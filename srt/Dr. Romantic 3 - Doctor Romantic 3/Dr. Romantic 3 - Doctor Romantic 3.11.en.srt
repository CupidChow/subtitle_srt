DR. ROMANTIC SEASON 3

3
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:45,545
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS, AND
EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE WORKS OF FICTION

4
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,507
(ominous music)

00:00:55,722 --> 00:01:00,018
CARDIOTHORACIC SURGEON
WOO SANGMIN

00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:17,285
(suspenseful music)

7
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,001
JINMAN: The field of medicine

8
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,796
is currently facing a crisis.

9
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,898
(glass shattering)

10
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:50,401
69% OF HOSPITALS IN PROVINCES
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH DOCTORS

11
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:53,029
FROM BEING IN CHARGE OF WARDS, ICU, AND ER
TO CONSULTING GUARDIANS...

12
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:56,116
ZERO APPLICANTS TO CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY,
NO DOCTORS EVEN IF YOUR HEART STOPS!

13
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,701
SENSE OF DUTY NOT ENOUGH REASON
TO APPLY FOR CORE MEDICAL DEPT

14
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,578
-(tense music)
-(glass shattering)

15
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:03,748
The number of applicants
to core medical departments is declining.

16
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:04,833
MEDICAL STAFF ON CALL 24/7 FOR EMERGENCIES

17
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:05,792
In the provinces...

18
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,085
NATIONAL UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS
SHORT ON CORE MEDICAL STUDENTS...

19
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:10,588
...there already aren't enough doctors
in pediatrics, emergency medicine...

20
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:11,756
NO USE IN 'INCREASING MANPOWER'
WITHOUT BETTER TREATMENT OF DOCTORS

21
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,510
...let alone doctors to perform surgeries.

22
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,971
(glass shattering)

23
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:20,223
(tense music continues)

24
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,896
WOMAN: My kid was burning up.

25
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:28,064
(voice breaking)
I was so worried

26
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,566
something bad might happen soon.

27
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:31,985
(sobs)

28
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,946
But we've been waiting for over six hours.

29
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:37,365
MAN: All the university hospitals in Seoul

30
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,450
told us to wait for several months.

31
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,077
I had to call around for days

32
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,913
until I found a surgeon
all the way in Incheon.

33
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,415
And we live in Daegu.

34
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:48,793
They closed the ER
because they had no doctors on call.

35
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:50,795
(sighs)

36
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,131
The splitting pain in my heart
was unbearable.

37
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,800
I thought I might actually die

38
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:57,677
right then and there.

39
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,513
PARAMEDIC: We just keep circling
for two to three hours

40
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,891
until we find a hospital
that will take the patient.

41
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:06,936
And some patients die in the process.

42
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:10,064
JINMAN: Each year, there are
plenty of applicants for medical schools.

43
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:13,234
So why do we lack doctors each year?

44
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:17,030
Some say it's because everyone goes into
plastic surgery or dermatology for money.

45
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,617
That's partly true and partly false.

46
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:24,329
JINMAN: I'm sure there are
many doctors who want to make money.

47
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,332
The number problem is a real issue here.

48
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,586
However, the more important reason is...
(inhales sharply)

49
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,422
...that the respect
for medical professionals...

50
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,133
has disappeared.

51
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,302
(tense music)

52
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,553
Our families discourage us.

53
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,555
JINMAN: Our seniors discourage us.

54
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,724
You quack!

55
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,935
-And you call yourself human?
-JINMAN: Despite that,

56
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:50,355
so many surgeons chose this path
to become true doctors.

57
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,273
How is someone like you even a doctor?

58
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,150
However, they face
verbal and physical abuse...

59
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,111
(inhales sharply)
...without any protection whatsoever.

60
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,197
This is overtreatment!

61
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,909
How dare this hospital
try to make money off of sick patients?

62
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,452
They're being bought over.

63
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:07,247
Get your hands off me.
I don't want to be treated by you!

64
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,207
KYUNGSOOK: What are you waiting for?
Let's go!

65
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,333
JINMAN: And they're being hurt.

66
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,127
As the police investigation
has already shown,

67
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:17,632
the car accident on that day
was caused by the driver's drowsiness.

68
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,509
Even in the moments
where the plaintiff claims

69
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,512
that our medical staff neglected her son,

70
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:25,974
they were fighting hard
to save the other two patients...

71
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,309
who were her aides.

72
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,021
JINMAN: We were swamped that day
with a patient who fell,

73
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,940
two traffic accident patients,

74
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:35,692
and even a drunk patient causing a scene.

75
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,361
Dr. Jung Insu in emergency medicine

76
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:41,406
was handling
all of those patients on his own.

77
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,616
I'm sure you have checked this as a fact

78
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,618
through the CCTV footage
that we've submitted.

79
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,328
It was not negligence.

80
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,623
It was a tragic accident

81
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,251
due to a lack of manpower.

82
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,880
JINMAN: Despite covering
the workload of a hundred doctors

83
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:01,134
due to this shortage of staff
by treating and operating on patients,

84
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:02,510
the current situation forces us

85
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:06,472
to prove that we did our best in court.

86
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,852
The world views us
as money-hungry villains of society

87
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,187
with much disdain.

88
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,399
As someone...

89
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,069
who has only lived
for my patients for decades,

90
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,530
it makes me feel bitter...

91
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,492
and like everything was all in vain.

92
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,161
There is no honor for doctors,

93
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,163
let alone respect.

94
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,666
If we can't even have
the least bit of dignity,

95
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,879
which doctors will be there
to maintain the emergency rooms

96
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:42,175
and keep the operating rooms going?

97
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:44,302
PLAINTIFF

98
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,429
I close my final statement

99
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,640
by posing that question.

100
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:59,359
(tense music)

101
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,620
Master Kim!
(laughs)

102
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,331
-Master Kim!
-SABU: What is it?

103
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:14,791
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

104
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,042
-GITAE: Master Kim!
-Yes?

105
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,877
I just got a call from Director Park.

106
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,755
The courts have ruled
in favor of Doldam Hospital!

107
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,840
The plaintiff lost. We won.

108
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:25,593
See? What did I tell you?
I knew this would happen!

109
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:26,594
(laughs)

110
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:30,223
Didn't you say we had a fire inspection
in the trauma center?

111
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,725
I was just on my way over there now.

112
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,728
You should go and finish preparing for it.

113
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,231
Right.

114
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,693
I know he's happy on the inside though.

115
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,323
Ms. Oh. It's me.

116
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,908
We won in court!

117
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,743
(laughs)

118
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,079
There's no need to be so happy.

119
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,956
I will appeal right away.

120
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,250
Are you still not done letting off steam?

121
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,963
I'm mourning the loss of my son
in my own way right now.

122
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:05,758
Wallowing in self-pity
and blaming everything on others

123
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,052
isn't mourning but being a nuisance.

124
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,597
(tense music)

125
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,143
Is it so hard to give me
a sincere apology?

126
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,270
Do you know...

127
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:21,774
how often I've had to deal
with people like you over the years?

128
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,735
The moment I apologize,

129
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:26,904
you people swarm us like a pack of dogs

130
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:30,575
to frame us
as the offenders and murderers.

131
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,161
It's not the first time this has happened.

132
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:36,789
I don't intend to let people
trample on us like that any longer.

133
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:41,127
Your power and pride are more important
than people's lives. Is that it?

134
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,880
I mean we will maintain
our self-esteem as doctors.

135
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,008
Let's say it's our last line of defense.

136
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,432
KYUNGSOOK: I'm curious about something.

137
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:55,558
Yes?

138
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,728
Why did you bring in Professor Cha Jinman?

139
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:02,732
He seems different from you
in both disposition and personality.

140
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,693
That's why I brought him in.
Because he's different from me.

141
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:08,863
In any organization,

142
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,949
being too one-sided isn't a good thing.

143
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,496
Many ideas and opinions
must be able to coexist

144
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,414
to become a healthy organization.

145
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:22,126
SABU: Also, Professor Cha is
one of our field's finest.

146
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,713
So there's no reason for me to refuse him.

147
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,090
Do you know about the incident

148
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:31,135
where a resident from Hankuk University
jumped to his death three years ago?

149
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,847
(tense music)

150
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,933
There were rumors
that he committed suicide

151
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,726
because Professor Cha was too oppressive.

152
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:44,690
We can't deny his whole career
just based on one rumor.

153
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,446
But what if all those rumors were true?

154
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,158
Would you still think the same way?

155
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,127
KYUNGSOOK: In the end,

156
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,047
all you people are the same.

157
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,634
Let me make you an offer.

158
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,930
Dismiss Professor Cha Jinman.

159
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:19,308
Then I'll drop the lawsuit.

160
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,356
I'll also review the budget needed
for the trauma center

161
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,650
in a favorable light.

162
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,945
What are you trying to say?

163
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:34,865
I'm saying we should make a deal.

164
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,617
(tense music continues)

165
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:41,414
I must see
Professor Cha leave this trauma center.

166
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,376
What do you say?

167
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,672
Will you take this deal?

168
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:15,072
I hope you defend yourself well
in the second trial too.

169
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,949
I will.

170
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,620
COURT

171
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,916
I wish you luck.

172
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:32,673
(tense music)

173
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,473
Looks like this will become a long fight.

174
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:43,601
Right?

175
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:49,190
Well, we'll have to find a way
to win this fight.

176
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,734
(inhales sharply)
Let's go.

177
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,152
Right.

178
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,927
HEAD OF THE TRAUMA CENTER, CHA JINMAN

179
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,687
(pensive music)

180
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:47,039
DOLDAM HOSPITAL TRAUMA CENTER

181
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,252
(upbeat music)

182
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:59,301
VOLUME 11
THE CERTAINTY OF UNCERTAINTY

183
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:05,349
Ms. Eom. We're out of foam dressings
in the hybrid OR.

184
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,185
Nurse Euntak is in charge of that room.

185
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:12,565
The company is short in supply
and can't send any for a while.

186
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,608
EUNTAK:
We'll switch to another company's product.

187
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,069
I'll restock them
once they arrive this afternoon.

188
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,489
And check the BST
for the patient in bed five,

189
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,949
and notify
the patient can be discharged, Ms. Eom.

190
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,242
HYEONJEONG: Yes, Doctor.

191
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:29,039
RESTRICTED AREA
OPERATING ROOM

192
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,252
Dr. Yoon cried a lot that day.

193
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:35,337
She was so worried about you.

194
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,423
I thought you should know that.

195
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,258
Right.

196
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,762
(soft music)

197
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:19,048
Stop staring. You're being too obvious.

198
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:25,471
You're not even good at being angry,
and yet you're pretending to be mad.

199
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,264
DONGHWA: You're pretending to be mad,

200
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:30,518
and yet you keep watching
how Nurse Euntak feels and acts.

201
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,394
You pretend not to be,

202
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,189
but you keep fretting about
and caring so much about him.

203
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,691
It's so obvious.

204
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:38,901
I'm not pretending.

205
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,820
I really am mad.

206
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,155
But what you're doing
doesn't seem to work.

207
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,826
You're the only one
who's suffering. Right?

208
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,537
-(playful music)
-(sucks teeth)

209
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,330
Since it has come to this,

210
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,457
you should take a stronger stance.

211
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:54,917
A stronger stance?

212
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,169
How?

213
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,345
First of all, you should hang out with me.

214
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,142
(soft chuckle)

215
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:13,978
(door closes)

216
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,442
Mom.

217
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,488
What are you doing here?

218
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:25,614
Were you home?

219
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,575
I thought you went to work.

220
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,078
Here. This was outside.

221
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,455
How did you open the door?

222
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,040
I asked your dad what the password was.

223
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:38,627
It seems like he'll be here for a while,
so I brought some stuff he might need.

224
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:39,753
Come in.

225
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,966
The steam closet and dryer
will be here in a couple of hours.

226
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,510
(Eunjae's mom sighs, sucks teeth)

227
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,346
EUNJAE'S MOM: But is there
enough space for everything?

228
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:52,266
EUNJAE: Why are you bringing
Dad's stuff here?

229
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:54,184
It should go to his new place
once he finds one.

230
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:57,438
Well, it looks like
we'll have to find a new place anyway.

231
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,982
This place is too small
for our family to live in.

232
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,526
What do you mean by that?
Are you moving here too?

233
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,944
Should we find a two-story house?

234
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,280
It was your dream to live in one
and not an apartment.

235
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:10,576
How could you decide something like this
without even discussing it with me first?

236
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:11,994
We're discussing it now.

237
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,621
I moved out, Mom.

238
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,415
I've already started
living apart from you and Dad.

239
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:19,209
That was when your dad and I
weren't living nearby.

240
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,172
(sighs)

241
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:25,758
EUNJAE'S MOM: By the way,

242
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:28,552
how is Dr. Seo's hand? How is it healing?

243
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,387
He started rehabilitation two days ago.

244
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:31,597
Seriously, that kid.

245
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,391
He's a natural at making people worry.

246
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,435
Why would you be worried about him?

247
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,730
He's a surgeon. If his hand is ruined,

248
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,231
what good would he be?

249
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,191
Mom.

250
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,777
Dating is short, but marriage is long.

251
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,279
EUNJAE'S MOM: No matter
how hard you pick and choose,

252
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,531
you end up regretting who you marry.
(sighs)

253
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:53,035
I haven't given my full approval
for Seo Woojin just yet.

254
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,203
I thought you should know that.

255
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,293
-Are you on call tonight?
-(door beeps)

256
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,378
(door opens)

257
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,171
(door slams shut)

258
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,548
(quirky music)

259
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,301
I've cut her too much slack.

260
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:10,928
(sighs)

261
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:13,681
(groans)

262
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,891
EUNJAE'S MOM:
Look at those boxes of instant noodles.

263
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,936
All that junk food
has made her act irrationally.

264
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:20,896
My goodness.

265
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,150
(suspenseful music)

266
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,612
(gasps)

267
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,990
(nervous exhale)

268
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,915
(dramatic music)

269
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,509
(panting)

270
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,345
M-Mom.

271
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,937
(Woojin grunts, sucks teeth)

272
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:04,732
(grunts)

273
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,110
My fourth and fifth digits
aren't responding very well.

274
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,614
It's only been two days
since you started rehabilitation.

275
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,160
There's no need to rush. Take it easy.

276
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:20,330
Just focus on your rehabilitation
for the next six months.

277
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,709
When will I be able to do surgery again?

278
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:26,003
It will be possible in a couple of weeks,

279
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,631
but I'll give my final approval
after I look at your hand then.

280
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,260
So don't even think about
holding a scalpel

281
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:35,054
until I give you the okay.

282
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:37,556
(soft chuckle)

283
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,600
MUNJEONG: All right, let's try again.
With more force.

284
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,101
Open.

285
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,520
-With greater force.
-(grunts)

286
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,985
I thought this only happened to others.

287
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,488
I never thought
I'd see my own child do this.

288
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,116
Mom.

289
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,413
Who knows you've been living like this?

290
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:02,831
Does Dad know too?

291
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,542
No, I haven't told him yet.

292
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,962
Dad came here
not long after we moved in together.

293
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:09,922
And people at work?

294
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:12,299
Nobody at work knows yet either.

295
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,383
Then it's fine.

296
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,845
Go and tell Seo Woojin
to take his stuff away.

297
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,180
Mom.

298
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,057
No matter how much the world changes,

299
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,351
I won't allow you
to live together before marriage.

300
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:24,019
Mom.

301
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,521
(shouts angrily) Do you think
I worked so hard to raise you

302
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,439
to see you live like this?

303
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,235
How can you bring such shame
to your parents?

304
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,529
What if rumors get out

305
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,365
that you're living with a guy
while working at a countryside hospital?

306
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:37,866
How will your dad...

307
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,661
be able to hold his head up high
at the hospital?

308
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,664
And how will I be able to show my face
in front of people?

309
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,708
(Eunjae's mom exhales shakily)

310
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,877
(tense music)

311
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,213
How can you be this selfish?

312
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,716
Don't you care about your family?

313
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,468
I wanted to be with him.

314
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,345
He's the man I love.

315
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,933
If he truly cared for you and loved you,

316
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:04,935
he wouldn't have made this decision.

317
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,188
He decides to skip
all procedures and formalities

318
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,023
and irresponsibly start living together?

319
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,861
It's so vulgar I can't even say it.

320
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:16,405
I decided to do it, not Woojin.

321
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:20,200
Don't try to protect him.
Pull yourself together!

322
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:22,703
Putting aside everything else,

323
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:25,414
I won't back down on this issue.

324
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:30,043
People don't consider marriage
the event of a lifetime for no reason.

325
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:30,961
Do you understand?

326
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,046
(exhales angrily)

327
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,965
I thought she was happy
to see me move out.

328
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:37,634
And yet, she still nitpicks and butts in
on everything.

329
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:41,054
I'm the one
who's living with him, not her.

330
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,056
(in annoyed voice)
Seriously!

331
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,933
(sighs)
I can't even...

332
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:57,821
There's a possibility that his hand
won't recover to the way it was before.

333
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,408
MUNJEONG: In particular,
there's a high probability

334
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,328
of permanent disability
in the fourth and fifth digits.

335
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,873
(somber music)

336
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,586
Does Woojin know about this too?

337
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,963
I haven't told him the specifics yet.

338
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:18,675
He just thinks of it
as the sequelae of surgery for now.

339
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:20,928
But he'll catch on soon.

340
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:24,640
MUNJEONG: The sensation
and the way his fingers move

341
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,016
won't feel the same as before.

342
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,810
He's quite sensitive about his hands,
after all.

343
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:34,233
How long do you think it'll take
for him to perform surgery again?

344
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:39,196
Even if he does...
(sighs)

345
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,574
...he won't be as nimble as before.

346
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,159
(sighs)

347
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:48,622
(glasses clatter)

348
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,458
SABU (sighs): Darn it.

349
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,714
(somber music continues)

350
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,132
(exhales softly)

351
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,482
-(door opens)
-(sighs)

352
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,026
(door closes)

353
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,071
What are you doing?

354
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:22,531
WOOJIN: You're here.

355
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:23,865
You got here early.

356
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,367
Here.

357
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,954
These are a change of clothes,
and this is a present.

358
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,836
EUNJAE: Ta-da.

359
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,004
What's all this?

360
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,714
It's for your rehabilitation.

361
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:42,009
I didn't want you to get bored,
so I bought them in every color.

362
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:44,052
EUNJAE: For Monday to Sunday,
every color of the rainbow.

363
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:47,014
Which color do you want first? Green? Red?

364
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,640
Or yellow?

365
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:50,183
That looks good on you.

366
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:54,396
(inhales sharply)
Something happened, didn't it?

367
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,814
No, nothing happened.

368
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,567
Tell me. What is it?

369
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,950
Don't read my mood
without my permission from now on.

370
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,785
I can tell just from your voice.

371
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,663
-EUNJAE: We'll only text from now on.
-(soft chuckle)

372
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,457
You think I won't catch on that way?

373
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:17,169
Sometimes, I have feelings
I want to keep to myself too.

374
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,049
WOOJIN: Don't worry, Eunjae.

375
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,260
-I'll be fine.
-(soft music)

376
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,304
(inhales deeply)
I'll work hard in physical therapy

377
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,848
and get back into the OR
in good condition.

378
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,434
It might be frustrating for a while,

379
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,685
but I'll overcome it.

380
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:35,687
I can overcome this much.

381
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,608
I'm the icon of resilience, aren't I?
(soft chuckle)

382
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,235
(plastic rustling)

383
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,199
(exhales deeply)

384
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:48,241
Should we get married?

385
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:53,914
Let's just register our marriage.
What do you say?

386
00:22:58,585 --> 00:22:59,920
-NURSE 1: Hello.
-NURSE 2: Hello.

387
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,800
-MYEONGSIM: Dr. Cha--
-YEONGMI: Just leave her be.

388
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,844
She's been like that for a while.

389
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:12,140
Why? Did something happen?

390
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:14,518
Who knows?

391
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,937
I asked her twice,

392
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,355
but she's not here right now.

393
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:23,485
It's as if her soul left her body.

394
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,737
That's how it feels at the moment.

395
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:27,239
I see.

396
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,659
(soft music)

397
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,536
WOOJIN: Why, all of a sudden?

398
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:36,331
Why are you bringing up marriage like this
out of the blue?

399
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:39,501
There's no reason. I just want to.

400
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:41,795
Did we get caught?

401
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:45,132
Well, it's not exactly like that.

402
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,383
Still,

403
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:49,553
you can't throw out
the word marriage just like that.

404
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,513
I didn't throw anything out.

405
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:52,722
That's how it felt to me.

406
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,143
You want to get rid of everything
that's bothering you at once.

407
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,813
You figured you could do that
by getting married

408
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:01,982
and threw out that word.

409
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:04,901
So you don't want to?

410
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:06,570
(sighs)

411
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:08,822
You don't...

412
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:10,991
want to marry me?

413
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:12,409
(sighs)

414
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:18,248
No.

415
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,459
Not like this.

416
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:28,925
(sighs)

417
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:42,772
(sighs)

418
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,400
What did you just say?

419
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,362
I'll give you a free pass
to use Jang Donghwa.

420
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:52,157
What's that?

421
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,826
It's exactly what it sounds like.
It's a special pass to use me.

422
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:59,289
I usually don't give this out
to people lightly.

423
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:02,542
But you did teach me to read ultrasounds,
so I thought I'd repay your kindness.

424
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:05,212
So what am I supposed to use
this pass for?

425
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,005
(sighs)

426
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,633
You're in a cold war
with Nurse Euntak right now.

427
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:10,592
And?

428
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:14,596
And your tactic isn't working.
You're the only one who's distressed.

429
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:16,223
So?

430
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,643
-So I'll help you.
-But how?

431
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,269
By getting on his nerves.

432
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:24,481
You'll only talk to me, only eat with me,

433
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:25,857
and only act friendly with me.

434
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,861
DONGHWA: He might be able to act cool
about it a few times, but if it continues,

435
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,488
he will become anxious.

436
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,574
That's when you turn the tables.

437
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,911
That's when you take control
and dominate your relationship.

438
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,120
(in English) Game over.

439
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,878
(in Korean) Do you actually think
that will work?

440
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,004
(scoffs)

441
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,756
I've played games for over 20 years.

442
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,300
Reading the flow
and carrying out a strategy

443
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,970
is what I do best.

444
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,304
(inhales deeply)

445
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,681
What do you say?

446
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:00,433
Do you want to see Nurse Euntak's eyes

447
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,435
flashing with jealousy?

448
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,230
And what if they don't?

449
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:09,276
Then you should break up with him.

450
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,946
It'll mean he doesn't really like you.

451
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:21,037
If I were to see another guy
hanging around the girl I like,

452
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,291
I don't think I'd be able to stand it.

453
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:32,632
Then don't hang around me.

454
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:37,512
-What?
-It's true I'm mad at Euntak,

455
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:40,599
but it's not right
to test someone's feelings like that.

456
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,935
If you really want to give out
a free pass to use Jang Donghwa,

457
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,354
you should give it to a patient instead.

458
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,733
Then you'd seem a lot cooler.

459
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,361
(comical music)

460
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:57,657
(door closes)

461
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:01,161
(siren wailing)

462
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,788
-(door opens)
-MR. HEO: We have a patient!

463
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,498
(hurried footsteps approaching)

464
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,293
AREUM: What happened to her?

465
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:10,545
MR. HEO:
She slipped and fell down the stairs.

466
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:13,089
According to her neighbor,
she's been showing signs of dementia.

467
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:16,009
She had a forehead laceration,
but the bleeding was light.

468
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:18,261
And she has a scratch on her arm
that's about 8 cm long.

469
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,055
Her BP is 150/100, heart rate is 90.

470
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:21,514
She's having trouble breathing.

471
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:22,432
And her guardian?

472
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:23,683
We haven't reached anyone yet.

473
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,226
PATIENT (gasping): Goodness.

474
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,353
Doctor.

475
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:28,730
Please save me.

476
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,733
These people are trying to kidnap me.

477
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:35,362
Ma'am, this is the hospital.
You came here because you got hurt.

478
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,280
Save me, Doctor.

479
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:39,366
PATIENT: Please untie me.
(breathes heavily)

480
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:41,868
I don't want to go to jail.
(breathes heavily)

481
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,161
Take her to bed three.

482
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:44,079
Okay.

483
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:44,996
Ma'am, you're okay.

484
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:49,876
Here we go.

485
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,506
-Lift on one, two, three.
-One, two, three.

486
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:56,758
ALL: One, two, three.

487
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:03,223
Ma'am, your breathing doesn't sound good.
I'll take a listen.

488
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:04,307
PATIENT: No!

489
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,017
Go away, you brat!

490
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:07,936
I don't have money!

491
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,729
PATIENT: What are you trying to take now?

492
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:12,565
What are you trying to steal, you brat?
Go away.

493
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:14,275
-Go away!
-Ma'am, calm down.

494
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,485
This is the hospital.

495
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:17,028
-(breathing heavily)
-You were hurt.

496
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:22,242
Brother?

497
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:24,953
(somber music)

498
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,497
(patient breathes shakily)

499
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,665
It's me.

500
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:30,709
It's Junggeum.

501
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:34,003
Why did you come so late?

502
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:38,800
Father and Mother waited for so long.

503
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:42,095
Ma'am.

504
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:43,263
JUNGGEUM: Brother.

505
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,974
-(siren wailing)
-Brother.

506
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,434
-(siren blares)
-(Junggeum sobbing)

507
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,227
PARAMEDIC: We have a patient!

508
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:53,565
Nurse Euntak, get her on oxygen
and page Dr. Lee.

509
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:55,650
-Okay.
-(tense music)

510
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,612
He's a dialysis patient.
We heard he had trouble breathing.

511
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,030
His heart stopped on the way here.

512
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,282
To the hybrid OR, please.

513
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:03,366
Okay.

514
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:12,542
-NURSE: Lift on one, two, three.
-ALL: Three.

515
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,420
NURSE: Take out the gurney.

516
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:23,094
Let me check the rhythm.

517
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:28,224
There's no pulse. PEA. Let's switch.

518
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:32,562
(tense music continues)

519
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:36,983
DONGHWA:
The left arm is used for dialysis.

520
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:38,234
Start a line in his right arm.

521
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:39,652
HYEONJEONG: Yes, Doctor.

522
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:40,820
Let's do an ABG test.

523
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:43,448
(suspenseful music)

524
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:49,788
(sighs)

525
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,623
-(tapping gently)
-Is the IV not ready yet?

526
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,292
I can't find a vein.

527
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:59,047
Ms. Eom, do the ABG test.

528
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,048
HYEONJEONG: Okay.

529
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:03,176
-Let's do an IO.
-NURSE: Yes, Doctor.

530
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:17,774
(whirs)

531
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:22,320
(whirs)

532
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,076
(whirring)

533
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:31,663
(whirring continues)

534
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,625
(suspenseful music continues)

535
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:00,066
(Donghwa grunts)

536
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:04,404
Push epi through this line
once every three minutes.

537
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:05,530
Yes, Doctor.

538
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,574
Here are the ABG test results.

539
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,660
It's hyperkalemia. His levels are 8.6.

540
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:11,703
Let's check the rhythm.

541
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:16,249
(Areum panting)

542
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:17,375
Bring calcium gluconate.

543
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,419
There's no pulse. PEA.

544
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,882
(suspenseful music continues)

545
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,350
(Donghwa pants)

546
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:37,770
How long has it been?

547
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,148
It's been 12 minutes.

548
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:42,442
Let's check the rhythm.

549
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:47,822
-(rhythmic beeping)
-(Donghwa panting)

550
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:52,327
Okay. He's back.
(panting)

551
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,703
What was the BST?

552
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:54,746
It was 190.

553
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:55,872
Give him half a pack of D50W

554
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,957
mixed with 10 units of regular insulin
for 5 minutes.

555
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,083
After that, give him 10D.

556
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,127
Check his blood sugar
every 30 minutes for 2 hours.

557
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,170
Yes, Doctor.

558
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,672
Get a c-line
and hemodialysis catheter ready.

559
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:07,133
Arrange for a CRRT
once his vitals are stable.

560
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,343
Yes, Doctor.

561
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,595
(Areum exhales deeply)

562
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,931
(pants)

563
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,766
(exhales deeply)

564
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:19,646
Do I seem...
(panting)

565
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:20,772
...pretty cool now?

566
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,441
-(Donghwa panting)
-(snickers)

567
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:26,736
Jang Donghwa free pass.

568
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,280
(Donghwa chuckles)

569
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,199
(soft music)

570
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:32,116
A bit.

571
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:35,161
Come on. I was really cool.

572
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:36,412
-AREUM: What?
-DONGHWA: I was very cool.

573
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:37,830
-Oh, right.
-(Areum and Donghwa laughing)

574
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,292
DONGHWA:
You used your Jang Donghwa free pass.

575
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:43,878
You are pretty cool.

576
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,548
(Areum laughs)

577
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,008
JUNGGEUM: Hey.

578
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,594
-Yes, please lie down.
-(whimpers)

579
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:56,891
-Good work today.
-Good work.

580
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,146
YEONGMI: Dr. Jung.

581
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:03,898
You're back.

582
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,441
You did great today.

583
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:08,361
We heard about the win in court.
I'm so relieved to hear it.

584
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:09,570
It's nothing big.

585
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,698
She's going to appeal right away.

586
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:16,327
Is she really going to do that?

587
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:18,204
YEONGMI: She's so harsh!

588
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:20,623
You even caught her compartment syndrome.

589
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:23,126
YEONGMI: If you hadn't caught it on time
and she had gone elsewhere,

590
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:25,211
there's no saying
what might've happened to her.

591
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:29,132
What did Administrator Cha
and Director Park say?

592
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,509
The head of the trauma center
didn't say much.

593
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:33,594
Director Park went to Master Kim.

594
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:37,598
He's very worried
we might not get the provincial budget.

595
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:39,600
(sighs)

596
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:42,520
MINGUK: Assemblywoman Ko says
she will appeal the court ruling.

597
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:46,441
If things come to this,
we might not get the provincial budget.

598
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,986
If we don't get the grant this time,

599
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,320
our trauma center

600
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:54,574
will have a hard time
staying open the following year.

601
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:58,745
Please have a seat first.
Do you want some coffee?

602
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:01,122
Master Kim.
(sighs)

603
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:05,126
MINGUK: If Assemblywoman Ko refuses
to back down like this,

604
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:06,836
shouldn't we consider

605
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,547
her offer?

606
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,842
(dramatic music)

607
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:20,767
What's this?

608
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:27,482
HEAD OF THE TRAUMA CENTER, CHA JINMAN

609
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,119
(tense music)

610
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,088
WOO SANGMIN

611
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,464
JINMAN: It was your fault.

612
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:53,758
So you take responsibility.

613
00:34:56,177 --> 00:35:00,473
WOO SANGMIN

614
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:01,557
SANGMIN: Professor.

615
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:03,684
I'm sorry.

616
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:06,104
CARDIOTHORACIC SURGEON
WOO SANGMIN

617
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:08,189
MAN: Hey. How is someone like you
even a doctor?

618
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:09,690
You quack!

619
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:14,570
SANGMIN: Professor.

620
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:16,864
Please help me.

621
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:19,951
SANGMIN'S MOM (wailing): Sangmin!

622
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,620
Sangmin!

623
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:25,665
(Sangmin's mom wailing)

624
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:27,875
SANGMIN: I...

625
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,128
SANGMIN'S MOM: Sangmin!

626
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,712
...will take responsibility.

627
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:37,093
(wailing continues)

628
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,395
(tense music continues)

629
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:01,868
That's not an offer, Director Park.
That's a threat.

630
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:05,204
If we take up her sweet offer

631
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,874
by turning a blind eye
and acting like we have no choice,

632
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:10,877
you think we'll get what we want,
don't you?

633
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,211
SABU: No way.

634
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,339
She'll see us as pushovers

635
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,842
and start demanding much more than that.

636
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:20,636
(inhales deeply)
But the current situation--

637
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,263
I know it's hard.

638
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,682
But, Director Park,

639
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,768
when did we ever have it easy?

640
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:29,562
We've always...

641
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:33,149
faced hardships and crises.

642
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:35,484
It has always been hard.

643
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:39,447
Still, we never once tried

644
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,992
to dodge those hardships like cowards.

645
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:46,245
We always tried to find a way
to break through it,

646
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,788
and that's how we got here.

647
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:49,832
If we had compromised

648
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,376
in a way that wasn't right,

649
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,172
Doldam Hospital as it is now...

650
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,466
wouldn't be here.

651
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:03,763
Do you mean you will take on any risk?

652
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:05,473
I mean that no threats

653
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:09,393
should be able to sway us.

654
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:11,062
(sighs)

655
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,606
(inhales deeply)

656
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:15,149
A leader is someone

657
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:19,153
who must fight the big waves upfront.

658
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:23,491
That's how other people
don't feel anxious or get swayed.

659
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,326
I hope that...

660
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:28,788
you become that kind of leader.

661
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,297
CONSULTATION ROOM 2

662
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,424
(mysterious music)

663
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:51,811
Ms. Oh.

664
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:52,979
Yes, Professor.

665
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:55,731
I want to check the CCTV
in the hall outside my office.

666
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:57,733
Who can I ask?

667
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,318
What is this about?

668
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:02,363
I think someone came into my room
without permission.

669
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,910
You can always ask me for such things.

670
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:09,495
Let's take a look.

671
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:17,211
DOLDAM HOSPITAL TRAUMA CENTER

672
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,428
HEAD OF TRAUMA CENTER'S OFFICE

673
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,265
HEAD OF TRAUMA CENTER'S OFFICE

674
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:31,684
Nothing looks out of the ordinary so far.

675
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,394
I'll fast-forward it a little.

676
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:35,813
(keyboard key clacking rapidly)

677
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:36,856
Wait, there.

678
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,317
(key clacks)

679
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,244
GITAE: He's going into your room.

680
00:38:58,252 --> 00:38:59,086
(key clacks)

681
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:05,092
GITAE: I don't think
he's carrying anything out.

682
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:08,637
If you tell me what exactly you lost--

683
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:09,638
Ms. Oh.

684
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,351
Do you recognize who that is?

685
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,898
(sighs)
I'm not sure.

686
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:22,610
Will we have to call the police for this?

687
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:25,154
No, that won't be necessary.

688
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,282
Things are uneasy around here
with the court case and all.

689
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,450
No need for the police.

690
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:33,245
But I'd like to see
the doctors' personnel records.

691
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,455
Personnel records?

692
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:35,873
I don't need everyone's files.

693
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:38,834
Just those who went to Hankuk University.

694
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,045
JINMAN: The faster I get them, the better.

695
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:42,254
Yes, Professor Cha.

696
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:50,763
What do you think he means

697
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:53,599
when he says he only wants the files
of those who went to Hankuk University?

698
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,894
It must mean he has a hunch.

699
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,028
SEONUNG: What can I help with?

700
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:07,530
Dr. Ung.

701
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:10,658
She's a patient with dementia.

702
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:13,327
Her X-rays show
cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema.

703
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:16,372
Current BP is 140/90 and saturation is 92.

704
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:19,458
She must've had a hard time breathing.

705
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:22,628
She seemed to be in bad condition,
so I had her moved to the hybrid OR.

706
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:24,880
AREUM: Her extremities are pale,

707
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:27,049
and dorsalis pedis pulse
is weak on both sides.

708
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,261
I suspect it might be Buerger's disease.

709
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:32,263
Let's restrict fluids for now

710
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:34,849
and remove the water from her lungs
with furosemide first.

711
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,976
Nurse Euntak,
let's switch the oxygen to high flow.

712
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,769
Make it 0.4 at 40 liters.

713
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:39,895
Yes, Doctor.

714
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:42,773
Brother. Where are you going now?

715
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,733
JUNGGEUM: Just stay here. Don't go.

716
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:46,569
I'll be right back
for your treatment, ma'am.

717
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:47,820
Don't go.

718
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:49,113
Ma'am.

719
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,951
We'll make it easier for you to breathe.

720
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:57,705
The nurse here will give you a shot.
Please wait a little.

721
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,084
-Honey.
-Pardon?

722
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:04,253
(soft music)

723
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:05,963
What brings you here?

724
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,507
Why have you gotten so young?

725
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,469
JUNGGEUM: Are you perhaps

726
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,221
-seeing another woman?
-No. What?

727
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:15,306
JUNGGEUM: Tell me.

728
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:17,808
Go ahead and tell me.

729
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,351
I'm sorry.

730
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,813
JUNGGEUM: It's fine. Just tell me.

731
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,190
It's fine. Tell me.

732
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:25,774
Come on.

733
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:28,903
-I'm sorry.
-JUNGGEUM: But...

734
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,030
SEONUNG: Let's get the high flow ready.

735
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:32,114
EUNTAK: Yes, Doctor.

736
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,283
-Ms. Eom.
-Yes?

737
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:36,827
Have we still not heard
from the elderly lady's guardian?

738
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:40,539
No. She has two sons and a daughter,
but no one is picking up.

739
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:44,502
Paramedic Heo said he asked
the lady's next-door neighbor.

740
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:46,253
It's been years since her kids visited.

741
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,130
(groans)
What do we do?

742
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,675
This is my husband.

743
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,179
It's nice to meet you.
(soft chuckle)

744
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:57,097
-EUNTAK: Hello.
-JUNGGEUM: Isn't he handsome?

745
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:58,098
SEONUNG: Of course.

746
00:41:58,599 --> 00:41:59,683
He's more handsome than you.

747
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:03,062

Here is the information you asked for.

Everything you asked for is inside.

762
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:25,936
You're sure you were discreet?

763
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:28,188
Of course, Director.

764
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:30,065
Don't worry.

No, I'm fine.

771
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:14,818
You can have it.

772
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:17,821
Should I unwrap it for you?

773
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:19,865
Oh, okay then.

Okay.

Whose call is it?

794
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:37,776
Is it Seo Woojin?

795
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:40,487
No, it's not.

796
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,782
Why? Did you have a fight?

797
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:46,410
It's not like that.

798
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:48,662

799
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:50,372

EUNJAE: Insu.

801
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:56,795
Do you regret getting married?

802
00:45:56,879 --> 00:46:00,549
No, I don't regret the marriage itself

803
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:03,260
because I did gain a lot of joy
after getting married.

804
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:05,971
INSU: To be honest,

805
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:08,724
there were more moments
that were like blessings.

806
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:10,726
Just like our Byeol.

807
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:14,021
Then why did you end up separated?

808
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:15,481
I used to...

809
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:18,400
want to live an average life.

810
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:20,527
Nothing too much or too little.

811
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:23,155
I wanted just enough to be satisfied.

812
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:24,364
But...

813
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:26,617
after I came to Doldam Hospital,

814
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:28,952
I kept dreaming of things.

815
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:31,497
Once I started dreaming,

816
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:34,082
I kept drifting away from reality.

817
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:37,753
That's how things ended up like this.

818
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,672
Did you ever ask her to come to live here?

819
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:42,382
I don't even have to ask.

820
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:44,468
My wife was born and raised in Seoul.

821
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:47,179
She's the kind of woman
who is terrified of leaving Seoul.

822
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:50,432
She would never move
to the boondocks like this place.

823
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:52,768
Did you ask her?

824
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:55,020
Why should I
when it's obvious what she will say?

825
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:57,147
You should still ask her at least once.

826
00:46:57,981 --> 00:46:59,399
Tell her you want to be with her.

827
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:01,360
Be honest.

828
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:05,072
-(soft music)
-(phone vibrating)

829
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:07,783
MOM

830
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:11,578
(sighs)

831
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:18,126
(sighs)

832
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:21,505
-(knocking on door)
-JINMAN: Yes, come in.

833
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:26,343
Mm.

834
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:31,223
I was organizing
some of my stuff that arrived late.

835
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:35,060
I needed a helping hand
as there are just so many files.

836
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:37,312
Can I ask you to help out?

837
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:40,107
Yes, of course. What should I do first?

838
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:42,568
First, go through the ones on the table.

839
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:44,486
Research materials should be separated

840
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:45,863
into published and unpublished ones.

841
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:47,281
And as for the surgery cases,

842
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,867
separate the open heart cases
from the VATS cases.

843
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,535
-Yes, Professor.
-JINMAN: Okay.

844
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,625
Which class were you in?

845
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:01,587
I entered school in 2009.

846
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,590
Then you must know

847
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:08,010
-Dr. Woo Sangmin.
-(tense music)

848
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:10,095
JINMAN (sucks teeth): That's right.

849
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:13,181
I remember there was another applicant
for CT surgery besides Sangmin.

850
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:16,143
That must've been you, Dr. Lee.

851
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:18,228
Yes, Professor.

852
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:19,438
(chuckles)

853
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:24,276
You could've done a military fellowship,
but you just served as a regular soldier.

854
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:25,903
Was there a particular reason?

855
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:27,571
I just thought...

856
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:30,741
it would be better
to get my military service over with.

857
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:32,659
I see.

858
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,121
Right.

859
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:39,124
Can you hand me that green file there?

860
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:54,431
No, not that.

861
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,224
The one on your left.

862
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:57,601
Right, of course.

863
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:12,741
I wasn't sure,

864
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:15,744
but it was you.

865
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:19,539
I remember you now.

866
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,334
(tense music continues)

867
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:26,672
That walk.

868
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:30,133
Where have I seen it before?

869
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:33,887
WOOJIN: Ms. Oh, what are you doing?

870
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:36,556
Goodness, Dr. Seo.
(soft chuckle)

871
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,559
What brings you to the trauma center?
We didn't call you.

872
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:42,604
Just because.
I had some time, so I decided to drop by.

873
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:48,318
Dr. Cha should be in the medical office.
You should go upstairs.

874
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:51,279
What were you looking at?

875
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:54,491
The man wearing the paper bag.

876
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,163
MYEONGSIM: There was someone

877
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:02,582
who snuck into
the head of the trauma center's office.

878
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:04,376
He was wearing that on his head.

879
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:10,424
MYEONGSIM: But there's something
strangely familiar about the way he walks.

880
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:13,885
I'm sure I've seen it before.

881
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:20,267
It was your doing.

882
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:23,103
-Pardon?
-Who made you do it?

883
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:26,815
Did Woo Sangmin's mother make you do it?

884
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:28,316
What do you mean?

885
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,609
JINMAN: Even so,

886
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:32,279
playing a joke with a dead friend's name

887
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,531
seems to be crossing the line.

888
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:36,783
-Professor.
-JINMAN: If not,

889
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:41,747
were you still holding a grudge
because of what happened three years ago?

890
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:45,542
SEONUNG: Pardon?

891
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:48,462
What do you mean, I should leave?

892
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:49,588
PROFESSOR CHA JINMAN

893
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:51,798
We can no longer
let you attend our school.

894
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:53,967
But I thought...

895
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:57,304
there were still spots available
in CT surgery.

896
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:58,472
Unfortunately,

897
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:02,809
I can't allow someone with grounds
for disqualification to enter the OR.

898
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:07,856
The moment I accept you into my team,
we will all have to take on the risk.

899
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:11,109
I don't have
any reason or necessity to do that.

900
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:13,195
Throughout my residency,

901
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:15,947
I finished the practical training
with great scores.

902
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:18,533
I worked really hard.

903
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:20,035
Anyone can work hard.

904
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:23,789
Anyone works to death

905
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:26,291
to become a doctor.

906
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:28,960
-Professor...
-JINMAN: It's already been decided.

907
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:31,046
I won't change my mind.

908
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:33,048
So you should go...

909
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:36,551
look for a position elsewhere.

910
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:38,762
Not here.

911
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,808
(dramatic music)

912
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:47,062
Even still,
how dare you threaten me like this?

913
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:48,021
(thuds)

914
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:50,649
Do you think
this is acceptable behavior from a doctor?

915
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:57,364
I don't know what that is,
but I didn't do it.

916
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,783
I've never been to your office.

917
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:01,451
(shouts)
Are you going to keep feigning innocence?

918
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:02,369
Do you want...

919
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:04,579
to take this to its end?

920
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:07,207
(dramatic music continues)

921
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:17,884
Director Park. It's me, Cha Jinman.

922
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:21,054
JINMAN:
Someone snuck into my office today.

923
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:23,348
I just caught the culprit.

924
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:24,516
It turns out...

925
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:26,893
he had grounds for disqualification.

926
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:29,646
Yes.

927
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,398
It's Dr. Lee Seonung.

928
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:38,822
What do you mean?

929
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:41,783
Lee Seonung snuck into
the head of the trauma center's room?

930
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:45,871
Yes, I checked the CCTV
with Administrator Cha.

931
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:48,498
He even wore a bag on his head.

932
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:50,667
He was determined to sneak in.

933
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:51,960
(clattering)

934
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:54,004
GITAE: I don't know what he stole,

935
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:58,049
but this is certainly a serious situation.

936
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:01,303
(sighs)

937
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:04,639
So where's Seonung now?

938
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:07,559
What do you think?
Administrator Cha is so angry right now.

939
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:09,686
He took Lee Seonung
to see the director right away.

940
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,607
(Hojun clears throat)

941
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:16,985
HOJUN: Let's talk outside.
It's a long story.

942
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:18,111
INSU: Okay.

943
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:22,657
(door closes)

944
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:30,290
(tense music)

945
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:48,183
What's up with those two?

946
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:53,396
I know, right?
I'm not sure what's going on.

947
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:58,902
DOLDAM HOSPITAL TRAUMA CENTER

948
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:16,086
-What's up with Dr. Ung?
-(phone vibrates)

949
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:20,590
What does this mean?

950
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,718
HYEONJEONG: It says Dr. Ung snuck into

951
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:27,138
the head of the trauma center's office
with a bag over his head.

952
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:29,474
Looks like
he's been caught on CCTV like that.

953
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:32,769
What? Dr. Ung wore a paper bag
over his head? Why?

954
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:35,313
(door opens)

955
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:43,697
What's going on?

956
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:46,199
What's the situation?

957
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,910
JINMAN: I was on my way
to meet Director Park now.

958
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:51,121
You should come up too
if you want to know.

959
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:53,123
JINMAN: Wait.

960
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:55,750
Were you the one...

961
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:57,544
who hired Lee Seonung?

962
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:04,843
You should talk to me first
before you blow this out of proportion.

963
00:55:04,926 --> 00:55:06,094
No.

964
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:10,140
My opinion is certain and clear.

965
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:11,933
Right now,

966
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:15,145
what we need is a decision,
not a discussion.

967
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:17,022
HOPE, LOVE, SERVICE

968
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:23,111
TREATMENT FROM THE HEART

969
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:27,615
It feels as though he is determined
to see things through to the end.

970
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:29,200
Don't you think so?

971
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:36,791
But why on earth did he do that?

972
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:39,753
Why would Dr. Lee wear a bag over his head

973
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:41,504
to go into Cha Jinman's office?

974
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:43,631
Did he steal something?

975
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:45,842
No, it didn't seem that way.

976
00:55:45,925 --> 00:55:48,928
If not, did he go in and write something?

977
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:51,306
"Professor Cha, you're dumb."

978
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:53,308
"Neener."

979
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:54,351
Dr. Jung.

980
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:57,145
Sorry.

981
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:00,523
I'm not sure about the details,

982
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:03,443
but maybe it has something to do
with the incident from three years ago?

983
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:05,987
HOJUN: Well, you know.

984
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:08,948
A CT surgery resident at Hankuk University
jumped to his death then.

985
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:12,410
INSU: What about it?

986
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:15,747
What does that incident
have to do with this incident?

987
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:19,709
I don't know if I should say this, but--

988
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:21,628
Then just don't say it.

989
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:25,006
Well, you know,
there were rumors back then,

990
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:28,301
that Professor Cha was responsible
for that resident's death.

991
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:30,053
I'm sure you all knew that.

992
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:31,554
That's because it's only natural

993
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:34,349
for people to discuss
who was responsible when a resident dies.

994
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:36,810
It was about a case
where a patient had died.

995
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:40,063
I heard Professor Cha was no joke
after it resulted in them going to court.

996
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:42,399
He told the resident
to take responsibility

997
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:43,566
as it was his fault.

998
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,902
He blamed the guy for everything,
or something like that.

999
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:50,323
Anyway, he ended his own life
because of that pressure.

1000
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:54,077
No way. Seriously?

1001
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,870
He really did.

1002
00:56:55,954 --> 00:57:00,125
But what does that
have to do with Dr. Ung?

1003
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:02,752
Well,

1004
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:05,296
the resident who died back then

1005
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:07,382
and Dr. Ung...

1006
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:09,008
The two were colleagues in school.

1007
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:11,136
(tense music)

1008
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:18,935
Isn't it very suspicious?

1009
00:57:19,727 --> 00:57:21,980
Is it just me? Don't you feel the same?

1010
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:23,314
(inhales deeply)

1011
00:57:35,076 --> 00:57:35,910
Goodness.

1012
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:47,255
I'll go.

1013
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:50,133
(sighs)

1014
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:51,634
She must've heard everything.

1015
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:53,845
MUNJEONG: What do we do?

1016
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:56,097
WOOJIN: Cha Eunjae.

1017
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:58,141
Cha Eunjae!

1018
00:57:58,224 --> 00:57:59,517
Cha Eunjae isn't here right now.

1019
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:01,728
-I have to say something.
-Cha Eunjae doesn't.

1020
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:03,396
-You can't just leave like this.
-(sighs)

1021
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,772
Then what should I do?

1022
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:07,859
Should I have stayed and listened,
as if nothing was wrong?

1023
00:58:07,942 --> 00:58:10,987
About my dad who blamed his student
and drove him to his death?

1024
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:13,907
(tense music)

1025
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:15,366
I love my dad.

1026
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:18,536
And I respect him
more than anyone else in the world.

1027
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:23,791
I am proud of my dad
like he's a decorated hero.

1028
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:26,544
No matter what anyone says,
he's my dad. Do you get that?

1029
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:28,963
(inhales shakily)

1030
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:35,178
(sighs)

1031
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:38,973
(sighs)

1032
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:00,787
(Sabu grunts)

1033
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:06,251
Professor Cha.

1034
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:08,294
Can you please explain?

1035
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:11,214
What is this situation right now?

1036
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:15,885
I ask that you dismiss Dr. Lee Seonung
from Doldam Hospital as of today.

1037
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:19,597
(tense music)

1038
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:28,690
What's your reason?

1039
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:31,234
I was threatened.

1040
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:37,907
Threatened?

1041
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:38,866
Threatened about what?

1042
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:51,129
JINMAN: It's a fountain pen that I gave
to a resident named Woo Sangmin.

1043
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:55,091
He was going through a lawsuit.

1044
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:58,177
He couldn't bear the pressure

1045
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:00,388
and ended his own life.

1046
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:04,392
The responsibility for his suicide...

1047
01:00:05,059 --> 01:00:08,855
fell onto me, his professor in charge.

1048
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:11,441
And the dead resident's mother...

1049
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:14,319
still resents me, saying it's my fault.

1050
01:00:19,824 --> 01:00:21,701
It's not like I killed a patient.

1051
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:24,787
JINMAN:
It happened because he made a mistake

1052
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:25,872
while starting a c-line.

1053
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:28,833
I taught him over and over,

1054
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:31,878
but that fool couldn't do
that simple work.

1055
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:36,090
There's no way that I'm fine...

1056
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:38,676
with the death of my student.

1057
01:00:40,928 --> 01:00:42,472
And there's no way it doesn't hurt me.

1058
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:45,600
But then,

1059
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:48,811
that punk put that fountain pen
right under my nose.

1060
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:52,065
If this isn't a threat, then what is it?

1061
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:54,192
Contempt? Scorn?

1062
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:55,610
Deceit? Ridicule?

1063
01:00:56,277 --> 01:00:57,612
Whatever it is,

1064
01:00:57,695 --> 01:00:59,322
I have no intention of forgiving him.

1065
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:02,825
I'm still the professor who taught him.

1066
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:05,495
But he wore a bag over his head

1067
01:01:05,578 --> 01:01:07,455
to sneak into my office
and leave that thing.

1068
01:01:07,538 --> 01:01:11,584
I will not let him make a fool out of me!

1069
01:01:16,714 --> 01:01:17,882
Dr. Lee Seonung.

1070
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:20,385
Did you really do it?

1071
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:26,307
I'm asking if you did this.

1072
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:28,851
No.

1073
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:31,187
I did not do this.

1074
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:39,320
(inhales shakily)
I...

1075
01:01:43,324 --> 01:01:45,201
never went into that office.

1076
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:53,835
DOLDAM HOSPITAL TRAUMA CENTER

1077
01:01:54,335 --> 01:01:55,586
WOOJIN: Ms. Oh.

1078
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:56,754
Let me borrow this.

1079
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:03,428
(whistling)

1080
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:05,972
(sucks teeth, inhales deeply)

1081
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:07,890
(laughs)
Sandwich.

1082
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:10,685
(humming excitedly)

1083
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:12,770
Ah...

1084
01:02:12,937 --> 01:02:15,106
I talked so much that I'm already hungry.

1085
01:02:18,192 --> 01:02:19,777
-(door slams open)
-That scared me.

1086
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:22,238
Are you trying
to break the door down or what?

1087
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:25,950
DOLDAM HOSPITAL TRAUMA CENTER

1088
01:02:26,033 --> 01:02:27,118
Do you perhaps know...

1089
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:28,995
who this is?

1090
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:30,496
(Hojun sighs)

1091
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:34,542
No, I don't.

1092
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:36,878
Who is this?

1093
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:41,090
(upbeat music)

1094
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:42,842
(keyboard key clacking)

1095
01:02:56,147 --> 01:02:58,858
(sighs)
What was the reason?

1096
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:02,653
If Dr. Lee Seonung really did bring

1097
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:04,614
this fountain pen as you say he did,

1098
01:03:05,406 --> 01:03:07,450
he would have to have a clear reason.

1099
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:09,619
What reason would he have

1100
01:03:09,702 --> 01:03:11,788
to threaten you now, after all that time?

1101
01:03:12,371 --> 01:03:15,750
That must be because I know
the grounds for his disqualification.

1102
01:03:18,252 --> 01:03:20,505
Could you tell us what that is?

1103
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,092
Dr. Lee has...

1104
01:03:26,427 --> 01:03:27,845
a red-green color vision deficiency.

1105
01:03:28,429 --> 01:03:29,889
(tense music)

1106
01:03:36,103 --> 01:03:37,438
(soft grunt)

1107
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:45,112
But why is that a problem?

1108
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,244
It doesn't say anywhere
that color vision deficiency

1109
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:53,037
is grounds for disqualification.

1110
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:56,165
Are you seriously asking that
when you know what it means to be unable

1111
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:58,125
to distinguish reds and greens in an OR?

1112
01:03:58,209 --> 01:04:02,547
Dr. Lee has already pulled off
a successful femoral artery repair.

1113
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:05,424
If he can do
that level of arterial surgery,

1114
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:09,178
I don't see how it will be a problem
in other surgeries too. Am I wrong?

1115
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:11,138
This is an ethical issue as well.

1116
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:13,599
He hid the fact
that he has color vision deficiency.

1117
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:16,602
No, he didn't hide it.

1118
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:19,689
Isn't that right, Master Kim?

1119
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:23,442
Yes, that's right.

1120
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:25,570
He didn't hide it.

1121
01:04:27,196 --> 01:04:29,448
SABU:
It says here you have dyschromatopsia.

1122
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:31,200
Yes, I have red-green
color vision deficiency.

1123
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:36,455
Is that perhaps a problem?

1124
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:38,624
No, not really.

1125
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:42,086
I believe they make
good corrective lenses these days too.

1126
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:44,422
Of course.

1127
01:04:47,008 --> 01:04:50,177
And he didn't hide this fact
from Dr. Bae Munjeong either.

1128
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:55,016
Yes, he told me about that
before we went into surgery that day.

1129
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:56,392
And what did you tell him?

1130
01:04:56,475 --> 01:04:58,227
He may not be able to tell apart colors,

1131
01:04:58,686 --> 01:05:00,438
but he can tell apart the situation.

1132
01:05:00,813 --> 01:05:02,481
I told him it wouldn't be that big a deal.

1133
01:05:03,357 --> 01:05:05,276
MINGUK: Dr. Lee was honest with us.

1134
01:05:05,776 --> 01:05:08,905
And we didn't think it was a big issue.

1135
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:13,743
But why did you think
that was a reason for him to threaten you?

1136
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:16,078
That's because this fountain pen--

1137
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:18,789
And just look at what was caught on CCTV.

1138
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:21,751
Dr. Lee is denying it was him so strongly,

1139
01:05:21,834 --> 01:05:24,879
and we're not even sure
who the man in the bag was.

1140
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:26,964
So why do you insist so strongly

1141
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:29,634
that it was Dr. Lee?

1142
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:31,677
I am very curious about...

1143
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:33,930
why you're doing this.

1144
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:37,767
Is it perhaps...

1145
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:41,687
because you feel uncomfortable
about Dr. Lee Seonung

1146
01:05:41,854 --> 01:05:43,230
since he knows about Woo Sangmin?

1147
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:45,066
What does that mean?

1148
01:05:45,566 --> 01:05:48,319
I'm asking you
if you orchestrated this whole situation

1149
01:05:48,736 --> 01:05:50,988
to get him kicked out...

1150
01:05:52,698 --> 01:05:53,783
of Doldam Hospital.

1151
01:05:53,866 --> 01:05:56,077
(tense music continues)

1152
01:06:08,839 --> 01:06:09,966
(mouths)

1153
01:06:15,179 --> 01:06:20,434
HOPE, LOVE, SERVICE

1154
01:06:29,193 --> 01:06:31,779
(dramatic music)

1155
01:06:39,787 --> 01:06:42,289
(dramatic music continues)

1156
01:06:57,388 --> 01:06:59,015
Dr. Lee, you may go now.

1157
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:04,603
Here at Doldam Hospital,
no disability can hold you back,

1158
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:06,522
as long as you have the will
to circumvent it.

1159
01:07:08,149 --> 01:07:09,358
So cheer up.

1160
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:11,110
Thank you.

1161
01:07:22,955 --> 01:07:23,789
(door closes)

1162
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:28,169
(Sabu clears throat, sighs)

1163
01:07:34,675 --> 01:07:35,760
(grunts)

1164
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:39,346
I feel like I faced quite a big wave.

1165
01:07:43,851 --> 01:07:45,102
What did you think?

1166
01:07:45,686 --> 01:07:47,813
(tense music)

1167
01:07:54,695 --> 01:07:57,615
I told you, it wasn't me!

1168
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:01,535
Then what is this bag?

1169
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:03,996
I don't know either.
Why are you asking me?

1170
01:08:04,371 --> 01:08:06,874
I'm not the only person
who had sandwiches from here!

1171
01:08:11,837 --> 01:08:13,380
It wasn't me!

1172
01:08:19,053 --> 01:08:22,932
(breathing shakily)

1173
01:08:27,228 --> 01:08:29,563
(uneasy music)

1174
01:08:33,567 --> 01:08:35,194
(breathes shakily)

1175
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:39,824
KYUNGSOOK:
I'm saying we should make a deal.

1176
01:08:40,324 --> 01:08:45,121
I must see
Professor Cha leave this trauma center.

1177
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:46,330
What do you say?

1178
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:50,584
Will you take this deal?

1179
01:08:50,668 --> 01:08:51,710
Fine.

1180
01:08:53,045 --> 01:08:55,256
If a person gets too upset and angry,

1181
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:57,341
one could do that.

1182
01:08:57,633 --> 01:08:59,844
One's thoughts might get out of control.

1183
01:09:00,594 --> 01:09:02,471
But as time goes by,

1184
01:09:03,514 --> 01:09:05,808
nothing is more foolish

1185
01:09:06,267 --> 01:09:07,893
than paying back anger with anger.

1186
01:09:10,354 --> 01:09:12,481
With time, you will also regret

1187
01:09:13,190 --> 01:09:16,485
the offer you just made.

1188
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:18,529
Are you rejecting my offer?

1189
01:09:19,405 --> 01:09:21,282
That's right, I am.

1190
01:09:21,365 --> 01:09:24,535
(tense music)

1191
01:09:24,618 --> 01:09:29,039
I don't make deals over people,
no matter the circumstances.

1192
01:09:29,748 --> 01:09:34,044
I believe no one's life
deserves to be treated that way.

1193
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:36,755
I cannot accept it.

1194
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:38,257
(smacks lips)

1195
01:09:46,265 --> 01:09:48,934

EUNTAK: Ms. Eom.

1202
01:11:13,477 --> 01:11:15,521
Did you see the elderly lady patient?

1203
01:11:15,604 --> 01:11:19,233
What? No, I didn't.

SABU:
So you're going to kick Cha Jinman out

1208
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:14,556
and accept Assemblywoman Ko's deal?

1209
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:17,309
MINGUK: This isn't about
what's right or wrong, Master Kim.

1210
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:18,936
I should step down?

1211
01:13:19,019 --> 01:13:20,646
EUNJAE: This is the life I chose.

1213
01:13:22,606 --> 01:13:24,233
But you're doing a great job.

1214
01:13:24,316 --> 01:13:27,361
JINMAN: Is this also the romance
that Bu Yongju talks about?

1215
01:13:27,444 --> 01:13:29,446
-It's just my dream.
-JINMAN: Your dream?
