(exhales sharply)

8
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,860
Seokgu wants to see you.

9
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:11,321
I have a surgery to get to. Step aside.

10
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:12,906
MAN: I heard you were Seokgu's friend.

11
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,075
He'll be sad if you ignore him.

12
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,534
Who said that he was my friend?

13
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,787
(tense music)

14
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,749
EUNTAK (in video): You little...

15
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:24,834
WOOJIN (in video):
What are you doing, Euntak?

16
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,044
You can't do this in the hospital.

17
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:27,295
EUNTAK: I'm going to kill this guy.

18
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:28,630
MAN: It came out nicely.

19
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,590
Should I share this on social media

20
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:34,010
with the caption, "A nurse grabs a patient
by the collar and threatens him"?

21
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:36,846
Then your hospital will be toast.

22
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,139
Will you be okay with that?

23
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,103
ANCHOR (on TV): We have breaking news.

24
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:46,815
The Gangwon-do military base shooter
has been revealed.

25
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:50,026
He is a non-commissioned officer
with the last name Jeon.

26
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:52,487
Gambling debt was
the apparent cause of the trouble.

27
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,740
It seems
everything the elders say is right.

28
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:59,244
They say gambling is a shortcut
to ruin and disgrace.

29
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:02,580
...and it was revealed that he shot
Platoon Leader Second Lieutenant Park

30
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:07,377
and the platoon members on duty
because of this grudge.

31
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:11,214
By the way,
it seems like they haven't caught him yet.

32
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:15,301
He wouldn't show up
at our hospital, right?

33
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,095
Why would he show up at our hospital?

34
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:18,012
What for?

35
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,889
They said he was holding a grudge.

36
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,433
What if he figures out they're here

37
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,394
and comes to harass them again?

38
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,437
It's a possibility, Chief Jang.

39
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,730
No way.

40
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,441
There are soldiers standing guard.

41
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:31,818
He'd have to be crazy to...

42
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,027
(scoffs)

43
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,363

and other injured individuals

47
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:46,416
were rushed to a nearby trauma center
as transport to a military hospital

48
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:50,044
became difficult
in worsening weather conditions.

49
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:51,629
Mr. Jeon, who is on the run--

50
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:53,923
(scoffs)

51
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,217
So they're still alive?

52
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,513

SABU: Switch places.

57
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,281
Remove your hands.

(Sabu panting)

65
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:44,891
SABU: Doil, there isn't enough
blood volume. Pump some more.

66
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:46,726
DOIL: Okay.

67
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:50,146

71
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,160
He's in V-fib.

72
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,537
SABU: Bring the internal
defibrillation paddles, quickly!

73
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,164
EUNJAE: I'll do it!

74
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,250

80
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,805
SABU: Cha Eunjae, once more.

81
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,056
EUNJAE: 20 joules.

82
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,516
(defibrillator whirring)

83
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,809

(Sabu panting)

90
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:23,740
SABU: Cha Eunjae,

91
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,451
you haven't lost anything yet.

92
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,119
What do you want to do?

93
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:29,996
Do you think you can continue?

94
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,665
(Eunjae breathes shakily)

95
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,919
(Eunjae breathes deeply)

96
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,673
EUNJAE: I'll start a wedge resection now.
Please give me the linear cutters.

97
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:43,593
SABU: Okay.

98
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,861
HYEONJEONG: Sir, how do you feel?

99
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:05,239
What? Where did he go?

-(grunts)
-(chuckles)

106
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,480
Hey, Park Euntak.

107
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:39,607
You've gotten really weak.

108
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:42,068
(panting)

109
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,195
Is this why you asked to see me?

110
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,907
This is just a greeting.
A "let's get along from now on" greeting.

111
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,494
Your hospital has
a lot of good drugs, right?

112
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:53,913
My injuries really hurt.

113
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,124
SEOKGU: Give me a strong painkiller,
will you?

114
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,127
Was it called pethidine?

115
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,211
Something like that.

116
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,588
Your hospital has that, right?

117
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,465
Is that how far you've come?

118
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,675
Can you give me some?

119
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,802
Just leave the hospital quietly

120
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,096
before I call the police.

121
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:11,889
(exhales softly)

122
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,141
(scoffs)

123
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,480
How many years did it take you?

124
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,613
SEOKGU: It should be about 10 years.

125
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,907
Even if this is
some hospital in the boonies,

126
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:34,162
you probably studied
and worked really hard those 10 years.

127
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,039
That's how you've gotten this far.

128
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:39,041
But Euntak,

129
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,169
I could destroy those 10 years

130
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:44,088
in less than five minutes.

131
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,049
You know the power of editing, right?

132
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:50,261
If I touch up that video you saw earlier,

133
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:51,804
it'll be over for you.

134
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:53,973
Not only you,

135
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:55,683
but your hospital too.

136
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,561
Ruining someone's life...

137
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,981
is too easy in this world,

138
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,150
you idiot.

139
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,070
(snorts)
Can you guess why?

140
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:10,573
I have nothing to lose,

141
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,451
but you worked hard for this life,

142
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,037
so you have a lot to lose.

143
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,122
Your sense of inferiority...

144
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,875
Your sense of defeat is understandable,

145
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,212
but you shouldn't threaten me like that.

146
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,006
It makes you look
like a total scumbag right now.

147
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,174
Do you have a death wish?

148
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:29,509
So watch what you say.

149
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,844
You should be the one
watching what you say, you bastard.

150
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,305
Wonyoung died because of you.

151
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:38,392
SEOKGU: Don't you think
you should pay for your sins?

152
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,436
(tense music)

153
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,066
So, my friend.

154
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,403
Stop trying to get on my nerves

155
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:53,407
and just give me a shot
so we can quietly end things.

156
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,870
I just want some hospital medication,
courtesy of a friend.

157
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,332
Is that too much to ask?

158
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:14,428
TREATMENT FROM THE HEART
HOPE, LOVE, SERVICE

159
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,681
Oh, Chief Jang.

160
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,349
Have you seen Nurse Euntak?

161
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:20,309
No, I haven't.

162
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,894
Why? Is he not here?

163
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:25,439
Yes, and I can't get hold of him.
He's not in the medical office or the ER.

164
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,650
I wonder what happened.

165
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:30,278
Nurse Euntak isn't one
to leave without saying anything.

166
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:31,737
HYEONJEONG: Dr. Seo!

167
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,240
What's wrong?

168
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,076
I can't find the patient you brought over.

169
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:40,037
There's half an IV left,
but he just took it out and disappeared.

170
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,748
The troublesome patient that fought
with Nurse Euntak is missing too.

171
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,834
He went to use the restroom
and hasn't come back yet.

172
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,377
What is going on here?

173
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,545
GITAE: No way.

174
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,006
A serial disappearance

175
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:52,091
in our Doldam Hospital?

176
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:55,344
Mr. Koo, could you check
near the restrooms?

177
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,512
I'll check the second floor.

178
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,555
Okay, I will.

179
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,027
GITAE: There's a snowstorm.

180
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,364
The hospital becomes isolated.

181
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,830
Did you happen
to see Nurse Euntak anywhere?

182
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,666
-NURSE: I haven't seen him today.
-GITAE: One by one,

183
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,084
people start to disappear.

184
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:31,881
GITAE: It's unlikely
that they went outside in this weather.

185
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:33,924
Then there's a high probability

186
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,720
that the incident started
inside the hospital.

187
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,610
(intense music)

188
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:55,905
(gasps)

189
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,031
(music swells, fades)

190
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:02,578
DONGHWA: Please check the I/O hourly

191
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,164
-and notify someone if there's a fever.
-NURSE: Yes, Doctor.

192
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,298
Are you looking for someone?

193
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:18,094
Did Nurse Euntak come up here?

194
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,261
No, I haven't seen him.

195
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,933
Is Nurse Euntak playing hooky too?

196
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,142
He isn't like you.

197
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:28,270
What did I do?
I've been dutiful these days.

198
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,188
(scoffs)

199
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,733
The patient he fought with in the ER
is missing too.

200
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,862
Did they go out to fight then?

201
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,406
-GITAE: Dr. Seo!
-(door opens)

202
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,448
Dr. Seo!

203
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,033
Dr. Seo.

204
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:44,245
It's an emergency!
You need to come down immediately.

205
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:54,714
GITAE: They're from a bus
that was passing near the hospital.

206
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,091
It skidded down a slope
on the snow-covered road.

207
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:01,053
No one has been seriously injured,
but quite a few of them are hurt.

208
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,556
They were redirected
to Doldam Hospital by 911

209
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:07,143
because it would take too long for them
to send help because of the snow.

210
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,227
(sighs)

211
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,900
We have to get it done by tomorrow!

212
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,447
HYEONJEONG: If I were to take a guess,
there are more than 20 people.

213
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,199
We should let Master Kim know first.

214
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:25,453
He can't come, because he's operating
on a patient with a gunshot wound.

215
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:28,622
He left the patients in our care
until he gets back.

216
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,833
However, the situation is dire.

217
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,543
Who's on duty at Doldam right now?

218
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:35,546
You can say it's only us right now.

219
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:38,591
Director Park Minguk went
to a budget review meeting today,

220
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:41,427
but he's probably unable
to come back due to the snow.

221
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,054
(classical music playing over headphones)

222
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,681
How about Dr. Lee Seonung?

223
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,892
Dr. Ung is in an operating room
with Dr. Ortho.

224
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,019
(sighs)

225
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:52,354
GITAE: What should we do, Dr. Seo Woojin?

226
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,149
Are you sure
we shouldn't contact Master Kim?

227
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,735
(tense music)

228
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,077
Nurse Eom, use the KTAS

229
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,497
and send anyone level three and below
to the ER.

230
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,498
Yes, Doctor.

231
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:11,916
Also, Chief Jang,

232
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,793
please guide patients with no pain

233
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,086
or visible trauma to the lobby to wait.

234
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,463
-Okay.
-And you.

235
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,090
Stay focused.

236
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:21,091
You've got this, right?

237
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,010
You shouldn't trust me too much.

238
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,514
You've got this. Right, Dr. Donghwa?

239
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,015
I'll do my best.

240
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:28,974
(scoffs)

241
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,226
Right.

242
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,311
MAN: Hello? Are there any doctors here?

243
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,480
Is no one here at this hospital?

244
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:35,481
(sighs)

245
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:36,941
Let's go.

246
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:47,993
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

247
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:55,501
(upbeat music)

248
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:03,717
VOLUME 8
UNDERDOG EFFECT

249
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,469
JINMAN: Kelly.

250
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,056
(Jinman grunts)

251
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,641
MYEONGSIM: Is it lodged in the bone?

252
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,810
JINMAN:
I think there's only a cortical break.

253
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:14,937
Let's try pulling it out.

254
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,401
(machine beeping rapidly)

255
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,488
Vascular clamp.

256
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,289
(machine beeping rhythmically)

257
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,169
Irrigation, please.

258
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,802
I don't think we need to perform a bypass.

259
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,304
I'll start the repairing process.

260
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:49,722
Suture, please.

261
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,654
-JINMAN: Cut.
-MYEONGSIM: Cut.

262
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,864
(scissors snip)

263
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,158
-JINMAN: Cut.
-MYEONGSIM: Cut.

264
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,075
(scissors snip)

265
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,165
MYEONGSIM: We're repairing an artery.

266
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,753
-JINMAN: Cut.
-MYEONGSIM: Cut.

267
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,923
JINMAN: I'll take the clamp off now.

268
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:27,259
Okay.

269
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:28,802
(Jinman sighs)

270
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,596
I've done my part.

271
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,389
Let's switch out.

272
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,528
SABU: As expected of you.

273
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,907
Good work, Dr. Cha Jinman.

274
00:15:57,581 --> 00:16:01,043
MYEONGSIM: I think I finally understand
what Dr. Nam Doil meant

275
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,045
when he said you two were "TVPG."

276
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,172
It's my first time

277
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,882
getting nervous
about the pace of a surgery

278
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,634
since working with you.

279
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:12,930
SABU: I told you there were
a lot of hidden masters in Korea.

280
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,352
I'm going to explore the nerve injury now.
Give me the Senn retractor.

281
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,981
All right, grab here.

282
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:23,774
Suture, please.

283
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:48,424
JINMAN: Oh, hey.

284
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,092
Did the operation end well?

285
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,431
The patient went into cardiac arrest
in the middle of the surgery.

286
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,641
Oh, I see.

287
00:16:58,809 --> 00:16:59,810
You made a great effort.

288
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,732
Do you want me to get you a cool drink?

289
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,112
No, I have to go see the patient.

290
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,115
Luckily, we stopped the bleeding
but we still have to wait and see.

291
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,492
Take it easy, okay?

292
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,585
DOIL:
Today's surgery was a little difficult.

293
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:26,754
Dr. Cha...

294
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,798
doesn't usually make that kind of mistake

295
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,341
but she missed a lung injury

296
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,510
caused by a rib fracture
on the right side.

297
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,014
There was subcutaneous emphysema
up to the patient's face.

298
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,725
(inhales deeply)

299
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,769
JINMAN: You inserted a tube on the left.

300
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,437
Why do you need another on the right?

301
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,690
The right side still shows signs of
pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema.

302
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:49,109
The subcutaneous emphysema
could go past the midline.

303
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,986
JINMAN:
If the pneumothorax isn't that serious,

304
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,906
inserting tubes on both sides
is too much, Dr. Cha.

305
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,912
DOIL: Fortunately, Master Kim
was able to bring the patient back.

306
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,999
He not only saved the patient
but saved Cha Eunjae too.

307
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,668
Cha Eunjae...

308
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:10,464
has a hard time as it is
because of her surgery anxiety.

309
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,562
(exhales deeply)

310
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,399
(sighs)

311
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,158
What are you doing here?

312
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,244
Observing the patient.

313
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,664
EUNJAE:
Is he really in that bad of a condition?

314
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:47,209
No, he's okay.

315
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,129
His brain CT came back clear

316
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:51,839
and no unusual signs.

317
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:55,717
Hey, the patient's monitoring line
is still intact, right?

318
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,805
EUNJAE: Yes, it's still intact.

319
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,141
(sighs)

320
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,727
After losing Assemblywoman Ko's son,

321
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,814
I've started to doubt everything I know.

322
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:11,567
Even though I know
the top priority is to stop bleeding,

323
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,194
I can't help but think, "Is that right?"

324
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:18,615
"What if that seemingly fine patient
is in a more critical state?"

325
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:22,619
The current state I'm in is,

326
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:23,745
in short,

327
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,457
the worst of the worst.

328
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:29,793
(Insu sighs)

329
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,463
I almost lost a patient today too.
(sighs)

330
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:35,591
How?

331
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:37,759
Because...

332
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,221
Because I'm inexperienced.

333
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:44,933
You must have had a really hard time
if you're saying that.

334
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,145
I thought he was going to die
and completely lost my wits.

335
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,772
But thanks to Master Kim,
the patient lived.

336
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,567
EUNJAE: Open cardiac.

337
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,735
Open...

338
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,195
(exhales in awe)

339
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,864
That's our Master Kim. As expected.

340
00:19:58,947 --> 00:19:59,823
(in English) Respect.

341
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,325
Respect.

342
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,788
(sighs, speaks in Korean)
At least it's not as busy

343
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,499
as I thought it would be today.
I was worried since it snowed a lot.

344
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:13,378
What did you just say?

345
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:17,799
-(gasps)
-(phone ringing)

346
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,052
-Hello, this is Doldam Hospital.
-Where is the restroom?

347
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:21,261
One moment, please.

348
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:24,598
-MAN 1: A blanket, please!
-MAN 2: Excuse me, may I get a blanket?

349
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:25,891
MAN 3: My head...

350
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:27,351
MAN 4: Thank you.

351
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,854
(phone ringing in distance)

352
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,272
-What's wrong?
-I'm sorry.

353
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,149
MAN 5: Gosh, it's so cold.

354
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,612
-Oh?
-What the heck?

355
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:41,406
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

356
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,158
WOMAN: I feel bad using the blanket alone.

357
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:44,576
My gosh, it's cold.

358
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,791
Okay, the lobby is clear.

359
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,794
It's not our first time working together.

360
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,754
-It's normal for quarantine to follow...
-Sir.

361
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:58,215
-Wait one moment, please.
-Sir.

362
00:20:58,298 --> 00:20:59,800
MAN 1: I feel a little better now.

363
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,594
MAN 2: Please hurry up and do something.

364
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,137
-Bring me the suture materials.
-NURSE: Okay.

365
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,389
MAN 3: I'm really busy though.

366
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,516
Hurry up!

367
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,313
What are you doing, Chief Jang?

368
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:18,860
The identity of the military base shooter
has been revealed.

369
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:19,861
Oh, really?

370
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,947
GITAE: They say he's still on the run.

371
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,865
It's unlikely he's here though.

372
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,743
I'm checking in advance as a precaution.

373
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,954
(laughs)

374
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:30,789
What's wrong?

375
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,833
HYEONJEONG: I think

376
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,502
I've seen this person before.

377
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:37,337
You've seen him? Where?

378
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,719
(tense music swells, fades)

379
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:56,148
Oh, I can see it!

380
00:21:58,191 --> 00:21:59,818
-Does it hurt?
-Yes...

381
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:03,655
Nurse Eom, can I get tramadol
and an X-ray for this patient?

382
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,408
AREUM: Nurse Eom?

383
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,161
Nurse Eom!

384
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:10,412
EUNTAK: I'll do it.

385
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,124
You...

386
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:16,460
(soft music)

387
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,172
After giving the patient tramadol,
I'll take him to get an X-ray.

388
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:24,509
Did you get hurt? Let me see.

389
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:26,136
It's nothing. I'm fine.

390
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:28,138
Hold on. Don't move.

391
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:33,685
Did the surgery end well?

392
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,229
Yes, of course.

393
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:37,856
(Donghwa clears throat)

394
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,446
I'm sorry I wasn't there.

395
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,781
We'll talk about that later.

396
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,742
Dr. Jang, prepare some dressings.

397
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:49,910
Okay.

398
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:57,417
(sighs)

399
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:09,304
Nurse Euntak, there's no problem, right?

400
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:10,847
No, of course not.

401
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,392
Even if there was, I can handle it.

402
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:17,354
Let me know if you need help. Okay?

403
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,337
(Donghwa exclaims)

404
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:45,006
He got completely beat up.

405
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:48,009
Shouldn't we report this
to the police as assault?

406
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:49,678
Don't you have a patient?

407
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,391
DONGHWA: Why are you always so mean to me?

408
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:57,477
You're so nice
when you talk to Nurse Euntak.

409
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:00,105
(sighs)
So what?

410
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:05,068
Nurse Choi, I need normal saline
and to run labs on this patient.

411
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,236
NURSE: Yes, Doctor.

412
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:08,196
-Dr. Seo!
-Dr. Seo Woojin!

413
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:11,241
(Gitae panting)

414
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:17,247
HYEONJEONG: It's him, right?
The patient you brought over.

415
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:20,792
Yes, it is him.

416
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:23,670
Where could he have gone?

417
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:25,005
Could he have run away?

418
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,173
I treated him,

419
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:28,592
but it would be hard for him
to walk with the deep leg wound.

420
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:31,845
Not only that, it's snowing a lot outside.

421
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:33,263
GITAE: That means

422
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:34,764
he's hiding somewhere.

423
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:38,185
Chief Jang, call the police first.

424
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:39,102
Okay, I will.

425
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,771
What should we do
about the people in the hospital?

426
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,028
(patients clamoring)

427
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:54,117
(sighs)

428
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:01,166
-(phone ringing)
-(phone vibrates)

429
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:02,751
Hello, this is the Trauma Center.

430
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,127
What's up, Dr. Seo Woojin?

431
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,795
Hi, Nurse Eom. What's going on?

432
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,005
Yes.

433
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:09,049
-Excuse me?
-What?

434
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,557
-SABU: Cut.
-MYEONGSIM: Cut.

435
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:18,642
(scissors snip)

436
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,480
(Sabu grunts)

437
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,778
-MYEONGSIM: Master Kim.
-SABU: Yes?

438
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,363
MYEONGSIM: Should we take a break?

439
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,490
SABU: No, it's okay.

440
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:35,408
Nerve hook, please.

441
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,999
I think the nerves are connected well.

442
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,670
Just a little more irrigation
and we'll wrap up after that.

443
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:47,963
MYEONGSIM: Okay.

444
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,719
-YEONGMI: Master Kim!
-SABU: Yes, Nurse Joo?

445
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,972
YEONGMI: We just got a call
from Doldam Hospital.

446
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,099
There's been an off-road bus accident.

447
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:02,394
7 injured patients and 16 other passengers
have evacuated to the hospital.

448
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,187
SABU: Who's over there right now?

449
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:07,148
YEONGMI: For now, Dr. Areum and Dr. Woojin
are taking care of things,

450
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:08,525
but...

451
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,820
MYEONGSIM: What is it? Is something wrong?

452
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,907
The shooter who is on the run
seems to be inside the hospital.

453
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,076
(tense music)

454
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,369
He came in as a patient.

455
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,914
-Damn it. Call headquarters now.
-Yes, sir.

456
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:27,919
(sighs)

457
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,051
SEONUNG: Scalpel.

458
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:42,058
Potts scissors.

459
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,479
A 4-French Fogarty catheter, please.

460
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:55,447
MUNJEONG: Dr. Seonung,
you have to push it in a little more.

461
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:03,955
All right. That's good.

462
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,127
Okay, now gently use the syringe.

463
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,301
(soft music)

464
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,057
Heparin fluid, please.

465
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:31,316
You're doing much better
than I thought you would.

466
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:32,859
Should we...

467
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,236
increase the pace a little bit?

468
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,822
SEONUNG: I'm sorry,
I was going a bit slow, wasn't I?

469
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:41,201
MUNJEONG: You were just being cautious.
That's not a bad thing.

470
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:42,994
SEONUNG: Thank you.

471
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:46,081
I'll begin distal revascularization now.

472
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:52,295
SABU: What's the situation like now?

473
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:55,965
Well, the military police
are on their way.

474
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,802
However, as you know,
the weather conditions are very bad.

475
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,929
So we don't know how long it will take.

476
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:05,100
Until then, it'll be best
to evacuate to a safer place.

477
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,226
What do you mean, evacuate?

478
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,771
Wouldn't this be over
if you just arrest the culprit?

479
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:13,983
Well...

480
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:16,653
You see,

481
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:20,073
there's something
that wasn't released to the public yet.

482
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:21,449
SABU: What?

483
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,827
The culprit...

484
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,496
is carrying a weapon.

485
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:27,622
(scoffs)

486
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,417
He took two guns with magazines
from the guard post

487
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,419
and a pistol from the second lieutenant.

488
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:34,754
How many bullets are in one magazine?

489
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:37,298
Each magazine holds 30 bullets.
In total, he has 60 bullets.

490
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:38,717
(sighs)

491
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,595
You didn't even inform us in advance
about such a dangerous situation

492
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,013
and just brought the patients?

493
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:47,600
Did you even think
about the safety of our medical staff?

494
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:52,021
We didn't expect the situation
to get this big either.

495
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:54,357
(tense music)

496
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,316
(sighs)

497
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:01,781
(sighs)

498
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:05,201
-Dr. Jung Insu.
-Yes, Master Kim?

499
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,996
Transfer the patients
in the Observation Area to the ICU.

500
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,207
Leave only two ICU staff members.

501
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:14,335
-Okay.
-And evacuate the rest of the staff

502
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,421
to the medical office on the second floor.

503
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:17,464
Understood.

504
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:18,798
INSU: Excuse me.

505
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,970
Dr. Jung Insu is well aware
of evacuation procedures,

506
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:28,141
so you can discuss everything with him
and make decisions accordingly.

507
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:32,520
The control tower needs to be strong,
so no personnel mishaps occur, right?

508
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,189
What are you going to do?

509
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:37,358
I'm going to go over to Doldam Hospital

510
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,986
and move the patients
Dr. Seo Woojin already operated on.

511
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:44,365
It'll be easier to protect the patients
if we keep them together.

512
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:47,410
We'll go with you.

513
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,704
Okay, let's go.

514
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:07,263
(phone vibrating)

515
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,392
EUNJAE: Dad, is something the matter?

516
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,686
JINMAN: There's an issue in the hospital,

517
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,897
so everyone is evacuating
to the medical office.

518
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:18,024
You should get out too. Evacuate.

519
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,194
(tense music)

520
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:22,987
RESTRICTED AREA

521
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:26,449
Seo Woojin.

522
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,159
Yes, Master Kim?

523
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,788
No, we're okay. Nothing's happened yet.

524
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:34,999
Evacuate everyone in the lobby to the ER.

525
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,669
SABU (over phone):
Keep movement to different locations,

526
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,295
including restrooms, to a minimum.

527
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:43,216
Get ready to move patients
from the Observation Area to the ICU.

528
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:44,801
Okay, we'll do that.

529
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:47,637
-WOOJIN: Jang Donghwa.
-Yes?

530
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,640
We're moving the hemoperitoneum patient
from the ICU to the Trauma Center.

531
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:52,684
Go get the patient ready.
I'll be right behind you.

532
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:53,768
Okay.

533
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:57,689
Dr. Yoon, evacuate everyone
in the lobby to the ER for now.

534
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:59,274
Work with Chief Jang to get it done.

535
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,275
Okay, understood.

536
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,611
Nurse Euntak,
separate the patients into sessions.

537
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:04,904
Okay, I'll do that.

538
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:11,661
NARCOTICS FOR MEDICAL USAGE

539
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,965
Why is this bastard taking so long?

540
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:26,926
He won't come.

541
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:31,222
What did you say?

542
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,642
You know how Euntak is.

543
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:37,061
MAN: He would never do such a thing.

544
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:39,647
(scoffs)

545
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:48,615
(man breathing heavily)

546
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,219
Were you informed
about the hemoperitoneum patient?

547
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:13,014
Yes, we're getting ready
to transfer him to the Trauma Center.

548
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,098
DONGHWA: Okay.

549
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:18,645
(suspenseful music)

550
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,066
(man breathing heavily)

551
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:34,869
Get down.

552
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,956
(both scream, whimpering)

553
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:41,584
-NURSE 1: Oh, my.
-NURSE 2: What...

554
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,294
(nurses scream)

555
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,053
(nurses whimpering)

556
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:56,641
Everyone in here...

557
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:58,977
should get out.

558
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,562
DONGHWA: Go, get out. Quickly.

559
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:03,147
NURSE 1: Let's go.

560
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:07,944
You should leave too.

561
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,780
DONGHWA: What? Oh, okay, I will.

562
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:14,784
Dang it.

563
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:28,381
(Donghwa grunts)

564
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:32,385
WOOJIN:
How does it feel to save a patient?

565
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:34,345
Today, it was you who did well.

566
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,185
(breathing shakily)

567
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,603
(inhales deeply)
What are you doing?

568
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,397
I told you to hurry up and get out!

569
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,525
DONGHWA: Yes, I'm leaving.
I'm on my way out.

570
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:49,444
I'm going to leave, but...

571
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,362
Damn it!

572
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:52,905
(Donghwa groans)

573
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:55,158
(breathing heavily)

574
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:05,376
What are you doing?

575
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,753
DONGHWA (in shaky voice): But...

576
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,547
By the way...

577
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:13,259
You shouldn't be carrying around
such a dangerous weapon in the hospital.

578
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:15,094
(splutters)
This is...

579
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,513
This is the ICU, so you have to...

580
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,891
You have to wear a mask.

581
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:22,226
(splutters)
You have to dis...

582
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:25,813
disinfect your hands too...

583
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,523
Get out of the way.

584
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,485
(shouts)
I said, get out of the way!

585
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:33,488
DONGHWA: How can I do that?
If I move, you'll shoot him!

586
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:36,699
(panting)

587
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:39,035
-Then you can die with him.
-(Donghwa gasps)

588
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:41,746
-DONGHWA: Wait, please!
-WOOJIN: Stop!

589
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,210
(Donghwa whimpers)

590
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,420
DONGHWA: Dr. Seo!

591
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,090
(tense music)

592
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,057
INSU: Come out, quickly.
Go to the medical office.

593
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,433
Come out, quickly.

594
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,102
Leave it.

595
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:08,022
Eunjae, what are you doing?
I told you to get to the medical office.

596
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,982
INSU: Hurry. Come on out.

597
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,275
(breathes shakily)

598
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:15,530
(exhales deeply)

599
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:19,242
I'm sorry, but I have to stay here.

600
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,622
The patient's condition is still unstable,
so I have to stay by his side.

601
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:27,917
Why are you being so stubborn?

602
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:30,628
You should listen to me
in a situation like this!

603
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,047
He's my patient, Dad.

604
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,424
I make the decisions,
and he's my responsibility.

605
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:41,305
EUNJAE (over phone):
From what I experienced in the OR,

606
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,516
I'm now painstakingly aware
of what happens to a patient

607
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:46,269
if I don't fulfill
my responsibility to them.

608
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,271
I don't...

609
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,106
want that to happen again.

610
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:52,984
I'll stay here.

611
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,320
-Eunjae...
-(call end tone)

612
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,078
(sighs)

613
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:09,000
This is a hospital.
What do you think you're doing?

614
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:14,630
I'm going to kill them.

615
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:16,007
(breathes heavily)

616
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:17,133
They looked down on me,

617
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,135
walked all over me,

618
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,180
and disregarded me.
I'm going to kill these bastards.

619
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,267
Then go do that somewhere else.
This is a hospital.

620
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,644
So you should've left me alone.
Why did you take me here?

621
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:29,812
(breathes heavily)

622
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:31,147
Because you were hurt,

623
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,149
and I'm a doctor.

624
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:38,112
(soft chuckle)

625
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,405
You're so full of yourself.

626
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,408
Put down the gun.

627
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:45,661
You won't gain anything with that.

628
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,872
Do you think
I'm doing this to gain something?

629
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:48,915
Well, I'm not!

630
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,752
MAN: I'm giving this unfair...

631
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:56,380
and unjust world a wake-up call.

632
00:36:57,423 --> 00:37:00,509
There are people like me
who were born to different starting points

633
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:03,471
and struggle to have things go their way!

634
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:07,141
I want to give comfort to those people!

635
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:10,436
(scoffs)

636
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,065
Do you think
saying it like that makes it right?

637
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,361
What did you just say?

638
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:19,570
In reality, it's not true.

639
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,198
It's all just an excuse, a justification.

640
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:26,869
You got caught gambling,

641
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:30,539
got kicked out of the army, and got mad
at yourself for your own shortcomings!

642
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,625
(tense music)

643
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,295
You're just taking it out on others,

644
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:40,341
in the most vulgar form of violence
and in the most cowardly way!

645
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,802
Shut up! Stop acting all high and mighty!

646
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:44,929
DONGHWA: Dr. Seo!

647
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,474
(breathes heavily)

648
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:54,021
-MAN 1: What is going on?
-MAN 2: Hello, Doctor.

649
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,607
-MAN 3: Can you tell us what's going on?
-MAN 4: I have to go!

650
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,109
MAN 5: We deserve some answers!

651
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:00,152
-SABU: Nurse Euntak.
-Master Kim.

652
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:02,071
How is the evacuation...

653
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,448
What happened to your face?

654
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:06,951
It's nothing. I just fell.

655
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:10,913
Did you finish evacuating everyone?

656
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:14,000
Yes, the hybrid OR and five inner beds
were given to the patients.

657
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:16,669
The rest were given to regular passengers.

658
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:17,837
Okay.

659
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:19,380
What about Seo Woojin?

660
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,424
In the ICU on the second floor.
He was getting ready--

661
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:22,925
(rapid gunshots)

662
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:24,468
-MAN 1: What the...
-MAN 2: What's going on?

663
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,429
MAN 3: Oh, my gosh. What's happening?

664
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:27,555
MAN 4: A gunshot!

665
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:28,556
MAN 5: A gun?

666
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,182
MAN 6: Wasn't that a gun just now?

667
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,225
MAN 7: I think so.

668
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,898
(classical music playing over headphones)

669
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,403
(sighs)

670
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,405
That was a gunshot just now, right?

671
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:46,073
I think so.

672
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:52,038
(line ringing)

673
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:54,415
What was that?

674
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:57,043
Who the heck does target practice
while it's snowing?

675
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:58,127
Crazy fools.

676
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:01,255
INCIDENT REPORT: ON-DUTY ABSENCE
CHICKEN BURGER...

677
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:13,225
(rapid gunshots)

678
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:16,479
(Seokgu wailing)

679
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:17,480
MAN: Go that way.

680
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:18,856
Over here!

681
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,527
Over here, Euntak!

682
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:25,863
Over here, quickly! Hurry up!

683
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:27,823
SEOKGU (cries): What am I going to do?

684
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:29,700
Someone help me!

685
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:32,453
(tense music)

686
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,164
(Seokgu groans in pain)

687
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,710
(crying)

688
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:41,670
(yells)

689
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,005
Damn it!

690
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,716
Be gentle, it hurts.

691
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,802
Don't cry. You won't die.

692
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,553
(Seokgu sobs)

693
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:51,222
SABU: Hey, Jang Donghwa.

694
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:52,431
Are you okay?

695
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,059
(breathing shakily)

696
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:55,976
(in shaky voice)
Yes.

697
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:57,728
I'm okay.

698
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,648
(breathing shakily)

699
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:04,402
The patient...

700
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:06,987
is safe too.

701
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:08,989
(sighs)

702
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,160
What about Seo Woojin?

703
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,454
Where is he now?

704
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,374
(grunts, pants)

705
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,587
WOOJIN: It looks like your wound reopened.

706
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:25,548
MAN: Don't worry about that and walk.

707
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:29,677
If the inflammation gets worse,
it can lead to sepsis.

708
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:31,262
Then you could die.

709
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:34,765
It's not my first time
hearing a doctor say things to scare you.

710
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:38,144
Don't make the situation bigger
than it already is and turn yourself in.

711
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:40,020
No one's died yet.

712
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:43,774
It's not as bad as you think it is.

713
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:44,859
Be quiet.

714
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:47,111
I'll take care of my own issues!

715
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:48,195
(both grunt)

716
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:50,698
-(man grunts)
-(Woojin groans)

717
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:53,242
(groans in pain)

718
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:55,953
(suspenseful music)

719
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:57,955
(grunts)

720
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:00,791
(both grunt)

721
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:07,965
(panting)

722
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:10,301
(grunts)

723
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,429
(groaning)

724
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:18,601
(panting continues)

725
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:21,979
(man breathing heavily)

726
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:24,356
Hey.

727
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:26,942
What would you know...

728
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:28,777
as a doctor?

729
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,572
All you did was study in a nice home

730
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,824
where you had everything handed to you
on a silver platter.

731
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,743
You go to medical school or law school,

732
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:39,747
getting to be the doctors, prosecutors,
and judges you always wanted to be.

733
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,125
Do you even know what it's like...

734
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:45,878
to live a life like ours?

735
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:47,505
(sighs)

736
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:49,840
(sighs)

737
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:51,884
Yes,

738
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:53,511
I do.

739
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,474
I never had a nice home.

740
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,268
I was never born...

741
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:03,771
with a silver spoon in my mouth.

742
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:07,191
After my father's business failed,

743
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:09,485
my whole family died

744
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:12,112
in a murder-suicide.

745
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:15,115
I was the only one to come out alive.

746
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:16,534
(Woojin sighs)

747
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:19,662
Sure.

748
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:22,498
The world is...

749
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:24,750
an unfair place.

750
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:26,502
And it's unjust.

751
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:28,879
(sighs)

752
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:32,508
But still,

753
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:36,303
don't assume that others had it easy...

754
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:40,224
while achieving the things
they worked so hard for.

755
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,229
That would really infuriate me...

756
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,816
because I worked myself to the bone
to get here.

757
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:51,902
You're full of yourself.

758
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,615
(tense music)

759
00:42:58,158 --> 00:42:59,785
Don't act all high and mighty,
you bastard.

760
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:04,206
Despite all that,
we're the same when we die, you know that?

761
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,128
So let's keep it fair and die together.

762
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,131
How about that?

763
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:16,302
(exhales softly)

764
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:20,431
(music intensifies, fades)

765
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:22,641
(phone vibrates)

766
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:28,230
CHA EUNJAE

767
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:30,316
(sighs)

768
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:33,861
Why aren't you answering?

769
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:40,659
(vibrating continues)

770
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:47,916
Don't move.

771
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:55,341
CHA EUNJAE

772
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:58,594
I told you not to move, you bastard!

773
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:01,930
WOOJIN: I'm sorry...

774
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,851
but I'm going to live some more.

775
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:11,649
I want to live some more.

776
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,407
(man breathes heavily)

777
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:23,369
This bastard...

778
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:26,288
(tense music continues)

779
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:30,542
(shouts)
Hey!

780
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,255
(gunshot in distance)

781
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,349
(somber music)

782
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:35,733
Are you okay?

783
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:39,319
Yes.

784
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,157
(sighs)

785
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:46,493
(Sabu sighs)

786
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:55,043
(breathes deeply)

787
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,759
The situation has been handled.
You may come out now.

788
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:04,970
-DOIL: All right. Let's go.
-NURSE: What a relief.

789
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:10,267
Go, Nurse Oh and Nurse Joo.

790
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:24,198
YEONGMI: Dr. Cha, I'm here!

791
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:26,116
Did you hear that gunshot too?

792
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,994
Unbelievable. I didn't know
a gunshot would be that loud.

793
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:30,204
Nurse Joo, hold on.

794
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:32,414
Can you watch the patient for a bit?
I'll be right back.

795
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:35,334
The patient is stable now,
so just keep an eye on the urine.

796
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:54,228
Next time, don't run into danger
like you just did, got it?

797
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:57,064
Other people could have gotten hurt.

798
00:46:57,898 --> 00:47:00,067
You would have done the same, Master Kim.

799
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:03,779
There's no need for you
to be like me in that way, Dr. Seo.

800
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:06,949
What if you had gotten hurt?

801
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:10,619
Then you could fix me up, Master Kim.

802
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,121
What?

803
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:14,873
My goodness.
(scoffs)

804
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:18,627
-(soft chuckle)
-(hurried footsteps approaching)

805
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:19,670
EUNJAE: Hey, Seo Woojin!

806
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:22,881
(sighs)

807
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:26,677
Hey, you should answer your phone when...

808
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:30,013
SABU: Don't worry about me, Eunjae.

809
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:32,307
Continue what you were doing.

810
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:33,559
All of it.

811
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:36,937
Now it's Eunjae's turn
to give you an earful.

812
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,981
That way you'll get a grip on yourself.

813
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:42,192
Go on, Eunjae. You can continue.

814
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:48,240
Do as much as you want!
(chuckles)

815
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,244
Hey, Seo Woojin,

816
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:55,205
the hospital was
in such a serious situation.

817
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:58,333
It's a state of emergency,
and there were evacuation orders.

818
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:01,503
How could you not call...

819
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,548
Why are you looking at me like that?

820
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:08,176
I love you.

821
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:12,389
(soft music)

822
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:13,473
What?

823
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:15,934
What did you say?

824
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:18,937
I'll see you later.

825
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:23,191
What did you say?

826
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:27,112
EUNJAE: Hey, Seo Woojin!

827
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:31,575
WOOJIN: Eunjae,

828
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:34,411
I wonder what would have become of me

829
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:36,955
if I had never met you.

830
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:44,504
SABU: You should have told us in advance
about a situation like this. Gosh.

831
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:47,007
I'm sorry, considering the situation...

832
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:51,511
Regardless of the situation,
one of our doctors almost got hurt!

833
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:57,309
WOOJIN:
If I had never met Master Kim in my life,

834
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:01,688
what would have become of me?

835
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:17,496
Chief Jang,
where have you been this whole time?

836
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:19,790
GITAE: I was very busy
helping Dr. Seo Woojin in the ER--

837
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:23,043
I was in the ER with Woojin
this whole time! You...

838
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:25,170
GITAE: Why are you getting angry at me?
In my own way, I...

839
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:32,344
Dr. Seo!

840
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,726
DONGHWA: Are you okay?
You're not hurt, are you?

841
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,729
Gosh, I was worried
something bad was going to happen to you.

842
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:44,982
My heart was racing so fast
I thought I was going to die.

843
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:46,984
The gunshot was really...
Gosh, unbelievable.

844
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:47,943
(Donghwa breathes sharply)

845
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:49,653
I thought you said
you liked shooter games.

846
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:51,530
A game is a game,

847
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:54,074
you shouldn't confuse a game with reality.

848
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:57,285
Well, anyway, I'm glad you weren't hurt.

849
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:06,169
WOOJIN: Can I be that kind of person
to someone as well?

850
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:07,337
Do you want a drink?

851
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:08,547
Well...

852
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:10,590
I'll take an orange juice.

853
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:12,843
The squeezed, expensive kind.

854
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:14,720
I almost died, so it's okay, right?

855
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,267
WOOJIN: Can I, really?

856
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:22,519
Why aren't you getting me one?

857
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:26,064
(Seokgu groaning)

858
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:29,943
Sir, we've given you the painkillers,
so you'll start to feel better soon.

859
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:32,320
I told you it really hurts right now.
(sobs)

860
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:34,114
I'm...
(sobs)

861
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:36,074
I'm not okay at all!

862
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:38,785
Could you give me something stronger?

863
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,871
-(Seokgu groans loudly)
-(sighs)

864
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:43,540
Nurse Eom, give him pethidine.

865
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:45,625
EUNTAK: Don't, Dr. Yoon.

866
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:48,253
This patient has an addiction.

867
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:52,716
(groans)

868
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:55,093
Then we'll go with another tramadol.

869
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:58,638
Sir, we're going to give you
something else that's not a narcotic.

870
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:01,683
(Seokgu groans, grunts)

871
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:03,560
Hey, what are you saying?

872
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:06,063
What did you say to that doctor?

873
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:07,731
I told her that you were a drug addict

874
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,442
and that you can't be given
opioid pain relievers.

875
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:13,904
(scoffs)
What the hell are you saying?

876
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:17,574
Hey! Do you really want me to kill you?

877
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:21,703
Do you even know...

878
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:23,872
what it is to die?

879
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:25,749
What?

880
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:27,918
While Wonyoung was dying,

881
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:31,630
I ran 30 minutes with him on my back.

882
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:34,800
I can still...

883
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:39,429
remember the way
Wonyoung's body became stiff on my back.

884
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:44,684
If I had found Wonyoung faster that night,

885
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,979
maybe he could have lived.

886
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:51,566
The regret of not stopping him

887
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:54,694
from getting along
with scum like you, the self-blame,

888
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:58,657
and the weight of death
that weighed me down endlessly...

889
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:00,408
I ran for the last 10 years...

890
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:04,371
carrying all of that on my back.

891
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:07,499
But you're going...

892
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:09,918
to destroy that in five minutes?

893
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:17,425
(grunts)

894
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:20,887
Don't be ridiculous.

895
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:24,349
You can't even touch my collar, Seokgu.

896
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:26,768
Can you guess why?

897
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:30,397
No matter how much you try to rattle me,

898
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:33,191
I won't be rattled.

899
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:38,196
I haven't lived in such a sloppy way
to be rattled by the likes of you.

900
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,199
Are you crazy, you bastard?

901
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:43,410
DETECTIVE KO: My gosh.

902
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:45,662
-Hello, everyone.
-HYEONJEONG: Detective Ko.

903
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:46,997
DETECTIVE KO: I got a report

904
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,915
that there was a drug offender
in the hospital.

905
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:52,169
(tense music)

906
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,051
Are you Choi Seokgu?

907
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,224
(suspenseful music)

908
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:07,517
DETECTIVE KO: Hey, hurry up and catch him!

909
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:13,398
(gasps, grunts)

910
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:19,863
SEOKGU: Let go of me!
(yells)

911
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:21,698
Let go of me. Damn it!

912
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:24,117
Park Euntak.

913
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,244
This isn't the end.

914
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:29,206
I won't go down easy.

915
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:32,834
I will come back and kill you!

916
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:35,462
(yells)

917
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:36,671
Let go!

918
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,381
I said, let go of me!

919
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:48,683
Okay!

920
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:51,937
I'm done!

921
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:55,982
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

922
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:01,112
INCIDENT REPORT

923
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:12,707
Looks like the operation went really well.

924
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:17,128
Dr. Lee was actually more meticulous
and calm than I thought he would be.

925
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:18,421
Is that so?

926
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:20,131
Well...

927
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:23,009
You must have practiced a lot
in secret on your own.

928
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,469
-(soft laugh)
-(Sabu chuckles)

929
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:28,723
No, that's not it.
Dr. Bae Munjeong helped me a lot.

930
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:31,017
HEO BYUNGBAE

931
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:33,019
Remember this patient's name,

932
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:37,649
since he's the first patient
you've operated on in this hospital.

933
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,528
Okay, I'll make sure to remember his name.

934
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:44,155
All right. Keep up the good work.

935
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:45,740
-SEONUNG: Bye.
-SABU: Bye.

936
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:53,123
MUNJEONG: By the way, Dr. Ung.

937
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:55,250
About what you said before the surgery,

938
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:59,087
let's keep that between us for now.

939
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:02,549
Right, okay.

940
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:04,426
I'll be going.

941
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:14,561
I heard you performed
the mesentery surgery.

942
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:18,189
Did you already hear about that?

943
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:20,483
How did it feel?

944
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:25,280
Well, my hands weren't as dull
as I thought they were.

945
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:27,824
My reflexes weren't bad either.

946
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:31,411
I'm a third-year resident now,
so I should know how to do that much.

947
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:34,247
(scoffs)

948
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:37,917
You're late.

949
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:39,461
Sorry?

950
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:41,629
When I was your age,

951
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:44,049
I did everything
from a hemoperitoneum to a panperitonitis

952
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:45,258
in my last residential years.

953
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:47,469
Back in my day,

954
00:55:47,552 --> 00:55:50,305
a single mesentery,
assisted by a professor...

955
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:52,182
(exhales deeply)

956
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:55,310
That was nothing to write home about.
(chuckles)

957
00:55:57,228 --> 00:55:59,397
So you're a "when I was your age"
kind of person too.

958
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:03,401
Hey, everyone has
their own "when I was your age" stories.

959
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:07,364
I wouldn't be here today
if not for those experiences.

960
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:08,281
Don't you think so?

961
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:09,949
Right.

962
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:13,244
So...

963
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:15,872
keep that in mind.

964
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:19,918
Today will be one of your many...

965
00:56:20,668 --> 00:56:22,379
"when I was your age" stories.

966
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:24,631
(Sabu clears throat)

967
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:28,134
(calm music)

968
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:29,928
SABU: You did well today.

969
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:44,359
GENERAL SURGERY RESIDENT
JANG DONGHWA

970
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:56,162
CHIEF OF SURGERY
MASTER KIM

971
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:59,791
Nurse Oh, why haven't you gone home yet?

972
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:02,085
Can you make me some coffee?

973
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:07,715
All right then. Let's go in.
(chuckles)

974
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,596
(sighs)

975
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:17,934
We've been through
all sorts of situations now, haven't we?

976
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:20,061
I guess it's become that kind of era.

977
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:23,857
Even as we speak,

978
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:26,067
there are women and children dying

979
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:28,528
because of war somewhere

980
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:32,740
and thousands of people are dying
because of earthquakes somewhere else.

981
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:37,078
We've seen a whole city
flooded by natural disasters

982
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:43,418
and the whole world on lockdown
because of an infectious disease too.

983
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:48,256
At this point,
the world has become a place

984
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:51,968
where anything can happen
and we wouldn't find it unrealistic.

985
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:55,847
Now,

986
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:59,392
-we have to prepare...
-(coffee sloshing)

987
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,603
...for that kind of world.

988
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:04,230
Next, you'll be saying
you'll save the world.

989
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:08,151
They say saving one person
is like saving a universe, Ms. Oh.

990
00:58:08,526 --> 00:58:09,402
(chuckles)

991
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:21,247
How is...

992
00:58:23,082 --> 00:58:24,167
your arm?

993
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:25,084
(soft chuckle)

994
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:29,130
I was a little slow at work in the OR,
wasn't I?

995
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:34,093
I was performing
an open cardiac in the other OR

996
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:35,887
and I overdid it. That's all.

997
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:38,473
There's nothing to worry about.

998
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,516
(chuckles)

999
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:43,353
Today,

1000
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:46,648
after watching
Professor Cha Jinman's surgery,

1001
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:49,609
I understood
that Director Park's stubbornness

1002
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:52,487
wasn't what brought him here.

1003
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:54,572
I told you that was the case.

1004
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:56,032
(chuckles)

1005
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:58,451
-Master Kim.
-SABU: Yes?

1006
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:01,496
How far...

1007
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:04,457
has your condition progressed?

1008
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:07,919
I need to hear an answer today.

1009
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:10,004
(pensive music)

1010
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:15,718
(Sabu sighs)

1011
00:59:19,138 --> 00:59:20,765
-NURSE: You did great, Dr. Cha.
-You too.

1012
00:59:24,435 --> 00:59:26,437
-Hey.
-EUNJAE: Are you going home?

1013
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:27,814
Do you want to go home together?

1014
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:30,233
We're eating fried chicken
in the medical office.

1015
00:59:31,025 --> 00:59:31,901
At this hour?

1016
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:33,111
(chuckles)

1017
00:59:33,444 --> 00:59:35,822
If your mother hears this,
she'll be furious.

1018
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:41,494
By the way, are you upset

1019
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:44,205
because I missed the rib fracture

1020
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:46,457
in the pneumothorax patient?

1021
00:59:48,209 --> 00:59:49,335
If that's the case,

1022
00:59:49,877 --> 00:59:52,171
my advice wasn't wrong.

1023
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:54,549
That patient was a special case.

1024
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:57,927
Normally, if there's little
to no pneumothorax,

1025
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:00,430
you don't put in tubes on both sides.

1026
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:03,516
And there aren't many cases
where it gets to hypertension.

1027
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:09,105
Then it'll be a case
of excessive medical treatment.

1028
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,691
Yes, that's usually the case.

1029
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:14,819
But this is a trauma center, right?

1030
01:00:17,822 --> 01:00:19,449
SABU: That's usually the case.

1031
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:21,826
But this is the trauma center.

1032
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:25,246
EUNJAE: Here in the trauma center,
no treatment is excessive.

1033
01:00:25,913 --> 01:00:28,625
It's a place where you have to do
everything you can to save a patient.

1034
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:33,546
I spent the past three years
learning that from Master Kim.

1035
01:00:36,924 --> 01:00:38,468
You didn't miss it, Professor Cha.

1036
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:40,428
I missed it.

1037
01:00:46,684 --> 01:00:47,685
Get home safe.

1038
01:00:58,488 --> 01:00:59,656
You're brilliant, Eunjae.

1039
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:08,456
Wonyoung...

1040
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:12,085
was my best friend since middle school.

1041
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:15,588
He was a great guy,

1042
01:01:16,547 --> 01:01:20,885
but after befriending Seokgu,
he began doing terrible things.

1043
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:24,931
Then he got ahold of drugs...

1044
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:28,059
that he never should have touched.

1045
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,146
Do you feel...

1046
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:35,566
guilty about his death?

1047
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:40,071
I'm not sure.

1048
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:43,282
Whether it's guilt...

1049
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:45,660
or remorse.

1050
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:51,666
(inhales deeply)
Regardless, my friend died

1051
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:55,294
and I went astray for a while
before I got into a car accident.

1052
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:57,463
That's when I was brought here,

1053
01:01:58,172 --> 01:01:59,757
to Doldam Hospital.

1054
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:01,384
Nurse Euntak,

1055
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:03,886
you were a patient here?

1056
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:05,596
At Doldam Hospital?

1057
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,682
That's how it started.

1058
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:12,603
After I met Master Kim,
I came to my senses.

1059
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:16,065
(sighs)
Perhaps Wonyoung couldn't stand

1060
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:18,317
seeing me being a mess,

1061
01:02:18,484 --> 01:02:20,194
so he sent me here.

1062
01:02:20,945 --> 01:02:22,697
I get that thought sometimes.

1063
01:02:25,491 --> 01:02:26,409
I see.

1064
01:02:30,955 --> 01:02:31,956
You're...

1065
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:34,959
disappointed, aren't you?

1066
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:37,378
By what?

1067
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:38,796
By my past,

1068
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:42,341
my friends from then,

1069
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:46,429
going astray, the accident, and so on.

1070
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:53,728
At one point,

1071
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:56,606
I used to stutter.

1072
01:02:58,733 --> 01:02:59,817
In middle school,

1073
01:03:00,526 --> 01:03:03,321
I was bullied by my best friend.

1074
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:09,035
I once stole my mom's money too.

1075
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:13,915
There were shoes I really wanted,
but she didn't buy them for me.

1076
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:16,292
I was an unruly teenager...

1077
01:03:17,543 --> 01:03:20,254
and playing make-believe became a hobby.

1078
01:03:21,672 --> 01:03:23,966
As a result, I used to be called a freak

1079
01:03:24,592 --> 01:03:26,511
and a nutjob.

1080
01:03:31,015 --> 01:03:32,308
Are you disappointed...

1081
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:34,268
in me?

1082
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:37,063
No, I'm not.

1083
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:41,275
I believe that without a past,
you don't have a present.

1084
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,111
If you love the present,

1085
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:46,906
there's no past you can't understand.

1086
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:53,329
I like the present Nurse Euntak.

1087
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:56,082
(soft music)

1088
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:01,295
(phone vibrates)

1089
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:04,340
What?

1090
01:04:04,423 --> 01:04:06,843
It's Dr. Cha. She says come quickly.

1091
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:09,762
Okay.

1092
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:12,265
-INSU: Eat. Let's eat.
-(paper bags rustling)

1093
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:13,599
-AREUM: What?
-MUNJEONG: Oh, hey!

1094
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:14,684
-SEONUNG: Hey.
-INSU: Hello.

1095
01:04:14,767 --> 01:04:18,229
Welcome, Dr. Yoon Areum and Nurse Euntak.

1096
01:04:18,312 --> 01:04:20,273
AREUM: Dr. Jung, it's been so long!

1097
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:23,484
23 bus passengers?

1098
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:24,944
And you managed all that.

1099
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:27,572
-I'm so proud of you.
-Thank you.

1100
01:04:28,489 --> 01:04:29,782
HOJUN: What is this good smell?

1101
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:32,243
Whoa! Fried chicken?

1102
01:04:32,326 --> 01:04:34,120
For everyone,
since they had a hard day today...

1103
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:36,289
Did you pay for it?

1104
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:38,708
-No, Dr. Seo Woojin did.
-Oh, I see.

1105
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:39,917
Enjoy, everyone.

1106
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:42,336
-Thank you!
-Thank you.

1107
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:45,590
Gosh, it tastes really good too.

1108
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:47,717
(relaxing music)

1109
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:52,221
I was worried because of the snow

1110
01:04:52,638 --> 01:04:55,600
but thankfully, things were pretty calm
and quiet at the hospital, right?

1111
01:04:55,683 --> 01:04:57,101
(music fades dramatically)

1112
01:04:58,227 --> 01:05:01,480
Or was the Trauma Center in shambles
because of the GSW patient?

1113
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:04,191
Dr. Yang Hojun, what's your MBTI?

1114
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:06,319
(groans)
I don't believe in that kind of thing.

1115
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:07,570
It doesn't sit well with me.

1116
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:09,864
You're so...

1117
01:05:09,947 --> 01:05:11,490
INSU: Eat up.

1118
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:14,994
Shall we make a drumstick toast
to celebrate all of us gathering here?

1119
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:16,370
-Sure!
-Let's do that.

1120
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:19,290
Let's congratulate Dr. Jang Donghwa
on his mesentery operation

1121
01:05:19,373 --> 01:05:21,876
and Dr. Lee
on his first operation! Congratulations!

1122
01:05:21,959 --> 01:05:22,793
Thank you!

1123
01:05:23,294 --> 01:05:24,462
ALL: Congratulations!

1124
01:05:24,545 --> 01:05:26,339
Congratulations. You did well.

1125
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:28,049
Thank you very much!

1126
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:30,968
By the way,

1127
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:34,055
-wasn't I kind of cool earlier?
-What do you mean?

1128
01:05:34,138 --> 01:05:37,099
The way I stood in front of the patient
to protect him.

1129
01:05:37,975 --> 01:05:38,851
I didn't see that.

1130
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:40,186
(sighs)

1131
01:05:40,311 --> 01:05:42,313
You should've seen it.

1132
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:45,191
I was really cool.
(clicks tongue)

1133
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:46,275
That's too bad.

1134
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:54,825
(soft chuckle)

1135
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:56,827
WOOJIN: Did you know?

1136
01:05:56,911 --> 01:05:58,454
(all laughing)

1137
01:05:58,537 --> 01:05:59,497
WOOJIN: To me,

1138
01:06:00,581 --> 01:06:02,959
every day at Doldam Hospital...

1139
01:06:04,585 --> 01:06:05,795
is a spring day.

1140
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:12,176
(laughter in distance)

1141
01:06:14,762 --> 01:06:15,721
(soft chuckle)

1142
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:20,935
(soft chuckle)

1143
01:06:23,187 --> 01:06:25,314
My gosh, you could have come tomorrow.
(chuckles)

1144
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:26,941
You didn't have to with all that snow.

1145
01:06:27,024 --> 01:06:29,485
I stopped by on my way home from work.

1146
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:32,279
It's from the court,
so I thought it was important.

1147
01:06:32,363 --> 01:06:33,864
-From the court?
-POSTMAN: Yes.

1148
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:35,324
The court?

1149
01:06:37,118 --> 01:06:38,119
One moment.

1150
01:06:45,292 --> 01:06:47,461
-(tense music)
-Master Kim!

1151
01:06:48,295 --> 01:06:49,547
Master Kim!

1152
01:06:50,131 --> 01:06:52,091

1153
01:06:55,803 --> 01:06:57,680

PLEASE DON'T THROW

Oh, hello.

1161
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:27,460
A package for you.
(chuckles)

1162
01:07:27,543 --> 01:07:28,711
Thank you.

1163
01:07:28,794 --> 01:07:29,962
Keep up the good work.

1164

-SEONUNG: Thank you.
-No problem!

1165

01:08:36,695 --> 01:08:37,947
Call both of them.

1170
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:39,323
GITAE: A decrepit building collapsed

1171
01:08:39,406 --> 01:08:41,200
-in a redevelopment area.
-(siren blaring)

1172
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:42,785
BOY: Please help us!

1173
01:08:42,868 --> 01:08:44,787
WOOJIN: There are so many young students.

1174
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:46,914
EUNTAK: Chief Jang, let us out here.
We'll run from here.

1175
01:08:46,997 --> 01:08:47,873
SABU: Director Park, we'll need you...

1176
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:50,167
-This way!
-...to help out in the trauma center.

1177
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:51,919
-SABU: Pick up the phone.
-(line ringing)

1178
01:08:52,002 --> 01:08:53,212
-Pick up.

1179
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:54,463

1181
