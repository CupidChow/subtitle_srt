DR. ROMANTIC SEASON 3

3
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:45,962
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS, AND
EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE WORKS OF FICTION

4
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,548
(suspenseful music)

5
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,889
SELF-SERVICE GAS STATION

6
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,561
WILDFIRE SPREADS WITH STRONG WINDS,
DIFFICULTY IN EXTINGUISHING FIRE

7
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,319
(siren wailing in the distance)

8
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:13,698
EPISODE 15

9
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,869
(siren wailing continues)

10
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,039
(horns honking)

11
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,379
(sighs)
I was going to go home and get some rest.

12
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,135
(upbeat music)

13
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:52,070
DOLDAM

14
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:52,987
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,659
SIM HYEJIN

16
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:09,587
(helicopter blades whirring)

17
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,469
So what's the situation right now?

18
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,972
Several firefighters
who were putting out the fire

19
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,765
and workers
at the chemical fertilizer plant

20
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,977
are heading
to the Trauma Center right now.

21
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,061
But there is no one

22
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,564
at the Trauma Center at the moment.

23
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,274
Also,

24
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:34,821
there's someone here
from the Ministry of Health and Welfare.

25
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,491
(sighs)

26
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,494
TREATMENT FROM THE HEART
HOPE, LOVE, SERVICE

27
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,955
This is an emergency, Dr. Kang.

28
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:47,333
Bring the Trauma Center staff
who are on strike in the lounge right now.

29
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,295
(breathes heavily)

30
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,798
Look how the Ministry of Health
and Welfare sent someone.

31
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:57,677
Also, the provincial budget officer
is watching us like a hawk.

32
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,845
Right now of all times!

33
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,889
Do you think I can make any negotiations?

34
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:03,308
You should at least go
beg on your knees if you can't.

35
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:06,269
Aren't you prepared to do that much
as the future head of the Trauma Center?

36
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,479
Why should I have to grovel?

37
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,441
And I haven't seen anyone
be convinced by such tactics either.

38
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,695
This is why you were blindsided
by Assemblywoman Ko Kyungsook.

39
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,159
I'm sorry.

40
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:22,076
Ms. Ko!

41
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,040
(sighs)

42
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,172
(sighs)

43
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:35,798
(line ringing)

44
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,051
OPERATOR: The number you have dialed
cannot be reached…

45
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:46,100
What? Why are you here?

46
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,813
Didn't you get the emergency text?
(pants)

47
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:51,731
It's a forest fire.

48
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:54,567
Those who were injured
while putting it out will be here soon.

49
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:57,028
So what? What do you want from us?

50
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,947
Don't you see we're on strike right now?

51
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:00,823
I do.

52
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,700
Then shut up and get out.

53
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:06,037
Our rights are
just as important as survival.

54
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,288
I know that.

55
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,792
I also know why you're doing this.

56
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:15,213
The patients always take priority
over our rights.

57
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:19,384
And our desperate voices
only sound selfish to the world.

58
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,095
And whenever that happens,

59
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:24,430
we wonder,
"What are we devoting ourselves for?"

60
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:25,974
WOOJIN: We get hurt,

61
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,393
become dejected, and feel doubtful.

62
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,103
WOOJIN: I know all that.

63
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,105
But,

64
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:34,482
we can…

65
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,735
keep fighting.

66
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,364
The trauma patients arriving soon

67
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:44,117
can't fight without us.

68
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:45,827
Without us,

69
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:49,914
they don't have a future.

70
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,417
HOJUN: Hey.

71
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,043
We're not refusing to treat patients.

72
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,545
We will treat them.

73
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,298
So, go tell Kang Dongju
to come and kneel before us.

74
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,341
Why are we the only ones
considering the patients?

75
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,302
If Kang Dongju
also considers the patients,

76
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:05,221
he should come and kneel
before us first. Isn't that right?

77
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,347
(sighs)
Hojun.

78
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,893
That can only mean that you want to
use patients for your pride.

79
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:12,520
WOOJIN: In the meantime,

80
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,064
our colleagues will have to
work that much harder.

81
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,608
Someone has to fill in

82
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,153
the lack of medical care.

83
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:25,825
YEONGMI: Ms. Oh.

84
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,952
I think we might have to go on strike.

85
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:29,787
You will join us, won't you?

86
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:34,500
No, I don't think I can join you.

87
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:35,752
Why not?

88
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,963
Weren't you on our side?

89
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:42,550
Of course. I'm always on your side.

90
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:46,888
But for you to step away
from your jobs more comfortably,

91
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:50,558
someone will have to
stay here and work your parts too.

92
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:52,101
MYEONGSIM: We're fighting against

93
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:55,813
the unjust system, not the patients.

94
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:04,489
But still, don't hesitate
to make your voice heard.

95
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:09,118
A society where you can't make
your voice heard is a sick one.

96
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,288
Go and confidently say your piece.

97
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,291
I will try my best to fill the places

98
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,461
that you guys leave behind.

99
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,754
Okay?

100
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:21,756
Ms. Oh.

101
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,188
Let's go back now.

102
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,193
It's not just any emergency.

103
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:43,820
It's a disaster situation.

104
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:48,032
I don't think it's right
to put this all on Ms. Oh.

105
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:52,245
HOJUN: Ms. Joo.

106
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,163
You can't back down now.

107
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,249
HOJUN: We're all in this together.

108
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,126
Those who want to stay can do so.

109
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:02,463
Let's respect each other
no matter what decision we make.

110
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,924
EUNJAE: So you shouldn't try
to force anyone either.

111
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:07,051
Just like how gathering here was
a free choice,

112
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:10,012
I think going back should be
up to each person too.

113
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:11,514
(sighs)

114
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:27,905
(laughs softly)

115
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,577
(tense music)

116
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:37,331
SABU: Hey.

117
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,418
All right. You've all heard, right?

118
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,712
There are a total of 20 casualties
due to the fire

119
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,173
according to the report.

120
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,426
But there might be twice as many injured.

121
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,011
SABU: Let's all be prepared.

122
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,429
Hand me one of those.

123
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:54,307
Ms. Eom.

124
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:58,102
Let's be prepared for the patients
who have inhaled toxic fumes and gases.

125
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,314
SABU: Get ready with the high-flow
and prepare as much oxygen as possible.

126
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:02,732
HYEONJEONG: Yes, Master.

127
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,986
By the way, the Trauma Center asked us
to send some staff over.

128
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,779
No, I don't think they need us.

129
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:12,825
What? But apparently,
there's no staff at the center and--

130
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,285
No, they'll be fine.

131
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,496
Oh, okay, then.

132
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:32,845
(sirens wailing)

133
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,107
-(doors open)
-PARAMEDIC: We have patients!

134
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,079
Sir?

135
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,207
Paramedic Heo.

136
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,416
MYEONGSIM: Paramedic Heo.

137
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:05,711
Captain Heo and Paramedic Kim
were crushed by a falling structure

138
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,672
while helping people evacuate.

139
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:10,550
PARAMEDIC: Captain Heo's vitals are
110/70 and 96.

140
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,344
-And Paramedic Kim?
-It's 90/60 and 120.

141
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:17,598
Ms. Oh, have we heard back
from Doldam about the backup request?

142
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:20,059
I told them it was urgent,
so they should be joining us soon.

143
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,067
They'll have lots of patients
themselves too.

144
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,985
Sir?

145
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,697
You'll have to explain
this situation later on, Dr. Kang.

146
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,116
Let's talk about it
once we're safely past this situation.

147
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,581
Hurry and move them to the trauma bay!

148
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,583
(clamoring)

149
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,795
Please make way!

150
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,171
Please move faster!

151
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,049
A total mess.

152
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:56,470
Everything is a total mess.

153
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,307
(clamoring continues)

154
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,769
This way.

155
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,439
Dr. Seo!

156
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:07,565
(pants)

157
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,033
(gasps)

158
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,785
Tell me about
the patients' conditions first.

159
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:23,414
Paramedics Heo and Kim
were crushed underneath the wreckage

160
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:25,374
that fell in the fire
while rescuing people.

161
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,544
MYEONGSIM: Paramedic Heo is unconscious
and Paramedic Kim's vitals aren't good.

162
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,671
Paramedic Choi was hit by a car
that was backing up.

163
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,214
I suspect he has multiple injuries.

164
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,883
Paramedic Choi is in cardiac arrest!

165
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,176
PARAMEDIC 2: CPR!

166
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,511
Move the beds to the back!

167
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,848
-Please move this bed!
-(clamoring)

168
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:41,974
YEONGMI: This way.

169
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,851
I'll take Captain Heo to the trauma bay!

170
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,145
WOOJIN: Let's move the others
to the observation area.

171
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,565
This way to the observation area.

172
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:53,694
YEONGMI: Yes, that way.

173
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:00,993
I hope you're not misunderstanding.

174
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:01,911
About what?

175
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,872
That you were moved by my surgery?

176
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:06,624
Or that you came here?

177
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:09,794
Just because I'm back
doesn't mean I will compromise.

178
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:14,256
The staff came back
for the patients and our colleagues.

179
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,676
We don't intend to gloss over the problem.

180
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,220
Don't get the wrong idea.

181
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,348
(tense music)

182
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,391
(scoffs)

183
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:39,865
(upbeat music)

184
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:49,291
VOLUME 15
THE GAME CHANGER

185
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,169
-(slurping)
-SEONUNG: Mmm.

186
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,130
By the way, Dr. Jang,

187
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,090
when is your rotation over?

188
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:59,510
Doesn't a resident's rotation
last about four months?

189
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:00,428
That's about right.

190
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,597
When it's over,
will you go back to Keosan?

191
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,182
Yes, I guess.

192
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:06,976
(slurps)

193
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,937
Keep eating. I'm just grabbing some water.

194
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,447
You need to eat while you can
to be able to keep going.

195
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,115
This is a battle of stamina.

196
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,992
-Yes, Ms. Eom.
-(chuckles)

197
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:24,744
(Seonung laughs)

198
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,165
-I'll go first. Take your time.
-Wait, but…

199
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:30,791
Hey, wait.

200
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,376
-Why is he…
-(door opens)

201
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,754
(slurps)

202
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,130
(indistinct clamoring)

203
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,506
NURSE 1: Here comes a patient.

204
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,008
NURSE 2: Coming through.

205
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,644
NURSE 3: Thank you. Out of the way!

206
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:51,729
Out of the way.

207
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,564
NURSE 4: Wait.

208
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:57,985
NURSE 3: Out of the way.

209
00:12:58,527 --> 00:12:59,737
NURSE 4: That's…

210
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:06,494
DONGHWA: How did you become
Master Kim then?

211
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,412
Someone

212
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,415
started calling me that.

213
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:15,961
She was the first pupil Master Kim met
during his heyday.

214
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,713
Her name was Jang Hyunju.

215
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:25,054
HYUNJU'S COMPILATION

216
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,726
PARAMEDIC 3: We have a patient!

217
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,228
(tense music)

218
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,106
Is he a burn victim?

219
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,067
He works at the factory.
He can't breathe well.

220
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,276
PARAMEDIC 3: He inhaled a lot of smoke.

221
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,903
-Okay, this way.
-PARAMEDIC 3: All right.

222
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,449
Breathe out.

223
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,159
(coughs)

224
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,247
SEONUNG: In one, two, three!

225
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,757
(wheezes)

226
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,093
This sounds really bad.

227
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,803
(patient's wheezing continues)

228
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,638
My eyes hurt too.

229
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,183
They're burning.

230
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,853
It could be because of the smoke.
Don't rub your eyes.

231
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:16,939
Oh.

232
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,441
DONGHWA: I think this patient was burned.

233
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,445
What? Where? His clothes look fine.

234
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:26,323
DONGHWA: Right here.

235
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,710
Dr. Ung. What's wrong?

236
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:39,795
Dr. Ung?

237
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:45,676
Well, the thing is…

238
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,346
I actually…

239
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,140
One moment.

240
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:56,186
Sir, how did you get hurt?

241
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,314
PATIENT: I don't know.
(wheezes)

242
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,440
I think I hurt myself

243
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,525
while escaping.

244
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:06,614
I'm sorry.

245
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:10,618
I need a minute.

246
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:24,214
Where do you work?

247
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:25,841
The chemical fertilizer plant?

248
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,635
Yes.

249
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:32,139
The firefighters are spraying water
where the chemical tanks are.

250
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:34,141
I believe there haven't been
any gas leaks.

251
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,602
What kind of chemicals do they have there?

252
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:39,605
PARAMEDIC 3: We were warned
about accidents from hydrogen fluoride.

253
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,941
It was diluted,
but they did use hydrofluoric gas.

254
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,235
It sounds bad.

255
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:46,820
SABU: Dr. Jang.

256
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,240
Wash out his eyes with saline first,

257
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,450
irrigate his whole body,

258
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:52,618
and have him change.

259
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,328
The whole body?

260
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:56,914
Washing the patient is priority
in cases of hydrofluoric gas exposure.

261
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:57,831
Hurry up.

262
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,542
Yes. I'll need some saline.
Let's wash out his eyes first.

263
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:02,878
Dr. Yoon.

264
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:04,713
Yes, Master?

265
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,507
Figure out how many patients there are

266
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,802
who came from the fertilizer plant.

267
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:10,886
Yes, Master.

268
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:14,473
PARAMEDIC 3: Sir, I think chemical gases
have been leaked at the plant.

269
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:19,770
-(dial tone)
-Mr. Jang, it's me.

270
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:23,816
Set up a decontamination and detox tent
outside the hospital right now.

271
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,693
And tell the paramedics

272
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:29,905
to have people from the plant
go through there first

273
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,992
before they enter the ER.
Please get the word out.

274
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:34,952
Yes.

275
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:36,537
Okay. Bye.

276
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,585
CONSULTATION ROOM 3

277
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,299
(soft music)

278
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:52,594
(grunts)

279
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,275
(sniffles)

280
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:10,946
What was wrong with Dr. Ung just now?

281
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:12,448
I don't know.

282
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,783
I was telling him about the burn
and he suddenly went like…

283
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:18,203
He acted all flustered and then left.

284
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:21,540
Does he have indigestion?
His face was as white as a sheet.

285
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,586
-DONGHWA: Master Kim didn't say a word.
-HYEONJEONG: Why?

286
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,546
DONGHWA: If I ran off,
he would've yelled at me.

287
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:29,965
HYEONJEONG: Were you told off before?

288
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:31,842
DONGHWA: No.

289
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,347
(soft music)

290
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,768
I'll take a five-minute break.

291
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,037
What's going on?

292
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,372
Something is wrong, isn't it?

293
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,711
Actually,

294
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,340
I told him I wanted to break up.

295
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,425
Really?

296
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:18,764
I mean, you really did that?

297
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:20,641
You told me to give it a go.

298
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:23,477
You said that would make
Nurse Euntak come to his senses.

299
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,025
-Would you like some coffee?
-Yes.

300
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,238
HYEONJEONG: So, coffee…

301
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,240
Which one do you want?

302
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,079
So? What did he say?

303
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,414
Nothing.

304
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:48,001
What? He didn't say anything
when you said you wanted to break up?

305
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,462
He didn't even react.

306
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,174
I don't think he was fazed at all.

307
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:56,301
AREUM: What do I do, Ms. Eom?

308
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:57,803
I think…

309
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,558
we might be really over.
(cries)

310
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,434
HYEONJEONG: But…

311
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,320
PARAMEDIC 4: We have a patient!

312
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,827
-In front of the ICU.
-PARAMEDIC 5: Okay.

313
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,036
Let's go.

314
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,371
That way, please.

315
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,251
Excuse me.

316
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:32,421
Please grab a stand
and start an IV for him.

317
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:37,426
Hey, I'm in a lot of pain.
When will you treat me?

318
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,052
We have a lot of urgent patients.

319
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,512
I'm in a lot of pain too!

320
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,890
Look.

321
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,225
I'm hurt too. I'm a patient too.

322
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,728
I'm sorry, but could you wait
a little longer?

323
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,438
PATIENT 2: Hey.

324
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:50,939
Hey.

325
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,066
Darn it.

326
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,250
-DONGJU: Ms. Oh.
-Yes?

327
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,711
Why are the regular injuries here?

328
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:16,465
They're getting
a lot of gas-exposure patients at Doldam.

329
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,635
We decided to take
the regular injuries here.

330
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:20,886
Who did?

331
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,095
WOOJIN: I did.

332
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:24,973
Let's check vitals.

333
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,186
I thought I said
we'll only take severe trauma cases.

334
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,813
I know, but there was an exception.

335
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:36,318
In case of disasters,
we can accept a wider range of patients.

336
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,779
Do you also know
we can't use the facilities and equipment

337
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,781
from the Trauma Center
for regular patients?

338
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:43,867
In cases of inevitable circumstances,
"like lacking emergency surgery facilities

339
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,035
beyond the Trauma Center,

340
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,912
or when doctors
who can use certain equipment

341
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:48,664
are only in the Trauma Center,

342
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,541
they make an exception."

343
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:53,585
Did that answer your question?

344
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,840
If you have more questions,
let's set a time to discuss them later.

345
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,343
I have an urgent patient right now.

346
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,726
See? I told you he was pretty good.

347
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,354
It sounds as if

348
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,691
-you're sticking up for your youngest son.
-(laughs)

349
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:21,280
I feel the same way
about all of the doctors here.

350
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:22,864
Including you, Dr. Kang.

351
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,743
I know you want to do well,

352
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:31,498
but I think
how you do well is also important.

353
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:35,377
MYEONGSIM: What we need now
isn't a single hero.

354
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,338
It's a leader who can unite us as one.

355
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:42,259
"Follow my lead!"
You should stop doing that.

356
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,429
You should be a leader
who can tell people to join you.

357
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,765
The work that we do

358
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,685
is impossible
without everyone's cooperation.

359
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:53,687
NURSE 5: Ms. Oh, the trauma bay.

360
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,689
Okay. I'll be right there.

361
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,503
(sirens wailing)

362
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:22,674
PARAMEDIC 5: We have a patient!

363
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,396
(whimsical music)

364
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,454
Are you looking for someone?

365
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,122
My dad.

366
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:00,837
-(tense music)
-(Insu pants)

367
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,595
-Let's check his rhythm.
-(flatlining)

368
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:10,389
(Insu pants)

369
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,015
Compressions!

370
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,320
EUNJAE: Ms. Oh, please connect the bottle.

371
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,201
NURSE 6: Dr. Cha,
I have Master Kim on the line.

372
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,286
EUNJAE: Master.

373
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:36,373
I just sent Captain Heo's brain CT.
Did you see them?

374
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:37,958
Who? Captain Heo?

375
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,669
You mean our Paramedic Heo?

376
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:43,964
EUNJAE: Yes, he has multiple bleeding
in his chest and abdomen.

377
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:45,715
The hemoperitoneum isn't bad,

378
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,467
but I think his right diaphragm
is slightly elevated

379
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,261
and there is some fluid.

380
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:52,472
EUNJAE: I'm trying to take care of
the massive hemothorax first,

381
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:55,267
but the brain CT seems to show an IVH.

382
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:59,104
(sighs)
You're right. It's an IVH.

383
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:00,856
How are his pupils?

384
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:05,068
EUNJAE: They're both 3 mm and prompt.

385
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:09,281
Then let's just keep an eye
on his brain condition

386
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,783
and take care of the hemothorax quickly.

387
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,369
EUNJAE: The IVH could increase
during surgery, right?

388
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:17,205
I'll let Dr. Nam Doil know,

389
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,915
so take care of the hemothorax first.

390
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,500
EUNJAE: Yes, Master.

391
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:23,670
Ms. Oh, please ask Dr. Nam
to get us an OR.

392
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:27,299
Call Dr. Ung and Dr. Seo
for the GS combined surgery.

393
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:28,383
Yes, Doctor.

394
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,178
Dr. Seo is handling
another emergency patient now.

395
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,846
I'll do the combined surgery.

396
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:35,807
(tense music)

397
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:38,268
(Eunjae sighs)

398
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:42,439
Ms. Oh, please ask
if Director Park can come.

399
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:45,192
Didn't you hear me say
that I'll do the surgery, Dr. Cha?

400
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:50,113
I'm not comfortable with that.

401
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,080
Deal with it, then.

402
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:02,334
Dr. Cha.

403
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:05,170
Paramedic Heo is our priority.

404
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:06,838
MYEONGSIM: Right?

405
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,758
INSU: Let's check the rhythm!

406
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:14,054
-(pants)
-(flatlines)

407
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,097
One more time.

408
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:18,642
Let's go one more time.

409
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,685
Compressions!

410
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:25,440
(Insu pants)

411
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,452
How long has it been?

412
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:39,704
NURSE 7: It's been 30 minutes now.

413
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,709
-Insu.
-Please.

414
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:47,629
Please. You can do this.

415
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:49,130
INSU: Inchul.

416
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,967
You're still young!

417
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:53,718
Inchul.

418
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:57,639
Let's check the rhythm.

419
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,683
-(pants)
-(flatlines)

420
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,059
Compressions!

421
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,233
(exhales)

422
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,445
That's enough.

423
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:15,115
(pants)

424
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:25,125
-(solemn music)
-(breathes shakily)

425
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:38,513
(exhales)

426
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:47,647
The time of death…

427
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,111
is 21:09.

428
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:58,116
INSU (voice breaking):
Paramedic Choi Inchul…

429
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,455
has passed away.

430
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:10,837
(sniffles)

431
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:25,477
(paramedics cry)

432
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:35,820
PARAMEDIC 1: Inchul!

433
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,492
PARAMEDIC 3: Inchul!

434
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:48,833
Dr. Cha, Paramedic Heo's family is here.

435
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:52,295
Let's get their consent for surgery first.

436
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:53,797
But the thing is,

437
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:55,674
they're his kids.

438
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:06,101
What do you mean?

439
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,103
Why can't we get an OR right away?

440
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,397
Dr. Lee in anesthesiology has the day off.

441
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,023
He went to visit his family.

442
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:15,652
He's in Sokcho, and it'll take
at least two hours to get back.

443
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:18,571
And if the road conditions
aren't great with the forest fire,

444
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,532
it might take even longer.

445
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,660
How long do you think
your surgery will take?

446
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:26,037
Paramedic Heo is in
very bad shape right now.

447
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,831
He has a hemothorax, a hemoperitoneum,

448
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:29,749
and even an IVH.

449
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,418
He has to be observed for that too.

450
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,213
Paramedic Kim's abdomen
is continuing to swell too.

451
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:37,549
WOOJIN: We can't delay any longer.

452
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:41,094
And he even had a stent put in
for an unstable angina last year.

453
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:43,638
He takes aspirin too, wow.

454
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:45,807
What's going on?

455
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,684
I didn't expect you to be here
until next week.

456
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:51,479
I know, right?
As soon as I get back from my sabbatical,

457
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:54,274
-I'm right back on the battlefield.
-(laughs)

458
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:55,942
Have you been well, Dr. Nam?

459
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:59,070
Thanks to you being gone,
I was busier than ever.

460
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,321
(laughs softly)

461
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,408
Hey, you look great.

462
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:05,577
HYEJIN: You didn't get married
while I was gone, did you?

463
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,706
-(soft music)
-(laughs softly)

464
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:11,499
Can you take a look first?

465
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:14,461
WOOJIN: It's a massive hemoperitoneum.
We should go in soon.

466
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:17,172
I don't think we have time
to check his heart condition.

467
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,383
He's taking aspirin,
so he will have bleeding tendencies.

468
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:23,052
Look at you changing the topic.
How suspicious.

469
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:25,972
Could we open the OR in 10 minutes?

470
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:28,558
I should've come back tomorrow.

471
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:32,687
Okay, fine.
I'll see you in OR One in 10 minutes.

472
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,231
(laughs)

473
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,901
She's the same as ever.
(chuckles)

474
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,487
Ms. Lee, let's move the patient.

475
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:45,450
(sighs)

476
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:57,212
What are you doing?
It's a mess out there. Why are you hiding?

477
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,755
I'm sorry.

478
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:02,091
I missed the signs
for the gas-exposure patient.

479
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,844
But to my eyes,

480
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,181
those burn marks weren't visible.

481
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:09,766
I'm sorry.

482
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,060
It's fine.

483
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:14,312
The initial diagnosis
for emergency patients

484
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:15,980
is the job of emergency physicians.

485
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,858
SABU: You were just trying to help

486
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,819
because it was a disaster situation.

487
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:25,114
Sure, you shouldn't miss
a patient's symptoms.

488
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:28,201
But Jang Donghwa was there, and so was I.

489
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:31,287
I became a doctor
because I wanted to help people.

490
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:34,290
I don't want to receive help.
(sniffles)

491
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,085
But I keep becoming a nuisance.

492
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,170
It feels terrible.

493
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,339
Hey.

494
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:46,094
I've never seen a newbie
who wasn't a nuisance.

495
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:48,888
And I've never seen anyone become
a specialist without making mistakes.

496
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:51,683
What if a patient suffers because of me?

497
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,562
That scares me so much.

498
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:01,901
So what? Will you quit being a doctor?

499
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:06,489
If that's not it, just keep doing
what you've been doing.

500
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:10,618
Besides, you've never been
confused in the OR.

501
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,996
SABU: You've never gotten
the wrong blood vessel or anything.

502
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:17,292
MUNJEONG: He was a little slow,
but he was precise.

503
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,712
It was his first surgery,
but he didn't hesitate.

504
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:24,299
That means

505
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:27,844
you worked so hard to get there.

506
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:31,097
Even I can see how hard you must've worked

507
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,100
to overcome your weakness
by looking at so many blood vessels,

508
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,728
familiarizing yourself with their shapes,

509
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,022
and memorizing their characteristics.

510
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:43,026
That weakness of yours

511
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:46,863
has made you who you are now.

512
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:52,619
So believe in the effort
that you've put in so far.

513
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:56,039
Don't be scared of making mistakes.

514
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:59,125
Don't be anxious
about how others might see you

515
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:01,961
or what they might think of you.

516
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:04,964
Hey.

517
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:07,425
Do you want to know a secret?

518
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:12,347
It's not other people's views of you
that make you.

519
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:17,060
It's your own views that make you. Okay?

520
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:18,436
Yes.

521
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:20,021
SABU: So,

522
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:24,150
praise yourself more
and be kind to yourself.

523
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:28,154
You're doing really well right now,
Dr. Lee Seonung.

524
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:30,406
(Sabu chuckles)

525
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:32,158
(sniffles)

526
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:37,080
Cha Eunjae is waiting for you
in the OR. You should get going.

527
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:39,707
Yes, sir.
(sniffles)

528
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,461
Hurry up and run over there.

529
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:44,712
Yes.

530
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:55,556
(sniffles)

531
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:57,350
(exhales)

532
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:20,915
SURGERY CONSENT FORM

533
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:26,170
MYEONGSIM (sighing): But they're so young.

534
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,340
Will they be able
to understand the situation?

535
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:34,429
Give it to me. I'll explain it to them.

536
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,612
Are you Paramedic Heo's son?

537
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:53,489
Yes.

538
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:55,283
Do you want to see your dad?

539
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,493
Dr. Kang.

540
00:33:58,077 --> 00:33:59,579
Paramedic Heo's condition right now

541
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:04,167
is not something a child should see.
He's in bad shape.

542
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,338
What do you want to do?

543
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,177
I want to see my dad.

544
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:17,847
(sighs)

545
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,570
What is it? Is something wrong?

546
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,948
(sighs)
I don't know.

547
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:38,117
What on earth is Dr. Kang doing?

548
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:58,471
Do you know

549
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:01,974
just how many people your dad has saved?

550
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,603
There are so many
that we can't even count them all.

551
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:09,982
Yejun.

552
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:14,403
This time, it's our turn to save your dad.

553
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,659
YEJUN: Is my dad…

554
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:23,579
going to live?

555
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:28,209
Do you see that doctor over there?

556
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:35,883
She's the best surgeon at our hospital.

557
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:38,136
DONGJU: I am sure

558
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,805
she will do her best for your dad.

559
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,852
Isn't that right, Dr. Cha?

560
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,272
Of course.
(laughs)

561
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:50,898
I will do my best.

562
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,209
I HAVE READ AND CONSENTED TO THE FOLLOWING

563
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:12,003
ATTENDING PHYSICIANS:
KANG DONGJU, CHA EUNJAE

564
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:15,506
RELATION: SON
HEO YEJUN

565
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:21,762
EUNJAE: Seriously, he sure has a way
of making people feel pressured.

566
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:25,224
DONGJU: Did you feel pressured?
I was only trying to cheer you on.

567
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:27,894
Dr. Cha,

568
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:30,354
you've improved a lot
compared to the past.

569
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:34,025
You always used to doze off
in the OR and fall over.

570
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,902
You'd have to be carried out.

571
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,322
I even had to yell at you once.

572
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,116
EUNJAE: That was ages ago.

573
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:46,621
I just didn't feel well for a while
during my residency.

574
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:47,914
You're still going on about that?

575
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,417
DONGJU: I got into a huge fight
with that guy once.

576
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,045
He thought I was too harsh on you.

577
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:57,548
You've been dating since then, right?

578
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:06,057
DONGJU: What will you do, Dr. Cha?

579
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:09,268
If you feel too pressured to do this,
I can call Master Kim now.

580
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:11,938
EUNJAE: No, I'll do it.

581
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,275
I'll save him, no matter what.

582
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,244
WOOJIN: Are you doing this on purpose?

583
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:27,328
DONGJU: What?

584
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:28,746
WOOJIN: Making people angry.

585
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,041
DONGJU: She wants to save him.
Isn't that what matters?

586
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,710
What's important
is the unwillingness to back down.

587
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:36,420
WOOJIN: So,

588
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,590
are you getting what you want?

589
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:45,346
DONGJU: I'm discovering what it is
that I actually want to get.

590
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,645
HYEJIN: Isn't that Kang Dongju?

591
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:55,731
MYEONGSIM: I guess you know him.

592
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:58,776
HYEJIN: I worked with him a few times
at Keosan University Hospital.

593
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,820
So he's back.

594
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:03,823
MYEONGSIM: And so are you, Professor Sim.

595
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,702
HYEJIN: Seeing this fine Trauma Center

596
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:10,288
being filled up by doctors

597
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:14,208
makes me think
Master Kim's picture is being finished.

598
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,544
MYEONGSIM (laughs): Do you think so?

599
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,594
NURSE 8: Dr. Seo, we're ready for surgery.

600
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,013
DONGJU: Good luck.

601
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:47,992
HYEJIN: The patient's current vitals
are 110/80 and 90.

602
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:51,662
He has an underlying unstable angina
and multiple severe injuries.

603
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,914
He's at higher risk
of complications from anesthesia.

604
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,583
So he can't be under
for too long, Dr. Seo.

605
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:58,544
WOOJIN: I know. I'll try to finish
in under two hours.

606
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:00,171
EUNJAE: Can we begin, Dr. Nam?

607
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,256
DOIL: Yes, you may begin.

608
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,135
-EUNJAE: Scalpel.
-WOOJIN: Scalpel.

609
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:09,180
(hopeful music)

610
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:18,230
MYEONGSIM: Is Master Kim's picture

611
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:22,276
being finished piece by piece?

612
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:25,571
DOIL: It's the picture

613
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:27,156
that we've all been dreaming of.

614
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,502
Yes, it sounds okay.

615
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,796
-Get some rest.
-PATIENT 3: Yes, Doctor.

616
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,005
Thank you.

617
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:56,268
-(tense music)
-(fire roaring)

618
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:03,484
GITAE: The beds are to the left!

619
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:05,444
-The beds are to the left!
-(sirens wailing)

620
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:08,864
GITAE: Those who can walk,
go to the right!

621
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:11,659
You have been exposed
to dangerous material.

622
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,411
-You must be decontaminated!
-(sirens wailing)

623
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,788
GITAE: The patients
from the chemical fertilizer plant

624
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:19,458
must enter the building
after they are decontaminated.

625
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,213
Are you from the fertilizer plant?

626
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:26,424
Please go to the decontamination tent.

627
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,634
You must go through that first.

628
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:31,554
Are you from the fertilizer plant?
Please go to the decontamination tent.

629
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:37,518
(groans)

630
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:42,148
(groans)

631
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:47,570
(groans)

632
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,160
(groans)

633
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:09,008
STAFF 1: The patient is coming out!

634
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:16,640
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

635
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,559
STAFF 2: Please make way.

636
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:21,645
Coming through.

637
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:25,608
HYEONJEONG: This way, please.

638
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,200
AREUM: Nurse Euntak.

639
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:37,912
Could you bring some more ointment?

640
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,580
EUNTAK: Yes, one second.

641
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:42,833
(soft music)

642
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:54,345
DONGHWA: Is Dr. Yoon really breaking up?

643
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:56,680
HYEONJEONG: It's not Dr. Yoon.
It's Nurse Euntak.

644
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,516
He seems to want to break up.

645
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:09,860
(Donghwa sighs)

646
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:12,404
(phone emergency alert rings)

647
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:15,533
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

648
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,872
STAFF 3: Aren't we in danger here too?

649
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,375
-(tense music)
-(wind howling)

650
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:37,763
(wind howling)

651
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,351
(siren wailing)

652
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,159
(hissing)

653
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:04,164
EUNJAE: Ung, can you pull down
the lung retractor more?

654
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,207
SEONUNG: Yes, Doctor.

655
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:07,126
I'm pulling it down.

656
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:10,671
-(tense music)
-(Eunjae exhales)

657
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:12,423
EUNJAE: What is this?

658
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,386
This is the liver.

659
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:20,889
The hemoperitoneum

660
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:22,850
must've been liver damage.

661
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,394
The blood from the liver
is leaking into the chest cavity

662
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:27,062
through the ruptured diaphragm.

663
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:29,440
The broken liver is herniating
into the chest cavity too.

664
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:31,066
DONGJU: Switch places. Get out of there!

665
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,860
EUNJAE: I'll open him up. Scalpel, please.

666
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:46,248
WOOJIN: Richardson.

667
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,350
WOOJIN: I need more gauze.

668
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:13,942
HYEJIN: Get some more blood.

669
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:15,361
And let's start another line.

670
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:17,488
Get a 16 gauge needle and a PMS ready.

671
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:18,489
NURSE 9: Yes, Doctor.

672
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:21,992
GITAE: Master Kim.

673
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:26,580
-(coughs)
-(indistinct chattering)

674
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:35,589
GITAE: Master Kim!

675
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:39,468
-GITAE: Master Kim.
-SABU: Ms. Eom,

676
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:43,138
please close this patient's wound
and give him diclofenac.

677
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:45,808
-Let me know if the pain persists.
-HYEONJEONG: Yes, Master.

678
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:47,434
SABU: What is it, Mr. Jang?

679
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,269
GITAE: Chief Park is here.

680
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:03,033
DONGJU: The liver is packed,
and the bleeding is subsiding.

681
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,326
So you don't need to rush.

682
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:08,997
He has a TBI as well.

683
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:10,999
There will be a high chance of TIC.

684
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:14,753
DOIL: His vitals aren't stable.

685
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:19,258
-Can we get more FFP for him?
-NURSE 9: Yes, Doctor.

686
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:23,220
(Doil exclaims softly)

687
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:29,893
CHIEF PARK: The wind has changed
direction.

688
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:33,689
The wind has changed direction?

689
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:36,108
What does that mean?

690
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:39,027
The wind was blowing to the east,
but it's now blowing southwest.

691
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:41,113
The direction of the fire is changing too.

692
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:43,949
But if it's heading southwest…

693
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:45,743
It'll be 30 minutes at the fastest.

694
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:48,078
At the latest,
the fire will reach Doldam Hospital

695
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:50,080
in 40 to 50 minutes.

696
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:53,041
GITAE: What do you mean by that?

697
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:56,336
The fire will reach Doldam Hospital?

698
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:58,255
Are you saying that Doldam Hospital

699
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,591
will catch on fire?

700
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:03,719
There hasn't been any rainfall
over the past month.

701
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:05,804
And the wind is blowing too strong.

702
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,056
CHIEF PARK: The fire is continuing
to spread,

703
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,142
and it's burning
everything down in its path

704
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:12,895
from the chemical fertilizer plant

705
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,606
to the nearby homes and stores.

706
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:18,066
GITAE: No way. It can't be.

707
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:21,862
We only just finished building
the Trauma Center, and it will burn down?

708
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:24,573
The firefighters will do our best
to keep it at bay,

709
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:26,658
but the forest fire is so vast

710
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:29,161
that we won't have
a lot of men to post here.

711
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:31,079
CHIEF PARK: I think

712
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:33,373
you should be prepared
for the worst-case scenario.

713
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,709
(tense music)

714
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:05,948
NURSE 10: Dr. Jang,
please take a look here.

715
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:06,990
Okay.

716
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:12,830
DONGHWA: Dr. Yoon, take a look at Bed Two.

717
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:15,415
Yes? One second.

718
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:19,628
(indistinct chatter)

719
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:22,381
MAN: Doctor, please help over here.

720
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:24,174
MR. KOO: Ms. Eom,
we're back from the X-ray.

721
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:25,092
Okay.

722
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:33,767
Put the bed here.

723
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:35,602
Ms. Joo, after you dress his wound,

724
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,896
-get an X-ray for this patient,
-YEONGMI: Yes, Doctor.

725
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,982
(groans)

726
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:46,822
(phone vibrates)

727
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:53,704
Hey, Doil.

728
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:56,206
DOIL: Master Kim, what do we do?

729
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,457
I just checked

730
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:00,711
and Paramedic Heo's pupil reflex
has become sluggish.

731
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:07,301
DONGJU: Bring a portable CT here quickly!

732
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:09,303
-EUNJAE: Cut.
-DONGJU: Cut.

733
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:13,682
DOIL: I don't think
we can delay any longer.

734
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:22,274
NAM DOIL

735
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:27,279
GITAE: Master Kim.

736
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:30,616
You must hurry.
The fire is going to reach here

737
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:33,243
like water rising in a flood.

738
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:35,871
Mr. Jang.

739
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,290
Call Director Park, please.

740
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:39,458
Got it.

741
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:44,129
Nurse Euntak.

742
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:46,715
-EUNTAK: Yes, Master.
-Come here.

743
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,012
Paramedic Heo is in surgery now
for multiple injuries.

744
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:53,305
He has an IVH.

745
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:57,351
I think I'll have to go
to the Trauma Center and operate.

746
00:48:58,101 --> 00:48:59,645
Will you do an EVD?

747
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:02,773
You should go ahead
and prepare for it first.

748
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,691
I'll be there in five minutes.

749
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:05,776
Yes, Doctor.

750
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:11,531
GITAE: Master Kim!
I have Director Park on the line.

751
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,951
Yes, Master Kim. Talk to me.

752
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:15,619
Yes.

753
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:17,287
Yes.

754
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:56,368
Great work today, Dr. Seo.

755
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:59,621
You haven't lost any speed
with only three fingers.

756
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:00,872
It's thanks to you both.

757
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:04,751
Hey, isn't that Master Kim?

758
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:09,673
DOIL: He's holding up.

759
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:13,260
Paramedic Heo had an IVH.
He must be here for that.

760
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:16,304
Does Master Kim operate on the brain too?

761
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,390
He's a neurosurgeon.

762
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:22,394
His specialty is in the spinal nerve,
so he usually doesn't work on the brain.

763
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:24,980
MYEONGSIM: But I guess
the situation has gotten urgent.

764
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:29,276
-(exhales)
-(phones vibrate)

765
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:33,280
(gasps)

766
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:34,781
(gasps)

767
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:38,785
(phones vibrate)

768
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:46,209
(phones vibrate)

769
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:00,390
(staff murmuring indistinctly)

770
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:02,476
What's this about
transferring the patients?

771
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:03,435
Why?

772
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,896
Why are we emptying out the hospital
all of a sudden?

773
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:07,147
But there are so many patients.

774
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,316
Everyone, don't be alarmed and listen.

775
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:13,445
The forest fire seems to be
headed to Doldam Hospital now.

776
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:16,198
It's heading to the hospital?

777
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:20,994
We must evacuate the patients
in Doldam's ER, ICU, and rooms

778
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:22,954
in 30 minutes.

779
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:25,165
MUNJEONG: Most of all,
we must maintain order

780
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:26,625
so we don't scare the patients.

781
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:28,085
If you seem flustered,

782
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:30,462
people will get hurt.
You know that, right?

783
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:31,713
ALL: Yes, Doctor.

784
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:34,800
The ICU patients who are out of surgery
will be taken to nearby hospitals

785
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:37,094
in ambulances where it is safe.

786
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:39,012
Patients in need of urgent care

787
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:41,348
will be taken
to Jeongseon's public health center.

788
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,975
And the rest of the patients
who are able to move on their own

789
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:47,395
will move to a safe evacuation site
where they will continue being treated.

790
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:49,606
How should we divide up the staff?

791
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,817
Yes, we'll do that.

792
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,444
Patients who just got out of surgery

793
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:56,905
will be marked by the doctors
who operated on them.

794
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:59,950
MYEONGSIM: The other Trauma Center staff
will go to the evacuation site.

795
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:03,745
The Doldam staff will go
to the public health center.

796
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:06,957
(sighs)
I sure picked a great day to come back.

797
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:09,042
I'll get going first.

798
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:12,754
-(Hyejin sighs)
-Professor Sim.

799
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:13,797
Yes?

800
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:17,676
(scoffs)
Okay, get going.

801
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:20,011
I'll stay with the patient.

802
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:22,097
Thank you.

803
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,515
Buy me a meal next time.

804
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:29,354
(tense music)

805
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:43,660
SABU: Dr. Kang.

806
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:45,787
How's it going with the liver?

807
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:49,082
DONGJU: The damaged part
has been taken care of by packing it.

808
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:52,002
SABU: How long do you think it'll take?

809
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:54,880
DONGJU: The mesentery is damaged too.

810
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:58,300
If we sort that out
and wrap up with a temporary closure,

811
00:52:58,383 --> 00:52:59,885
it will take about 20 minutes.

812
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:03,054
WOOJIN: Dr. Lee. Let's switch places.

813
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:04,389
SEONUNG: Yes, Doctor.

814
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:12,063
WOOJIN: I'll join you.

815
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:14,566
I can cut that time by five minutes.

816
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:18,069
SABU: All right.

817
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:19,863
We'll begin too.

818
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:21,114
DOIL (in English): Okay.

819
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:23,491
SABU (in Korean): Scalpel blade no. 10.

820
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:34,294
AREUM: One second.

821
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:36,796
-You shouldn't be moving!
-NURSE 11: Coming through!

822
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,507
Those of you who can walk,
please step outside!

823
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:41,718
-Let's move.
-One second!

824
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:42,844
Here!

825
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:45,096
-Ms. Eom. Are you okay?
-CHIEF LEE: That way.

826
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,641
If you can walk, go to the front doors.

827
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:50,143
-We'll take care of you. Please come.
-Over here!

828
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,270
Just a second.

829
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:54,314
AREUM: It was really hard
to start an IV for this patient.

830
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:55,899
Make sure it doesn't slip out.

831
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:58,318
-DONGHWA: Yes, Doctor.
-(pants)

832
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:01,738
DONGHWA: Dr. Yoon, you should hurry too.

833
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:04,783
I don't see Nurse Euntak.

834
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:06,660
Have you seen him?

835
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:09,663
DONGHWA: Master Kim called him earlier.
They went over to the Trauma Center.

836
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:11,706
I think they had a surgery over there.

837
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,083
What?

838
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:15,043
He went into the OR in the middle of this?

839
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:16,962
SABU: Drill.

840
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:33,520
-DONGJU: Cut.
-SEONUNG: Cut.

841
00:54:41,569 --> 00:54:42,821
DONGJU: Suture.

842
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:55,709
-WOOJIN: Cut.
-SEONUNG: Cut.

843
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:04,259
Go slowly.

844
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:08,847
MINGUK: Bed coming through.

845
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,056
Good.

846
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:23,194
We should evacuate now. On the mountain…

847
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:25,572
Dr. Jung, please wait a moment.

848
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:26,573
Yes, Director Park.

849
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:29,617
PATIENT 2: Darn it!

850
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:32,662
What are you trying to do here?

851
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:35,707
Didn't I say I was in pain
since a while ago?

852
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:37,459
-Didn't I?
-Sir.

853
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:39,461
The forest fire is headed this way.

854
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:41,713
Patients who are able to walk

855
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:43,923
-must go outside on their--
-PATIENT 2: Hey!

856
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:45,884
(patient 2 sighs)

857
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:48,219
Do I look like I can walk right now?

858
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:49,304
Do I?

859
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:52,307
PATIENT 2: I've been telling you
I was hurt,

860
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:54,267
that I was in pain,
and that I need treatment.

861
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:57,020
I said it multiple times,
but you didn't even look at me.

862
00:55:57,103 --> 00:56:00,315
That's because you weren't bleeding
after we dressed your wound.

863
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:03,193
And your head CT didn't show any problems.

864
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:05,570
There were other patients who were in need

865
00:56:05,653 --> 00:56:07,947
-of more urgent care--
-PATIENT 2: Darn it. As if that's true.

866
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,742
Hey, you're lying.

867
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:15,121
I know you've been
only taking care of those paramedics.

868
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:17,040
Are you guys friends? Is that it?

869
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:18,708
Are paramedics the only patients here?

870
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:21,294
Are we not patients?

871
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:22,670
It's not like that.

872
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:26,007
All the paramedics
who have been brought here

873
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:28,301
are severely injured.

874
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:30,595
INSU: Sir, can't you see them?

875
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:32,222
I'm severely injured too!

876
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:36,184
Hey, look.
I was bleeding so much earlier too.

877
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:37,852
For now,

878
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:41,773
the situation is urgent.
You should evacuate to a safe place.

879
00:56:42,857 --> 00:56:46,027
We'd appreciate it if the patients
who are able to walk

880
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,947
-could go on their own--
-Why, you little punk.

881
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:50,990
-PATIENT 2: Didn't you hear me?
-Let go of this.

882
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:53,159
-PATIENT 2: I told you I can't walk.
-Let go.

883
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:56,496
I can't walk right now, punk!

884
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:58,039
Sir, let go of him.

885
00:56:58,123 --> 00:56:59,874
-Out of the way, lady!
-Ms. Oh.

886
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:00,875
Hey, punk.

887
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:04,087
PATIENT 2: You're a doctor,
but you don't even take care of a patient.

888
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:07,465
If you had done your job right,
I wouldn't be doing this now!

889
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:08,883
Let go of him.

890
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:12,971
I said let him go!

891
00:57:13,054 --> 00:57:18,685
(yells)

892
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:23,815
There's a forest fire spreading!

893
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:25,024
Didn't you hear him?

894
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:27,735
You should be evacuating in order!

895
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:31,739
How dare you grab a doctor
by the collar and cause a scene?

896
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:35,910
Lady! How dare you raise your voice at me?

897
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:37,704
Do you know who I am?

898
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:39,622
Who on earth are you?

899
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:42,041
I'm dying to know who you are too.

900
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:45,086
Tell me your name!

901
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:47,255
Who on earth are your parents,
and what do you do?

902
00:57:47,338 --> 00:57:48,506
Tell me that!

903
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:52,469
What kind of life have you led
that you're this rude, shameless,

904
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:55,847
and brazen? Tell me that!

905
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:57,974
And tell me where you work too.

906
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:01,936
I will go to your boss
and ask him what his standards were

907
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:05,064
for hiring a guy
with a terrible personality like yours.

908
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:07,775
Tell me. Answer me right now!

909
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:13,698
(yells)

910
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:17,952
Ms. Oh. Please calm down.

911
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:21,122
(pants)

912
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:23,875
The paramedics who were lying there

913
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:25,919
all got hurt while saving you people.

914
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:27,962
MYEONGSIM: While trying to save
your lives,

915
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:29,506
their intestines were crushed,

916
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:31,674
their livers smashed, their bones broken,

917
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:33,510
and some even died!

918
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:42,185
Is it so upsetting that we treated

919
00:58:42,268 --> 00:58:43,728
those urgent patients first?

920
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:46,231
How is it that

921
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:49,400
our dedication and sense of duty
is such a given for you?

922
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:56,032
How can you so brutally
take someone's sacrifice for granted?

923
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:00,036
-(sniffles)
-(clears throat)

924
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:02,413
Well,

925
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:05,250
I didn't mean to take it for granted.

926
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:08,962
-I was hurt and in pain right here, so--
-MYEONGSIM: Forget it!

927
00:59:11,172 --> 00:59:12,215
Tell me.

928
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:13,800
Your name,

929
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:15,885
your job, your parent's names.

930
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:20,640
Tell me all of them!

931
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:22,684
(huffs angrily)

932
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:32,902
I'm sorry.

933
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:38,408
(comical music)

934
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:49,460
(patient 2 yelps)

935
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:57,427
(exhales loudly)

936
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:02,432
Aren't there any police officers
to arrest annoying patients like him?

937
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:06,936
Why must we put up with guys like him
when we did nothing wrong?

938
01:00:07,061 --> 01:00:08,521
How much longer must we do this?

939
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:11,608
Ms. Oh, please calm down.
There are kids watching.

940
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:15,194
(light whimsical music)

941
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:18,364
Goodness. I'm sorry, kids.

942
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:21,200
I didn't yell because I was angry.

943
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:24,329
I did that because I was upset.

944
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:28,041
It's okay.
There's a kid like that in my class too.

945
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:30,752
He never listens to the teacher,

946
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:33,963
and he only blames his friends
when he was the one who did wrong.

947
01:00:36,257 --> 01:00:38,426
Right. Then shall we evacuate too?

948
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:41,304
You learned how to keep order, right?

949
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:44,140
Yes, I learned it in kindergarten.

950
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:46,059
We don't push the people in front,

951
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:48,936
and we have to help people who are hurt.

952
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:52,440
The young ones are better than the adults.

953
01:00:52,523 --> 01:00:53,566
I know.

954
01:00:54,108 --> 01:00:56,402
But what about my dad?

955
01:00:57,403 --> 01:00:59,614
He still seems to be in surgery.

956
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:03,284
The doctors will evacuate him safely

957
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:05,244
as soon as his surgery is over.

958
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:06,704
Don't worry.

959
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:09,374
Now, let's evacuate.

960
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:11,959
Let's go.

961
01:01:20,718 --> 01:01:24,055
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

962
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:26,307
(indistinct clamoring)

963
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:32,438
Yes, ma'am.

964
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:36,317
The hospital is transferring people out
because of the fire.

965
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:38,611
We wouldn't have to do anything ourselves.

966
01:01:38,986 --> 01:01:40,988
Yes, I'll tell you the rest
when I get back.

967
01:01:41,614 --> 01:01:43,324
STAFF 4: How many patients are left?

968
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:44,951
STAFF 5: We still have a few more.

969
01:01:45,451 --> 01:01:47,829
-Let's get a move on.
-Get out of the way.

970
01:01:47,912 --> 01:01:49,831
Those who can walk

971
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:52,291
-should move quickly.
-I'll carry that.

972
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:55,002
-DONGJU: Cut.
-SEONUNG: Cut.

973
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:58,339
(hopeful music)

974
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:17,984
(Sabu grunts)

975
01:02:19,652 --> 01:02:21,529
SABU: Give me an EVD catheter.

976
01:02:24,866 --> 01:02:26,617
Inserting the catheter.

977
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:29,120
All of you, stop for a second.

978
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:45,261
SABU: Focus.

979
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,472
(tense music)

980
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:02,612
SABU: Bowl, please.

981
01:03:08,826 --> 01:03:09,702
(Eunjae exclaims softly)

982
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:12,705
EUNJAE: It's draining well.
That's awesome, Master.

983
01:03:13,706 --> 01:03:16,918
DOIL: Dr. Cha, saying "awesome"
with a patient on the table is a little…

984
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:18,753
EUNJAE: I'm sorry.

985
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:23,925
SABU: The EVD is a success.

986
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:27,011
DONGJU: We'll keep going. Drain, please.

987
01:03:27,094 --> 01:03:28,221
WOOJIN: We'll do a temporary closure.

988
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:29,889
SABU: We'll close up this side too.

989
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:52,578
SABU: Suture.

990
01:03:57,667 --> 01:04:00,419
SABU: Don't be surprised
and listen to what I'm about to say.

991
01:04:01,045 --> 01:04:02,421
There is news

992
01:04:03,339 --> 01:04:05,967
that the forest fire
is heading to Doldam Hospital now.

993
01:04:07,301 --> 01:04:08,511
So right now,

994
01:04:08,886 --> 01:04:11,138
the hospital is transferring everyone out.

995
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:13,224
Cut.

996
01:04:13,307 --> 01:04:14,350
EUNTAK: Cut.

997
01:04:14,433 --> 01:04:16,811
-GITAE: Get inside!
-SABU: According to Chief Park,

998
01:04:18,145 --> 01:04:21,315
we won't have a lot of time left.

999
01:04:22,775 --> 01:04:24,986
As soon as we close up
and finish operating,

1000
01:04:26,237 --> 01:04:28,698
you should also evacuate
as soon as you can.

1001
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:31,200
Dr. Nam.

1002
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:32,785
DOIL: Yes, Master Kim.

1003
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:35,955
SABU: I have an ambulance ready
to move Paramedic Heo.

1004
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:39,667
Can you ride with him
and go to the hospital in Seoul?

1005
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:41,210
DOIL: Of course.

1006
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:42,712
SABU (in English): Okay.

1007
01:04:44,922 --> 01:04:46,340
-SABU (in Korean): Right. Cut.
-EUNTAK: Cut.

1008
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:50,386
-WOOJIN: Cut.
-SEONUNG: Cut.

1009
01:04:50,469 --> 01:04:51,679
-SABU: Cut.
-EUNTAK: Cut.

1010
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:54,390
WOOJIN: Ioban, please.

1011
01:05:03,357 --> 01:05:04,442
SABU: All right.

1012
01:05:07,194 --> 01:05:08,404
Great work, everyone.

1013
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:17,163
We really were…

1014
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:23,711
a perfect team.

1015
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:37,141
WOOJIN: Master.

1016
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:39,560
(Sabu laughs softly)

1017
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:51,155
-(door opens)
-(Doil sighs)

1018
01:05:53,908 --> 01:05:55,326
EUNJAE: What does this mean?

1019
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:58,496
If the forest fire
is heading to the hospital,

1020
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:01,248
what will happen to the Trauma Center

1021
01:06:01,332 --> 01:06:02,708
and Doldam Hospital?

1022
01:06:07,588 --> 01:06:09,548
("I Promise" by Lee Juck playing)

1023
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:13,636
DONGJU: Dr. Nam.

1024
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:15,972
Let's move the patient first.

1025
01:06:16,055 --> 01:06:18,140
DOIL: Yes, let's do that.

1026
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:21,102
Let's move the patient.

1027
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:23,187
Dr. Lee.

1028
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:24,438
SEONUNG: Yes.

1029
01:06:26,524 --> 01:06:27,900
DOIL: Okay, let's go.

1030
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:36,993
("I Promise" by Lee Juck continues)

1031
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:46,002
(sighs)

1032
01:06:48,754 --> 01:06:49,714
It's a shame.

1033
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:53,300
That was our first surgery

1034
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:55,803
as Team Doldam.

1035
01:07:11,152 --> 01:07:12,194
Seo Woojin.

1036
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:15,197
Don't tell me…

1037
01:07:17,074 --> 01:07:18,784
Was that…

1038
01:07:20,327 --> 01:07:22,204
our last surgery just now?

1039
01:07:24,832 --> 01:07:26,709
("I Promise" by Lee Juck continues)

1040
01:07:50,649 --> 01:07:53,152
(music fades)

1041
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:00,451
Master Kim!

1042
01:08:00,534 --> 01:08:01,452
Yes?

1043
01:08:02,453 --> 01:08:03,746
Is the surgery over?

1044
01:08:04,288 --> 01:08:05,956
Yes, we just finished.

1045
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,834
Then you should evacuate.
What are you doing here?

1046
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:11,253
The smoke is coming in already.

1047
01:08:11,337 --> 01:08:12,922
What about the other patients?

1048
01:08:13,005 --> 01:08:15,466
The patients in the Trauma Center
and Doldam Hospital

1049
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:17,051
have been evacuated safely.

1050
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:20,137
I was checking to see
if anyone was left behind.

1051
01:08:20,721 --> 01:08:23,974
Please make sure
not a single person gets hurt.

1052
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:28,729
Of course. I'll be right out
after I check the ICU once more.

1053
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:29,772
Okay.

1054
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:35,820
Master Kim.

1055
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:37,196
Yes?

1056
01:08:37,696 --> 01:08:39,323
Don't think about anything else right now.

1057
01:08:41,033 --> 01:08:42,743
I understand how you must feel,

1058
01:08:44,036 --> 01:08:45,371
but please evacuate first.

1059
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:48,707
MINGUK: From this point onward,

1060
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:51,335
there is nothing that we can do as humans.

1061
01:08:55,881 --> 01:08:56,715
Okay.

1062
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:59,218
(soft somber music)

1063
01:09:50,102 --> 01:09:51,020
(sighs)

1064
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:04,783
WOMAN: Master!

1065
01:10:13,083 --> 01:10:15,794
-GITAE: Get inside.
-PARAMEDIC 6: Everyone, hurry up!

1066
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,421
This way, quickly.

1067
01:10:17,588 --> 01:10:19,173
STAFF 6: It's this way.

1068
01:10:19,256 --> 01:10:21,425
-Yes, they'll be back!
-That's it. There will be more.

1069
01:10:21,508 --> 01:10:22,801
GITAE: Go!

1070
01:10:24,011 --> 01:10:25,387
CHIEF LEE: All right, that's it.

1071
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:28,224
-GITAE: Go.
-CHIEF LEE: They'll be back

1072
01:10:28,307 --> 01:10:31,060
-after dropping off the patients.
-GITAE: There will be more!

1073
01:10:31,143 --> 01:10:32,978
-CHIEF LEE: Please wait calmly.
-GITAE: Go.

1074
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:34,939
(suspenseful music)

1075
01:11:19,233 --> 01:11:20,234
(coughs)

1076
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:23,320
(Eunjae sighs)

1077
01:11:25,155 --> 01:11:29,201
(coughs)

1078
01:11:31,245 --> 01:11:32,162
Dr. Seo.

1079
01:11:33,455 --> 01:11:34,540
Nurse Euntak.

1080
01:11:35,165 --> 01:11:37,209
-What is it?
-I can't find Master Kim.

1081
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:38,335
EUNJAE: What?

1082
01:11:41,338 --> 01:11:43,215
(ominous music)

1083
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:10,242
WOMAN: Master!

1084
01:12:27,885 --> 01:12:31,013
(closing theme music)

1085
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:02,002
DR. ROMANTIC SEASON 3

1086
01:13:02,086 --> 01:13:04,588
All right, we will start
evacuating the medical staff now.

1087
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:06,632
I can't find Master Kim.

1088
01:13:06,715 --> 01:13:08,217
-EUNJAE: What do we do?
-DONGJU: Master Kim!

1089
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,679
KYUNGSOOK (shouts): Please help!

1090
01:13:13,263 --> 01:13:14,890
SABU: They say that life

1091
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:18,560
puts us to the test in two ways.

1092
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:20,854
Either nothing happens

1093
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:23,565
or everything happens all at once.
