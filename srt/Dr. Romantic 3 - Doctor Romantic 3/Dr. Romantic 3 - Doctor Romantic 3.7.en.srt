00:00:03,753 --> 00:00:05,005
DR. ROMANTIC SEASON 3

3
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:45,962
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS AND
EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE WORKS OF FICTION

4
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:53,845
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

5
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:55,180
MAN: In this world,

6
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:57,557
you can't make it, even if you try.

7
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,645
No matter how hard you try,

8
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:06,608
there's a line that you can never cross.

9
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:13,031
(door creaks)

10
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,784
Still, they say you should do your best.

11
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,703
That if you work as hard as you can,
you can make it.

12
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,709
(heavy breathing)

13
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,878
Why do they keep giving us false hope?

14
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,506
It's infuriating.

15
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:34,511
(sighs)

16
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:38,223
What can't be done can't be done.

17
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,185
You're born with different circumstances

18
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:44,813
and have different starting points.

19
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:46,898
Isn't that right?

20
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,192
Sure.

21
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,152
The world is

22
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:53,113
an unfair place.

23
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,031
And it's unjust.

24
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:58,034
(grunts)

25
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,078
But still,

26
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:04,415
don't assume that others had it easy

27
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,419
while achieving the things
they worked so hard for.

28
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,715
That would really infuriate me

29
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,803
because I worked myself to the bone
to get here.

30
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:23,685
But there is only one way
that we can make things fair for us.

31
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:28,815
Dying.

32
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:31,776
(tense music)

33
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,987
Let's keep it fair and die together.

34
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:36,865
Me…

35
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:39,576
and you, Doctor.

36
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,123
It'll really be fair between us.

37
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:47,709
Sounds fair, right?

38
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:53,464
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

39
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:54,591
(gunshot)

40
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,888
(upbeat music)

41
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:07,937
VOLUME 7
INCITING HOPE

42
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,110
MINGUK: As you can see, the Yeongdong
and Donghae Expressways are on both sides.

43
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:17,363
Nearby, there are

44
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:20,575
a total of five national highways

45
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,994
including Route 31, 35, 38, 42, and 59.

46
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:24,996
Also, there is a casino,

47
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:29,500
sixteen golf courses,
and four ski resorts nearby.

48
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,961
On top of that,
an average of over 20,000 hikers

49
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,840
visit the mountains
from all over the country every day.

50
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:39,886
As a result, an average of 30 to 40
traffic accidents occur each week,

51
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:43,640
and during peak seasons,
they reach up to 60 to 70.

52
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,100
Other incidents and natural disasters

53
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:49,646
and unpredictable injuries
have been leading to an increase

54
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,899
in emergency patients
and serious trauma patients.

55
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,319
And the place
where all of these patients can be treated

56
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,530
is none other than Doldam Hospital.

57
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,116
The medical staff at Doldam Hospital

58
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,954
have been saving the lives of numerous
emergency and trauma patients every day.

59
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:10,208
Despite a staff shortage
and an inadequate environment,

60
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,628
we have worked to build our own system

61
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:15,255
and hired new medical professionals.

62
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,507
After much effort,

63
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:20,885
we have finally built our Trauma Center.

64
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,804
HEAD OF TRAUMA CENTER, CHA JINMAN

65
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,182
MINGUK: As you may know,

66
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,434
a trauma center is
not a profitable hospital.

67
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:32,188
We're currently receiving a subsidy
from the Keosan Foundation and the state,

68
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,856
but to run the hospital,

69
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,943
we are in desperate need
of the local government's budget.

70
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,571
I ask you to seriously consider
your support

71
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:43,992
for our trauma center where we save
countless lives on the frontline

72
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:47,370
in the budget review.

73
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:49,664
That will be all.

74
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:53,042
2023 GANGWON PROVINCIAL ASSEMBLY
BUDGET MEETING

75
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,379
(tense music)

76
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,682
CHAIRMAN: We will now conclude
today's meeting.

77
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:10,059
-MEMBER 1: Thank you.
-MEMBER 2: Thank you.

78
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,519
Thank you for your time

79
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,229
-I will see you next time.
-Thank you.

80
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,648
-Thank you for your time.
-Sure.

81
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,570
Thank you for your time.

82
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:29,495
You must've decided to go beyond
being shameless and be bold.

83
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,373
I only feel sorrow and remorse

84
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,293
for what happened to your son.

85
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:39,255
But if you block the budget
for the trauma center because of that,

86
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:40,965
that loss

87
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,177
will go straight to the many patients
who need emergency care.

88
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,095
Will you use the patients
as an excuse again?

89
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,806
It's not an excuse.
I'm merely telling you the reality.

90
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,560
A hospital exists for patients,

91
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,521
but at the same time,
it can't exist without money.

92
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,442
From the moment treatment begins,
a great number of resources are needed,

93
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,027
like materials and manpower.

94
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:05,531
And everything,
down to a tiny cotton ball, costs money.

95
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:09,077
Are you saying you can't bring
humanism to life without money?

96
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,913
I mean that humanism alone

97
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:15,249
can't save patients' lives.

98
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,292
(snorts)

99
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,961
I see.

100
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:21,798
Have a safe trip back.

101
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,217
Apparently, it's snowing.

102
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:31,265
(sighs)

103
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:39,857
(Eunjae sighs)

104
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,359
I've been waiting for spring,

105
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:43,820
but it's snowing instead.

106
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,196
(pants)

107
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:48,116
These days, you can only predict
that the weather will be unpredictable.

108
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,075
Just accept it.

109
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:51,702
(sighs)
I'm jealous you're off today.

110
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,455
I want to play in the snow too.

111
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,249
Should we eat lunch together?

112
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:59,293
Forget it. You don't need to do that.

113
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,088
But if you join me,

114
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,298
I'd appreciate it.

115
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,802
I'd be so grateful.
Thank you very much, indeed.

116
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,012
I'll see you soon. Have a good day.

117
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:11,389
(laughs)

118
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,683
It's snowing a lot.
Don't run for too long,

119
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:14,892
so you don't catch a cold.

120
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,060
Okay.

121
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:17,979
Bye.

122
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,944
(pants)

123
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,700
I'm sorry.

124
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,996
(suspenseful music)

125
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,005
Excuse me. You're hurt.

126
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:47,717
Hang on.

127
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,718
What's up with you?

128
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:54,182
(music intensifies)

129
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,519
The wound looks deep.

130
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,937
WOOJIN: You're bleeding a lot too.

131
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,496
You should get it treated at the hospital.

132
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:20,458
It's bleeding a lot,
and you could get tetanus or septicemia.

133
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,919
You might get frostbite from the cold

134
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:24,420
which would be even worse.

135
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:27,465
Do you know me?

136
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,510
No, but I do know
you have a serious wound.

137
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:31,761
I'm a doctor.

138
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,304
I'm fine.

139
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,182
Just keep going your way.

140
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,476
I'll deal with my leg myself.

141
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,271
(grunts)
Damn it.

142
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,900
(man pants)

143
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,905
(tense music)

144
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:54,992
WOOJIN: Hey.

145
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,410
Sir!

146
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,747
(breathes heavily)

147
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:11,592
(Yeongmi sighs)

148
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,636
YEONGMI: The weather is crazy these days.

149
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,638
The forsythias bloomed in winter,

150
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,557
and now it's snowing in spring.

151
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:21,894
These days, you can only predict
that the weather will be unpredictable.

152
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,438
It is pretty though, right?

153
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:25,898
You're right.

154
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:29,694
Such beautiful garbage
is falling by the truckload.

155
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:33,698
Gosh, you have no sense of romance.

156
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:37,743
Dr. Jung, have you already
reached that age

157
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,580
when you feel nothing
even at the sight of falling snow?

158
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,123
I just don't like

159
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:46,252
anything that falls from the sky,
whether it's rain or snow.

160
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,297
I hope there aren't any accidents.

161
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,966
(phone rings)

162
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,719
This is the Doldam Hospital Trauma Center.

163
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:56,971
Yes, that's right.

164
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,599
What?

165
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,269
Is that so?

166
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:05,563
Yes, got it.

167
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,024
Is it another traffic accident?

168
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,109
How many cars? Did many people get hurt?

169
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,445
There was a shooting incident
at the nearby military base.

170
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,196
-(gasps)
-What?

171
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:18,242
Four have been injured,
including two gunshot wounds.

172
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:21,454
But the helicopter can't take them
to the military hospital with the weather.

173
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:25,541
They must be in bad condition.
They're sending the patients here.

174
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,795
-(groans)
-(sighs)

175
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,341
Gunshot wounds?

176
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:37,053
Yes, Dr. Jung Insu
and Dr. Cha Eunjae are on standby.

177
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,221
Should we call Master Kim too?

178
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,891
Will that really be necessary?

179
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,478
Gunshot wounds are different
from regular trauma cases.

180
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,938
Having an experienced doctor
makes a big difference.

181
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:51,942
MYEONGSIM: And four have been injured,
including those with gunshot wounds.

182
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,070
We only have Dr. Yang Hojun
for general surgery.

183
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,156
Call Dr. Seo Woojin.

184
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,991
Dr. Seo is off today.

185
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:01,243
Professor Park also left
early this morning

186
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,245
for a provincial assembly budget meeting.

187
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,706
Then let's decide
after we see the patients' conditions.

188
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,333
Then it'll be too late.

189
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,086
Damage control is
a battle against the clock,

190
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,672
and the patients' lives
depend on how much time they have, sir.

191
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,425
Are you lecturing me right now?

192
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:21,389
(sighs)
You don't know much about trauma cases.

193
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:22,890
So you should learn.

194
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,228
Can you handle gunshot wounds?

195
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,611
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

196
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,029
(grunts)

197
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,323
(chuckles)

198
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,741
Good work, Doctor.

199
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,702
You too, Dr. Bae.

200
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:55,464
(exhales deeply)

201
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,347
(upbeat music)

202
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,108
Cut.

203
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:35,671
Cut.

204
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,214
SABU: Cut.

205
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,383
Doctor.

206
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,385
When did you get here?

207
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,846
-Keep going.
-Pardon?

208
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,139
Keep going.

209
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,223
Yes, sir.

210
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,329
(quirky music)

211
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,372
(Seonung sighs)

212
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,302
Which are your actual skills?

213
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:24,970
What you showed before or now?

214
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:26,931
Sorry, Doctor.

215
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,768
I can manage when I'm working alone, but…

216
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,979
But do your hands freeze up
when someone is watching?

217
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:36,982
Yes.

218
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,737
-NURSE 1: Master.
-SABU: Yes.

219
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:42,947
NURSE 1: Ms. Oh is calling.

220
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,031
Okay.

221
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,536
Keep practicing. I won't watch.

222
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:57,962
Keep going.

223
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,759
(sighs)

224
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,683
Ms. Oh, it's me. What's going on?

225
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,273
(sighs)

226
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,778
(pants)
Euntak, we have a patient.

227
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:24,488
(man grunts)

228
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,534
Get him in bed one.

229
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:32,830
Slowly.

230
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,124
Lie down here.

231
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,917
-(Woojin groans)
-(man grunts)

232
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,961
(pants)

233
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,173
MAN: No.

234
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:44,675
Never.

235
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,931
(scissors snipping)

236
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:52,641
WOOJIN: There.

237
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,185
We'll disinfect the wound
and take his temperature.

238
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,979
I'll disinfect it. Please hand it to me.

239
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,401
(grunts)

240
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:03,944
How did you bring him in?

241
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:07,197
I nearly bumped into him while jogging.
He seemed to be in bad shape.

242
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,490
Temperature is 39.1°.

243
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:12,369
WOOJIN: There doesn't seem to be
a vessel injury.

244
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:15,456
I think the wound is infected.

245
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,458
Euntak, let's run some bloodwork.

246
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:18,792
-(phone vibrates)
-Okay.

247
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:25,341
It's the Trauma Center.
They have gunshot wound patients.

248
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,676
(tense music)

249
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,347
Aren't you off today?

250
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,266
It's not like I had anything else to do.

251
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,769
It's not every day
you see gunshot wound patients.

252
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,062
I don't want to miss it.

253
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:42,149
No way. You're going to see a patient?
On your day off?

254
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,109
I'll leave him in your hands.

255
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,152
Okay.

256
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:49,114
(exclaims)

257
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,241
I'm liking him less and less.

258
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,911
He's a monster, isn't he?
He can't be human.

259
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,747
Euntak, please do
a bacterial culture on him

260
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,123
and give him an antibiotic injection.

261
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,542
Dr. Dong, you'll stitch him up, right?

262
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:04,380
-Me?
-Why? Can't you handle it?

263
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,718
Sure. I can handle it.

264
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,679
DONGHWA: I'll do it.

265
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,306
-EUNTAK: I'll get things ready.
-AREUM: Okay.

266
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:15,933
(phone rings)

267
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,269
Dr. Yoon. It's Master Kim.

268
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,354
Okay.

269
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,356
Dr. Yoon.

270
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:25,359
I was just called to the Trauma Center.

271
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:28,028
Yes, Master Kim. I heard from Dr. Seo.

272
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,488
There are gunshot wound patients?

273
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:30,906
Yes, that's why I called.

274
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:34,118
I might be away
for quite a while this time.

275
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,371
You can manage the ER
until I get back, right?

276
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:38,372
What?

277
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,124
Uh…

278
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,213
Of course. No problem.
Don't worry, Master Kim.

279
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:48,465
(in English)
Okay.

280
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,467
(in Korean)
Then I'll be back.

281
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,680
What?

282
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,268
What's wrong, Dr. Yoon?

283
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:05,441
Which surgeons will be left here
if Master Kim and Dr. Seo are gone?

284
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,442
(sucks teeth)

285
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,570
That leaves Dr. Ung for cardiothoracic
and Dr. Dong. Why do you ask?

286
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:12,489
ADMISSION DESK

287
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,367
DONGHWA: Let's begin.

288
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,587
Those two and I

289
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,089
will be able to manage the ER, right?

290
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,924
-(sirens wailing)
-Right?

291
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,344
-What?
-PARAMEDIC: We have a patient!

292
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,513
(patient yelling)

293
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:37,723
PATIENT 1: My leg!

294
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:38,932
-Hang on.
-MAN 2: Shut up.

295
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,602
It hurts so much, man!

296
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:42,978
MAN 3: What's with this hospital?

297
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:47,024
PATIENT 1: Please be gentle with me.
(groans)

298
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,234
(intense music)

299
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,784
INSU: Are you in charge?

300
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:58,577
BOSEUNG: Yes,
First Lieutenant Kang Boseung.

301
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,037
It happened an hour and a half ago.

302
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,040
We loaded him with saline on the way,
but his vitals kept dropping.

303
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,333
How much did you give him?

304
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,709
Almost a liter.

305
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:09,171
BOSEUNG: Doctor, the other two patients
are in bad shape too.

306
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,673
One has serious blunt force trauma
to the stomach.

307
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,635
The other hit his head hard as he fell
and is unconscious.

308
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,762
(breathes heavily)

309
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:19,598
Dr. Jung. Let's get
the GSW patients to the trauma bay first.

310
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,060
(high-pitched ringing)

311
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,072
EUNJAE: Dr. Jung?

312
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:38,784
(patient 2 groans)

313
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,871
(cries, grunts)

314
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,378
SABU: Get the GSW patients
to the trauma bay first.

315
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,881
The other two patients
will go to the observation area.

316
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,466
WOOJIN: Sorry I'm late.

317
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:58,262
Let's move him.

318
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,473
EUNJAE: Let's move the patient.
Please bring a portable X-ray machine.

319
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:12,734
Are you okay?

320
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:14,945
Yes, I'm fine.

321
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,406
My thoughts just got tangled up for a bit.

322
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,949
Sorry, Doctor.

323
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,118
We'll handle the gunshot wounds.

324
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:23,328
You can take the observation area.

325
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:24,371
Yes, Doctor.

326
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:27,875
I'll go with him.

327
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,670
DOLDAM HOSPITAL TRAUMA CENTER

328
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:35,632
Where's the head of the trauma center?

329
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,009
I just called him.

330
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:38,218
Call him again.

331
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,219
Yes, Doctor.

332
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,107
(phone vibrates)

333
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:55,903
JINMAN: Why is it?

334
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:00,699
Woojin.

335
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,243
I've confirmed the two exit wounds.

336
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,953
It seems
there are two through-and-throughs

337
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,455
and one bullet

338
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:07,915
is still in his abdomen.

339
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,751
Cha Eunjae. What about that patient?

340
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,295
There's an exit wound on his side.

341
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,589
EUNJAE: I think a bullet only grazed
his calf.

342
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,008
But the thigh was hit.

343
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,052
I think it's along the femoral artery.

344
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:24,097
If it's in this spot,
it could've torn through the nerve too.

345
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,683
Nurse Kim, let me see the ultrasound.

346
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:31,021
JINMAN: That guy flies around
the trauma center with so much vigor.

347
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:32,856
So why did he

348
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,734
bring me into this position?

349
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:39,071
It's mostly due to external factors.

350
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,866
Having you as the head
of the trauma center gives the impression

351
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,952
that this place is
running smoothly from the outside.

352
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:48,288
You could say
that it adds to our public confidence.

353
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,583
-JINMAN: No.
-(sighs)

354
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,503
There's no way
he brought me here just for that.

355
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:56,880
The Bu Yongju that I know

356
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,299
isn't the kind of guy

357
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,802
to care about things
like public confidence.

358
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,806
Then it must mean
there is an internal factor.

359
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,976
SABU: Eunjae, something about that
seems wrong, doesn't it?

360
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:14,523
(clattering)

361
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,192
-EUNJAE: Are you okay?
-SABU: Yes, I'm fine.

362
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,153
(suspenseful music)

363
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,410
SABU: Let's take a look.

364
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:35,836
EUNJAE: Can you bring this down?

365
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,632
JINMAN: Yongju, are you perhaps…

366
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,386
starting to fall?

367
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,181
(patient 1 yelling)

368
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:52,227
It hurts! My leg!

369
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:54,313
PATIENT 1: Do it gently, please.

370
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,023
My pants!

371
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,567
These are designer pants!
They're expensive!

372
00:21:58,650 --> 00:21:59,860
Hang on, please.

373
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:03,113
Sir, don't move. We must treat you first.

374
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:05,449
-Darn it.
-AREUM: Euntak, how are his vitals?

375
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,159
It's 140/90, heart rate 128.

376
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,786
AREUM: Oh, the swelling is really bad.

377
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:13,582
Let's order an X-ray.
Ms. Eom, can you call Dr. Ortho?

378
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,375
MUNJEONG: Dr. Ortho is here.

379
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:19,004
You were here.
I thought you were at the trauma center.

380
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:22,466
Master Kim told me to help you out today.

381
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,676
He did?

382
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,303
Let's see here.

383
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:29,514
-Goodness, you hurt yourself pretty badly.
-(yells)

384
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:32,809
You should've been more careful.
It's snowing out.

385
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:37,230
Let's run an OP lab
and do a lower extremity angiography.

386
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,149
And please call Dr. Lee Seonung.

387
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:40,525
Yes, Doctor.

388
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,236
I'll be back after I see the results.

389
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,237
Yes, Dr. Bae.

390
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:45,947
AREUM: Euntak.

391
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,742
Please give the patient
pethidine for his pain.

392
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:50,160
Yes, Doctor.

393
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,536
It's you, right?

394
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:52,954
Park Euntak.

395
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:55,999
Who...

396
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,585
It's me, Heo Byungbae.

397
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,299
Maybe you don't remember me.

398
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,885
But you must remember Seokgu, right?

399
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,263
Hey, Seokgu. Look over here.

400
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,724
BYUNGBAE: Guess who I'm with now.

401
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:15,143
(tense music)

402
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,069
Park Euntak?

403
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,373
(music intensifies, fades)

404
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:41,294
Yes, Dr. Bae.

405
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:44,005
What is the ER like over there?

406
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,091
There's a motorcycle TA patient.

407
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,551
He has a femur fracture.

408
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:51,138
MUNJEONG: It's a spiral type
and his femoral artery was torn.

409
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:54,850
It won't need to be reconstructed,
but it will need to be repaired.

410
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:56,726
(sighs)

411
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,145
Okay, got it.

412
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:02,607
-MYEONGSIM: Master Kim.
-Yes?

413
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,276
Dr. Jung just checked with the sonogram,

414
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:06,570
and the abdominal trauma patient
has hemoperitoneum.

415
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:14,911
(inaudible)

416
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,789
Can you call Dr. Yang Hojun here quickly?

417
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:18,874
(sighs)

418
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:22,294
Well, I actually just called him.

419
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,131
Apparently, he went out to grab lunch and…

420
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:29,134
(horns honking)

421
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,510
HOJUN: I'm sorry, Ms. Oh.

422
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,221
I was just grabbing some lunch,

423
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,099
but the cars won't budge
for an hour because of the snow.

424
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:39,186
This is driving me crazy.

425
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,274
My goodness.

426
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:45,567
(sighs)

427
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:51,990
(sighs)

428
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:01,917
Is Professor Cha not here yet?

429
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,252
I called him, but he's still not here.

430
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,796
Get him on the line.
I'll talk to him myself.

431
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:08,340
JINMAN: There's no need.

432
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,467
I'm here.

433
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,135
(Sabu sighs)

434
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:13,345
SABU: Good going.

435
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,972
We have four trauma patients,

436
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:20,268
but the head of the trauma center
is just lurking around.

437
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,020
They say
you're an expert on gunshot wounds.

438
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,688
So I called you. What's the problem?

439
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:27,108
We have three combined operations
and a hemoperitoneum.

440
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:31,446
We need to get the bleeding under control
for all of them. What will you do?

441
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,282
The ball is in your court.
You should arrange the surgeries too.

442
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:37,160
Let me learn a thing from you.

443
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:38,954
What?

444
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,748
If I don't know, I should learn.

445
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:43,583
Isn't that right, Ms. Oh?

446
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,961
-(scoffs)
-(tense music)

447
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:55,512
-Have Dr. Seo handle the hemoperitoneum.
-Yes, sir.

448
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:58,390
Cha Eunjae and I will take
the lung through-and-through case.

449
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,268
After I remove the bullet in his abdomen,

450
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:03,562
we'll move on to the femoral artery.

451
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:06,731
Until then, you, the head of the center,

452
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:10,110
will remove the bullet in the thigh
and stitch up the artery.

453
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,487
SABU: After that,

454
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:16,658
I'll go in and finish up
on the through-and-through patient.

455
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,744
Then we'll continue
with the nerve reconstruction nonstop.

456
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:22,330
(inhales deeply)
Is it okay to push yourself so much?

457
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,167
Are you picking a fight
or being sarcastic?

458
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,128
I'm just worried.

459
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:32,340
(tense music continues)

460
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:35,343
SABU: Ms. Oh.

461
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,928
-MYEONGSIM: Yes, sir.
-Let's get ready.

462
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,138
Yes, sir.

463
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:41,099
Then I'll go and get ready too.

464
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:56,406
Cha Eunjae and Bu Yongju will handle
the lung through-and-through.

465
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:59,075
Seo Woojin will handle the hemoperitoneum.

466
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:02,120
JINMAN: And I'll handle
the femoral artery.

467
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:03,830
Get ready.

468
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:05,332
Yes, sir.

469
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:09,044
Let's insert another tube
on the right side and move him to the OR.

470
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:13,673
You inserted a tube on the left.
Why do you need another on the right?

471
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:18,678
The right side still shows signs of
pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema.

472
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:21,014
The broken bone must've damaged the lungs.

473
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:23,475
The subcutaneous emphysema
could go past the midline.

474
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:27,228
JINMAN: It could start on the left
and go to the right.

475
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,105
If the pneumothorax isn't that serious,

476
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:32,067
inserting tubes on both sides
is too much, Dr. Cha.

477
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:33,860
But--

478
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:37,072
If you have the time for that,
look at the patient's history instead.

479
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:39,074
JINMAN: In the cardiopulmonary area,

480
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,909
the surgical procedure
and outcome may change

481
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,203
depending on
the patient's operation risks.

482
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:50,835
You decide. He's your patient.

483
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:53,713
(sighs)

484
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:55,382
MYEONGSIM: Dr. Seo.

485
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:58,593
The hemoperitoneum patient will go
to Operating Room Two in Doldam Hospital.

486
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,720
Dr. Yang of Jungil Hospital
is getting ready.

487
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:04,516
Dr. Cha, you're in Operating Room One
in the trauma center with Master Kim.

488
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,059
Dr. Nam Doil is getting ready.

489
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:11,022
The femoral artery patient
is in Operating Room Two, sir.

490
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,149
Let's move the patients.

491
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,322
Dr. Cha Eunjae.

492
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:25,245
Let's move the patient to the OR.

493
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:30,917
My dad knows better than I do. It's fine.

494
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,006
REPORTER: A heavy snow warning
has been issued

495
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,800
all across Gangwon Province.

496
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,970
The snowfall started around 10 a.m.

497
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:45,473
As of 2 p.m., there has been 20 cm of snow

498
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:46,683
and it's growing deeper.

499
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,437
The heavy snow started falling
over the Yeongdong area,

500
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,273
and it blanketed
the eastern coast in white in no time.

501
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:57,318
Power outages have been occurring
in areas where snow removal was delayed.

502
00:28:57,444 --> 00:29:00,447
And village buses have
stopped running temporarily.

503
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:03,366
Many people have been experiencing
inconveniences throughout the day.

504
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:08,037
As traffic continues to be congested,
traffic accidents keep occurring as well.

505
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,957
Cars cannot move forward

506
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,668
and keep struggling in place
as their tires spin out.

507
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:17,672
As such, the slippery roads have led to

508
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:21,718
a total of nine traffic accidents,
large and small, throughout this morning.

509
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:23,219
ABRUPT SNOWFALL CAUSES INCONVENIENCE

510
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:26,681
REPORTER: This snowfall will continue
until later tonight.

511
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:29,309
GITAE: I guess we won't be ordering
jjajangmyeon for a while.

512
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:31,436
Seriously.

513
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:34,105
We have some jjajang cup noodles too.
Would you like that too?

514
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:37,025
REPORTER: Citizens are asked
to take extra safety precautions.

515
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,735
-Shall we then?
-(knocking)

516
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,111
GITAE: My goodness.

517
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:45,533
Was there perhaps
a package delivery for me?

518
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,869
No, there wasn't.

519
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,247
-Was there?
-No, I didn't see anything.

520
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:54,959
Is it something important?

521
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:59,255
My contact lens was torn recently,
so I ordered new ones.

522
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:02,467
I see.

523
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,844
Well, that's unfortunate.

524
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:09,140
I don't think packages will be delivered
for a few days because of the snow.

525
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,519
Right.

526
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:14,604
Thanks, anyway.

527
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:25,281
Dr. Lee must have bad eyesight.

528
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:29,619
It must be uncomfortable in many ways.

529
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:35,583
That being said, let's quickly have
some jjajang cup noodles.

530
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:36,835
Yes, sir.

531
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:39,128
STAFF: This one.

532
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:41,130
-GITAE: The jjajang flavored one.
-STAFF: Okay.

533
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,305
(suspenseful music)

534
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:52,183
-SEONUNG: What?
-Have you handled vascular cases before?

535
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,271
I haven't performed surgery myself,
but I have assisted with it.

536
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,314
Then this will be
your first time leading the surgery.

537
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,816
MUNJEONG: All right.

538
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:05,905
You want me to do this?

539
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:09,701
I saw you practicing earlier.
I'm sure you can do it.

540
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,120
It's a big blood vessel, not a small one.

541
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,830
MUNJEONG: So it won't be that complicated.

542
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:15,456
What about Master Kim?

543
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,461
He went into emergency surgery
on the gunshot wound patient with Dr. Cha.

544
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:23,089
MUNJEONG: The only cardiothoracic surgeon

545
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:26,426
who can operate on this patient
at Doldam now is you, Dr. Lee.

546
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:36,895
NURSES' STATION

547
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:15,642
DOLDAM HOSPITAL TRAUMA CENTER

548
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:20,688
(suspenseful music)

549
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,277
EUNJAE: Could I have
the patient's history?

550
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,862
Yes, here are his medical records.

551
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:32,116
BOSEUNG: He had pleurisy as a child

552
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,493
and had the fluid drained once.

553
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,469
-Master Kim.
-Yes?

554
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:53,304
Why are there so many soldiers outside?

555
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:57,100
Soldiers were hurt.
They must've come along.

556
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,434
Still, that many?

557
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:01,312
And they're all fully armed.

558
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,108
Fully armed?

559
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,320
4 INJURED SOLDIERS
TRANSFERRED TO NEARBY HOSPITAL

560
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:13,157
NARRATOR: The mother reindeer
licks her baby's fur for a while.

561
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,159
She breathes life into it.

562
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,454
SHOOTER CURRENTLY ON THE RUN

563
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:24,460
Mr. Jang,
could that hospital be Doldam Hospital?

564
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:27,046
No way.

565
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:32,760
(suspenseful music)

566
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:50,611
BOSEUNG: Yes, sir.

567
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,781
I'll keep you updated
on how the surgeries go.

568
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:55,575
Yes, sir. Salute.

569
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,542
You must be hard at work.

570
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,878
Would you like a beverage?

571
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:08,921
Yes, thank you.

572
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:13,426
By the way,

573
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,553
GITAE: I saw on the news

574
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:19,223
that the shooter is still on the run.

575
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,517
Has he still not been caught?

576
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:26,022
The military and police
are searching for him right now,

577
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:27,857
so you shouldn't worry too much.

578
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,318
-I see.
-BOSEUNG: Yes.

579
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:33,780
By any chance, is the shooter

580
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,406
also a soldier?

581
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:38,493
Thank you for the drink.

582
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:44,499
EMPLOYEE: What did he say?

583
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,251
He says I shouldn't worry,

584
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,754
but something feels off.

585
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:51,297
Why?

586
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:55,134
It feels as if
he's trying to hide something.

587
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,095
(walkie-talkie beeps)

588
00:34:58,304 --> 00:34:59,263
Mr. Lee.

589
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:03,059
Could you find out
which division they're from?

590
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,103
Yes, Mr. Jang.

591
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,490
DONGHWA: It'll be done in about two hours.

592
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,159
You can leave
as soon as the IV bag is empty.

593
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,167
(phone vibrates)

594
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,086
He's being awfully quiet.

595
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,259
(scoffs)

596
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:39,929
(scoffs)

597
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:47,311
Mr. Park.

598
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,188
Dr. Seo is calling.

599
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:51,566
EUNTAK: Yes, I heard it
from Ms. Oh just now.

600
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,985
I'll wrap it up soon
and head over to the OR. You go ahead.

601
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:55,194
Okay then.

602
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:57,864
SEOKGU: What is this?

603
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:01,159
Am I the only one

604
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,786
who finds this strange here?

605
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:05,788
Am I the only one getting chills?

606
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:12,128
You suddenly disappeared
so I thought you bit the dust somewhere.

607
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:15,423
Who knew you'd be playing doctor
here in the boonies?

608
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:16,924
Please be quiet.

609
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,926
You're bothering the other patients.

610
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,345
What a load of crap, you punk.

611
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:22,638
Excuse me, sir.

612
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:25,641
This is a public place.
Please don't swear.

613
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,476
Out of the way, sis.

614
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,562
I'm not your sister.

615
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:33,149
AREUM: If you keep making a scene,
I could have you forcibly removed.

616
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:35,776
I have the authority to do so
as the person in charge of the ER.

617
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,737
(laughs)
How scary.

618
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,864
-(man 3 laughs)
-I'm so damned scared.

619
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,325
SEOKGU: I'm scared.

620
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:45,244
Sis in charge,
you're pretty damn charismatic.

621
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,746
I told you not to swear.

622
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:52,877
Do you have a death wish?

623
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,676
What are you doing?

624
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,303
Be quiet and leave once you're done.

625
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:05,598
Don't make a ruckus. Got it?

626
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,397
You damned little…

627
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,024
Euntak.

628
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,692
Step back.

629
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,070
AREUM: Euntak.

630
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:21,781
Don't react to him. Don't cause trouble.

631
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:35,336
TRAUMA CENTER

632
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,254
MUNJEONG: Huh?

633
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:38,881
Dr. Seo, aren't you off today?

634
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,758
I got called in about a trauma case.

635
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:44,553
The ORs are full over there,
so we're moving the patient here.

636
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,222
(sighs)

637
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:47,682
Take it easy.

638
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:51,727
This is why Dr. Jang Donghwa
always says he likes you less and less.

639
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:52,770
(laughs softly)

640
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,022
MUNJEONG: Oh, right.

641
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,774
I hear you're staying
at the medical office.

642
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,235
You can stay with me
if it's too uncomfortable.

643
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:02,113
The medical office isn't that bad.

644
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:03,406
I'm used to it now.

645
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:07,994
Still, you can always ask me
if you ever need anything.

646
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,204
You can do that with me.

647
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,209
This moment in my life

648
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,129
is like the warmest springtime.

649
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:22,383
All the days I spend here at Doldam

650
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:24,927
are like that for me.

651
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:31,475
Mr. Koo!

652
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,269
HYEONJEONG: Mr. Koo…

653
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:34,937
Dr. Ortho! Dr. Seo! We have a problem!

654
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:37,398
Euntak got into a fight in the ER! Hurry!

655
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,733
-Hurry!
-Euntak?

656
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:41,444
So?

657
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:43,988
Should we have another go here?

658
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:48,242
We have some unfinished business
from 10 years ago, remember?

659
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:52,413
Should we finish that mess here?

660
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:53,831
I told you to be quiet.

661
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:55,124
SEOKGU: Why?

662
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:56,876
Are you scared?

663
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:00,629
SEOKGU: This is what I mean.

664
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:03,674
(scoffs)
Just act like your old self.

665
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:06,552
Hey.

666
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:10,431
Just because you wear these clothes
and pretend to be nice,

667
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,184
it doesn't mean you'll become an angel.

668
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,728
It damned doesn't suit you at all.

669
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:17,980
It creeps me out, you punk!

670
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,106
(Seokgu chuckles)

671
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:21,901
I mean,

672
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:24,695
you even killed a man.

673
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,031
(tense music)

674
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:30,868
You little…

675
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:33,454
What are you doing, Euntak?

676
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,039
You can't do this in the hospital.

677
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:36,957
I'm going to kill this guy.

678
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,709
Don't do this. Let him go now.

679
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:39,877
Get off me.

680
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,379
Euntak!

681
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:44,340
(breathes heavily)

682
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,807
The hemoperitoneum patient
will arrive at the OR soon.

683
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,476
Go and prepare for surgery, okay?

684
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,399
Please do that, Euntak.

685
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,375
(pants)

686
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:23,587
(soft music)

687
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:40,271
What an idiot.

688
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:41,689
(scoffs)

689
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,317
Mr. Koo!

690
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:53,784
Yes, Doctor.

691
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:55,286
If this patient

692
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:58,414
causes a scene again,
have him discharged right away.

693
00:40:58,497 --> 00:40:59,707
Understood, Doctor.

694
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,550
What are you doing? Get ready for surgery.

695
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,510
Pardon? Yes, I'm coming.

696
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,236
(pants)

697
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:32,448
BOY: Euntak.

698
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:35,367
Save me.

699
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:40,206
Please...

700
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:43,334
save me.

701
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,430
(horns honking)

702
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,439
(sighs)

703
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,075
DIRECTOR PARK MINGUK

704
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,701
(gasps, exhales)

705
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:21,330
(clears throat)

706
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:24,375
Yes, Director Park.

707
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:26,710
Hey, how are things at the hospital?

708
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,922
I heard we had soldiers
with gunshot wounds.

709
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:31,048
Are they in surgery?

710
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:33,425
Well, the thing is...

711
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:36,887
I'm on my way back
after grabbing a quick lunch.

712
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,932
Lunch? Why are you still eating lunch?

713
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:42,810
Well, I'm done eating lunch.

714
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:44,812
HOJUN: I was on my way
back to the hospital,

715
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,855
but I'm stuck in traffic due to the snow.

716
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:48,107
Don't worry too much, sir.

717
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,608
I'll get back as soon as I can.

718
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:53,279
I'll go back, assess the situation,
and report back to you soon.

719
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:56,156
Director Park?

720
00:42:58,158 --> 00:42:59,702
(in sing-song)
Director Park?

721
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:06,625
(gasps)

722
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:12,047
Why are you there, Director Park?

723
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:15,968
You said it was a quick lunch,
but did you drive into town for it,

724
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:17,428
Dr. Yang Hojun?

725
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:21,307
Well, what happened was...

726
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:24,977
HOJUN: The thing is,
my favorite hamburger restaurant

727
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,062
opened a new location in town.

728
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:29,315
I really like
their chicken burgers, you see.

729
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:31,609
-HOJUN: I really just had one burger--
-(line disconnects)

730
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:33,068
Hello?

731
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:34,570
HOJUN: Director Park!

732
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:37,573
I swear I'm telling the truth!

733
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:39,325
This is Park Minguk.

734
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:41,118
How is the trauma center right now?

735
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,870
I really only ate one burger.

736
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:45,623
The ORs are full?

737
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,541
HOJUN: Director Park! Just this once.

738
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,376
-(horns honking)
-HOJUN: Director Park!

739
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:51,962
I just wanted the burger so badly.

740
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:53,505
Director Park!

741
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:56,592
You'd understand
if you tried it too. Director Park!

742
00:43:57,259 --> 00:44:00,929
EUNJAE: Patient is 24 years old.
Two through-and-through GSWs to the chest.

743
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:03,015
We'll start an exploratory thoracotomy.

744
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:06,018
After we take care of
the two gunshot wounds on the left lung,

745
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:07,978
we'll remove the bullet
lodged in his abdomen.

746
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:09,855
May I begin?

747
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:11,148
DOIL: Yes, you may begin.

748
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,319
EUNJAE: Scalpel, please.

749
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:29,917
JINMAN: Is it just you and me, Ms. Oh?

750
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,336
MYEONGSIM: Don't worry.
I'll assist you well.

751
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:36,632
JINMAN: Let's see then.

752
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:40,177
Hm…

753
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:43,806
Scalpel.

754
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:50,771
WOOJIN: What about Euntak?

755
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:52,606
DONGHWA: He isn't here yet.

756
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:53,649
Should I call him?

757
00:44:58,904 --> 00:44:59,988
(sighs)

758
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:03,826
(tense music)

759
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:20,384
(sighs)

760
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:30,853
(Seongung exhales)

761
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:33,480
Shall we go in?

762
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:35,524
SEONUNG: Sir.

763
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:39,069
I have something to tell you first.

764
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:50,247
WOOJIN: Let's begin the operation.

765
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:52,207
DONGHWA: Without Euntak?

766
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:54,710
WOOJIN: Why?
Can't you do this on your own?

767
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:58,213
DONGHWA: It's not that. Let's do this.

768
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:01,258
WOOJIN: Scalpel.

769
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:09,475
(Seonung exhales)

770
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,603
MUNJEONG: Don't be nervous.

771
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:14,438
Just do it like how you practiced.

772
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:16,148
You can do this.

773
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:17,691
SEONUNG: Yes, Doctor.

774
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:24,531
SEONUNG: Patient is a 29-year-old male.

775
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:26,742
He has a distal femur fracture

776
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:29,411
and a femoral artery laceration.

777
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:32,247
After a thrombectomy
using the Fogarty catheter,

778
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:34,124
I will repair the damaged areas.

779
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:36,585
May I begin?

780
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:38,337
ANESTHESIOLOGIST: You may begin.

781
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:42,424
SEONUNG: Scalpel.

782
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:49,181
MUNJEONG: I think that's the right line.
Good.

783
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:50,849
With confidence.

784
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,582
(tense music)

785
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:19,837
(phone vibrates)

786
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:34,059
(grunts)

787
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:41,275
(sighs)

788
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:42,818
Let me use the restroom.

789
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:50,742
RESTRICTED AREA
OPERATING ROOM

790
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:02,045
WOOJIN: Metz.

791
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:04,298
As soon as I open,
suction with both tubes.

792
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:11,847
WOOJIN: Suction.

793
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:13,932
(machine beeps frantically)

794
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:15,392
WOOJIN: Suction!

795
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:20,439
WOOJIN: Right next to that.

796
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:24,985
WOOJIN: There.

797
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:26,528
More gauze.

798
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:29,281
DONGHWA: The blood is starting to clot.

799
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:30,365
WOOJIN: Then scoop it out.

800
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:35,537
WOOJIN: Pour in saline. Lots of it.

801
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:53,639
WOOJIN: Once more.

802
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:56,516
Suction.

803
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:06,735
WOOJIN: Richardson.

804
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:16,536
WOOJIN: Forceps.

805
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:22,709
WOOJIN: Do you see it?

806
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:24,002
DONGHWA: Yes, I see it.

807
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:26,380
WOOJIN: Then clamp it!

808
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:28,882
DONGHWA: What? Oh, right.

809
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:31,134
-Kelly.
-WOOJIN: Are you sure about that?

810
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:34,888
DONGHWA: Give me the Mixter clamp, please.

811
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:40,686
(Donghwa grunts)

812
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:42,354
(Donghwa sighs)

813
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:46,733
ANESTHESIOLOGIST: You got it.

814
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,068
BP is starting to rise.

815
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:52,239
WOOJIN: You take care of the mesentery.
I'll get the artery.

816
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:54,825
Ms. Oh.

817
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:56,702
Give Dr. Jang the sutures.

818
00:49:58,745 --> 00:49:59,705
DONGHWA: I'll take them.

819
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:29,609
WOOJIN: You must've been practicing
regularly.

820
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:32,779
DONGHWA: I wasn't at the top of my class,
but I wasn't at the bottom either.

821
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:35,866
Cut.

822
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,035
WOOJIN: Cut.

823
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,370
(hopeful music)

824
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:46,543
(inaudible)

825
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:50,297
DOIL: What do you mean,

826
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,215
the blood transport vehicle
is stuck in traffic?

827
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:54,217
NURSE 2: We're supposed to get
more blood today,

828
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:56,011
but they're stuck in traffic
due to the snow.

829
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:57,596
EUNJAE: Linear cutter, please.

830
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:01,349
DOIL: Check how much blood we have
at the hospital for now,

831
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:03,769
and contact
all nearby hospitals and health centers

832
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:05,187
for emergency backup.

833
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:06,980
NURSE 2: Yes, Doctor.

834
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:08,148
SABU: Hang on.

835
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:10,609
-Where is the blood transport vehicle now?
-NURSE 2: Pardon?

836
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:13,403
SABU: Find out where the vehicle is stuck.

837
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:14,571
NURSE 2: Yes, Doctor.

838
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:15,781
SABU: And Ms. An.

839
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:20,118
Call Dr. Yang Hojun
and put him on speaker.

840
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:21,369
EUNJAE: Sutures, please.

841
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:26,750
HOJUN: Let's go, please.

842
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:28,877
(moans)
Come on.

843
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:33,048
(stomach growls)

844
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,675
HOJUN: No, Hojun. My stomach.

845
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:37,052
(grunts)

846
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:39,471
No, wait. Quiet down.

847
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:41,223
(groans)

848
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:42,516
(stomach continues growling)

849
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:43,475
My stomach.

850
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:44,935
(phone rings)

851
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:46,561
DOLDAM MS. AN

852
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:47,687
(grunts)

853
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:50,107
Hello?

854
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:52,567
SABU: This is Master Kim.
Where are you right now?

855
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:54,194
HOJUN: Yes, Master Kim.

856
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:55,362
(Hojun exhales)

857
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:57,072
HOJUN: I'm sorry.

858
00:51:57,572 --> 00:52:00,075
I just stepped out to grab some lunch and…

859
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:02,285
Darn it.

860
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:05,622
I really only had one burger.

861
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:07,666
HOJUN: It's my favorite hamburger--

862
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:10,043
SABU: So where are you right now?

863
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:14,422
I'm almost there.
Really, I'll be back soon.

864
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:17,425
SABU (shouting): Give me your location!
Where are you now?

865
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:18,969
Pardon?

866
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:21,638
This is...

867
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:25,100
I'm near the Ulmok three-way intersection.

868
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:26,935
SABU: Ulmok?

869
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:31,815
Hey, hurry up and see
if the blood transport vehicle is nearby.

870
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:33,358
HOJUN: The blood transport vehicle?

871
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:35,527
One second, Master Kim.

872
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:40,657
Oh?

873
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:48,331
BLOOD TRANSPORT VEHICLE

874
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:51,001
Yes, it's here! I see it.

875
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:54,087
HOJUN: It's one, two, three,
four, five cars

876
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:57,007
ahead of my car.
(chuckles)

877
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:59,467
SABU: Hey, are you a good runner?

878
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:01,094
Pardon?

879
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,098
(door closes)

880
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:10,937
Excuse me.

881
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:15,734
I need to take some of those boxes.

882
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:24,451
Will you be okay? These weigh quite a bit.

883
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:27,579
I must take them.
That's the only way I can live.

884
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:28,496
Pardon?

885
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:30,248
Just give them to me!

886
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:34,294
(grunts)

887
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:37,589
(grunts)

888
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:40,592

00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:44,012
-(upbeat, hopeful music)
-Director Park.

890
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:45,513
Pick it up.

891
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:46,765
Yes, sir.

892
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:48,433
KOREAN RED CROSS BLOOD TRANSPORT BOX

893
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:54,189
Let's go.

894
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:55,398
Yes, sir.

895
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,369
EUNJAE: We've stopped all the bleeding.

896
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:10,747
SABU: Let's close up quickly
and get the bullet in the retroperitoneum.

897
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:12,040
EUNJAE: Yes, Doctor.

898
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:16,086
(machine beeps frantically)

899
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:21,800
DOIL: Dr. Cha, didn't you get
all the bleeders?

900
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:23,176
EUNJAE: I did.

901
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:26,471
DOIL: His vitals are dropping again.

902
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:28,515
EUNJAE: What? That's not possible.

903
00:54:29,015 --> 00:54:30,934
I made sure I stopped all the bleeders.

904
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:33,228
SABU: Which side did you say
the rib fracture was in?

905
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:34,271
EUNJAE: The right side.

906
00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:39,526
SABU: Dr. Nam.
Take a quick look at the patient's neck.

907
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:45,782
DOIL: The subcutaneous emphysema
is up to his face.

908
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:49,619
SABU: Ms. An, the povidone-iodine.

909
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:57,460
SABU: Scalpel.

910
00:54:58,753 --> 00:55:00,755

911
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:06,553
(air hisses)

912
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:11,141
SABU: Chest tube.

913
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:20,358
JINMAN: You inserted a tube on the left.

914
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:22,193
Why do you need another on the right?

915
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:25,238
Inserting tubes on both sides
is too much, Dr. Cha.

916
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:27,032
SABU: Scalpel.

917
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:31,619
Richardson.

918
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:37,208
SABU: You need to turn it around.

919
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:39,919
Long forceps.

920
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:41,129
Metz.

921
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:53,725
SABU: Pull it down a little.

922
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:04,444
SABU: Retractor.

923
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:08,531
(Sabu grunts)

924
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:21,503
(Eunjae gasps)

925
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:23,588
(Sabu grunts)

926
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:27,092
(Eunjae breathes heavily)

927
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:31,471
SABU: Stop the bleeding first

928
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,223
and do a wedge resection.

929
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:35,892
(Eunjae breathes shakily)

930
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,024
(Eunjae exhales)

931
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:44,484
SABU (muffled): Cha Eunjae.

932
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:48,863
SABU (clearly): Cha Eunjae!

933
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:50,490
EUNJAE: Yes, Doctor.

934
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:51,658
SABU: Look at me.

935
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:53,243
Focus!

936
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:56,287
The patient isn't dead yet.
Pull yourself together, got it?

937
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:58,623
EUNJAE: Yes, Doctor.

938
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:00,417
(Eunjae exhales, sniffles)

939
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:02,961
SABU: Long forceps.

940
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:06,256
Suction.

941
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:08,716
(Eunjae breathes shakily)

942
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:11,136
SABU: Suction!

943
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:12,887
EUNJAE: Suction.
(sniffles)

944
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:24,566
-DOIL: What about the blood?
-NURSE 2: That was the last one.

945
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:28,361
The Doldam ORs
are running low on blood too.

946
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:31,281
DOIL: Call Dr. Yang Hojun
and ask him where he is.

947
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:32,615
NURSE 2: Yes, Doctor.

948
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:34,701

(Hojun wheezes)

952

Director.
(pants)

953
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:51,968
Can we please slow down?

954
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:54,179
Shut it. Run.

955
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:56,347
I can't...

956
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:58,975
(chokes)
I can't breathe.

957
00:57:59,058 --> 00:58:00,310
Shut it!

958
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:02,020
Run!

00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:05,398

00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:34,719
SABU: Eunjae, take this out.

967
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:38,765
(Eunjae breathes heavily)

968
00:58:43,436 --> 00:58:44,312
(Sabu grunts)

969
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:45,730
SABU: Doil.

970
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:46,814
DOIL (in English): Okay.

971
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:56,741
(Sabu pants)

972
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:06,918

977
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:22,225
Go!

978
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:25,019
(Minguk pants loudly)

979
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:27,730

I can't move my hand.

984
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:40,994
Dr. Bae.

985
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:43,288
I can't move my hand.

986
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:45,415
(hopeful music)

987
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:07,979
(Woojin sighs in relief)

989
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:19,449
HOJUN: I was so surprised.

990
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:21,909
I knew you were in great shape,

991
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:24,704
but I never thought you'd run that fast.

992
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:31,210
Submit a report
on leaving the hospital today.

993
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:32,337
Pardon?

994
01:00:32,837 --> 01:00:33,838
A report?

995
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:37,008
-As I told you earlier…
-(stomach growls)

996
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,260
What? Is there a problem?

997
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:41,846
(strained) Well, the thing is...

998
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:43,848
It started snowing…

999
01:00:43,931 --> 01:00:45,516
HOJUN (groaning): Sir.

1000
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:47,185
I'm sorry.

1001
01:00:48,519 --> 01:00:50,563
Please excuse me...

1002
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:51,981
(groans)

1003
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:55,318
(scoffs)

1004
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:58,196

-Ah!

MEN'S RESTROOM

1006
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:06,871
HOJUN: But I only had one burger!

1007
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:09,791
(Hojun groans)

1008
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:14,712
(somber music)

1009
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:25,932
Good work.

1010
01:01:27,308 --> 01:01:28,142
What?

1011
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:31,771
How does it feel to save a patient?

1012
01:01:33,898 --> 01:01:34,732
Well,

1013
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:37,735
you were the one who did that, not me.

1014
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:41,447
Today, it was you who did well.

1015
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:48,079
(bright music)

1016
01:02:23,948 --> 01:02:25,032
(sniffles)

1017
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:38,045
JINMAN: There is muscle injury
in part of the rectus femoris

1018
01:02:38,629 --> 01:02:39,964
and the vastus medialis.

1019
01:02:42,216 --> 01:02:43,551
JINMAN: Don't these cases usually

1020
01:02:43,634 --> 01:02:46,262
have orthopedic surgeons take the lead,
not the CT surgeons?

1021
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:48,181
SABU: That's usually the case.

1022
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:51,601
But this is the trauma center.

1023
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:57,273
Oftentimes in trauma cases,
we have to ignore who's the main surgeon

1024
01:02:57,732 --> 01:03:01,360
and start tackling the problem
with whatever is easiest to access.

1025
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:05,490
With your skills, you wouldn't need
an orthopedic surgeon to join in.

1026
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:07,283
I thought you'd use

1027
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:10,620
an anatomical approach
to pull off an arteriorrhaphy yourself.

1028
01:03:10,703 --> 01:03:12,872
Why? You aren't sure of yourself?

1029
01:03:14,248 --> 01:03:16,501
JINMAN (sighing): Are you picking
a fight again?

1030
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:18,795
SABU: No.

1031
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:21,672
I meant that I trust you.

1032
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:25,843
We may think differently,

1033
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:29,555
but I've never doubted your skills.

1034
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:34,268
JINMAN: DeBakey.

1035
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:37,146
Metz.

1036
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:53,621
JINMAN: There isn't much vessel damage.

1037
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:56,415
Shall we take off the tourniquet?

1038
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:58,000
NURSE 5: Taking off the tourniquet.

1039
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:00,253
(beeps)

1040
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:04,090
JINMAN: Okay, vascular looks good.

1041
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:06,551
Let's remove the foreign body and wrap up.

1042
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:08,427
Kelly.

1043
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:13,307
(Jinman grunts)

1044
01:04:14,767 --> 01:04:16,310
MYEONGSIM: Is it lodged in the bone?

1045
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:18,437
JINMAN: It doesn't seem
to be lodged in deeply.

1046
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:21,566
There's just a cortical break.

1047
01:04:22,316 --> 01:04:23,734
Let's try pulling it out.

1048
01:04:26,779 --> 01:04:29,240
(tense music)

1049
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:38,291
-(flatlining)
-(air pumping rythmically)

1050
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:39,542
DOIL: Master Kim.

1051
01:04:40,334 --> 01:04:42,837
I think we've lost him.

1052
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:44,755
(Sabu pants)

1053
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:46,883
-(tense music)
-(Eunjae exhales)

1054
01:04:47,925 --> 01:04:50,428
SABU: Cha Eunjae.
We're doing an open cardiac massage.

1055
01:04:50,511 --> 01:04:51,429
Get him open now.

1056
01:04:51,512 --> 01:04:54,140
EUNJAE: What? Me?

1057
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:56,559
SABU: There's no time to switch places.
You do it.

1058
01:04:57,351 --> 01:04:58,352
Povidone iodine.

1059
01:04:59,979 --> 01:05:02,148
(Eunjae breathes shakily)

1060
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:03,983
EUNJAE: Mosquito forceps, please.

1061
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:09,947
(Eunjae breathes shakily)

1062
01:05:17,663 --> 01:05:18,873
EUNJAE: Scalpel blade no. 10.

1063
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:22,543
(Eunjae breathes heavily)

1064
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:25,338
EUNJAE: Mayo.

1065
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:30,343
(Eunjae breathes heavily)

1066
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:34,347
SABU: What are you doing?
Cardiac massages, now!

1067
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:35,556

1069
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:51,447
(Eunjae breathes heavily)

1070
01:05:53,741 --> 01:05:55,743
DOIL: Get some more blood.

1071
01:05:58,829 --> 01:05:59,872
(Sabu pants)

1072
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:04,251
SABU: Switch places.

1073
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:08,923
Take out your hands.

1074
01:06:14,553 --> 01:06:15,638
(Eunjae breathes heavily)

1075
01:06:32,613 --> 01:06:33,698
EUNJAE: It's my fault.

1076
01:06:37,118 --> 01:06:39,578
I failed this patient.

1077
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:44,542
(Sabu pants)

1078
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:48,254
(Eunjae cries)

1079
01:06:53,217 --> 01:06:54,051
Woojin.

1080
01:06:55,469 --> 01:06:56,679
What's wrong?

1081
01:06:56,762 --> 01:06:57,680
Is it another patient?

1082
01:06:58,639 --> 01:06:59,557
I can't find

1083
01:07:00,641 --> 01:07:01,517
Euntak.

1084
01:07:02,643 --> 01:07:04,979
I looked everywhere in the hospital,
but I couldn't find him.

1085
01:07:05,062 --> 01:07:06,147
He won't answer his phone.

1086
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:07,732
Sir, how do you feel?

1087
01:07:08,482 --> 01:07:09,650
DOLDAM HOSPITAL

1088
01:07:09,734 --> 01:07:11,736
What? Where did he go?

1089
01:07:13,779 --> 01:07:15,948
Mr. Koo, have you seen this patient?

1090
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:17,867
No, I haven't.

1091
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:19,243
The patient I was guarding

1092
01:07:19,326 --> 01:07:21,871
didn't come back from the restroom,
so I was going to look for him.

1093
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:28,127
(suspenseful music)

1094
01:07:42,933 --> 01:07:46,687

DR. ROMANTIC SEASON 3

GITAE: We should let
Master Kim know first.

1099
01:08:29,647 --> 01:08:34,193
DOIL: Cha Eunjae has a hard time as it is
because of her surgery anxiety.

1100
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:35,569
SEOKGU: I could destroy those ten years…

1101
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:37,655
It's him, right?

1102
01:08:38,197 --> 01:08:40,366
-…in less than five minutes.
-(gunshots)

1103
01:08:40,491 --> 01:08:43,327
Evacuate everyone in the lobby to the ER.

1104
01:08:43,744 --> 01:08:44,912
I'll stay here.

1105
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:46,789
SABU: What about Seo Woojin?

1106
01:08:46,872 --> 01:08:48,958
Where is he now?

1107
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:51,127
WOOJIN: Don't assume
that others had it easy

1108
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:53,254
while achieving the things
they worked so hard for.

1109
01:08:53,337 --> 01:08:55,256
-DONGHWA: Doctor!
-(gunshot)
