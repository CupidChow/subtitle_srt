00:00:01,084 --> 00:00:03,003
(theme music)

2
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:05,005
DR. ROMANTIC SEASON 3

3
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:45,962
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS AND
EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE WORKS OF FICTION

4
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,298
(sensual music)

5
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:53,803
Should I...

6
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,181
lie down first?

7
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,475
I will...

8
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,478
lie down first.

9
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:08,943
SEONUNG: Oh!

10
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:11,613
Is it...

11
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,741
okay for us to do this?

12
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:17,660
You know
that we can't go on like this anymore.

13
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:19,704
Let's start...

14
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,916
being honest with each other now.

15
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:25,710
(breathes shakily)

16
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,013
(exhales deeply)

17
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:39,182
I'll do it.

18
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,309
(breathes deeply)

19
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:48,149
The blood work seems to show
indications of cholangitis,

20
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,235
so we'll do a CT scan first.

21
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,113
Could you help him to get his scans?

22
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,114
Yes, Doctor.

23
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:59,786
RESTRICTED AREA
OPERATING ROOM

24
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:02,288
Ms. Eom.

25
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,373
-Yes?
-AREUM: By the way,

26
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:04,999
where did the two go?

27
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:08,503
You mean Dr. Ung and Dr. Jang?

28
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:11,798
HYEONJEONG: I'm not sure.
They were just here a minute ago.

29
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:14,425
DONGHWA: I'm sorry.

30
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,094
I don't think I can do this.

31
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,262
What are you saying?

32
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,597
Are you saying you want to give up now?

33
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:22,142
No, you can't do that.

34
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,103
Take it off now.

35
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:27,605
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

36
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,234
(grunts)

37
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,324
-SEONUNG: The back has to go...
-DONGHWA: No, wait.

38
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,659
SEONUNG: Can you lean down a little?

39
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:42,287
-DONGHWA: Wait!
-SEONUNG: The back!

40
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:47,208
-(comical tune)
-(crickets chirping)

41
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,380
MINGUK: The surgeons gathered here

42
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:55,508
will be doing a simulation
for the next two months

43
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,218
in the Trauma Center.

44
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:03,141
It will be like a pre-inspection
before the Trauma Center officially opens

45
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,935
to see how we work together as a team.

46
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,395
From this point forward,

47
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,815
just focus on the serious trauma patients.

48
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,403
Then what about the ER at Doldam Hospital?

49
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,948
Those of you here and I

50
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,951
will be covering the ER.

51
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,871
Just the people here right now?

52
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,122
Yes.

53
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,418
(tense music)

54
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:43,431
(whispers)
Will those two be enough?

55
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:46,226
(whispers)
I know, Ms. Oh. Will we be okay?

56
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:48,978
You two.

57
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:50,772
You can do it, right?

58
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,941
(coughs)

59
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:59,697
I'm sorry, but I won't take part in this.

60
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:05,995
JINMAN: Why?

61
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,622
Are you not confident enough?

62
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,670
I heard Bu Yongju taught you.
I was looking forward to seeing you work.

63
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,298
Your skills must not be good enough
to show me just yet.

64
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:21,386
I don't perform surgery
merely to show people my skills.

65
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:25,014
That seems like a good excuse.

66
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,435
Did my refusal sound like an excuse?

67
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,104
I assume it's one of two reasons.

68
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:34,607
Either you don't feel confident
in your skills...

69
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,194
or you're uncomfortable with me.

70
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:44,367
I just want to keep working
at Doldam Hospital with Master Kim.

71
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,828
Are you unable to step outside
of Bu Yongju's shadows?

72
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,122
JINMAN: Come to think of it,

73
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,958
he has been raising minions,

74
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,045
not teaching doctors.

75
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,172
Professor.

76
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,053
WOOJIN: I was the one
who willingly became a minion.

77
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,139
Master Kim was the one

78
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,975
who didn't look down on me
and treated me with respect

79
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:11,477
as a junior doctor.

80
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:16,399
I'll be going now.

81
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,199
Dr. Seo.

82
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:27,493
INSU: Hey, wait.

83
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,415
-Hey! Woojin!
-MUNJEONG: Dr. Seo!

84
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,711
EUNJAE: You spoke too harshly, Professor.

85
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,379
Dr. Seo is

86
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,798
a talented surgeon at Doldam Hospital.

87
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:42,508
Please treat him with respect.

88
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,018
Hey, Dr. Seo.

89
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,312
You can't just leave like this.

90
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:56,731
We still have to open the Trauma Center.

91
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,441
I'm not against that.

92
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,026
I just won't be part of it.

93
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,612
That's what I'm saying.

94
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:06,240
What will happen to the team
if our ace won't be part of it?

95
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,909
MUNJEONG: That's right, Dr. Seo.

96
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:10,328
I don't think you should leave like this.

97
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,538
You should at least get started

98
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,207
and say that you want to leave later.

99
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:18,795
Master Kim can't cover
the ER on his own, okay?

100
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,339
There's only one CT fellow who just joined

101
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:24,175
and a resident who barely has experience
being a first assistant.

102
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,844
Basically, they're casting us aside.

103
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,683
What do you mean?
Why would they do that to us?

104
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,352
DONGHWA: I see it as a type of power play.

105
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:37,230
They're trying to discipline us.
Can't you see it?

106
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:40,525
Come on,
Master Kim wouldn't do such a thing.

107
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:41,734
He totally would.

108
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,986
His true craziness...

109
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,364
(sucks teeth, breathes shakily)

110
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:47,824
Oh.

111
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:49,617
You haven't seen it yet, right?

112
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:52,829
His craziness?

113
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,791
Do you know what day it is today?

114
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,377
Today is Friday.

115
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:02,547
You can't imagine it, right?

116
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,133
What Fridays at Doldam Hospital are like.

117
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,468
But if all of us are sent to work
at the Trauma Center,

118
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:11,139
Doldam Hospital will fall into chaos
in no time.

119
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,265
Once that happens,

120
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,935
it'll be worse
than anything you can imagine.

121
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:19,439
Master Kim will eventually
have to take care of all the patients.

122
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,317
Are you sure you can handle it?

123
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,780
That won't happen, Dr. Seo.

124
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:30,783
Once the Trauma Center is up and running,

125
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,119
serious trauma cases will be sent there.

126
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:35,830
Then the number of surgical cases
at Doldam Hospital will decrease.

127
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:38,499
That would mean
it won't be that hard for Master Kim.

128
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,710
(snaps fingers)
That's right.

129
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,670
MUNJEONG: Besides,

130
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,881
we have to tackle this hurdle sometime.

131
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:48,384
We have to see how well we work together
without Master Kim.

132
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:52,597
Isn't it time for us to test ourselves?

133
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,390
Right.

134
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:01,314
Did Master Kim tell you to do this?

135
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,024
To persuade me?

136
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:04,650
Master Kim?

137
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:06,277
-(chuckles)
-(sighs)

138
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,528
Why would he do that?

139
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:09,697
No, he didn't, right?

140
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,407
-INSU: No.
-MUNJEONG: You're right.

141
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,993
(sighs)
Master Kim told us to do this.

142
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,957
Hey, Woojin.

143
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,417
INSU: Woojin!

144
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:25,004
How could you just tell him that?

145
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,005
(sighs)

146
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,216
-He already knew. What else could I do?
-(phone vibrates)

147
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:31,385
Yes, Dr. Nam.

148
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:34,680
No, he won't budge.

149
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:36,891
He just left.

150
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,061
Is that so? Okay.

151
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,607
I guess they couldn't persuade him.

152
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:46,859
(Minguk sighs)

153
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:57,995
(sighs)

154
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,206
MINGUK: If Seo Woojin goes on like this,

155
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:03,084
the Doldam surgeons
might not even get a chance.

156
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,087
Before we even get the chance
to test our teamwork,

157
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:09,257
the Trauma Center will be staffed

158
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,676
by other doctors
brought in by Dr. Cha Jinman.

159
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:15,429
When did you say
the provincial assemblymen were visiting?

160
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,931
Early next week.

161
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:21,310
The budget we can get will likely depend
on how the visit turns out.

162
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,604
What should we do, Master Kim?

163
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:25,690
(sighs)

164
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,527
Let's proceed as it is now.

165
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,988
What about Seo Woojin?

166
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,281
What can we do?

167
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:36,951
It's not like we can force him
to do something he doesn't want.

168
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:41,747
And we can't keep postponing
the opening of the Trauma Center either.

169
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,208
Let's just continue without Seo Woojin,
Director Park.

170
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,045
What will we do about GS without him?

171
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,592
We'll have to go with plan B.

172
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,638
My goodness.

173
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,188
This place looks nice.

174
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,902
It finally looks like a proper hospital.

175
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,530
(chuckles, inhales deeply)

176
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,038
Got it.

177
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:23,956
(chuckles)

178
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:26,751
-Ah...
-(door opens)

179
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,592
(inhales deeply)

180

Dr. Yang Hojun?

183

SABU: So,

184
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,493
I think you'll have to go
to the Trauma Center.

185
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,411
(inhales deeply)
Yang Hojun...

186
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,538
doesn't have a lot of experience
in treating trauma cases,

187
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,540
and it'll be his first time
with Professor Cha.

188
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:10,086
I'm sure they'll need
a skilled pair of hands like yours.

189
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:13,798
But if I go as well, what about you?

190
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,217
I'll stay.

191
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,177
No, there's no need for that.

192
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:22,348
You might as well go
and work as a team too.

193
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:25,309
-Still, we can't both leave the ER.
-(phone rings)

194
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,853
One of us will stay here with you.

195
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,106
I'll stay. Please, Master Kim.

196
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,774
I told you it's fine.

197
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:34,318
Master Kim,
two pesticide-poisoned patients

198
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,403
are arriving in five minutes.

199
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:38,322
There has also been a serial collision
on Route 35 with three injured.

200
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,451
(sighs deeply)

201
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:46,914
-Euntak.
-EUNTAK: Yes.

202
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:50,501
Call Dr. Yoon Areum. Go and get ready.

203
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:51,544
Yes, sir.

204
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,925
I'll leave it to you then.

205
00:11:58,801 --> 00:11:59,802
Yes, Doctor.

206
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,220
Ms. Joo, let's go.

207
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:02,138
Yes, ma'am.

208
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:06,600
Ms. Eom, send the traffic accident cases
to the Trauma Center.

209
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,770
And call Dr. Jang and Dr. Lee.

210
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:10,896
Yes, Master Kim.

211
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:25,286

212
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,330

214
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,459

216
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,842
There has been a serial collision
on Route 35.

217
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,928
Ms. Oh,
have you switched places with Euntak?

218
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:46,474
What can I do?
I hear they need a seasoned player here.

219
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,058
Three injured,

220
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,311
one of which is in cardiac arrest.

221
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,062
They're on their way while performing CPR.

222
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,230
They'll be here in five.

223
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,690
-Got it.
-Ms. Joo.

224
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,902
Stay on the phone with the paramedics
and keep checking on the patient.

225
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,153
Yes, Doctor.

226
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:02,114
Why don't I see one person?

227
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,133
Thanks.

Does my dad get to you that much?

What about you?

We can't keep it a secret forever.

And don't you want to try
and get along with my dad?

249
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,717
You could let him get to know you
from close by,

250
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:30,721
and you could grow closer
as you work in the Trauma Center together.

What?

00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,810
Am I not worthy enough

255
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:38,854
to introduce to your dad?

256
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,774

00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:51,992
I was just curious

262
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:56,580

Keep that in place.

332
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,838
INSU: There's some muscle guarding
in the abdomen.

333
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,090
Dr. Yang, you should check the ultrasound.

334
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,636
Could you stay for the ultrasound?

335
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,096
Why, you...

336
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:44,766
Out of the way, punk.

337
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,560
I said, out of the way.

338
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,941
I'll check your blood pressure
and oxygen levels.

(tense music)

356
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,335
AREUM: Compressions.

357
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:57,547
(Donghwa panting)

358
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:58,924
Charge to 200 joules again.

359
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:01,718
Yes, it's charged.

360
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:02,678
Clear.

361
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,389
-Shock.
-(thumps)

362
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,432
AREUM: Starting compressions again.

363
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,727
(Donghwa panting)

364
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,104
Wait, step back.

365
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,358
I think he's back.

366
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,446
He's back. ROSC.

367
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,532
Let's get a c-line.
Get a chest X-ray and an echo.

368
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,117
-NURSE: Yes, Doctor.
-(sighs in relief)

369
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,451
(flatlining)

370
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:27,619
AREUM: Asystole.
(pants)

371
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:28,954
Starting compressions again.

372
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,835
-(Seonung breathes heavily)
-(Areum pants)

373
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,925
(Areum panting)

374
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:50,892
(Areum exhales deeply)

375
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:03,947
(Donghwa breathes heavily)

376
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,408
(Seonung breathes heavily)

377
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,871
SABU: You should call it now, Dr. Yoon.

378
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,791
(somber music)

379
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:17,044
(Seonung breathes shakily)

380
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:18,920
(Hyeonjeong sighs)

381
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:25,552
(Sabu sighs)

382
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,638
SABU: I think we should let him go now.

383
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:35,062
(phone vibrates)

384
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:38,565
SABU: Yes, Eunjae. What is it?

385
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,033
Dr. Lee.

386
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:51,286
-SEONUNG (sniffles): Yes, Doctor.
-SABU: Come here for a second.

387
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,047
(Donghwa breathes heavily)

388
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,595
DONGHWA:
Aren't you calling the time of death?

389
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:16,520
AREUM (breathes heavily): Time of death,

390
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:19,606
3:26 p.m.

391
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:24,861
Oh, no.

392
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:28,907
(Areum sniffles)

393
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:31,743
AREUM:
I don't even know the patient's name yet.

394
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,210
(Areum sobs)

395
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:44,214
Really?

396
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:46,758
Okay, hang on.

397
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:50,011
Hey, go over
to the Trauma Center right now.

398
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,055
-Cha Eunjae is asking for you urgently.
-What?

399
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,724
-There's no time to waste. Hurry.
-Yes, sir.

400
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:56,810
SABU: Eunjae, Dr. Lee is on his way...

401
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,187
(shouts)
Hey, run like the wind!

402
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,188
(shouts)
Yes, sir!

403
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,523
RESTRICTED AREA
OPERATING ROOM

404
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:03,400
Hey.

405
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:06,194
SABU: Okay, how is everything else?

406
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,824
EUNTAK: Why don't you just go over there?

407
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,870
You want to see how things are going
over there, don't you?

408
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,126
WOOJIN: How many liters did we pump out?

409
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,295
EUNTAK: About five.

410
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:25,672
WOOJIN: Let's check the ABGA.

411
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:35,974
(Woojin sighs)

412
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,523
Hello. How old are you?

413
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:44,774
I'm 17.

414
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:45,734
And your name?

415
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:46,860
Kim Hanul.

416
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,362
How are the others who came with me?

417
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:52,532
The doctors are doing their best
to treat them now.

418
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:54,159
How do you know them?

419
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,328
They're my mom's secretaries.

420
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:58,705
My mom should be on her way now.

421
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:01,917
Do you feel
any pain or discomfort right now?

422
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,085
I feel a bit cold.

423
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,713
My body keeps shaking.

424
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:15,931
The doctor will be here soon
to check on you.

425
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,725
Wait a little longer.

426
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:19,976
Okay.

427
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:27,734
(Insu sighs)

428
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,819
The bleeding is bad.

429
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,572
Which side is that?

430
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,991
INSU: It's near the liver,

431
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,827
but the lungs might be damaged too.

432
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:39,704
I also see a hemothorax.

433
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,206
HEMOTHORAX: BLEEDING IN THE CHEST CAVITY

434
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:44,000
Ms. Joo, let's get a CT scan right away.

435
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,794
Call me as soon as you get the results.

436
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:48,880
We'll assess the hemothorax during surgery
and decide on chest tube placement.

437
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,006
Yes, Doctor.

438
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:53,218
I'll call Professor Cha just in case,

439
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:55,637
so be prepared for that, Dr. Yang.

440
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,349
You want me to do a combined surgery
with Professor Cha?

441
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:02,269
Of course you should do it.
Do you expect me to do it?

442
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:04,854
Why, I ought to...

443
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:08,400
NURSE: Doctor, there's another patient
coming in for a falling accident.

444
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,902
And two more TA cases
from a motorcycle accident.

445
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,153
(sighs)

446
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,321
(shouts)
Dr. Bae!

447
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,115
Wait, Dr. Jung!

448
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:18,868
(sighs)

449
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:37,304
EUNJAE: What do you see?

450
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,849
Oh, are you asking me?

451
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:43,393
Can't you read an echo?

452
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:48,106
No. I mean, yes. The thing is...

453
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:49,649
It's cardiac tamponade. Watch.

454
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,735
EUNJAE:
Do you see the blood pooling in here?

455
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:53,069
Right.

456
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:56,239
Right. I do.

457
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:57,782
Can you do a pericardiocentesis?

458
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:00,744
Sorry, ma'am.

459
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:03,455
I haven't done one on my own yet.

460
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:05,540
Get a double-lumen c-line ready.

461
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:06,833
Yes, Doctor.

462
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,346
I thought you might need one.

463
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:22,766
Oh.

464
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:26,019
Thanks, Dr. Jang.

465
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,113
Is it like that every time?

466
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:39,824
What do you mean?

467
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:41,826
You seemed...

468
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:45,038
really sad.

469
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,501
(sighs)

470
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:50,877
I know, right?

471
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:54,172
I've been seeing this for years now,

472
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:56,758
but I just can't seem to get used to it.

473
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:01,137
I think...

474
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:04,891
declaring a patient's death
is the hardest thing to do.

475
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,019
Well,

476
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:10,271
it would be weird for a doctor

477
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,400
to be too used
to a patient's death, right?

478
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,991
Well,

479
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,035
I'm okay.

480
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:26,996
I'll be fine.

481
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:30,333
If I'm not fine,

482
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:33,002
it'll be harder to treat the next patient.

483
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:35,380
(soft music)

484
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:48,810
You worked hard.

485
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,103
DONGHWA: Thank you.

486
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:52,480
(Donghwa and Areum chuckle softly)

487
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,409
-EUNTAK: Dr. Seo.
-WOOJIN: Yes.

488
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,832
WOOJIN (sighs): The pH is 7.0.

489
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:11,750
Yes.

490
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,960
Let's inject two ampoules of bicarbonate.

491
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:15,795
That won't be enough.

492
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,589
Master Kim.

493
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,716
Have you administered atropine?

494
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,593
We injected 6 ml so far.

495
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:24,721
Seeing how the heart rate is at 120,
I think it's effective.

496
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:30,185
Tachycardia and mydriasis are not
markers of atropinization.

497
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,102
MARKER: SIGNS

498
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,355
-Euntak, suction please.
-EUNTAK: Yes, Doctor.

499
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,232
There need to be fewer secretions.

500
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:39,235
What about pralidoxime?

501
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:41,404
I didn't give him any.

502
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,615
In the case of organophosphate poisoning,

503
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:47,118
you have to administer atropine
and the antidote as well.

504
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,288
-Euntak, I'll do it. Get the 2-PAM.
-Yes, Doctor.

505
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:52,582
Oh. I'll keep that in mind.

506
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:56,336
No, a general surgeon
doesn't need to remember that as well.

507
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:59,297
You taught me
to be a doctor needed by patients.

508
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,423
That's right.

509
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,969
But the place that needs you now
is not here but the OR over there.

510
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:13,686
Honestly, Professor Cha and I
just don't get along.

511
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:18,691
In life, you will run into more people
you don't get along with

512
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,026
than the ones you do.

513
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:22,487
I don't like
the way he treats people either.

514
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:25,240
I don't like
the way you're acting now either.

515
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,868
You haven't actually dealt with him,

516
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,579
but you're full of preconceptions
and aversion.

517
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:34,165
SABU: You keep assuming the worst,
looking for excuses not to do things,

518
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,583
and doing nothing but complain.

519
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,252
Hey.

520
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:40,630
That's what unfounded complaints
and excuses are like.

521
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:44,759
They make you narrow-minded and petty.

522
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,553
-(sighs) Master Kim.
-SABU: Also,

523
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:49,722
what you're doing isn't turning your back
on Dr. Cha Jinman.

524
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:52,517
Know that you're turning your back
on the patients that need your care.

525
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,317
-I've brought the 2-PAM.
-SABU: Thanks.

526
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:04,153
Administer another 6 ml of atropine.

527
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:06,698
And give him two grams of 2-PAM
mixed in with 100 ml NS.

528
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,825
SABU: Let it drip in for 30 minutes.

529
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:12,829
I'll prescribe the maintain dose now.

530
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:13,830
Yes, Doctor.

531
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,001
(pensive music)

532
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,308
Dr. Seo.

533
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:36,603
Yes, Master Kim is right about everything.
I know that.

534
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,146
I do,

535
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:40,273
but that won't change my mind.

536
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:42,525
There's a TA patient
with a ruptured lung and liver.

537
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:46,446
They need a combined CT surgery,
which Dr. Yang is prepping for now.

538
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:47,572
Why is Dr. Yang doing that?

539
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,450
If it's the liver,
shouldn't Professor Park do it?

540
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:53,328
Professor Park is out
for the provincial assembly meeting.

541
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:57,040
Dr. Yang is the only general surgeon
in the Trauma Center now.

542
00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,542
(sighs)

543
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,590
(Hojun breathes nervously)

544
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:07,842
(sighs)

545
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,722
Who's the CT surgeon on the surgery?

546
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,807
Professor Cha Jinman.

547
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,685
(tense music)

548
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:18,603
(scoffs)

549
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,698
MYEONGSIM: We finally get to see
Professor Cha's skills.

550
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:33,534
DOIL: We don't really have to see
his skills. They're the best.

551
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:34,911
MYEONGSIM: Is he that good?

552
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:37,914
DOIL: He was the only surgeon
that Master Kim was jealous of.

553
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:42,585
Can I see the scans?

554
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,128
Yes, Professor.

555
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,007
JINMAN: Down a bit more.

556
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,218
A little more.

557
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:53,846
JINMAN: Yes, right there.

558
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,766
The bleeding is worse than I thought.

559
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,769
JINMAN: The liver seems badly damaged.

560
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:01,896
Dr. Yang,
what are your plans for the surgery?

561
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,190
-Pardon?
-What do you plan to do?

562
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,943
Well, the thing is...

563
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:12,782
We'll go in and stop the bleeding first.

564
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:16,119
Then we'll check the damaged areas
and cut them out.

565
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:19,622
If that doesn't work,
I'll do damage control...

566
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:23,209
After that, I'll do the second surgery--

567
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:24,919
WOOJIN: I'll start with a segmentectomy.

568
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:27,380
HOJUN: Dr. Seo.

569
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,007
You're here.

570
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,383
What are you doing here?

571
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:36,764
Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Surgery
is Dr. Seo's specialty, you see.

572
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,058
I called him in urgently, Professor.

573
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,644
I'm telling you.

574
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,730
It's not that I can't do it.

575
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,606
I can do it, if I have to.

576
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:48,443
But this is a combined surgery
with Professor Cha.

577
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:52,697
Hey, Professor Cha is stepping in himself.

578
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:54,741
And I'm not good enough for this.

579
00:33:55,324 --> 00:34:00,038
As you know,
I did my fellowship on colon surgery.

580
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:03,499
And you have a bit more experience
in dealing with trauma cases than me.

581
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:06,794
What can I do?

582
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:09,297
Experience trumps everything in the OR.

583
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:11,549
You should step up to the plate, Woojin.

584
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:16,637
Do you specialize in HPB?

585
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:17,972
I have multiple specialties.

586
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,601
-Did you check the scans?
-I checked them before coming.

587
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,270
I gave him all the information,
Professor Cha.

588
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,313
(chuckles)

589
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,731
Will you start with the liver?

590
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:27,899
Yes, sir.

591
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:29,692
I'll start the approach
with the liver dome

592
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:31,569
and proceed to the wound on the lungs.

593
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:35,031
However, there is the possibility
of a diaphragm injury too.

594
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:38,284
Are you saying the lungs will be fine?

595
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,453
Seeing that there are

596
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:44,207
contusions, hematocele, and hemothorax
on the lung parenchyma,

597
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:46,292
there will be injuries to the lungs too.

598
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:49,712
But there wasn't that much blood
that was drained after the thoracostomy.

599
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,257
If a diaphragm injury is present too,
there's a chance

600
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:56,177
that blood from the liver
went to the thoracic cavity.

601
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,555
Is there a possibility that the hemothorax
went down to the liver

602
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,432
due to the diaphragm injury?

603
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:02,642
That's possible too,

604
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:04,936
but there was
contrast medium extravasation,

605
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,688
which suggests
liver bleeding is more likely.

606
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:12,944
That's why it would be right to check
the liver first and work our way up.

607
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,949
(suction whirring)

608
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,285
Okay.

609
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,996
Things are looking hopeful.

610
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,125
I guess we've overcome a hurdle.

611
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,627
MINGUK: For both you and Dr. Seo Woojin.

612
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:33,548
As you said,
Dr. Yang Hojun played his part well.

613
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,676
SABU: Euntak.

614
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:39,303
Get the maintain dose
that I prescribed earlier.

615
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:40,304
Yes, Doctor.

616
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:47,812
What were you planning to do
if Dr. Seo held out until the end?

617
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:51,399
That's why I asked you to be on standby

618
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,067
-as our plan C.
-(both chuckle)

619
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:57,864
Anyway, I'm glad
I didn't have to cancel the meeting.

620
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,448
It's an important meeting

621
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,284
about the support fund
for the Trauma Center.

622
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:04,453
I've heard that the assemblywoman
in charge of our budget

623
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,873
-is a very strict person.
-(breathes deeply)

624
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:07,832
All right.

625
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:09,292
SABU: I wish you luck, Director Park.

626
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:11,335
Call me if you need anything.

627
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,379
Okay. I'll be back.

628
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:14,547
-I'll leave it to you.
-Okay.

629
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,427
(phone vibrates)

630
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:24,891
They must be getting started.

631
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:36,360
WOOJIN:
Then we will now begin the surgery.

632
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:38,362
Scalpel.

633
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:40,239
(bright music)

634
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,335
WOOJIN: Forceps.

635
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,900
(sighs)
I don't see anything.

636
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:26,869
Why? Is something wrong?

637
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,913
No, it's not that.

638
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,793
I think there's some gas in the bowels.

639
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,046
(tense music)

640
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:43,302
Let's get a CT scan first.

641
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:45,179
What?

642
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:49,308
Since the gas in the bowels
is obstructing the view,

643
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:50,893
let's get a CT scan first.

644
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,313
(mouthing)

645
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,859
Don't you think you could get a visual
if you push the air out?

646
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:04,490
I just gave you an order, Mr. Park.

647
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:08,619
Do as you're told.

648
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:14,709
Let me see.

649
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:19,839
Hello, I'm Master Kim, Chief of Surgery.

650
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:22,675
(Sabu grunts, exhales deeply)

651
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:25,553
All right, let's take a look.

652
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:32,768
In most cases, if you push down like this,

653
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,647
the gas will move around.

654
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,817
Most patients who come to the ER

655
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:42,194
don't come in after fasting.

656
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,196
So it's more likely to happen.

657
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:47,992
You have to have a soothing touch.

658
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,411
Apply pressure

659
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,455
little by little.

660
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:03,674
(tense music)

661
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:08,554
Do you see that?

662
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:14,685
What does that look like
in the right corner?

663
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:17,563
DONGHWA: Well,

664
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,274
it looks like a mass.

665
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:23,069
Could it be a tumor?

666
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,616
Take another good look.

667
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,418
Hmm?

668
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,879
AREUM (gasps): Wow!

669
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:43,756
-It's a beautiful baby.
-(Sabu chuckles softly)

670
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,800
-Congratulations, ma'am.
-(chuckles)

671
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,134
She's pregnant?

672
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,637
Really? Is that really our baby?

673
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,722
Yes, you're pregnant.

674
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:54,350
SABU:
You may experience implantation cramps

675
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:56,394
in the early stages of pregnancy.

676
00:39:56,477 --> 00:40:00,064
You should visit an OB-GYN
and get a checkup.

677
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:01,440
Congratulations.

678
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:02,650
Thank you.

679
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,276
SABU: Congratulations.

680
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,986
(Sabu chuckles)

681
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,030
I'll leave you to wrap up.

682
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,493
(sighs, chuckles)

683
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,296
Mr. Park.

684
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:27,466
Can I have a word?

685
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,149
DONGHWA: What...

686
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,861
What did you just do
in front of the patient?

687
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,196
Are you looking down on me
because I'm a resident?

688
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,865
Mm...

689
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,533
Not knowing something

690
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:55,703
is nothing to be ashamed of.
You can learn.

691
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,122
EUNTAK: But I believe hiding the fact

692
00:40:58,205 --> 00:40:59,707
that you don't know something
is dangerous.

693
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:04,044
I've learned CT scans in early pregnancy
should be done with caution.

694
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,463
Are you lecturing me now?

695
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:08,132
I'm not lecturing you.
I'm just saying what I think.

696
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:10,426
Then I'll tell you what I think too.

697
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:13,053
Even if I'm a resident,
I'm a doctor, and you're a nurse.

698
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:16,682
I give the orders
and you just have to listen.

699
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:19,685
You should be aware of that. Okay?

700
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:20,853
I'm well aware.

701
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:23,731
You didn't know what to do
in front of the patient.

702
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,692
(tense music)

703
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:28,110
Are you done?

704
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:30,571
We still have lots of emergency patients.

705
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,866
Yes, I'm done. Go back inside.

706
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:41,290
(phone vibrates)

707
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:45,961
(phone closes)

708
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,298
ASSEMBLYWOMAN KO KYUNGSOOK

709
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,342
(phone rings)

710
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:52,635
MINGUK: Hello?

711
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:56,931
Yes, ma'am. I was just on my way.

712
00:41:58,974 --> 00:41:59,808
What?

713
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:01,352
Your son?

714
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:02,686
What?

715
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,689
The provincial assemblywoman's son
is at our hospital?

716
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,150
No, I haven't heard anything.

717
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:11,654
Yes, sir. I'll check right away
and call you back.

718
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:15,658
ER REGISTRATION

719
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,202
Is this the Trauma Center?

720
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,581
EUNJAE: How are his vitals?

721
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:27,211
SEONUNG: It's 120/70.
The heart rate is okay too.

722
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:28,337
EUNJAE: Okay.

723
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,673
We've done the most urgent part.

724
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:33,259
Let's keep an eye on the patient
and decide whether to do surgery.

725
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:36,053
EUNJAE: Let's discuss it
when the family gets here.

726
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:37,763
SEONUNG: Okay.

727
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:44,895
EUNJAE: Is it hard?

728
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:48,566
SEONUNG: No, Doctor. I'm fine.

729
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:51,652
But the thing is...

730
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,197
Why did you call me?

731
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:58,742
I acted like such a fool in the OR.

732
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,995
EUNJAE: I know, right?
I didn't know you were like that.

733
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:04,832
That's why you should see more

734
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,667
and experience more.

735
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:09,795
You should get more hands-on experience
with the patients.

736
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:14,550
(soft music)

737
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:18,679
EUNJAE: Even if you study hard,
memorize things, and watch videos,

738
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:20,431
nothing beats actual experience.

739
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:22,558
I know this from experience too.

740
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:24,977
SEONUNG: Yes, Doctor.

741
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,271
EUNJAE:
Practice reading ultrasounds more too.

742
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:30,858
Doldam Hospital gets
more emergency patients than outpatients.

743
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,943
Most patients will require ultrasounds.

744
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,403
It'll be hard if you can't read it.

745
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:37,239
SEONUNG: Yes, Doctor. I'll study hard.

746
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:40,159
EUNJAE: Follow up on this patient
for another hour,

747
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:41,744
and call me if anything is wrong.

748
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,641
(patient groans)

749
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:05,184
-It's okay.
-PATIENT: But it hurts so much.

750
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:06,560
You're doing well.

751
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:08,854
(patient grunts)

752
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,023
(soft laugh)

753
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:18,447
(sighs)

754
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:26,205
I'll clip this back on.

755
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,333
(flatlining)

756
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:31,335
Huh?

757
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:40,344
(tense music)

758
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:42,680
-(beeping)
-(shouts) CPR!

759
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:43,931
We need to start CPR!

760
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:50,437
Dr. Jung!

761
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:52,564
The observation patient is in arrest.

762
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:55,484
Was there another patient?

763
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:57,486
MYEONGSIM: Dr. Jung.

764
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:00,197
There's one more patient
in the observation area.

765
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,074
He's in his late teens.

766
00:45:02,157 --> 00:45:05,786
His injuries seem minor,
but I think you should still check.

767
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:08,789
-Ms. Joo, take over here.
-(clattering)

768
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:36,275
Let's intubate him, quickly!

769
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:39,111
EUNJAE: Is there anyone
to take over compressions?

770
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:41,989
Let's switch.

771
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,907
-Are we ready to intubate?
-NURSE: Yes, Doctor.

772
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:00,632
(exhales shakily)

773
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:13,270
Where is the high school student
who came in from a traffic accident?

774
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:15,522
NURSE: Over there...

775
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:24,198
(breathes shakily)

776
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:55,187
DOLDAM HOSPITAL TRAUMA CENTER

777
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:05,447
DOLDAM HOSPITAL TRAUMA CENTER

778
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:14,706
(solemn music)

779
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:27,928
(sighs)

780
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:43,735
(sighs)

781
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,243
What do you mean?

782
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:54,788
The son of a provincial assemblywoman came
to the Trauma Center after a car accident,

783
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:57,749
but he just died of cardiac arrest.

784
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,043
(sighs)

785
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:02,087
GITAE: But that assemblywoman

786
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:04,673
happens to be in charge
of our Trauma Center's budget review.

787
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:07,718
It's Assemblywoman Ko Kyungsook.

788
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:13,223
My goodness.

789
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:30,782
Assemblywoman Ko.

790
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:34,661
I don't know what kind
of words of consolation will help.

791
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:39,458
Don't try to console me.

792
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:44,254
You shouldn't try to console others
if you don't have the right to do so.

793
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:47,466
(sniffles)

794
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:50,969
This is medical malpractice, isn't it?

795
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:53,013
(Kyungsook breathes deeply)

796
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:57,768
KYUNGSOOK: He was perfectly conscious
when he arrived at the hospital.

797
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:59,186
I even talked to him on the phone.

798
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,647
So why...

799
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:04,942
(Kyungsook sobbing)

800
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:06,693
Who's the doctor in charge?

801
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:08,528
Who is it?

802
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:12,950
(yelling)
Which idiot doctor did this to my son?

803
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:16,203
(Kyungsook groans, breathes heavily)

804
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:19,122
-Ma'am.
-Or maybe,

805
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:22,125
a doctor didn't even come to check on him.

806
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:23,919
Is that it?

807
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:26,129
Did you neglect him like this

808
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:29,967
and leave my son to die?

809
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:33,637
(Kyungsook breathing heavily)

810
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:36,223
I'm sure that wasn't the case.

811
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,433
(tragic music)

812
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:43,105
I will look into what happened right away.

813
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:45,107
(scoffs, breathes shakily)

814
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:51,071
You all better be prepared.

815
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:56,368
Got it? For dereliction of duty,
medical malpractice,

816
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:04,418
and the murder of my son.
I will charge you for these crimes.

817
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,758
(Kyungsook cries)

818
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:21,643
(Kyungsook wailing)

819
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:26,356
WOOJIN: CUSA.

820
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:48,420
Removing the specimen now.

821
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:50,505
(hopeful music)

822
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:59,473
I've gotten all the small bleeders too.

823
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:00,390
Richardson.

824
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:11,610
I don't see a diaphragm injury,

825
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:15,655
but the bleeding is increasing.

826
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,449
I'll change position now.

827
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:26,249
Give me some wraps.

828
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:37,928
JINMAN (in English): Position change.

829
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:39,888
DOIL (in Korean):
Bringing the bed back to normal.

830
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:51,399
JINMAN: Let's proceed to the lungs.

831
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:53,610
Scalpel.

832
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:56,738
There will be some blood.

833
00:51:57,989 --> 00:52:00,450
(tense music)

834
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:01,952
Scissors.

835
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:06,456
WOOJIN: More gauze, please.

836
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:10,544
JINMAN: Retractor.

837
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:28,395
Good. It's here.

838
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:31,189
Clamp.

839
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:36,820
WOOJIN: There's too much bleeding.
Should we do a lobectomy?

840
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:39,322
JINMAN: Let's try a suture ligation
on the bleeding site,

841
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:40,490
but if it doesn't work,

842
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:41,741
we can do a lobectomy.

843
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:43,368
Vicryl 3-0.

844
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:55,046
JINMAN: Dr. Seo. Tie.

845
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:57,215
WOOJIN: Tie.

846
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:16,484
-JINMAN: Tie.
-WOOJIN: Tie.

847
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,073
-WOOJIN: Cut.
-HOJUN: Cut.

848
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,492
JINMAN: Let's check for air leakage.

849
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:25,785
Irrigation, please.

850
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,999
Anesthesiologist, get the Ambu bag ready.

851
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:32,667
Pressure 25.

852
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:35,170
DOIL: Yes, I'll drain the mucus
and get the Ambu bag.

853
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:44,095
There's almost no air leakage.

854
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:45,472
WOOJIN: Did it work?

855
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:46,973
JINMAN: Okay, off.

856
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:47,974
HOJUN: Off.

857
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:50,894
DOIL: Do we not have to do a lobectomy?

858
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:52,229
JINMAN: I think we can leave it.

859
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:54,189
DOIL: Okay, got it.

860
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:55,690
JINMAN: I'll leave the rest to you.

861
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:18,171
-(door opens)
-EUNJAE: Hey.

862
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:28,932
Go ahead.

863
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:30,809
Just do as you used to.

864
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:38,483
(coins clattering)

865
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:42,404
I thought
you weren't going to go into the OR?

866
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,864
I wasn't going to until the end,

867
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:46,950
but they said Hojun would have to do it.

868
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:49,369
(sighs)

869
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:53,373
I knew it. Hojun sure is amazing.

870
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:57,085
It wasn't Master Kim or Professor Cha,

871
00:54:57,711 --> 00:55:00,171
but Hojun who changed your mind.

872
00:55:01,172 --> 00:55:02,048
(soft chuckle)

873
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:03,591
Is that so?

874
00:55:10,348 --> 00:55:11,516
You know,

875
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:14,936
you're actually pretty cool.

876
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:21,276
Sometimes, you're so cool
that you make me feel small.

877
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,445
That's how I feel about you.

878
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:27,615
But you know, Woojin.

879
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:30,744
Despite all that,

880
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:33,997
telling my dad that we moved in together

881
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:35,790
is not that easy.

882
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:38,376
(soft music)

883
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,837
Honestly, ask any daughter in Korea.

884
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,340
It's hard to tell your dad
about something like this.

885
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:47,761
And you keep butting heads
with my dad too.

886
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:53,224
On one hand, I have the guy I love.

887
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:55,894
On the other hand,
I have my dad whom I love.

888
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:57,479
What can I do?

889
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:04,152
I just wanted you to try
and get closer to my dad.

890
00:56:09,824 --> 00:56:11,993
That's just how I felt.

891
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:32,097
Let's stay like this for a bit.

892
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:34,557
I need to recharge too.

893
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:40,146
Maybe it was because I was apart from you
for too long.

894
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:42,774
Maybe that's why I was upset.

895
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:54,452
Okay.

896
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:45,462
Professor. Here you are.

897
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:46,921
Yes.

898
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:49,632
(exhales deeply)

899
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:53,720
I was so moved by today's surgery.

900
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:59,726
I can't believe
I got to see you in action in person.

901
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,853
It was such an honor.

902
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:05,648
Where's the patient?

903
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:09,068
He's in the ICU.
I'll continue to follow up on him.

904
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:10,737
By the way,

905
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:13,448
there's been a problem.

906
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:19,412
NURSE: We'll cover him now.

907
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,998
(solemn music)

908
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:45,647
The situation doesn't seem good.

909
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:48,399
On the first day of the trial opening
of the Trauma Center, no less.

910
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:51,486
Should we let Master Kim know?

911
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:54,239
I'm not sure.

912
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:01,287
Administrator Cha.

913
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:25,770
You may step out now.

914
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:27,814
Go and tend to your patients.

915
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:29,357
MINGUK: Excuse me.

916
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:30,858
Professor Cha.

917
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:39,325
I'm Cha Jinman, head of the Trauma Center.

918
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:41,369
I'm in charge here.

919
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:43,454
This is provincial assemblywoman
Ko Kyungsook.

920
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:45,623
Yes, I've heard.

921
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:49,168
My son is dead.

922
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:55,341
These doctors neglected my son,
and now, my precious child is dead.

923
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:57,802
I am sorry about your son.

924
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:01,764
But he wasn't neglected.
He just wasn't our priority.

925
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:05,810
In trauma, we don't treat patients
based on who arrived first.

926
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:08,771
We must treat patients
who are more urgent.

927
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,941
He died,

928
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:14,360
and you say it wasn't urgent?

929
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:17,530
That's why he wasn't a priority?

930
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:21,951
Do you think you can convince me
with those words?

931
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:25,371
I'm not trying to convince you.
I'm explaining it to you.

932
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:26,456
If that's the case,

933
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:29,542
you can explain it in court.

934
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:33,463
I've already decided to file
for criminal charges.

935
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:37,467
(tense music)

936
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:41,095
JINMAN: Do you perhaps know
who the more urgent patients were

937
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:42,680
besides your son?

938
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:47,518
They were your secretaries.

939
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:49,604
One person was in cardiac arrest,

940
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:53,608
and the other was in a coma
with a ruptured liver and lung.

941
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:57,570
And I just finished operating
on one of those two patients.

942
01:00:58,237 --> 01:00:59,697
In comparison,

943
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:03,826
your son was conscious enough
to speak to you on the phone.

944
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,328
When we asked him how he felt,

945
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:08,456
he didn't complain
of any particular aches or pains.

946
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:11,125
If you were a doctor,

947
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:14,962
who would you have judged
was the more urgent patient?

948
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:16,464
Look here.

949
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:19,550
I'm a politician, not a doctor.

950
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:20,635
By that, do you mean

951
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:23,846
you don't care
about your secretaries' lives

952
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:26,641
and that your son is
the only important patient?

953
01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:27,725
(shouts)
Look here!

954
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:28,851
JINMAN: Not once,

955
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:32,271
ever since I stepped foot in this room,

956
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:35,525
did you ask
how your secretaries were doing.

957
01:01:35,608 --> 01:01:37,944
-(inhales sharply)
-JINMAN: Besides,

958
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:41,989
they are paid by the government
to aid you govern the province.

959
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:43,032
So why is it

960
01:01:43,574 --> 01:01:46,327
that they were driving your son
during work hours?

961
01:01:47,912 --> 01:01:51,624
It's not like your teenage son
would've been performing public duties.

962
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:56,295
If you decide to file charges,

963
01:01:57,171 --> 01:01:58,172
go ahead.

964
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:02,176
People threatening doctors
to sue for malpractice

965
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:04,679
isn't really surprising to us anymore.

966
01:02:07,306 --> 01:02:08,307
I'll see you in court.

967
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:10,977
But you will also...

968
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:14,188
have to answer all the questions...

969
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:17,734
that I just asked you.

970
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:24,282
Dr. Jung.

971
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:44,427
It's sad that a patient has died.

972
01:02:45,052 --> 01:02:48,097
But I hope you don't blame yourselves
too much or feel too guilty.

973
01:02:50,224 --> 01:02:54,103
You are the ones
who are doing your best in every moment

974
01:02:54,979 --> 01:02:56,689
to save a patient
in an emergency situation.

975
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:01,194
Nobody can blame you.

976
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:03,070
I won't let anyone

977
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:05,031
blame you.

978
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:12,830
Dr. Jung Insu.

979
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:15,541
Stand up straight.

980
01:03:21,547 --> 01:03:22,632
(sighs)

981
01:03:28,846 --> 01:03:30,556
GITAE: Huh?

982
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:32,266
What was that?

983
01:03:32,725 --> 01:03:34,894
They say
you can't judge a book by its cover.

984
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:36,646
I didn't know he could be so cool.

985
01:03:37,438 --> 01:03:38,439
You think he's cool?

986
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:40,358
Is that how you see it?

987
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:43,986
He saved Dr. Jung from a crisis.

988
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:45,822
GITAE: He went in
and took care of business.

989
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:48,366
He took his junior's side
and said his piece.

990
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:50,910
That's how
the head of the Trauma Center should be.

991
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:52,870
Honestly, I feel so relieved.

992
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:56,833
Look here. You feel relieved?

993
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:59,585
A 17-year-old boy just died.

994
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:02,004
MYEONGSIM: The woman in that room

995
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:04,173
is not an assemblywoman or a politician.

996
01:04:04,715 --> 01:04:06,509
She's a mom who has lost her son.

997
01:04:07,718 --> 01:04:08,761
Can't you see that?

998
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:09,762
What?

999
01:04:10,429 --> 01:04:12,014
Well, that's...

1000
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:48,801
SABU: Can't you see
that super inflamed bile duct?

1001
01:04:49,468 --> 01:04:50,678
DONGHWA: Pardon?

1002
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:55,308
Oh, then...

1003
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:57,977
SABU: Indigestion, abdominal pain,
high fever, and jaundice.

1004
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:00,438
What is the clinical diagnosis
for these symptoms?

1005
01:05:04,483 --> 01:05:07,445
It's cholangitis.

1006
01:05:07,528 --> 01:05:08,446
Then what do you do?

1007
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:12,074
So, we should do an ERCP or MRCP...

1008
01:05:12,658 --> 01:05:14,952
You should check his labs first.

1009
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:16,203
Oh, right.

1010
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:18,998
Let's get his lab tests done first.

1011
01:05:19,081 --> 01:05:20,082
Yes, Doctor.

1012
01:05:27,006 --> 01:05:29,258
(chuckles)
All right.

1013
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:32,553
(sighs)

1014
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:37,058
(keyboard clacking)

1015
01:05:37,141 --> 01:05:40,227
CAME IN COMPLAINING OF INDIGESTION,
ABDOMINAL PAIN, FEVER, AND JAUNDICE...

1016
01:05:46,817 --> 01:05:48,110
SABU: Do you know

1017
01:05:48,819 --> 01:05:51,614
what the greatest weakness
of an ultrasound is?

1018
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:55,868
That it relies on the administrator?

1019
01:05:56,452 --> 01:05:58,162
You don't see it just by learning.

1020
01:05:58,871 --> 01:06:01,123
You have to keep seeing it
to be able to see anything.

1021
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:06,504
You must learn to read it properly
to give proper orders,

1022
01:06:06,587 --> 01:06:11,217
and only then will the nurses
trust your orders and follow them.

1023
01:06:14,845 --> 01:06:19,642
You should be embarrassed
that you gave a nurse the wrong order.

1024
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:23,688
Nitpicking the nurse
who caught your mistake

1025
01:06:24,271 --> 01:06:27,525
makes you look really petty.

1026
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:31,278
Got it, Dr. Jang Donghwa?

1027
01:06:34,615 --> 01:06:35,533
(sighs)

1028
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:40,329
Are you taking

1029
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:42,915
Euntak's side this time?

1030
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:45,126
NURSE'S STATION

1031
01:06:45,209 --> 01:06:46,419
No, I'm not.

1032
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:48,045
I'm taking your side.

1033
01:06:51,882 --> 01:06:52,967
I want you...

1034
01:06:54,051 --> 01:06:56,429
to become a respectable doctor.

1035
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:07,064
Gosh, it seems like
we're about done for the day.

1036
01:07:07,314 --> 01:07:09,150
Can I go inside for a while?

1037
01:07:09,984 --> 01:07:11,819
SABU: Have fun being on call.

1038
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:16,365
Call me
as soon as you get the lab results.

1039
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:18,617
(pensive music)

1040
01:07:27,251 --> 01:07:28,335
(sighs)

1041
01:07:28,419 --> 01:07:29,920
(phone vibrates)

1042
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:36,135
Yes, it's me. What is it?

1043
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:08,667
Yes, come in.

1044
01:08:12,463 --> 01:08:13,297
What are you doing?

1045
01:08:14,298 --> 01:08:16,509
I was going over today's surgery.

1046
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:19,929
JINMAN: I was honestly surprised.

1047
01:08:20,638 --> 01:08:24,558
For the past few years,
I haven't seen a pair of hands

1048
01:08:25,392 --> 01:08:26,560
move so swiftly and precisely.

1049
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:31,023
I feel as though I've met a true surgeon
after a long while.

1050
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:32,942
I had fun.

1051
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:39,615
I formally apologize
for calling you Bu Yongju's minion.

1052
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:42,701
That's just
how dads with daughters are like.

1053
01:08:44,161 --> 01:08:46,163
The guys that steal our daughters' hearts

1054
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:48,791
all look like darned thieves to us.

1055
01:08:50,918 --> 01:08:52,545
Did you know already?

1056
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:53,671
Of course.

1057
01:08:55,464 --> 01:08:56,382
Did you think I didn't?

1058
01:08:57,424 --> 01:08:59,844
Eunjae said she hid it really well.

1059
01:08:59,927 --> 01:09:02,012
Don't you know that she's a clumsy kid?

1060
01:09:02,388 --> 01:09:03,639
She's just tall.

1061
01:09:03,722 --> 01:09:04,849
(soft chuckle)

1062
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:07,810
I know.

1063
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:11,772
Just because I know about you guys
doesn't mean I approve yet.

1064
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:14,233
Don't relax too much.

1065
01:09:15,526 --> 01:09:17,194
Yes, sir.

1066
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:20,573
Have a seat. Shall we watch some more?

1067
01:09:38,215 --> 01:09:39,592
JINMAN: I have a sense of desire.

1068
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:44,555
The moment I saw that kid operate,

1069
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:47,641
and...

1070
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:51,478
as I was performing surgery
with a talented team,

1071
01:09:52,062 --> 01:09:54,315
a feeling of wanting to make
all of this mine

1072
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:56,275
grew inside me.

1073
01:09:57,943 --> 01:10:00,487
So, I've decided to do so.

1074
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:02,531
Bu Yongju.

1075
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:05,242
I must possess everything

1076
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:08,454
that you have achieved.

1077
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:16,712
-(keyboard clicks)
-JINMAN: You're good at making decisions,

1078
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:18,505
and you have great hands.

1079
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:22,134
I liked your anatomical approach as well.

1080
01:10:26,597 --> 01:10:28,057
WOOJIN: This part turned out great.

1081
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:35,606
That was nice.

1082
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:38,567
I have a lot of experience
dealing with hemothorax.

1083
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:55,417
DOLDAM HOSPITAL TRAUMA CENTER

1084
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:05,803
Did he say his name was Cha Jinman?

1085
01:11:07,429 --> 01:11:09,139
The new head of the Trauma Center, I mean.

1086
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:11,100
Yes, that's right.

1087
01:11:12,643 --> 01:11:13,769
That man

1088
01:11:13,852 --> 01:11:15,896
would've made a great politician.

1089
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:19,233
He threw a good punch.

1090
01:11:21,318 --> 01:11:25,030
Don't worry. I won't file criminal charges
against the hospital.

1091
01:11:25,656 --> 01:11:27,574
KYUNGSOOK:
I've been in politics for long enough.

1092
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:32,204
I have that much sense of reality.

1093
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:39,128
But you'll have to be prepared
for an all-out war, Master Kim.

1094
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:44,383
The head of your Trauma Center
came at me asking for a political war,

1095
01:11:44,466 --> 01:11:46,385
so I should pay you back with politics.

1096
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:48,095
Excuse me, ma'am.

1097
01:11:48,762 --> 01:11:50,681
That wasn't Master Kim's intention.

1098
01:11:50,764 --> 01:11:52,558
I don't care whose intention it was.

1099
01:11:55,477 --> 01:11:57,021
My son is dead,

1100
01:11:58,939 --> 01:12:02,067
and you people didn't do anything
for my son.

1101
01:12:03,444 --> 01:12:05,904
I will not stop...

1102
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:09,700
until you repent and admit what you did.

1103
01:12:09,783 --> 01:12:12,536
(tense music)

1104
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:30,095
EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICE

1105
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:38,979
What do we do?

1106
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:42,066
If we can't get
any of the province's budget...

1107
01:12:42,483 --> 01:12:45,277
won't we be facing
a huge crisis from the get-go?

1108
01:12:47,529 --> 01:12:49,990
Let's go inside. It's cold.

1109
01:13:12,304 --> 01:13:13,305
Master Kim.

1110
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:17,601
I...

1111
01:13:20,354 --> 01:13:23,273
will take responsibility.
(breathes shakily)

1112
01:13:24,358 --> 01:13:26,318
(tense music continues)

1113
01:13:32,366 --> 01:13:34,493
(voice breaking)
I forgot about that patient.

1114
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:40,582
That's why he died.
(sobs)

1115
01:13:44,586 --> 01:13:46,422
It's my fault.
(sniffles)

1116
01:13:46,505 --> 01:13:47,506
Master Kim.

1117
01:13:51,885 --> 01:13:52,886
I will...

1118
01:13:55,305 --> 01:13:57,015
I will take full responsibility.

1119
01:14:00,936 --> 01:14:02,312
INSU: I'm sorry.

1120
01:14:05,816 --> 01:14:07,985
(sobbing)

1121
01:14:28,046 --> 01:14:29,131
DONGHWA: What are you doing?

1122
01:14:29,923 --> 01:14:31,967
I was reviewing an echocardiogram.

1123
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:34,678
It seems to be a necessary skill
at Doldam Hospital.

1124
01:14:38,182 --> 01:14:39,016
Hey.

1125
01:14:46,356 --> 01:14:47,900
Do you want to do it with me?

1126
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:56,116
HOPE, LOVE, SERVICE

1127
01:14:59,119 --> 01:15:00,370
(whispers)
Come on.

1128
01:15:00,537 --> 01:15:01,455
Quiet!

1129
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:06,084
Let's go.

1130
01:15:16,803 --> 01:15:17,804
Should I...

1131
01:15:18,722 --> 01:15:19,973
lie down first?

1132
01:15:20,057 --> 01:15:21,225
I will...

1133
01:15:23,227 --> 01:15:24,311
lie down first.

1134
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:26,688
You can go first.

1135
01:15:35,113 --> 01:15:35,948
Oh!

1136
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:37,699
Is it...

1137
01:15:38,992 --> 01:15:40,536
okay for us to do this?

1138
01:15:41,119 --> 01:15:43,497
You know
that we can't go on like this anymore.

1139
01:15:44,706 --> 01:15:45,749
SEONUNG: Let's start

1140
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:48,502
being honest with each other now.

1141
01:15:48,585 --> 01:15:49,836
We should admit what we have to.

1142
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:54,424
At Doldam Hospital, the nurses are better
at reading ultrasounds than us.

1143
01:15:57,177 --> 01:15:58,095
(sighs)

1144
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:07,604
DONGHWA: I'll do it.

1145
01:16:14,111 --> 01:16:15,237
It's cold.

1146
01:16:21,952 --> 01:16:23,912
You must've had a big dinner.

1147
01:16:24,496 --> 01:16:25,455
I had a piece of bread.

1148
01:16:27,165 --> 01:16:29,376
And just a carton of milk. Why?

1149
01:16:30,002 --> 01:16:31,128
Can't you see very clearly?

1150
01:16:39,803 --> 01:16:40,804
(sighs)

1151
01:16:44,933 --> 01:16:45,934
I'm sorry.

1152
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:48,145
I don't think I can do this.

1153
01:16:49,938 --> 01:16:51,023
What are you saying?

1154
01:16:52,649 --> 01:16:54,484
Are you saying you want to give up now?

1155
01:16:54,568 --> 01:16:56,153
No, you can't do that.

1156
01:16:57,029 --> 01:16:59,031
-Take it off now.
-What?

1157
01:16:59,114 --> 01:17:00,574
It's my turn now.

1158
01:17:01,366 --> 01:17:02,576
Hurry up and take it off.

1159
01:17:02,659 --> 01:17:03,744
Uh...

1160
01:17:04,911 --> 01:17:05,871
Okay.

1161
01:17:10,709 --> 01:17:12,336
You should take this arm out first.

1162
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:14,588
No, to the back like this.

1163
01:17:15,339 --> 01:17:17,966
The back has to go up first
and push this...

1164
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:19,092
DONGHWA: Wait!

1165
01:17:22,179 --> 01:17:27,059
No, it's not what you think.
We were just trying...

1166
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:33,774
I see. You were practicing
reading ultrasounds, right?

1167
01:17:34,524 --> 01:17:37,277
Why were you doing it in secret here?
You could do it in the ER.

1168
01:17:38,111 --> 01:17:38,945
Can you see anything?

1169
01:17:42,949 --> 01:17:44,534
SEONUNG: I had some bread and milk.

1170
01:17:45,285 --> 01:17:46,286
Actually, I had some rice cakes too.

1171
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:47,954
(Areum and Donghwa laugh)

1172
01:17:48,747 --> 01:17:50,165
SEONUNG: They might have been bad.

1173
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:52,376
I had garae-tteok too.

1174
01:17:52,959 --> 01:17:55,128
AREUM: Seriously,
you don't have to tell us all that.

1175
01:17:55,962 --> 01:17:57,798
-See that?
-SEONUNG: Gosh.

1176
01:17:58,382 --> 01:18:00,008
AREUM: A little to the back.

1177
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:02,969
DONGHWA: I don't see anything.

1178
01:18:03,053 --> 01:18:06,598
No, you have to go like this,

1179
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:09,935
and the angle
should be pointing to the back more.

1180
01:18:10,936 --> 01:18:11,770
Like that.

1181
01:18:12,813 --> 01:18:13,814
Do you see it?

1182
01:18:14,481 --> 01:18:16,066
You see it, right?

1183
01:18:17,109 --> 01:18:18,819
DONGHWA: So that's how you do it.

1184
01:18:18,902 --> 01:18:21,113
-AREUM: Do you want to try the other side?
-DONGHWA: Yes.

1185
01:18:21,196 --> 01:18:24,408
(soft music)

1186
01:18:43,802 --> 01:18:46,471
DR. ROMANTIC SEASON 3

1187
01:18:47,305 --> 01:18:49,933
JINMAN: From what I can see,
there is no hope for this patient.

1188
01:18:50,016 --> 01:18:51,351
Am I supposed to give up on a patient?

1189
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:52,978
I gave you the fast lane,

1190
01:18:53,061 --> 01:18:54,980
so why do you keep hitting the brakes?

1191
01:18:55,063 --> 01:18:57,607
Do you only see the patient,
and not the doctor?

1192
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:00,068
CHILD: I came to meet my dad.

1193
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:01,278
-What?
-What?

1194
01:19:01,361 --> 01:19:02,446
Daughter?

1195
01:19:02,529 --> 01:19:04,281
GITAE (whispers):
Are you sure it's a dad's smile?

1196
01:19:04,364 --> 01:19:05,532
WOOJIN: I wanted to show

1197
01:19:05,615 --> 01:19:07,743
that I can save the patient.

1198
01:19:07,826 --> 01:19:08,994
SABU:
What do you mean it wasn't an accident?

1199
01:19:09,077 --> 01:19:10,454
JINMAN:
It means that the emergency surgery

1200
01:19:10,537 --> 01:19:12,831
you risked performing was for nothing.

1201
01:19:12,914 --> 01:19:14,374
WOOJIN:
Will the patient be able to hold on?

1202
01:19:14,458 --> 01:19:16,042
JINMAN: The patient will die.
