DR. ROMANTIC SEASON 3

THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS, AND
EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE WORKS OF FICTION

00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,673
(tense dramatic music)

5
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:52,427
But you'll have to be prepared
for an all-out war, Master Kim.

6
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,429
You have nothing to be afraid of.

7
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:58,475
In an all-out war, you go all-out.

8
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,062
Are you perhaps...

9
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:06,274
thinking about being the head
of the trauma center, Master Kim?

10
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:07,525
Someone more intense...

11
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:10,737
than me will be.

12
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,490
HOJUN: Still,
how can you bring in Kang Dongju?

13
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,784
Someone more intense than you?

14
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:16,868
He has a bigger dream

15
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:20,371
for Doldam Trauma Center
than anyone else does.

16
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,582
Who has been working the hardest
for the provincial budget?

17
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:24,167
It's you, Director Park.

18
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,460
Without a doubt,

19
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,880
he will have brought his own solutions.

20
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:32,050
Isn't Master Kim just trying
to start internal strife?

21
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,428
How much authority
are you planning to give him?

22
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:38,306
I'm thinking about giving him
full authority.

23
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:39,891
What do you think, Director Park?

24
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,727
Even authority over personnel management?

25
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,270
Why not?

26
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:47,690
Don't you think Master Kim is wielding
his authority however he wants?

27
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,402
(soft sigh)

28
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,117
DONGJU: Gauze!

29
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:58,868
More gauze, please.

WOOJIN: Are you really going in alone?

35
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:20,723
DONGJU: What are you worried about?

36
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,934
If you're risking
a patient's life for bravado--

37
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,811
DONGJU:
You have to have skills to have bravado.

38
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:25,854
(scoffs)

39
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:29,399
It's not too late for me to go in
as your first surgical assistant.

40
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,610
DONGJU: Just don't get too impressed
by my surgery.

41
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,196
I don't get impressed easily.

42
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,323
DONGJU: And if I do manage to impress you,

43
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:38,950
will you work with me?

44
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:43,288
I know you're actually curious
about this place.

45
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:47,041
Isn't that why
you keep showing up in front of me?

46
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,879
I am curious
about what you're trying to do.

47
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:54,132
DONGJU: Then come work with me.
I'll impress you.

48
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,512
DONGJU: The spleen is completely ruptured.

49
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,098
I'll work on the liver
after the splenectomy.

50
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,392
Right angle.

51
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,936

00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,897

-Cut.
-MYEONGSIM: Cut.

00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,033
DONGJU: Tie.

00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,288
-Cut.
-MYEONGSIM: Cut.

57
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:26,789

Yes, Eunjae?

63
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:48,353
How's the surgery?

64
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,230
WOOJIN (over phone):
It took him only 15 minutes

65
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:51,731
to take out the spleen.

66
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:53,399
What's with that crazy speed?

67
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,109
He's going that fast

68
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,736
even though it's just him and Nurse Oh.

69
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,279
That's crazy.

70
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,281
What about you?
Is it going to take you a while?

71
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,450
I was changing my scrubs.
I'll be there soon.

72
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,289
DONGJU: We got the spleen done,
so I'll be moving on to the liver.

87
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,682
-Nurse Eom.
-HYEONJEONG: Yes.

88
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,976
Did you find
the female high school student?

89
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:13,646
No. Two staff members searched
the hospital, but couldn't find her.

90
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,482
However...

91
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:20,111
(softly)
According to the guardian,

92
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:22,739
she ran away from home every now and then.

93
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,073
Ran away from home?

94
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,410
He said he had just found her
after two months and was taking her home.

95
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:30,955
Could it be that she ran away again?

96
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,499
I think so.

-EUNJAE: Nurse Eom, covers, please!
-HYEONJEONG: Yes, Doctor!

(Areum gasps)

103
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,566
What's going on, Dr. Cha?

104
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:01,277
-I found the baby in the women's bathroom.
-What?

105
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,363
In one of our bathrooms?

106
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,740
-Nurse Eom, give me a BVM, please.
-Yes, Doctor.

107
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,034
(tense music)

108
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,414
Give me a stethoscope, Areum.

109
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,083
Yes, Doctor.

110
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,757
The heart rate is too slow.

111
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,841
I'll start compressions.

112
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,428
Intubation, please.

113
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,266
Not that one. The straight one.

114
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,477
-Straight blade no. 0.
-Straight blade no. 0.

115
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,895
Oh, yes.

116
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,023
Have you ever intubated a newborn?

117
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,608
I did it once when I was a resident.

118
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:42,485
-Here you go.
-Okay.

119
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,695
(suspenseful music)

120
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,602

121
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,272
Give me an uncuffed 3.5 mm tube, please.

122
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,987
(gasps)
Oh, wait.

123
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,865
How far did PALS say
the neonatal intubation tube had to go in?

124
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,616
It said...

125
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,827
-It said nine centimeters.
-Okay, nine centimeters.

126
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,620
(exhales shakily, inhales sharply)

127
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,998
EUNJAE: Make sure
it's deep enough to not fall out.

128
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:41,294
Make sure it's not too deep
or it'll only ventilate the right lung.

129
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:52,930
Areum, the sound.

130
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,616
(exhales shakily, inhales sharply)

131
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:12,533
It sounds good.

132
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,953
-AREUM: The heart rate is up too.
-(sighs in relief)

133
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:17,288
I'll take over.

134
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,714

135
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,467

00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,052
(exhales shakily)

137
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,513
There's an incubator at the Trauma Center.

138
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,765
It's important for newborns
to maintain body temperature.

139
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,350
Nurse Park, incubator.

140
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:38,935
-NURSE: Yes, Nurse.
-Dr. Areum,

141
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,270
check if the tube went in properly
with the portable X-ray.

142
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:44,232
We checked it with the stethoscope,
but just to be sure.

143
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,483
I have a trauma operation.

144
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,360
You can go. I'll take care of everything.

145
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:48,486
Thanks.

146
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:52,949
AREUM: Nurse Eom.

147
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,825
Please record the Apgar score.

148
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,329
The first results were zero, one,

149
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,122
zero, zero, one, so put down two points.

150
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,624
Ten minutes later,

151
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:05,169
it was two, two, one, one, one,
so put down seven points.

152
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,381
We should call the police first.

153
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,886
Let's take care
of the baby's umbilical cord before that.

154
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:17,473
Do we have an umbilical clamp?
If not, I'll take the Kelly and Metz.

155
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,100
We have one. Hold on.

Gosh, how could this happen

00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:41,789
Tell me about it.

161
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,792
The baby went through
such a huge ordeal...

00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,628
(inhales deeply)
...after just being born.

163
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,011
What's the matter, sir?

164
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,805
Why is this here?

165
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:01,475
That was wrapped
around the baby here. Why?

166
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,561
This was...

167
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,063
my daughter's.

168
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:11,027

DOIL: Not a lot,

171
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,326
but the vitals
are still not looking too good.

00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,077
Is there bleeding somewhere else?

-DONGJU: Cut.
-MYEONGSIM: Cut.

DONGJU:
There's more bleeding in the chest.

DOIL: Is Dr. Cha still not here?

176
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,005
Please hurry up and check.

177
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:33,507
DONGJU: It might be the tube's position.
I'll put another one in.

179
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:39,013
I've done this many times, so don't worry.

180
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,015
Scalpel, please.

181
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,271
Tube, please.

182
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:51,901
Not that one, but a right-angle tube.

183
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,236
(thrilling music)

184
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,947
-Kelly.
-(exhales softly)

185
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,909
MYEONGSIM: Bottle, please.

186
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,203
DONGJU: Another Kelly, please.

187
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:18,886
Suture.

188
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:25,893
MYEONGSIM: Cut.

189
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,024
You know all kinds of things now,
Dr. Kang.

190
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:35,486
DOIL: The trauma center in the US
must have been pretty tough.

191
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:38,948
DONGJU: You'd be even more surprised
if you knew how much I've been through.

192
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:45,913
EUNJAE: How is it going?

193
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:47,665
(Woojin exhales sharply)

194
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,750
-He just put another tube in the chest.
-(water running)

195
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,129
EUNJAE: What? He did what?

196
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,720
DONGJU: Irrigation.

197
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,931
DOIL: Oh, nice timing, Dr. Cha Eunjae!

198
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,184
DONGJU: Suction.

199
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,479
Give me the drain, please.

200
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,528
Suture.

201
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,822
(tense music)

202
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,577
(Eunjae exhales deeply)

203
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,751
EUNJAE: He put that in?

204
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,377
And he's a GS.

205
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,630
EUNJAE: How much bleeding is there?

206
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,550
NURSE: 500 milliliters from the chest.

207
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,136
EUNJAE: Did you do this, Dr. Kang?

208
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,721
-DONGJU: Cut.
-MYEONGSIM: Cut.

209
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,306
DOIL: About that, Dr. Cha Eunjae,

210
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:47,308
the patient was still bleeding--

211
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:50,019
DONGJU: If the bleeding continues,
I'll do a chest exploration.

212
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,480
EUNJAE: That's something I'll decide.

213
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:55,024
DONGJU: If you wanted to decide on that,
you should've been here on time.

214
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,360
No.

215
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,071
You shouldn't have left
the Trauma Center in the first place.

216
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,325
-Cut.
-MYEONGSIM: Cut.

217
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,410
EUNJAE: I won't make any excuses.

218
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:10,289
I'm sure you are aware of what condition
the emergency patient was in.

219
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:12,625
DONGJU: No, you'll have to make an excuse.

220
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:16,212
Otherwise, you might have to leave
the Trauma team.

221
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:19,215
(tense music)

222
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:30,893
(scoffs)

223
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,358
(upbeat music)

224
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:45,407
VOLUME 14
THE ADDICTION TO SUCCESS

225
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,998
(soft music)

226
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,759
SABU:
Is this your first pediatric patient?

227
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,929
Yes, I've only seen data videos.
It's my first time operating on one.

228
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,223
SABU: In a way,
the most difficult and unpredictable thing

229
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:12,184
is surgery on a young child.

230
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:16,480
Even general anesthesia is too risky.

231
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,155
Is there something on my face? What is it?

232
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,323
Well...

233
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,827
you were once six years old too, right?

234
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,830
What kind of nonsense is this?

235
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:35,082
-Of course I was.
-(soft chuckle)

236
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,252
I just don't remember what I did
as a six-year-old.

237
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,088
Why did you become a doctor, Master Kim?

238
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,136
Well, there was

239
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,054
no particular reason.

240
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,347
Really?

241
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:53,309
I thought you would've had
some grand, marvelous reason.

242
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,226
(chuckles)

243
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:57,313
(clicks tongue)
I vaguely wanted

244
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,482
to know what success was

245
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:04,737
and chose to be a surgeon
since I only had my brain and hands.

246
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,905
(sucks teeth)

247
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:09,199
So here's another thing we have in common.

248
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,036
I also happened to become a doctor
because I got good grades.

249
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,787
(scoffs, chuckles)

250
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,498
(sighs)

251
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:20,336
I used to make
a lot of money at one point,

252
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:24,882
and I would get cocky
and consider myself successful

253
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:30,054
because everyone around me
would call me a doctor.

254
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,889
Sheesh.
(soft chuckle)

255
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:35,351
How did you become Master Kim then?

256
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,314
(pensive music)

257
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:42,775
Someone...

258
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,363
started calling me that.

259
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,699
Was it the new Trauma Center doctor,
Dr. Kang Dongju?

260
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,742
No.

261
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:54,328
Oh, so it was Dr. Yoon Seojung?

262
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:55,913
No, it wasn't.

263
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:58,332
Who was it then? Can you tell me?

264
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:01,877
Hey, stop talking nonsense
and check the urine.

265
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,130
Check the patient's condition
every 30 minutes too, okay?

266
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,925
DONGHWA: Then when should I clock out?

267
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:11,553
You have to keep an eye on her tonight.
She just got out of surgery.

268
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,263
And she's a pediatric patient.

269
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,308
Why? You don't want to, do you?

270
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:19,520
No, that's not it.
I'll make sure to check every 30 minutes.

271
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,188
Make sure you do well.

272
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:22,898
SABU: And you.

273
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,900
Stop smiling. I might start liking you.

274
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,297
Hmm? Nurse Euntak.
Are you done with all your operations?

275
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:48,549
EUNTAK: Yes.

276
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,176
Wait, what about the flowers?

277
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,388
You still haven't?

278
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:57,474
Now isn't the time for that
with what's going on in the ER.

279
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,143
I don't have the time.

280
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,394
Then you have to make the time.

281
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,730
You can't be stuck in a stalemate forever.

282
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,231
If you take any longer,

283
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,734
it'll become more awkward.

284
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:08,819
I'll take care of it.

285
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,112
But...

286
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,742
You're not taking care of it at all
right now.

287
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,260
(tense music)

288
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,862
(soft music)

289
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:59,661
-(cart rattling)
-NURSE: The incubator is here.

290
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,414
Put it over here, please.

291
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:27,606
(incubator clicks)

292
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,204
(sighs)

293
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,295
EUNJAE: Dr. Kang Dongju!

294
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,761
I'd like to correct
what happened in the OR right now.

295
00:18:58,345 --> 00:18:59,513
Correct what?

296
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,014
You crossed the line.

297
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:03,559
(scoffs)

298
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,688
General surgery and CT surgery are
clearly different departments.

299
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,314
Who doesn't know that?

300
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,774
We should cooperate with each other

301
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,527
as we are equals
before the operating table.

302
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,487
I do not take orders from you.

303
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,990
You were late to the operation

304
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,868
and I did what I had to
in order to control the situation.

305
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:24,329
I told you many times that the patient
with an embolism was in a dangerous state.

306
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:28,375
Nevertheless, I clearly told you
not to treat non-traumatic patients.

307
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,419
Wasn't the Trauma Center built
to save people?

308
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,461
However,

309
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:34,506
while you were away
to see another patient,

310
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,217
a critical patient died
in the Trauma Center.

311
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,807
Just because you can run,

312
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,809
does that mean you can do
both a marathon and a 100 m race?

313
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,561
DONGJU: No, right?

314
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,229
You'd probably die.

315
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,899
That's the difference
between a trauma center and an ER.

316
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:55,027
They may look similar, but they run
on completely different systems.

317
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,822
If you don't change your mindset,
I assure you

318
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:02,910
that you will not be able to stay
at the Trauma Center I lead.

319
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,203
(scoffs)

320
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,955
(tense music)

321
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,417
What happens if I can't stay?

322
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,004
I'm the only CT surgeon
in the Trauma Center right now.

323
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,257
What will you do without me?

324
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,968
You don't need to worry about that.

325
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:21,970
Soon, we'll have a CT surgeon,

326
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,139
a neurosurgeon,
and an interventional radiologist.

327
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,726
These are the teams I set up
while studying trauma in the US.

328
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,897
(tense music continues)

329
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,857
EMPLOYMENT APPLICATION

330
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:40,948
Did you know this already?

331
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:45,285
No, this is the first time
I heard about this.

332
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:51,959
So I hope you will be clear
about your stance on things.

333
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,629
If you still can't tell the difference
between emergency and trauma,

334
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:57,589
you can go back to Doldam Hospital.

335
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,425
If you want to stay at the Trauma Center,

336
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,219
follow my instructions.

337
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:03,387
Are you...

338
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,514
kicking me out?

339
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,434
Would you like me to?

340
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:12,145
(tense music continues)

341
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,197
(Eunjae sighs)

342
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,826
He's practically trying to take over
and make personnel changes, right?

343
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,370
Let's calm down first.

344
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:31,081
I can't calm down
during such an infuriating situation.

345
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:34,710
He just got here and he's trying
to boss his juniors around.

346
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,714
No way. Kang Dongju wouldn't have meant it
in that way.

347
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,716
He said he put together a team
while in the US.

348
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,718
"I have my own team."

349
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,720
"If you won't follow me, get out!"

350
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,430
He practically declared war.

351
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:49,766
You felt that way too, right?
It's not just me.

352
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:50,892
Absolutely, 100%.

353
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:54,104
I'm telling you,
Kang Dongju isn't that kind of guy.

354
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:55,022
HOJUN: No.

355
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,233
Kang Dongju is that kind of guy.

356
00:21:58,817 --> 00:21:59,985
INSU: What are you doing here?

357
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:02,195
Where were you all this time?

358
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,573
Well, I'm on call today.

359
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:07,534
Please go on. What do you mean by that?

360
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:12,289
I know him well as I've been watching him
ever since he was a fellow.

361
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,708
He's a totally ambitious person.

362
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:18,128
He wanted to advance in his career

363
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:19,755
but came here after getting kicked out

364
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:22,341
after performing a high-risk VIP operation
where the patient died.

365
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:23,467
And look.

366
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,094
Even now, he's doing everything he can

367
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,221
to take over the Trauma Center.

368
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:31,725
As they say,
legends are exaggerated and glorified.

369
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:34,019
It turns out
he's just an ambitious person.

370
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:36,438
(scoffs)
What do we do?

371
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:39,775
WOOJIN: What are you thinking?

372
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:41,735
What does that mean?

373
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,030
It seems like you're causing
problems and conflicts

374
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:46,782
between people on purpose.

375
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,158
We don't have the time.

376
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:49,368
-(mouse clicking)
-What time?

377
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,953
Time for friendly conversations
and persuasions.

378
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:55,791
I'd rather go head-to-head to see
who'll make it and who won't,

379
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,459
who'll go together and who'll give up.

380
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:00,253
It's better to quickly determine
who stays and who goes.

381
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,798
That way it'll be less tiring
and time won't be wasted.

382
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,634
Is that how you sort people?

383
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:07,719
If it's necessary.

384
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:11,473
Master Kim trusts you.

385
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:12,891
I know.

386
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:14,101
(scoffs)

387
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:17,437
However, you do things very differently
compared to Master Kim.

388
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:20,690
The goal may be the same,
but we have different ways to achieve it.

389
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:23,318
Master Kim thinks
the process is more important.

390
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:25,737
(scoffs, inhales deeply)

391
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,698
He had many irregular methods
of achieving his desired results.

392
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:31,159
Yet, he's never violated
his beliefs and principles.

393
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,913
There can be different interpretations.

394
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,709
Anyway, how did it feel

395
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,753
watching my operation?

396
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,675
May I ask why

397
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,135
you acted so rashly?

398
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,762
Because Master Kim is my opponent.

399
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:55,058
I should go against him properly,
even if I have to be rash about it.

400
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,061
(scoffs)
It sounds like

401
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,814
you're trying to beat Master Kim.

402
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,066
(scoffs)

403
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,068
It seems like you understand.

404
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:08,113
You're right. That's why I came back.

405
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,949
I wanted to see if I can beat Master Kim.

406
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:13,493
HOJUN: Speaking of which,

407
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,538
since it's like this,

408
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,373
let's make our voices heard.

409
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,710
Make our voices heard? Should we protest?

410
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,838
No, that won't work on Kang Dongju at all.

411
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:27,007
Let's simply boycott him.

412
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,176
(comical music)

413
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:30,177
Hey.

414
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,387
He sent all the patients
to Doldam Hospital

415
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,638
while idly sitting around,

416
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:37,392
but told Cha Eunjae to get out
after she operated on an embolism.

417
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,186
That doesn't make any sense!

418
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:41,771
All because he's an original member
of Doldam Hospital?

419
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:46,151
It's not like we care
about who came first.

420
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:49,362
How dare he try to boss us around
and take over things!

421
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:52,616
Who's been guarding Doldam Hospital
for the last three years?

422
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,409
INSU: That's a bit extreme, Hojun.

423
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,703
I wouldn't take it to that extent.

424
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,246
Anyway,

425
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:01,249
I think he needs to be humbled
at least once.

426
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:05,504
If we don't do something from the start,
his ego will only get bigger.

427
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,214
We won't be able
to do anything later then.

428
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,841
(slams on table)
That's enough, Dr. Yang Hojun.

429
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,468
INSU: Is this really the time?

430
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:12,636
We don't even know

431
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:15,180
when the provincial budget officers
are coming.

432
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:17,057
(slams on table)
Exactly!

433
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:20,060
If he's in a hurry to get
the budget approved, he'll listen to us.

434
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:24,189
Negotiations are supposed to be cutthroat.

435
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,107
I agree with Dr. Yang.

436
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,567
INSU: Nurse Joo!

437
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:30,195
Honestly, we have a lot of complaints
about Dr. Kang too.

438
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:32,989
He suddenly wants blood refrigerators
to be added to Trauma Bay.

439
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:36,409
The nurses will have to manage them,
but he didn't even discuss it with us.

440
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,912
YEONGMI: We're against him
making decisions unilaterally.

441
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:41,581
I agree.

442
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,753
-I agree with boycotting him.
-Hey.

443
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,755
You should make your stance clear.

444
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:51,091
Will you be acting with us or not?

445
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:53,218
Eunjae, not you too.

446
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,219
Which side are you on?

447
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,888
Are you on our side or Dr. Kang's side?

448
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,307
This is not about picking sides.

449
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,934
This isn't right!

450
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:02,143
WOOJIN: I'm against it.

451
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,355
Regardless of how angry you are,

452
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:07,357
I don't think a boycott is right, Dr. Cha.

453
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,360
"Boycott" is putting it nicely.

454
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:12,404
It practically means
making someone an outcast.

455
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:15,991
Dr. Kang was the one
who started casting people out.

456
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,118
Obviously, he thinks
we're not on the same team.

457
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,995
You can calmly ask him

458
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,830
what he's thinking.

459
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,624
Enough!

460
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,459
This only concerns the Trauma Center.

461
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,461
Doldam Hospital doctors
do not have a say in this.

462
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:29,546
So what will you do?

463
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,721
YEONGMI: Exactly.

464
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:41,308
The interim head of the trauma center
seems to do whatever he wants.

465
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,810
Apparently, he's bringing
his own team from the US.

466
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:45,145
I can't believe this.

467
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,273
He's basically trying to run
the Trauma Center however he wants.

468
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:50,734
Then what do we do now?

469
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:52,569
We should act.

470
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:53,820
Act how?

471
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:56,948
We're going to boycott
Dr. Kang Dongju together.

472
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:01,703
Dr. Yang and Dr. Cha are on our side too.

473
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,038
NURSE: Boycott?

474
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,414
Will that work?

475
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,085
(nurses murmuring)

476
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:19,471
Dr. Cha Eunjae.

477
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:22,223
Hey, Yang Hojun.

478
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,313
DONGJU: What are you doing right now?

479
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:30,899
This isn't just your Trauma Center.

480
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:39,282
I can no longer accept
your dogmatism and self-righteousness.

481
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:41,409
EUNJAE: Please withdraw the orders

482
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,453
that you gave unilaterally
over the past few days.

483
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:46,206
Until you do, the Trauma Center staff
will take group action.

484
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,042
I want you to be clear.

485
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,171
So are you saying
you're leaving this center?

486
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:57,884
No, the Trauma Center is my dream

487
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:01,763
and I put in a lot of time and effort
to get here.

488
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:04,057
Why should I give up that dream
because of you?

489
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,101
Return to your station
if you're not leaving.

490
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:09,729
I can't tolerate group action
that uses patients as hostages.

491
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,606
You're not going to treat
any patients anyway.

492
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,567
You're going to send them all
to Doldam ER.

493
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:16,236
(scoffs)

494
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:19,656
If you want to stop this from happening,
you should change how you do things.

495
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:21,991
We'll return as soon as you do.

496
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:25,036
Hey.

497
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,454
(door opens)

498
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,164
(door slams)

499
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:29,958
What she said.

500
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,085
Good luck then.

501
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:34,671
INSU: Hey.

502
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:36,548
(door closes)

503
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:38,842
(sighs)

504
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:42,721
(Eunjae sighs)

505
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:46,975
We need to talk.

506
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:49,519
(Hojun clears throat)

507
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:51,604
EUNJAE (sighs): Don't try to stop me.

508
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,022
I made up my mind,

509
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:55,442
and I just notified Dr. Kang about it.

510
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,361
You're only making things bigger,
not solving them.

511
00:28:58,445 --> 00:28:59,988
Was I late because I was messing around?

512
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:01,448
No, I wasn't.

513
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,491
I saved someone at that time.

514
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,244
I saved a patient with an embolism

515
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:09,247
and I intubated and barely saved
a dying newborn.

516
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:11,708
I'm here to save people.

517
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:15,295
But he wants to ignore the basics
and change everything

518
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,590
without persuasion
or explanation, unilaterally!

519
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,592
Isn't that a bit much?

520
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:24,804
I think you're being just as unilateral.

521
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,140
-(tense music)
-What?

522
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:31,561
Even if you're 100% right
and Dr. Kang is 100% wrong,

523
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:34,230
you became the person in the wrong

524
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:36,441
the moment you chose this method.

525
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:38,777
Do you understand?

526
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:45,241
Then I'll be in the wrong.

527
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:48,703
(sighs)

528
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,290
HOJUN: Thank you for your hard work.

529
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:55,043
Thank you so much
for participating in the boycott.

530
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:58,087
First, let's have a meeting
in the Doldam meeting room.

531
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,464
Let's go.

532
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,509
Let's go now.

533
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:11,100
(sighs)

534
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,020
A boycott?

535
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:15,855
Eunjae is boycotting?

536
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:16,981
Yes, Master Kim.

537
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:20,318
The situation is getting out of hand.

538
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:22,028
Yang Hojun played a part in that.

539
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:23,112
What?

540
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,031
INSU: Eunjae and Dongju
were already at odds

541
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:26,783
with each other,

542
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:30,954
and Hojun kept urging her to take action
and caused this to happen.

543
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:32,372
Goodness.

544
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,457
(door opens)

545
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,798
-Master Kim.
-Yes?

546
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:43,383
This is the list of people

547
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:45,343
that Dr. Kang notified me
about 30 minutes ago.

548
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,892
They're new doctors
who will be coming to the Trauma Center.

549
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:54,936
MINGUK: Did you know about this?

550
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,898
No, this is my first time
seeing this list.

551
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:01,109
So he didn't even discuss it with you?

552
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,152
I did suspect he was up to something

553
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:05,154
when he asked for authority
over personnel management.

554
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:08,658
You're not bringing these people in
without a verification process, are you?

555
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:13,872
Let's just wait and see.

556
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:17,584
I promised Kang Dongju that I would.

557
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:21,129
I'm sure you're well aware of this,
but all of our Trauma Center medical staff

558
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:23,756
are boycotting Dr. Kang Dongju.

559
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:27,552
MINGUK: The existing staff members
are having problems with him alone.

560
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:29,637
Imagine what would happen
when the new staff come.

561
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:31,639
It will only add to the confusion.

562
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,725
He'll take care of it on his own.

563
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:36,185
Kang Dongju set this in motion

564
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,229
so it's up to him to handle it.

565
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,731
(sighs)
Master Kim.

566
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:42,817
My gosh, don't worry!

567
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:47,739
It's not like he'll cause
that well-established Trauma Center

568
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:49,699
to close down.

569
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,245
I don't think
showing favoritism toward someone...

570
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:59,167
will help this situation at all,
Master Kim.

571
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,795
What do you mean
by "showing favoritism," Director Park?

572
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,923
I mean that in someone's eyes,

573
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:08,301
this situation may seem like
only one particular person is receiving

574
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:10,803
unconditional belief and full support.

575
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:16,017
And this can break and disrupt
the faith of the Doldam Hospital staff

576
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,394
that had been firmly built up so far.

577
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:20,605
(tense music)

578
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:23,358
Is that "someone" perhaps

579
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,443
Dr. Yang Hojun?

580
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,403
(sighs)

581
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:34,118
You represent Doldam Hospital, Master Kim.

582
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,122
Please help keep the balance.

583
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:53,596
(sighs)

584
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:02,855
Do you understand?

585
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:04,691
We can't back down.

586
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:08,653
We must show him
the definition of justice.

587
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:09,570
Come on!

588
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,364
I don't know about justice,

589
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:14,033
but let's just finish what we started.

590
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,082
YEONGMI: Dr. Cha.

591
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:25,753
To win!

592
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,088
ALL: Without fail!

593
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,214
Let's go!

594
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,889
MUNJEONG: You couldn't persuade Eunjae?

595
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:41,352
She's angry

596
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:45,523
because I didn't take her side.
She won't answer my calls either.

597
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:46,441
(sighs)

598
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,860
Dr. Cha must have been very upset
because of Kang Dongju.

599
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:49,944
(Munjeong clicks tongue)

600
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:51,529
By the way,

601
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:54,907
when will I
officially be able to operate again?

602
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:57,535
(soft chuckle)
Why?

603
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,455
-Do you keep getting anxious?
-(sighs)

604
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:02,999
(inhales deeply)

605
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:04,333
I'm just a little frustrated.

606
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:05,585
I mean,

607
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:07,712
you already used that hand
without me knowing.

608
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:11,007
I heard you operated with Kang Dongju

609
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:13,176
on the TA patient with hemoperitoneum.

610
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:17,221
Cha Eunjae went into another OR,
so someone needed to replace her.

611
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,682
No, you're not allowed to operate.

612
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:26,522
Woojin,

613
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:30,902
there's only one way
a parrotbill can keep up with a stork.

614
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:32,862
(soft music)

615
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:33,780
It can be done

616
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:36,491
by looking in the same direction
as the stork.

617
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:39,452
Without feeling intimidated
by the stork's pace

618
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:41,329
and going at its own pace.

619
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:44,248
It may take some time,

620
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:47,210
but they'll eventually arrive
at the same place.

621
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:49,462
It won't lose direction

622
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:52,006
or tear its legs apart.

623
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:04,143
WOOJIN: But, Dr. Bae...

624
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,991
I don't want to arrive late.

625
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:22,578
I want to arrive together.

626
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:26,958
CONSULTATION ROOM 2

627
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,252
Honestly...
(sighs)

628
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:31,671
...I didn't expect a boycott either.

629
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:35,091
SABU: What will you do?
Should I go and help you?

630
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:36,884
DONGJU: No.
(sighs)

631
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,303
I won't surrender just because of this.

632
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:41,305
Why?

633
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:43,224
Would doing that hurt your pride?

634
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,225
(scoffs)

635
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,644
I wouldn't have asked you to trust me

636
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,147
if I was going to give up so easily.

637
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:52,316
I'll do everything I can.

638
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:54,652
Dongju.

639
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:59,240
Everything is made by people.

640
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:03,953
No matter how good a hospital is
or how good the system is,

641
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:08,040
you won't be able to do anything
without people.

642
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,333
I know.

643
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:13,462
However, I can't force those who disagree
to follow me.

644
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:16,924
Let me ask you something, Dongju.

645
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,594
What do you want to become?

646
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,889
Do you want to be a boss or a leader?

647
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:28,603
(sighs)

648
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:35,276
(exhales deeply)
The baby is so small.

649
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:38,029
Didn't the baby just laugh a little?

650
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:40,198
I think the baby frowned.

651
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:42,533
I see...

652
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:45,411
But how long will the baby stay here?

653
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:49,248
We're waiting for a response
from the hospital in Seoul.

654
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:53,169
There used to be a hospital
15 minutes away with a neonatal ICU,

655
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:54,795
but it closed last year.

656
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,048
Because of the low birth rate,

657
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:59,675
all nearby OB-GYN clinics
are closing down one after another.

658
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,594
I see.

659
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,055
Look at those fingers.

660
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:07,725
SEONUNG: What in the world
could the baby be clutching so tightly?

661
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:10,603
It's fate.

662
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,942
My mom said...

663
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:20,488
that when a baby is born,

664
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:23,491
they hold onto their fate tightly
in that little fist.

665
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:27,870
And then, as time goes by
and they learn human language,

666
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:30,206
they slowly lose their memory.

667
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,376
That's fascinating.
I've never heard that before.

668
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:36,629
Whatever it is,

669
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,881
I hope there's a happy fate

670
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:41,926
in that baby's hand.

671
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:45,763
YEONGMI: That's all superstition...

672
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:49,934
and something fatalists came up with.

673
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:53,104
What are you doing here
at this hour, Nurse Joo?

674
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:54,146
Aren't you working?

675
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,649
I see, you didn't know.

676
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:59,986
We're boycotting
Dr. Kang Dongju right now.

677
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,028
ALL: What?

678
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,700
(pensive music)

679
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,928
So this is the patient you operated on?

680
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:29,932
-Yes.
-I see it went well.

681
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:32,518
It wouldn't have been an easy operation.

682
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:37,690
I heard you found
the newborn in the ER too.

683
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,151
-Yes.
-(soft chuckle)

684
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,278
Good job.

685
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:44,822
But from now on,

686
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:48,951
you don't have to worry
about patients in the Doldam Hospital.

687
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:51,746
I'll take care of things on this side.

688
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,374
What I mean is

689
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,752
don't waste your time

690
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:00,004
doing things you usually wouldn't do

691
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:02,381
like a boycott or whatever
and go back to your post.

692
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:03,716
Do you understand?

693
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:09,764
I'm disappointed, Master Kim.

694
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:13,601
-What?
-So in the end,

695
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,395
you were on Dr. Kang Dongju's side too.

696
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:22,234
How can you not listen to anything I say
and just tell me to go?

697
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:23,152
(scoffs)

698
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,114
Eunjae.

699
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:30,701
(inhales deeply)
Do I look like that kind of person to you?

700
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:36,582
Do you think
I'm the kind of person to favor one person

701
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,585
and only take their side
to cause a rift among you all?

702
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:42,755
-I mean...
-Oh, my.

703
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:46,217
Then I must have done something wrong.

704
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,261
-What?
-If you saw me like that

705
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:51,389
regardless of my true intentions,

706
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:54,850
then I must have done something wrong
and taught you wrong.

707
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:58,854
No, Master Kim. That's not what I meant.

708
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:01,023
Eunjae.

709
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:05,111
No matter how just the reason is,

710
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:07,571
if the process of achieving it
isn't right,

711
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:10,491
then it isn't right.

712
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:12,743
(Sabu sighs)

713
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:17,206
Besides, you know better than anyone else

714
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:22,086
that the person closest to you was hurt
by a boycott for a long time.

715
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:26,465
Did you really have to use this method
to handle this issue?

716
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:29,176
(soft music)

717
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,261
WOOJIN: I'm against it.

718
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,555
Regardless of how angry you are,

719
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:35,224
"boycott" is putting it nicely.

720
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:37,351
It practically means
making someone an outcast.

721
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,186
DAMNED TRAITOR
HYPOCRITE

722
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,980
DON'T THINK YOU'RE RIGHTEOUS, IDIOT!
GET LOST

723
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:52,533
SABU:
I'm not saying it's wrong to be angry.

724
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:55,786
You can go against it if it's unfair.

725
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,956
However, as you get older
and go through life

726
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,292
to become the adult that you are now,

727
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:06,046
instead of nitpicking and asking,
"What's wrong with you?"...

728
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:08,340
you need to ask,
"Why are they doing this?"

729
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:11,719
And put yourself in their shoes.

730
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:19,268
Once you understand them,

731
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:23,772
there can be endless possibilities
for a solution to the problem.

732
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:25,107
Okay?

733
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:30,154
(soft chuckle)

734
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,246
(sighs)

735
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,676
MYEONGSIM: How may I help you?

736
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,221
We're from
the Gangwon-do Budget Committee.

737
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,974
Are you the provincial budget officer?

738
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:01,101
Yes, that's right.

739
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:04,104
-(tense music)
-I see.

740
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:06,023
(phone vibrates)

741
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:08,192
(sighs)

742
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:13,489
(phone vibrates)

743
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:16,116
(gasps)

744
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:24,583
(phone vibrates)

745
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:27,628
Master Kim!

746
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:30,172
Did you see the text?
Right now, at the Trauma Center--

747
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:31,507
SABU: Yes, I saw it.

748
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:33,509
-What about it?
-GITAE: What?

749
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:34,927
What do you mean by that?

750
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:37,763
The provincial budget officers
are here right now!

751
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:40,099
Kang Dongju is there.

752
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:42,268
The person in charge is there.
What's the big deal?

753
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:45,020
-Hey, Master Kim!
-(door opens)

754
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:47,106
MINGUK: Chief Jang!
(panting)

755
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:49,441
-Did you see the text?
-GITAE: Yes, I just received it.

756
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:51,777
-All right. Let's go together.
-GITAE: Right.

757
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:00,786
(mysterious music)

758
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,498
(breathes shakily)

759
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:18,846
(sucks teeth)

760
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:27,980
(breathes shakily)

761
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:41,493
(sobbing)

762
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:48,250
They're from
the provincial budget committee.

763
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:53,005
DOLDAM HOSPITAL TRAUMA CENTER

764
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:54,757
Hello, Director Park Minguk.

765
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,217
We met briefly
during the last briefing session.

766
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:59,553
Oh, you're Officer Choi, right?

767
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,055
(chuckles)

768
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:03,682
Welcome, I was wondering
who I would be meeting.

769
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:04,975
Pleasure to have you here.

770
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:07,311
MYEONGSIM: The interim head of the center
is here as well.

771
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:10,856
Let me introduce him to you.

772
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,901
This is the new interim head
of the trauma center, Dr. Kang Dongju.

773
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:16,695
MINGUK: He studied trauma
for two years in the US.

774
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:20,866
They are the provincial budget officers.
Please give them a warm welcome.

775
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:22,326
I'm Kang Dongju.

776
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:26,705
Aren't you

777
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:29,667
the doctor who used to work
at Doldam Hospital some time ago?

778
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:34,421
You operated on my brother
who had liver cancer at the time.

779
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:36,423
Oh...

780
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:39,677
Do you mean... Mr. Choi Euiseok?

781
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,805
Goodness, you even remembered his name?

782
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:43,806
(chuckles)

783
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:48,060
After he recovered,
we went fishing twice together.

784
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:50,604
You look a lot like him.

785
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:51,980
(soft chuckle)

786
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:54,233
Let's go up first.

787
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:56,193
-MINGUK: Chief Jang?
-This way.

788
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:05,703
You seem to have a great memory,
Dr. Kang Dongju.

789
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:10,582
I did some research in advance.

790
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:13,711
DONGJU: Nurse Oh.

791
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:15,421
Please keep an eye on the ICU patient.

792
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:16,463
Yes, Doctor.

793
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,767
Dr. Kang Dongju is an interesting person.

794
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:30,769
There's a reason why

795
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:32,730
Master Kim brought him in
as a hidden card.

796
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:34,606
I said he was interesting,

797
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:37,317
not that I've recognized his ability,
Nurse Oh.

798
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:40,821
(scoffs)
You will recognize it soon enough.

799
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:46,326
(sighs)

800
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:51,999
(mysterious music)

801
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:21,862
Why aren't there any people?

802
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:26,492
SABU: Dr. Yoon Areum.

803
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:30,746
Did you check that patient's brain CT?

804
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:32,039
AREUM: Yes, well...

805
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:35,918
I didn't find anything problematic there.

806
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,669
-Yes?
-But...

807
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:40,047
Can you take a look at the abdomen?

808
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:45,511
(sighs)

809
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,890
He had cancer in the stomach.

810
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:52,768
It looks like it's progressed a lot too.

811
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:55,729
Given the seriousness,
I'm sure the patient knew about it too.

812
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:57,439
(exhales sharply)

813
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:00,692
Right, what about the baby?

814
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:04,279
The vitals are fine,
and there aren't any problems.

815
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:06,490
There are no nearby hospitals
that can accept newborns,

816
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:08,826
so we're contacting
the hospitals in Gyeonggi-do and Seoul.

817
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:40,524
-(gasps)
-Excuse me.

818
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:48,824
Are you looking for your baby?

819
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,504
It's okay.

820
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:06,925
The baby is safe.

821
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:10,304
(sobs)

822
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:14,933
(crying)

823
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:17,519
(somber music)

824
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:19,646
(crying continues)

825
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:29,907
Minjung!

826
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:34,286
What happened, you brat?

827
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:37,581
What's going on here?

828
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:40,208
(voice breaking)
I'm sorry, Dad.

829
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:42,753
I'm really sorry.
(sobbing)

830
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:45,797
I didn't know this would happen either.

831
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:47,174
(breathes shakily)
My gosh.

832
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:49,426
You silly kid,

833
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:52,429
you should have at least told me.

834
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:56,099
What if something happened to the baby?

835
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,894
I was scared.

836
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:00,979
(sobbing)

837
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:04,816
(crying)

838
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:06,568
My gosh.

839
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:10,113
What about you?

840
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:12,199
Are you okay?

841
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,957
(Minjung sobbing)

842
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:22,209
(voice breaking)
You're going to be the death of me.

843
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:25,087
(crying)
You silly girl.

844
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:27,506
You scared the heck out of me.

845
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:32,010
(wailing)

846
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:33,762
(sobbing)

847
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:55,200
-(baby coos)
-AREUM: The baby is healthy

848
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:57,744
and isn't injured anywhere.

849
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:01,039
You can touch the baby

850
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,041
if you put your hand through here.

851
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:10,382
(exhales shakily)

852
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,556
(soft music)

853
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:19,224
(cooing)

854
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:23,645
(soft chuckle)

855
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:26,606
They're so small.

856
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:30,527
One day,

857
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:34,656
this baby will use those two feet
to stand tall in this world,

858
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:37,576
just like her mom.

859
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:45,000
(sniffles, sobs)

860
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:01,683
Your daughter doesn't know
you're sick, right?

861
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:03,769
They said it's stage three already.

862
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:06,563
I don't have any money for the surgery.

863
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:15,822
Here you go.

864
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:22,829
He's a friend of mine

865
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:25,665
who specializes in gastric cancer.

866
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:28,794
We're colleagues.

867
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:32,672
I'll give him a call,
so make sure you go and get it treated.

868
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:38,678
There's also a very good treatment program
for low-income patients,

869
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:40,514
so you can go and get help from there.

870
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:41,723
Don't give up hope...

871
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:45,519
until the very end.

872
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:48,855
Doctor.

873
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:51,441
Doctor...

874
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:53,318
My gosh.

875
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:54,945
This is so generous of you.

876
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:57,322
(Minjung's dad sobs)

877
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:03,495
SABU: You have to live a long life

878
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:07,165
to see those two ladies grow.

879
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:10,710
Thank you.

880
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:13,922
(hopeful music)

881
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:23,181
(sobs)

882
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:30,814
(soft chuckle)

883
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,194
EUNJAE: There are times like this.

884
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:40,866
They're the moments
when I'm glad to be a doctor

885
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:45,871
no matter how tiring or hard it is

886
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:51,251
or how many troublesome patients
I have to deal with.

887
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:52,752
(sobbing)

888
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:03,138
EUNJAE: I can't quit this job
because I'm overwhelmed

889
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:05,348
by these rewarding moments.

890
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:09,227
(soft music)

891
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:15,692
-(clinking)
-(keyboard clacking)

892
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:25,285
He didn't do a dissection here
and did it directly.

893
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:26,912
EUNJAE: They say,

894
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:29,122
"You can't achieve anything
without going crazy."

895
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:37,005
I guess we're people
who are crazy for those moments

896
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:39,424
and always moving forward

897
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:42,385
to achieve those moments.

898
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:46,264
(phone vibrates)

899
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:54,606
CHA EUNJAE

900
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:55,690
EUNJAE: I love you.

901
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:07,744
STAFF LOUNGE

902
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:08,995
(phone vibrates)

903
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:12,332
WOOJIN: Pretty please.

904
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:36,022
What... is this?

905
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:39,359
Accept it first.

906
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:43,321
But why are you...

907
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:44,447
Oh.

908
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:47,033
I'll leave you two alone.

909
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,076
EUNTAK: No, Dr. Ung.

910
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:49,911
There's no need.

911
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:59,504
Take this to Dr. Areum
and cheer her up first.

912
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:04,175
She's in a good mood today,
so don't miss this opportunity.

913
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:07,262
Last time I checked,

914
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:09,723
Dr. Yoon was alone
in the hallway of the ER.

915
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:13,143
The universe is helping you, Nurse Euntak.

916
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:14,561
Hurry up and go.

917
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:17,939
-SEONUNG: Go.
-DONGHWA: Quickly!

918
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:22,402
(comical music)

919
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:49,679
(both mouthing)

920
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:07,322
Areum.

921
00:56:09,115 --> 00:56:10,950
I have something to say to you.

922
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:12,077
Me too.

923
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:15,246
I had something to say to you too.

924
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:16,790
Oh...

925
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:20,835
Well, you can go first. What is it?

926
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:25,382
You've been having a hard time recently
because of me, right?

927
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:30,136
You've been uncomfortable because of me

928
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:31,930
while working in the ER too.

929
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:35,016
It was probably the same for you.

930
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:36,726
I shouldn't be like that...

931
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:40,397
in the hospital,
especially while treating patients.

932
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:44,317
I'm sorry, Nurse Euntak.

933
00:56:45,026 --> 00:56:46,528
For making you uncomfortable.

934
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:51,116
So...

935
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:54,369
I've been thinking about it.

936
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:00,083
From now on...

937
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,211
why don't we make things easy...

938
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:07,257
and just be hospital colleagues
from now on?

939
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:14,431
(soft emotional music)

940
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:18,268
We're going to continue working together,

941
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:24,858
and we can't uncomfortably
stay like this forever.

942
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:26,818
Uh...

943
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:29,863
Areum.

944
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,906
If we're just colleagues,

945
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:35,827
I won't have any reason
to be disappointed by you

946
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:38,329
or upset with you.

947
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:42,000
And you won't have to...

948
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:45,211
needlessly worry about me either.

949
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:49,132
AREUM: Let's do that.

950
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:55,013
I want to feel at ease now.

951
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:01,853
It's your turn, Nurse Euntak.

952
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:05,940
What is it that you wanted to say to me?

953
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:13,990
I'm sorry.

954
00:58:16,784 --> 00:58:18,786
I suddenly don't remember.

955
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:28,046
Let me know

956
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:30,131
when you remember.

957
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:34,761
Excuse me.

958
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:40,725
(door closes)

959
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:49,734
What happened? What's going on?

960
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:52,487
DONGHWA: What?

961
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:54,364
Why didn't he give her the flowers?

962
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:56,741
Why did she walk away?

963
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:07,585
("One Hundred Love" by Lia playing)

964
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:28,523
(sniffles)

965
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:37,198
Dr. Yoon, there's a patient complaining
of abdominal pain in bed three...

966
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:40,034
(sobs)

967
00:59:41,202 --> 00:59:42,203
HYEONJEONG: Dr. Areum.

968
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:47,917
What's wrong, Dr. Areum?
Did something happen?

969
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:50,211
What is it? Are you sick?

970
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:51,754
It's nothing.

971
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:54,048
(exhales shakily)
I'm okay.

972
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:55,800
(breathes deeply)

973
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:57,302
Which bed?

974
00:59:57,802 --> 00:59:59,178
Bed three.

975
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:01,431
(breathes deeply)

976
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:13,610
AREUM: I'll get going.

977
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:20,491
What's going on?

978
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:23,620
DONGHWA: Did he...

979
01:00:24,829 --> 01:00:25,830
get dumped?

980
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:27,457
Get dumped?

981
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:28,583
(shushes)

982
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:39,886

983
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:42,430

989
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:46,077
KYUNGSOOK: It's just a formal procedure,

990
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:48,830
so just do it in a formal way.

991
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,292
This is an era where money is needed.

992
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:58,089
KYUNGSOOK: The only thing
that can bring in that money

993
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:00,717
is a favorable outcome
from a redevelopment.

994
01:02:06,514 --> 01:02:08,850
We need to realize
the dreams of the common people

995
01:02:08,933 --> 01:02:10,852
who want to turn their lives around.

996
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:14,147
Don't you agree?

997
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:16,774
DONGJU: Rather, it's divided efficiently

998
01:02:17,191 --> 01:02:21,237
to make sure that severe trauma patients
receive prompt and appropriate treatment.

999
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:25,408
Yes, because the Trauma Center
isn't a profitable hospital.

1000
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:28,327
I see.

1001
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:33,541
(phone ringing)

1002
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:36,627
Yes, Doldam...
(sighs)

1003
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:38,087
(line beeping)

1004
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:40,256
(groans, sighs)

1005
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:43,301
(gasps)
You startled me.

1006
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:46,387
Who are you?

1007
01:02:50,516 --> 01:02:52,268
MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND WELFARE
YEOM JUNGDO

1008
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:53,978
JUNGDO:
As per the Trauma Center's permit request,

1009
01:02:54,061 --> 01:02:55,563
I'm here for a preliminary inspection.

1010
01:02:55,646 --> 01:02:56,606
By the way,

1011
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:59,108
why aren't there any people here?

1012
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:00,193
Well,

1013
01:03:00,651 --> 01:03:03,196
there are usually people here, but...

1014
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:04,572
Is there a problem?

1015
01:03:05,239 --> 01:03:08,826
A problem? No, of course not.
(nervous chuckle)

1016
01:03:09,368 --> 01:03:12,288
The director
and the interim head of the center

1017
01:03:12,371 --> 01:03:14,540
are in a meeting
with the provincial budget officers.

1018
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:15,625
(inhales deeply)

1019
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:18,836
One moment, please.
I'll report this immediately.

1020
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:21,714
(phone ringing)

1021
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:24,675
-Gosh.
-JUNGDO: You should take the call.

1022
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:26,427
This is the fourth time it's ringing.

1023
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:29,514
Whoever is calling
a trauma center at this time

1024
01:03:30,431 --> 01:03:31,724
must be an emergency patient.

1025
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:33,142
One moment, please.

1026
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:35,895
Doldam Hospital Trauma Center.

1027
01:03:37,438 --> 01:03:38,439
Yes.

1028
01:03:41,442 --> 01:03:42,443
Yes.

1029
01:03:47,031 --> 01:03:48,199
(phone vibrates)

1030
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:54,121
One moment, please.

1031
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:57,166
-(tense music)
-Right,

1032
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:58,960
-we must have a patient coming in.
-(phone vibrates)

1033
01:03:59,043 --> 01:04:00,419
(Gitae chuckles)

1034
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:03,381
If you all will excuse me for a moment.

1035
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:05,216
(phone vibrates)

1036
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:08,553
I'm sorry. One moment, please!

1037
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:13,015

1040
01:04:25,903 --> 01:04:27,738
REPORTER (on TV):
A huge fire has broken out

1041
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:29,657
on a hill in Jeongseon, Gangwon-do
this afternoon.

1042
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:33,202
The flames are riding fast wind speeds
and swiftly engulfing houses.

1043
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:37,373
All that is left of the places
engulfed by the flames is charcoal soot.

1044
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:39,667
The residents who made it out

1045
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:44,547
had no choice but to watch their homes
burn away from a distance.

1046
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:48,259
Fire personnel and fire helicopter support
arrived one after another,

1047
01:04:48,342 --> 01:04:50,595
but it is said that it is difficult

1048
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:52,805
to actively extinguish the fire
due to the strong winds

1049
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:54,599
-and high, steep mountains.
-Mr. Lee!

1050
01:04:55,349 --> 01:04:58,352
REPORTER: Currently, fire authorities say
they will make efforts

1051

to minimize the damage
to the surrounding area

1052
01:05:00,813 --> 01:05:03,149
-and nearby chemical fertilizer plants...
-(sirens wailing)

1053
01:05:03,232 --> 01:05:06,444
...by deploying all available personnel
and taking every possible measure.

1054
01:05:10,531 --> 01:05:11,449
All right!

1055
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:13,868
Let's not get our spirits low.

1056
01:05:13,951 --> 01:05:16,412
You're supposed to stumble a little
on the path of justice.

You know that, right?
(chuckles)

1058
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:20,708
Nurse Joo, cheer up.

1059
01:05:20,791 --> 01:05:22,668
It's only been six hours.

Come on, cheer up!

1061
01:05:25,504 --> 01:05:27,340
You seem to be enjoying yourself.

1062
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:30,551
Enjoying myself? I'm having a hard time.
(clears throat)

1063
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:32,929
(sighs)

1064
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:35,556
EUNJAE: Let's get up, everyone.

1065
01:05:36,057 --> 01:05:37,892
Why? Are we going somewhere?

1066
01:05:37,975 --> 01:05:39,769
Let's go back to the Trauma Center.

1067
01:05:39,852 --> 01:05:41,103
What are you saying?

1068
01:05:42,146 --> 01:05:44,065
It hasn't even been a day.
Are you giving up?

1069
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:45,691
You said you're having a hard time too.

1070
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:47,401
Let's change our tactics.

1071
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:50,363
The problem won't be solved
if we just sit here.

1072
01:05:51,155 --> 01:05:54,116
Even if we do fight,
it's better to do it face-to-face.

1073
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,368
Hey.

1074
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:56,911
If he was willing to talk it out,

1075
01:05:56,994 --> 01:05:58,746
we wouldn't have done this
in the first place.

1076
01:05:58,829 --> 01:06:01,290
Kang Dongju doesn't have any common sense.

1077
01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:03,334
You had no common sense
from the start either.

1078
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:06,295
And yet you're doing fine,
after a few years.

1079
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:09,590
-Hey, Cha Eunjae, you--
-(phones buzzing)

1080
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:14,679
NURSE 1 (gasps): A forest fire?

1081
01:06:14,762 --> 01:06:16,639
-Don't we have to go?
-Right?

1082
01:06:16,722 --> 01:06:17,974
NURSE 2: What do we do?

1083
01:06:18,057 --> 01:06:19,141
Please move.

1084
01:06:20,017 --> 01:06:20,935
I have to go.

1085
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:24,563
Are you really going to work
under Kang Dongju?

1086
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:28,609
It's all over if you go now.

1087
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:31,320
You'll have to do
what Kang Dongju tells you to do!

1088
01:06:32,071 --> 01:06:33,030
Are you okay with that?

1089
01:06:33,114 --> 01:06:34,490
It's a forest fire.

1090
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:37,493
(intense music)

1091
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:41,497
(Woojin panting)

1092
01:06:50,214 --> 01:06:51,549
PARAMEDIC: Patients incoming!

1093
01:06:51,632 --> 01:06:53,801
(sirens wailing)

1094
01:07:00,307 --> 01:07:01,142
(groans)

1095
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:04,520
Sir? Come on.

1096
01:07:04,645 --> 01:07:05,813
MINGUK: Let me look.

1097
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:08,024
Paramedic Heo!

1098
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:09,316
MYEONGSIM: Paramedic Heo!

1099
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,777
(indistinct clamoring)

1100
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:13,863
Move them to Trauma Bay, quickly!

1101
01:07:13,946 --> 01:07:14,947
DONGJU: Quickly!

1102
01:07:19,827 --> 01:07:21,412
Make way, quickly!

1103
01:07:21,495 --> 01:07:22,788
Move, quickly!

1104
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:26,459
(clamoring continues)

1105
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:30,129
(sighs)
It's a mess.

1106
01:07:30,796 --> 01:07:33,382
(intense music continues)

1107
01:07:34,592 --> 01:07:37,970
(breathing heavily)

1108
01:07:56,864 --> 01:07:58,824
-Dr. Nam.
-(gasps)

1109
01:07:58,908 --> 01:07:59,950
You know, right?

1110
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:01,911
DOIL: Know what?

1111
01:08:01,994 --> 01:08:04,663
The first pupil
to ever call Master Kim, "Master."

1112
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:07,124
Why are you suddenly curious about that?

1113
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:09,585
Just because.

1114
01:08:09,877 --> 01:08:12,880
After trying to connect with Master Kim,
I got curious.

1115
01:08:13,547 --> 01:08:17,134
He says it's not Dr. Kang Dongju
or Dr. Yoon Seojung,

1116
01:08:18,052 --> 01:08:19,053
so I'm just wondering who.

1117
01:08:19,136 --> 01:08:19,970
(sucks teeth)

1118
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:24,350
She was the first pupil
Master Kim met during his heyday.

1119
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,185
Her name was Jang Hyunju.

1120
01:08:28,395 --> 01:08:31,232
You wouldn't know her.
She is your senior by several years.

1121
01:08:34,026 --> 01:08:36,904
("Still You" by Seungkwan playing)

1122
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:49,291
("Still You" by Seungkwan
continues playing)

1123
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:21,198
DR. ROMANTIC SEASON 3

1124
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:23,701
WOOJIN:
What are we devoting ourselves for?

1125
01:09:23,784 --> 01:09:24,618
But still,

1126
01:09:25,494 --> 01:09:27,163
we can keep fighting.

1127
01:09:27,246 --> 01:09:29,623
SEONUNG: I became a doctor
because I wanted to help people.

1128
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:31,792
DONGJU: That's enough.

1129
01:09:31,876 --> 01:09:34,003
(shouts)
I said let him go!

1130
01:09:34,086 --> 01:09:35,504
(shouts angrily)
There's a forest fire spreading!

1131
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:37,381
CHIEF PARK: At the latest,
the fire will reach Doldam Hospital

1132
01:09:37,464 --> 01:09:38,883
in 40 to 50 minutes.

1133
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:41,552
MUNJEONG:
We have to evacuate all of the patients.

1134
01:09:41,635 --> 01:09:42,845
MINGUK: From this point onward,

1135
01:09:43,637 --> 01:09:45,598
there is nothing a human can do.
