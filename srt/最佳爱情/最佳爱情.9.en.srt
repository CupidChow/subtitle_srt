00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:14,200
Gu Ae Jeong, you don't make my heart
race anymore.

4
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:14,710
Why?

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,970
I'm just saying that I don't feel nervous
because of you anymore.

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,110
Why not?

7
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,640
There's only one answer to all of this.

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,620
What do you think it might be?

9
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,040
Then...

10
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,310
You don't like me anymore?

11
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,020
Ding-dong!

12
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,460
It was a side effect that appeared
10 years after the surgery.

13
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,980
Even though I was so embarrassed during that
time I couldn't bear to show my face at all.

14
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:00,760
I’ve recovered!

15
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,950
But I'm all recovered now.

16
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,510
It really doesn't mean anything to you?

17
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,660
That's right.

18
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:11,390
When this right here realized it was
because of the "Heartbeat" song,

19
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,660
I woke up from the hypnosis.
Isn't that great?

20
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,170
I have to hear for myself if this is
really the truth.

21
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,350
Huh?!

22
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,300
What are you doing?

23
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,950
Stay still for a second.

24
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,100
It's racing!
It's going thump thump, right now!

25
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:29,070
If it doesn't beat, I'll die.

26
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,660
Thump thump, thumpity thump.

27
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,260
That's how it normally beats for anyone.

28
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,690
It's not supposed to go whoosh whoosh
or zoom zoom.

29
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,630
It sounds like it's zoom zooming a little.

30
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,430
That's why you should be careful
about how you rub yourself on people.

31
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,040
No matter how regular my heartbeat may be,

32
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,310
if you come at me and rub like this, then...

33
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,260
What's this about, Gu Ae Jeong?

34
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:55,120
Are you feeling disappointed, by any chance?

35
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:03,020
That my heart isn't going zoom zoom
but just thump thumping?

36
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,010
You are disappointed, aren't you? Huh?

37
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,540
Ah, ah, that stings!

38
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,300
What is it now?

39
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,320
I came because I was worried about
your sickly azalea.

40
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,290
It's a relief that you're fine.

41
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:20,040
Your hands sting like crazy.

42
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,460
But...

43
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:25,790
The song you heard when you were
receiving heart surgery 10 years ago

44
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,900
and your body reacting to it now...

45
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,960
Medically, does that even make sense?

46
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,310
Isn't it a little strange?

47
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,940
It's not strange, it's unfair.

48
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,670
I was tricked by this punk into thinking
I liked you so I shaved off my mustache

49
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,250
and lost all of my cheek fat.
I find it totally unfair.

50
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,400
I'm sorry for making you feel wronged.

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,530
But then, it does make more sense than
you saying I put a spell on you.

52
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,230
Now this is something I've never
seen before...

53
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,790
Hearing a song that was playing during
one's heart surgery

54
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,350
makes that person's heart react to it?

55
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,080
Ha, my goodness.

56
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,420
Even so...

57
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:18,590
If his heart was fine for the past 10 years,
why would it react now to this song?

58
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,540
I know, right?

59
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:28,310
This song was originally used to revive
his dying heart.

60
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:35,320
It can't be that this song has somehow
become vital to that same heart, can it?

61
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:40,170
I think I'm going to have to look over
Dok Go Jin's test results one more time.

62
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,390
Bring them to me.

63
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,070
You see...

64
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,480
There's something kind of strange going on.

65
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:51,960
Since you're a doctor, could you tell me
if you think this makes sense?

66
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:52,940
Sure.

67
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,740
Can the heart...

68
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,990
Umm... does the heart...

69
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,880
Well, you know how the heart normally
thump thumps.

70
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,910
But when that happens,
when you're looking at someone,

71
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:07,490
could you mistakenly believe you like them?

72
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:11,320
So are you asking if the thump thumping
of a heart can mistakenly

73
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:13,030
lead a person to think they're in love
with someone?

74
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,490
It's strange, isn't it?

75
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,840
You can't get confused about something
like that, can you?

76
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,030
I guess you could.

77
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:23,200
When a person sees another,
after the heart rate has increased,

78
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,650
as a result of riding a roller coaster,

79
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:30,100
I've seen research results of a sudden rush
of feelings that occurred for the person.

80
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,260
Then you can be mistaken about love too?

81
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:37,960
When that situation is experienced
repeatedly, then I guess it is possible.

82
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:46,100
Because of that person,
my heart is going thump, thump

83
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,540
[Oppa]

84
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:50,160
I love that person

85
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:56,130
Your "Heartbeat" song is what made me waver.

86
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:10,150
So if the stimulus is continuously repeated,
it's possible for a connection to form.

87
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,650
Now I feel wronged.

88
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,450
We're just going to go with the CF.

89
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,750
I won't be wronged anymore from here on out.

90
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,860
That's right. This was all just
a misunderstanding, wasn't it?

91
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,130
What was?

92
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,550
I was thinking that Ae Jeong unni

93
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,680
discovered a weakness of yours and
was using it to blackmail you.

94
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,390
It's gone now!

95
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:42,380
I was shocked when I momentarily thought
that I was a person, who had weaknesses

96
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,420
but that wasn't the case after all.

97
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:48,560
Then it's definitely not true that
Dok Go Jin likes Gu Ae Jeong, right?

98
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,450
Who was it?

99
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,420
Who was the person who spread around
such rumors?

100
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,600
I'm going to press charges. Was it you?!

101
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:05,000
I let go of my head and wasn't able
to control my surroundings enough.

102
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,070
I have to resolve all this before
the rumors begin.

103
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,910
I feel bad for Dok Go hyungnim.

104
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,630
He was kicked to the curb by Ae Jeong noona!

105
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,700
Don't be so loose-lipped.

106
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,730
If this gets around, it'll result in
a lawsuit.

107
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:24,330
- Of course, President Moon is on my side.
- With Dok Go hyungnim's personality

108
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,850
that's definitely what'll happen, right?

109
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:30,870
But of course, I'm feeling
a little satisfied.

110
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,450
You are too, President?

111
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,660
All the times I bent over backwards to
accommodate his dictator-like personality.

112
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:39,100
And the pent up anger I have now...
Why wouldn't I be?

113
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,470
I feel the same way!

114
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,860
Our Dok Go has believed until now that
he's superior to everyone else.

115
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,760
But the fact that he was dumped
by a woman...

116
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,400
Gu Ae Jeong...

117
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,180
I commend you.

118
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,300
Dok Go hyungnim doesn't know this

119
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:57,400
but Ae Jeong noona's family members
don't really like him either.

120
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,720
How pitiful our Dok Go has become.

121
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,380
It's a good thing though.

122
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,240
Does it taste good?

123
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,400
Yes.

124
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:12,510
That's good. Now why don't you explain to me
exactly what's going on at your house?

125
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,330
What have they been yapping about me,
for instance?

126
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,590
Hey, Ding-Dong.

127
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:22,050
At the age of 7, you can run your mouth

128
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,190
and say whatever you want without
worrying about other people.

129
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,760
So, go ahead and tell me, okay?

130
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:26,570
It's fine.

131
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:30,480
- Dok Go Jin is a butthole...
- That's enough, I got it.

132
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:37,740
Ahjussi, do you want to stick to
my aunt's side like this?

133
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,810
That's what I thought but I don't anymore.

134
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:45,920
I thought that something impossibly strong
was pulling me towards your aunt

135
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,710
but that's disappeared now.

136
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,770
It no longer pulls at me.

137
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,680
See, see? It's not sticking.
It's not sticking!

138
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,230
It's not sticking.

139
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,940
It's stuck.

140
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,970
I won't be pulled in by her any longer.

141
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,850
Wow...

142
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:15,990
Why are you watching TV here,
Hyung Gyu? Let's go!

143
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,800
I don't want to, I want to watch some more.

144
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,090
Gu Hyung Gyu, do you want to get
in trouble? Let's go.

145
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,750
Just leave him be.

146
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,650
There's a 3-D program beckoning to him
right now.

147
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,570
Do you really think his feet
will follow you willingly?

148
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,770
Why don't you come over here
and talk with me for a second.

149
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,230
Come on, let's go.

150
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,500
Look here.

151
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:45,700
The rumors going around are saying
that I've been chasing after you

152
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,220
and you've been running away because
you don't want me.

153
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,150
That's what people are saying. Up until now.

154
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,640
But all that is correct.

155
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:54,170
It's so humiliating I can't take it anymore.

156
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,730
My situation has been reversed.

157
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,470
I'm going to go in this direction.

158
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,850
Oh my... And now...

159
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,850
Gu Ae Jeong is latching onto me.

160
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,070
Oh my, it must be crazy!
Why is it latching on like that?

161
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,680
Gu Ae Jeong.

162
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,770
Do you feel pulled in by me right now?

163
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,760
You are feeling pulled in, aren't you?

164
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,870
Who do you think you're talking about?
It's only the magnets that are.

165
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,730
Just like this magnet, now that I'm turning
my back and saying I want to go on my way,

166
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,790
you're compelled to follow, aren't you?

167
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,270
Don't generalize our situation
like the magnets.

168
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:41,610
Then do you want to try putting
this on again to confirm?

169
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,280
Why should I?

170
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,530
I'm curious now, so I'd like for you to
try it on so we could know for sure.

171
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,200
Here, here, here. Yes?

172
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,300
I don't want to!

173
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:52,130
Oh, since you're saying
you can't put it on...

174
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:55,390
You're attracted to me, aren't you?

175
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,720
You're attracted, you're attracted!
Gu Ae Jeong, you're attracted!

176
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,400
You're attracted, you're attracted!
You're attracted!

177
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,770
- You're attracted!
- Hyung Gyu, let's go!

178
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:04,480
You're attracted, you're attracted!
Gu Ae Jeong is attracted to me! See?

179
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,400
Hyung Gyu, let's go!

180
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,640
You're attracted, you're attracted.
Gu Ae Jeong, you're attracted.

181
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:15,190
I feel so bad I don't know what to do
since I've decided to go my way.

182
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,910
Hyung Gyu, hurry up. Let's go.

183
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,660
It's almost over though.

184
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,520
Hey, Ding Dong, why don't you watch
till the end?

185
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:23,060
You can stay and watch the second
and third ones too if you'd like.

186
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,320
Take care, Gu Ae Jeong.

187
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:31,110
I'm now going to remain in my 60 to 90
range and be at peace.

188
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,640
This humiliating unrequited love
is now yours, Gu Ae Jeong.

189
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,400
- Does it make you that happy?
- Yes.

190
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:38,360
I feel like all the humiliation
I've suffered is finally fading away.

191
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:41,540
Why don't you go ahead and agree
I'm right before you go

192
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,520
so my pride will be revived as well?

193
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,670
You're attracted, you're attracted.
Gu Ae Jeong is attracted to me!

194
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,150
Too bad.

195
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,690
I can't ever admit to it because
I'd rather drown and die in the humiliation.

196
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,210
Hyung Gyu, I'm really going now.

197
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,290
So, get up now. Hurry up.
Get up! Hurry!

198
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,710
Quickly! Get up! Quickly, quickly!

199
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:09,030
Leave the glasses here.
The glasses. That's right.

200
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,710
You're attracted, you're attracted.
Gu Ae Jeong is attracted to me.

201
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,920
She's attracted to Dok Go Jin!

202
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:40,770
Gu Ae Jeong was right next to me
but I'm still at 88.

203
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,310
She's definitely attracted to me.

204
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,370
What should I do? I feel so bad for her...

205
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:50,250
Oh my, I feel so sorry now...

206
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:55,250
Restoration! Recovery! Happiness!

207
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:13,810
Oh my!

208
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,690
Pil Joo.

209
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:36,120
I was wrong to force you when you didn't
want to do the broadcast in the beginning.

210
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,080
Just go to China and study like you wanted.

211
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:41,520
I won't stop you from going any longer.

212
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,670
I'll do as you wanted, just like always.

213
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,290
- I'm not going.
- Is this because of Gu Ae Jeong?

214
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,480
I won't ever accept her!

215
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,340
Since you're sincerely trying to stop me,

216
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,780
I guess you've realized that my feelings
for her are sincere as well.

217
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:00,040
I've been so embarrassed ever since
that report about you and Gu Ae Jeong

218
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,530
that I can't even show my face
in public anymore!

219
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,250
I can't even play golf!

220
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,390
If you keep this up, I'm going to end up
an outcast!

221
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,050
Then I'll keep you company.

222
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,000
If the information on
the patient chart is correct,

223
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,400
Gu Ae Jeong's house is somewhere
around here.

224
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:29,620
It says that the girlfriend of a yakuza
is supposed to live in a palace.

225
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:36,190
I need to storm in there and find
some evidence to dissuade my Pil Joo.

226
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,060
You've arrived at your destination.

227
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,210
Huh? What is this?

228
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,550
What is this?

229
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,910
Where exactly is the palace?

230
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,820
Oh my, you scared me!

231
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:59,350
But... what are you doing here?

232
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:05,170
Is... is this Gu Ae Jeong's house?

233
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,800
Yes.

234
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,940
Her family members are the ones
who live here while Gu Ae Jeong

235
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:15,330
lives somewhere else with another
person, right?

236
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:21,340
Ae Jeong has lived here with our three
family members for 7 years now.

237
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:24,080
And also, there's no one else!

238
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,000
This wasn't supposed to happen.

239
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:34,810
It'd be much easier to dissuade him
from a girl with a past.

240
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:37,840
It's going to be even harder if
she's shabby.

241
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:40,400
What? What is she talking about? What?

242
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,400
Sh-shabby? She...

243
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,980
So the way I've been acting until now

244
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:52,170
was all due to a side effect from
my heart surgery.

245
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,950
Do the two of you understand?

246
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,740
So you'd better not make any assumptions.

247
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,040
Wow, things like that do happen.

248
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:03,060
I took Ae Jeong noona's side for nothing.

249
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:07,990
All of the problems that occurred because
of Loser Ddong Go Jin need to be resolved.

250
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,410
The CF contract with Kang Se Ri,
let's do it!

251
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,420
Good! That's a relief.

252
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,220
Thank you for coming back, Dok Go Jin.

253
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,630
And also...

254
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,550
The sneaker donation project.

255
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,720
Tell Gu Ae Jeong to take care of it.

256
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,340
But why? You don't like giving glory
to others.

257
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:27,440
I've been giving her lots of grief,

258
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,750
so I might as well do something
to make up for it.

259
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:33,890
It'll also improve her negative image
with the public.

260
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,490
Okay, we'll do that.

261
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,970
Oh, but as long as she's with Yoon Pil Joo,

262
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,990
her negative image will automatically
improve.

263
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,820
So you don't have to worry about that,
Dok Go.

264
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:43,850
Okay.

265
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,540
The doctor should accompany her.

266
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:57,670
I won't need the van for the time being,
so tell him and Gu Ae Jeong to use it.

267
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:03,670
But she and that doctor might use your van
to film themselves on dates...

268
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,480
Good for them then.

269
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:07,720
We have to rid ourselves of our
cheap reputation.

270
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:13,460
If they need it, tell them to ride
in it together.

271
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:24,960
Our Ae Jeong will do her best
with Yoon Pil Joo on Real Love Corner.

272
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,080
Do well! Gu Ae Jeong has jackpot potential.

273
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:33,330
You can't tell Yoon Pil Joo yet that
you've agreed to this, alright?

274
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:36,140
Because then the realistic shock
will be diminished.

275
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:37,990
Y- yes.

276
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:42,450
Oh my... Manager Gu!

277
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,450
Are you crying?!

278
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:53,110
This is the first time in ten years
that our Ae Jeong has been sought out.

279
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:58,320
Throughout the past decade,
everyone would curse her every move.

280
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,980
And I couldn't do anything to help her
because I'm such a fool.

281
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,800
To me...

282
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,810
This program is important to me
as her manager...

283
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,920
But as her brother, our Ae Jeong really...

284
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:22,770
Please help us so she can do well.

285
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,990
Oh my...

286
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:27,960
Here, for your tears.

287
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,340
Don't cry, stop crying.

288
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,190
How can a man cry so much? Huh?!

289
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,460
Enough! Enough! Enough!

290
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:45,750
This is the first time I feel this pleased
about being her manager.

291
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:49,710
Ah, it's been so long! It's wonderful
being able to be in a broadcast station.

292
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,070
Should I travel around with
Ae Jeong instead?

293
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,590
So I could keep an eye on Se Ri as well.

294
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,620
Really?

295
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:57,590
Then if we get married,

296
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,840
will our roles change and I get
to run the store?

297
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:05,610
No, Noona!

298
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,870
I'm going to take over Noona's shop.

299
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,840
What's this? Why are you butting in?

300
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,010
Why are you here?

301
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,970
I came because of Dok Go hyungnim's
special, Noona.

302
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:17,790
Ae Jeong will be coming out with a
new album, appearing on variety shows.

303
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,730
If she acts as well, she'll get
the triple crown!

304
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,180
What, you think Ae Jeong is
Lee Seung Gi or something?

305
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:27,810
Oh! It's the real Lee Seung Gi!

306
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,810
Because you're my woman, Noona

307
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:34,040
Because you're my woman

308
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,550
How have you been?

309
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:40,920
Hello!

310
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:43,200
I'm a huge fan of yours, Lee Seung Gi.

311
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,820
- Can I shake your hand?
- Ah, yes.

312
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,000
It's a pleasure.

313
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:47,380
Thank you.

314
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,370
Goodbye.

315
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,570
One second!

316
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:53,400
You're wearing the same scarf as her!

317
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,390
It's the same one as mine.

318
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,410
Yes.

319
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,120
Thank you.

320
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,600
He's so polite and kind!

321
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,380
He looks the same in person
as he does on TV.

322
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,570
I know, right?

323
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,760
He's a top star but he's so nice
and knows how to greet people.

324
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,510
He's the complete opposite of
Dok Go hyungnim.

325
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,840
When I first met Dok Go hyungnim,

326
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:44,750
I thought he was a nice person as well
and I completely fell for his act.

327
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,080
This...

328
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:06,900
Is this something a dog or mackerel
can wear?

329
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:10,050
- It's a limited edition...
- So what? Apparently, anyone can wear it.

330
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,600
I can't wear things like this.

331
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,730
Sunbaenim.

332
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,800
Yes, hello.

333
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,550
- Ah, Seung Gi.
- Yes, Sunbaenim?

334
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,780
The program that you worked so hard
to get MC for, Steel Heart...

335
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:33,620
Get our company's newbie Gu Ae Jeong
to appear on it.

336
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:34,670
Ah, yes.

337
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,950
The guests are chosen by the PD and writer,
so how could I...

338
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,350
Why are you being like this?
We're both pros.

Isn't anything possible when you want it?

340

You still haven't reached that level yet?

341
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,290
If you put it that way, Sunbaenim...

342
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,090
I'll try and speak with them about it.

343
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,090
But...

344
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:02,450
Is it that important to you that you ask
such a big favor of me?

345
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,770
If you do this for me,

346
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:12,550
I won't lay a finger on your
refrigerator CF.

347
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,160
The refrigerator one?

I'm Lee Seung Gi.

No matter the fact that you're my sunbae,

350
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:26,770
I'm not someone who you can steal
CF deals so easily from.

351
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:29,650
I've protected my CFs diligently until now.

352
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,550
And I will continue to do so as well.

00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,030
You can't do that.

- It's Lee Seung Gi!

Yes, thank you. Thank you.

Dok Go Jin said he's over you
but he's clinging onto you again?

403

All this makes it obvious
he's madly in love with you.

You're not good at talking about stuff
like that, Oppa.

a piece of my mind?

No, if you're not careful, he'll be sure

seem like he's going to stop anytime soon.

I called you because...

425
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:10,280
I was worried you weren't keeping
your heart rate under control.

426
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,320
It's a relief that's not the case.

427

I still want you to undergo some tests

428
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,030
since you said that you were experiencing
some pain.

429
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,510
No, we don't need to do that.

430
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,870
It was all due to hypnosis.

431
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,180
Are you sure it was because of hypnosis

432
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,980
that your heart was thumping so rapidly and
endured such strong feelings?

433
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:25,640
Of course I am.

434
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:27,650
Isn't it possible that instead of you liking
her because your heart was thumping,

435
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:30,230
your heart was thumping because
you liked her?

436
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,010
Are you certain which is which?

437
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:12,210
I went to the hospital for nothing,
now I'm getting paranoid.

438
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:16,630
Now! Time for mind control.

439
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:35,000
Thump, thump...

440
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:37,480
What is this?

441
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:39,270
Why am I singing this song?

442
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,250
What?

443
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,370
Why did you do it again, Dok Go Jin?

444
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:59,940
Did you have a sudden change of heart again
and decide you liked me again?

445
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,530
Ding dong or something?

446
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:04,890
You might be saying this because
you're still disappointed but that's not it.

447
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:08,190
Then what is it?

448
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,590
I'm feeling guilty and thankful and
I felt bad for you. That's why.

449
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,390
For what?

450
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,570
I felt guilty about pursing you
so relentlessly,

451
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,970
thankful that you didn't accept me

452
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:20,690
and I felt bad for you that you started
feeling for me when it was too late.

Don't feel burdened because
I'm doing this to compensate.

455
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,590
Really?

456
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:35,190
You're so proper now, Dok Go Jin.

457
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,610
One second.

458
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,090
What is it now?

459
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,310
I'm so disappointed and attracted to you
I can't just leave.

460
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,770
- What?
- You're right, Dok Go Jin.

461
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,470
It's disappointing that the Loser
Ddong Go Jin

462
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,670
who claimed he liked me so much is gone.

463
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:05,610
And when you say that I'm attracted to
the Proper Dok Go Jin you've become...

464
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,600
You're right.

465
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:10,540
Gu Ae Jeong, you said you'd never
admit to it.

466
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:12,450
Why are you suddenly admitting to it now?

467
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,900
Dok Go Jin.

468
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:16,260
Just give me 10 seconds.

469
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:22,230
Let me confirm that you don't pass
the safety zone from 60 to the 90.

470
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:33,840
Are you really feeling disappointed
and attracted to me?

471
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,780
Yes.

472
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:42,530
Since you're standing so close to me,
I want to stick even closer like a magnet.

473
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:01,640
Did you try doing this because
you felt so wronged?

474
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:05,560
You can't even throw yourself
at me properly. Leave.

475
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,700
When you were throwing yourself at me,

476
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,700
did you actually want to be with me?

477
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:20,340
Did you want actually wanted to
stick with me till the end?

478
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:27,610
I guess that heart turned of its own accord
without the need

479
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:32,800
for those complicated, realistic thoughts.

480
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,890
You said it was a transplanted heart, right?

481
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,850
Your heart is so proper.

482
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:05,040
What is this, have you gone insane again?
Why are you racing?

483
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:10,590
I didn't have the time to think
those complicated, realistic thoughts.

484
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,790
Right?

485
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,240
So you're saying Dok Go Jin really turned
his back on her.

486
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,590
That's what he said.

487
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,590
He was in the best mood yesterday and today.

488
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:26,750
If he was going to be so happy
once he had a change of heart, why?

489
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,180
Seriously why did he pursue Ae Jeong
so relentlessly?!

490
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,090
After making it seem weird for her
to go to Yoon Pil Joo?

491
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:36,580
Wasn't Ae Jeong noona's decision
about Yoon Pil Joo certain?

492
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:42,050
Yes, if we want to make them
a couple for sure,

493
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:47,120
I should start by setting the mood
for them first!

494
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,390
Yes, I'll be sure to stop by your place
for dinner, Jenny.

495
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,040
Yes.

496
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:58,450
I guess it does help when the people
around you step in.

497
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:03,920
It'll be hard to try and carry
the conversation during dinner again.

498
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,130
Calm down.

499
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,870
Because you got nervous, you almost became
a troublemaker again.

500
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,460

00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,650
Kang Se Ri?

503
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:52,970
Ah... you were my next appointment.

504
00:32:57,190 --> 00:33:00,840
Don't I seem too thin and exhausted?

505
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:02,670
You do.

506
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,240
I almost overdosed on the medicine
you prescribed last time.

507
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,950
My insides felt like they were going
to explode

508
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,850
but it was great at emptying them out.

509
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,800
You shouldn't do that.

510
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:12,200
Let me take a look.

511
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,770
You're lacking energy, aren't you?

512
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:17,490
Are you displaying other symptoms?

513
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,450
No matter how carefully you examine me,

514
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:23,650
you won't figure out why I'm in pain,
Yoon Pil Joo.

515
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,910
I'm not that much of a blockhead.

516
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,640
You know that Ae Jeong unni
has a bad reputation, don't you?

517
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:34,540
If you do the show with her,
you'll only be criticized more.

518
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:35,910
But do you still want to do it?

519
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,310
If I show everyone that I really like her,

520
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:42,530
won't everyone else start to like her
as well?

521
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:45,010
You know that Ae Jeong unni likes
someone else, right?

522
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:50,510
I'm hoping that if I like her enough,
something will happen in my favor.

523
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:56,760
It hurts so much to watch someone
you like like someone else.

524
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,380
You don't even have a backup plan.
You really are a blockhead.

525
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,590
That blockhead.

526
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,980
You don't have to worry anymore.

527
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:43,170
Kang Se Ri, can we get your autograph?

528
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,960
I'm a huge fan.

529
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:47,710
For me, too.

530
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:52,310
Please give us your autograph.

531
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,950
Kang Se Ri.

532
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:55,660
Kang Se Ri!

533
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,860
Kang Se Ri, are you all right?

534
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,530
Are you okay?

535
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:04,920
Director!

536
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:11,340
Kang Se Ri, are you okay? Can you stand up?

537
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,500
Please prepare a bed.

538
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,770
Okay.

539
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:27,690
Even though Gu Ae Jeong threw herself
at me, I feel completely fine.

540
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:36,480
Why do I feel so ashamed that
it's behaving so properly?

541
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:48,510
Instead of changing just my heart,
I should return everything to normal.

542
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:01,430
The bribe that I sent to Peter.

543
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:05,130
Grapes... that were made into wine.

544
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:10,820
It started with this so I'll end it
with this.

545
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,740
I think you're a really incredible cook!

546
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:19,910
- Oh, hello!
- Why did you prepare so much?!

547
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,170
Where's Ae Hwan?

548
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,500
Oh, he said he needs to look over
Hyung Gyu's homework.

549
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:27,040
Is today a special day?

550
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:28,570
It's a celebration!

551
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,970
These days, there are only things
to celebrate for you!

552
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,240
It must be your good lucky charm!

553
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:34,450
Lucky charm!

554
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:38,260
He's coming. He should be here soon.

555
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,960
You sure did prepare a lot.

556
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,780
It must be your good luck charm!

557
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:57,160
Was it you...?

558
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:00,470
I am a powerless manager.

559
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:12,070
This is the thing that played a crucial role
in bringing us to this point.

560
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,330
Sent to Peter but sent back.

561
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:17,980
You know... the grapes!
The grapes that were made into wine.

562
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,280
Why did you bring this here?

563
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:23,290
Awkwardness? Gratefulness?

564
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:26,290
Pity? Are you here to compensate
for those things?

565
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:29,550
I forgot to add one thing.

566
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,570
Gu Ae Jeong.

567
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,130
I'm...

568
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,590
*Sorry! (*play-on-words: it sounds as
the word "sound" in Korean)

569
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,820
Can't you hear it?

570
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:42,360
You can hear that sound, right?

571
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:45,590
That sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Can't you hear it?
Sorry, sorry, sorry?

572
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,540
Sorry, sorry!
Sorry, sorry!

573
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:50,200
I can't hear it.

574
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,370
Anyways, there's something like that,
so I brought it.

575
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:57,380
With this, Gu Ae Jeong,
I would like you to recover as well.

576
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:58,300
Recover?

577
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:02,500
This was our beginning so if we drink this,
you will recover.

578
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:03,530
How does that make any sense?

579
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:06,860
Believe me. I recovered because
I firmly believed it.

580
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:08,080
You'll be the same way too.

581
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:09,680
Red sun!

582
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:11,900
I just put a spell on you.

583
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:15,590
If you open up our beginning,

584
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:22,390
everything will also end for you.

585
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,740
Nice! Gu Ae Jeong!

586
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,840
Gu Ae Jeong! Recovery! Recovery!

587
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:37,840
Gu Ae Jeong is fully recovered.

588
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:44,510
One shot...

589
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,880
Gu Ae Jeong, what are you doing?

590
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:51,500
That's $15,000!

591
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:56,320
- Ae Jeong noona!
- Ae Jeong!

592
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,270
I'm all recovered now.

593
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:33,220
Because you idiotically chugged it down,
it wants to come back out.

594
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:36,610
I'm never going to throw this up.

595
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:43,260
I'm going to eat up everything
that happened,

596
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:48,390
digest it all and make it into poop.

597
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:10,490
I seem to have something in my eyes

598
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,680
Are you okay, Ae Jeong noona?

599
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:09,120
Ae Jeong, are you okay? Are you okay?

600
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:10,800
Are you alright? You okay?

601
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:17,920
That's why my tears keep flowing

602
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:14,160
Be careful with her.

603
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,940
Are you alright?

604
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:24,710
I have been hiding a part of my heart

605
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:23,170
Dok Go Jin.

606
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:28,320
Yoon Pil Joo will be coming.
Can you please excuse yourself?

607
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:33,170
A certain person can't even sense it
thus bringing me to tears

608
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:34,080
Yoon Pil Joo is an excellent man
who really cares for Ae Jeong.

609
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:36,710
Even if you cannot hear me

610
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:36,910
He cares for her so much that even when
Ae Jeong lost something special of his,

611
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:39,700
Even if you cannot hear my heart

612
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,690
he worried that she would feel horrible

613
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:44,840
so he bought another one and pretended
to have found it.

614
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:43,490
The love my tears convey

615
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:47,200
Will you finally hear it someday?

616
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:47,780
Something? What's that?

617
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,610
Because you are my man

618
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:49,160
A pen.

619
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:53,560
The pen that you threw away and
retrieved again.

620
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:54,350
Because you are my love

621
00:40:54,550 --> 00:41:01,950
After sending you away and letting go,
you still remain and make me cry

622
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:58,730
That pen... Didn't Gu Ae Jeong buy then
say she found it?

623
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:02,200
That's just a misunderstanding that
you believed by yourself.

624
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:05,360
Because you are my man

625
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:09,640
It's because you are still my man

626
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:16,910
I can't hold back these foolish tears

627
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,280
I thought about what you said earlier.

628
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:21,820
Watching someone you like like someone else...

629
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,840
How much it hurts...

630
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:29,520
Does it hurt a lot to break up with
Dok Go Jin?

631
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:35,070
If you have been so weak from that,

632
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:37,320
you must have been really sincere about it.

633
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:40,070
Yes, I am sincere.

634
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:44,120
I didn't know that it was this much.

635
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:50,110
But when I see him, I like him more.

636
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:54,590
Since I'm in the same situation,
I can't give you a solution

637
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:56,610
But feel better.

638
00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:00,770
You are a person who received love
from a lot of people.

639
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:05,520
But if they knew you were feeling so blue,
they would be upset.

640
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:08,990
Feel better, okay?

641
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:14,730
Then stay a little bit longer.

642
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:19,260
I feel more depressed when I'm alone.

643
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:21,710
Stay a little bit more.

644
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,790
Then I'll stay a little longer.

645
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,670
Do you usually feel depressed?

646
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:39,640
I guess so...

647
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:43,030
For depression, you should drink some tea.

648
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,960
I'll write down what tea will make you
feel better.

649
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,770
Chen Pi tea.

650
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,460
Longan tea.

651
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:01,250
Rose petal tea.

652
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:18,910
Ae Jeong's not in the bathroom.

653
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:19,690
Did she go out?

654
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:22,170
I was watching Dok Go Jin go,
so I didn't see.

655
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:23,830
Where did she go?

656
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:27,170
Since she chugged all that down,
she's probably drunk now!

657
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,960
Hurry and call her.

658
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:46,550
Gu Ae Jeong?

659
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:08,570
Gu Ae Jeong.

660
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,150
Gu Ae Jeong, why are you here?

661
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:22,720
Please pick up.

662
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:24,260
She's not picking up?

663
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:26,180
Where is she?

664
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:27,270
Why is it only you two.

665
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,370
Ae Hwan, did you see Ae Jeong
on your way in?

666
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:31,060
I didn't see her. Why?

667
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:34,620
She chugged down a bottle of wine
then disappeared.

668
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,280
Ae Jeong's drunk?

669
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:40,420
She can't show her drinking habits
to a harsh person.

670
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:45,880
Wasn't Ae Jeong involved in a case involving
intoxication and violence a long time ago?

671
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:50,660
Are you okay?

672
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,450
Are you drunk?

673
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,450
Are you okay? Are you drunk?

674
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,650
What is this?

675
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,840
What is this?

676
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:02,590
Gu Ae Jeong, wake up.

677
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,160
Wake up.

678
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:08,690
When she gets drunk, she repeats
everything someone says.

679
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:12,620
At that time, it was a middle aged woman.

680
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:16,650
And she started talking informally and that
woman caused a scene because she was angry.

681
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:19,170
And Ae Jeong continued to follow her.

682
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:22,530
Then the woman said, "Is this bitch crazy?"

683
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:26,960
and Ae Jeong repeated that.

684
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:33,880
What are you two doing? Hurry and find her!

685
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:37,920
Gu Ae Jeong.

686
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,140
Gu Ae Jeong.

687
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:41,520
Stupid.

688
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:43,200
Stupid.

689
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:50,390
Is your drinking habit repeating everything?

690
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:53,240
Repeating everything.

691
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:56,070
Why didn't you explain about the pen?

692
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,340
Didn't explain.

693
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:01,740
You didn't trust me, did you?

694
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:04,840
Didn't trust you.

695
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:10,970
Then when you said you wouldn't
like me back,

696
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:16,120
were you really going to cancel them?

697
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:18,550
Really going to cancel them.

698
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:24,260
And you brought those potatoes for me?

699
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:27,390
Brought for you.

700
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:34,060
Then you came to feed the fish.

701
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,740
I came.

702
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,450
I'm sorry.

703
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:28,110
Hello.

704
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:29,740
You came!

705
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:33,560
Ae Jeong is a bit drunk and she went out.

706
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:36,420
Ae Hwan and Jae Suk are looking for her.

707
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:38,130
Is she really drunk?

708
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,760
I'll go look for her too.

709
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:52,720
Gu Ae Jeong!

710
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,440
Are you okay?

711
00:47:56,450 --> 00:47:58,190
Are you okay?

712
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:00,670
Can you stand up?

713
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:08,970
How much did you drink?

714
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:20,800
Can you stand up?

715
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:43,090
This faraway thing called love

716
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:43,220
Gu Ae Jeong...

717
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:50,750
If it comes into sight,
it will bring heartache and tears, right?

718
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:49,420
Tomorrow, you will hold my hand
for sure, right?

719
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:53,840
That's why I left you

720
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:57,160
So that I can fall in love with my love

721
00:48:57,470 --> 00:49:04,550
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

722
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:10,410
Don't forget me

723
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:14,490
Even if I only lived for a second

724
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:14,210
It's a promise.

725
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:20,780
I'll be the one and only heart who loves you

726
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:24,640
For that one and only

727
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:29,400
I've concealed sorrowful tears and left

728
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:34,000
So please remember me

729
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:39,740
I should have raised an animal that
could talk.

730
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:46,580
A dog would have gone "woof, woof"
if I asked if Gu Ae Jeong came.

731
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:44,810
Don't forget me

732
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:51,140
Why didn't you guys say a thing?

733
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:57,770
Manager Jang.

734
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:00,310
When National Treasure Girls broke up,

735
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,670
it would have been okay to continue on.

736
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:07,680
But why did we break up as Ae Jeong said,
even when she was the one who hit me?

737
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:12,370
At that time, there was definitely someone
backing Ae Jeong up from somewhere.

738
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:16,480
The company's CEO received money
from that person

739
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:20,280
and immediately decided on a break up.

740
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:24,270
Ae Jeong had a person like that? Who?

741
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:27,550
If I knew that, do you think I would
leave Ae Jeong alone?

742
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:34,590
Do you think Han Mi Na would know
since they were close?

743
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,470
That's my guess.

744
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:40,770
If I find her, I have a lot to ask her.

745
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:48,070
I want to ask her everything too.
But there are a lot of things in the air.

746
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:51,360
I don't know if I should find her or not.

747
00:50:51,370 --> 00:50:53,030
If you find her, let me know.

748
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:57,320
I'll make sure to dig up Gu Ae Jeong's
secrets without troubling you.

749
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:09,650
Gu Ae Jeong, take your medicine.

750
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:11,780
Not right now, Unni.

751
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:17,670
Yoon Pil Joo brought this here,
saying that your insides will hurt.

752
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:20,550
He firmly requested that I heat it up.

753
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:25,130
Yoon Pil Joo is such a great man.

754
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:26,560
Ae Jeong.

755
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:33,320
I want you to live without getting hurt
anymore.

756
00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:38,930
So even though I know what's making you
worry or hesitant,

757
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,160
I'm going to pretend I don't know.

758
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:45,940
I'm going to go. Make sure you take
your medicine!

759
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:57,930
I'm going to die...

760
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,050
It's cold.

761
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:30,330
It's warm.

762
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,610
The weather's so nice.

763
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:51,280
It's hot.

764
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,100
Dok Go Jin... Why is he here again?

765
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:07,620
Do you think he's trying to stop you
from filming?

766
00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:09,960
He's probably here because he felt
uncomfortable

767
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,660
listening to my drunk ramblings.

768
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:15,570
I should set him straight before I go.

769
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:16,980
Ae Hwan, you go first.

770
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:22,340
Ae Jeong, you're definitely going
to come, right?

771
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:25,310
I'm going to believe that you're going
to come.

772
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,180
Gu Ae Jeong, are you okay?

773
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:44,080
Your wine has given me quite the hangover.

774
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,350
Please get rid of it.

775
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:49,040
Then take me to the filming.

776
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:00,880
I'm going to cure my headache and
my insides with hangover soup.

777
00:54:00,890 --> 00:54:03,660
So until I'm done, don't get on my bad side.

778
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:08,000
Now that I think about,

779
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:12,090
I never sat face to face with you
and stayed until the very end.

780
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:15,140
You always made me storm out.

781
00:54:15,170 --> 00:54:18,710
You never let me rest comfortably before.

782
00:54:20,210 --> 00:54:23,540
But that's a good thing.

783
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:27,910
If I didn't storm out and stayed with you
until the end,

784
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,000
we would have come out over there.

785
00:54:32,830 --> 00:54:34,710
Then it would have plummeted.

786
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,960
For you, it wouldn't have mattered
that much, since you're at the bottom.

787
00:54:37,970 --> 00:54:41,970
But for me, who's at the top, it would
have been a completely different story.

788
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:46,040
If you knew that so well, why didn't you
like me without letting me know?

789
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:49,300
I liked you so much that I couldn't do it.

790
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:52,790
- Did you even really like me?
- Yes.

791
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:56,790
You witnessed me plummeting down
to my pathetic one-sided love state.

792
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:59,230
I can say this honestly since it's not
the case anymore

793
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,210
but if I hadn't come to my senses,

794
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:05,200
I really would have hit rock bottom
and my heart would have broken.

795
00:55:06,610 --> 00:55:09,400
Why are you laughing at me?
Are you mocking me?

796
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,790
You turned away from me not because
I was pathetic.

797
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:18,820
You still liked me a lot and it makes me
feel good.

798
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,550
Even if you smile like that,
I'm perfectly fine.

799
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:32,930
You're right.

800
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,880
It's behaving so properly that
I sort of hate it.

801
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:41,090
I'm Dok Go Jin, the master of mind control.

802
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:45,250
What are you doing?

803
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:48,060
I wanted to check how good you were
with mind control.

804
00:55:48,070 --> 00:55:49,560
- Check?
- Yes.

805
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:51,860
I just confirmed that you're perfectly fine.

806
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:54,910
It's here.

807
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:00,780
- Eat deliciously.
- Thank you.

808
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:08,460
I should eat this heartily and become
perfectly fine too.

809
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:12,510
Since my head and my insides hurt a little.

810
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:55,020
- Did you check all the supplies?
- Yes.

811
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:59,850
How about the lights? Go check them. Run.

812
00:56:59,910 --> 00:57:02,060
I just wanted to check on the lighting.

813
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:05,150
You have to be careful.
Keep everything a secret.

814
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:08,230
Okay. Did you check everything else?

815
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,560
We're getting ready for the night filming!

816
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:14,660
Get ready to go on air!

817
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:20,040
Yoon Pil Joo.

818
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:23,580
You believe that Ae Jeong will definitely
come out, right?

819
00:57:24,590 --> 00:57:28,770
- But I don't think she'll come out.
- What?

820
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:30,250
You seem really flustered.

821
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:32,110
Was that a joke?

822
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:36,220
I'm already nervous, so please don't joke
around like that.

823
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:40,150
You were flustered and now,
you're angry, aren't you?

824
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:46,260
Don't forget that feeling and remember it
so that it's easier to explain.

825
00:57:59,670 --> 00:58:03,520
I'll film really well over there.

826
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,900
Thank you dropping me off.

827
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:13,020
The doctor is waiting for you
over there, right?

828
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:14,300
Yes.

829
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:22,220
Dok Go Jin.

830
00:58:23,130 --> 00:58:30,510
Since you were honest with me,
I'll be honest with you before I go.

831
00:58:32,990 --> 00:58:37,710
Truthfully, you made my heart flutter.

832
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:45,990
After meeting you, cherry blossoms bloomed
in my heart...

833
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,220
then camellias bloomed...

834
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:51,740
and azaleas too.

835
00:58:55,220 --> 00:59:00,020
But after flowers blossom, they fall off
at some point.

836
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:07,000
So even though I felt excited and happy,
I was afraid.

837
00:59:07,390 --> 00:59:10,820
I was slowly approaching you one step
at a time.

838
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:16,110
But luckily, the flowers fell off
on their own first.

839
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:30,160
Thank you so much for showing me
beautiful flowers this spring.

840
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:41,520
Something's wrong.

841
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:45,550
My heart is thumping.

842
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:48,670
I'll be going.

843
00:59:49,770 --> 00:59:51,060
Gu Ae Jeong.

844
00:59:55,870 --> 00:59:58,290
It seems like something's wrong.

845
00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:03,310
I have to confirm something for sure.

846
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,710
Because you are my man

847
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:13,550
Because you are my love

848
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:21,150
After sending you away and letting go,
you still remain and make me cry

849
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:24,560
Because you are my man

850
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:28,840
It's because you are still my man

851
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:34,490
I can't hold back these foolish tears

852
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:38,360
It's completely fine.

853
01:00:36,790 --> 01:00:39,660
Why can't you hear?

854
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:41,090
Completely fine?

855
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:43,510
Why can't you see me?

856
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:46,720
Turn around, I'm here

857
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:50,600
What I'm saying is that I love you, you fool

858
01:00:47,030 --> 01:00:48,610

you're nervous but happy

883
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:36,180
at the thought of starting a relationship
with Ae Jeong, right?

884
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:44,210
But, I don't want to stand here
and just watch so I'm going to tell you.

885

That feeling I told you to remember
is how I'm feeling right now.

Because I like you.

887
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:09,830
What's wrong with his expression?

888
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:13,060
Really. Why does he look like that?

889
01:03:13,970 --> 01:03:15,490
It's Gu Ae Jeong!

890
01:03:15,570 --> 01:03:17,020
Keep the camera on her.

891
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:31,390

coming to start a new beginning
with Yoon Pil Joo.

896
01:03:44,830 --> 01:03:48,780
Or is she coming to painfully reject him?

897
01:03:48,790 --> 01:03:51,980

898
01:03:51,990 --> 01:03:55,880

899
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:59,480
Viewers, just wait a little more.

900
01:04:10,510 --> 01:04:14,490
Gu Ae Jeong suddenly stopped walking.

901
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:17,560
Is she wavering in the most
important moment?

902
01:04:17,570 --> 01:04:24,010
Is her swaying for a happy ending
or a beautiful departure?

903
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:35,400
It is a very tense moment.

904
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:57,060

Yoon Pil Joo.

905
01:04:57,540 --> 01:05:00,980

906
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:13,390
Yoon Pil Joo is all ready.

907
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:17,670
Gu Ae Jeong, please let your heart decide.

908
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:37,840
Gu Ae Jeong...

909
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:46,890
This faraway thing called love

910
01:05:47,370 --> 01:05:54,100
If it comes into sight,
it will bring heartache and tears, right?

911
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:57,600
That's why I left you

912
01:05:57,650 --> 01:06:00,960
So that I can fall in love with my love

913
01:06:01,270 --> 01:06:08,350
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

914
01:06:09,910 --> 01:06:14,210
Don't forget me

915
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:16,430
Gu Ae Jeong, it hurts so much.

916
01:06:14,210 --> 01:06:18,290
Even if I only lived for a second

917
01:06:16,850 --> 01:06:18,950
I think I'm going to die.
