00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:14,200
Gu Ae Jeong, you don't make my heart
race anymore.

4
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:14,710
Why?

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,970
I'm just saying that I don't feel nervous
because of you anymore.

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,110
Why not?

7
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,640
There's only one answer to all of this.

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,620
What do you think it might be?

9
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,040
Then...

10
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,310
You don't like me anymore?

11
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,020
Ding-dong!

12
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,460
It was a side effect that appeared
10 years after the surgery.

13
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,980
Even though I was so embarrassed during that
time I couldn't bear to show my face at all.

14
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:00,760
Iâ€™ve recovered!

15
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,950
But I'm all recovered now.

16
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,510
It really doesn't mean anything to you?

17
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,660
That's right.

18
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:11,390
When this right here realized it was
because of the "Heartbeat" song,

19
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,660
I woke up from the hypnosis.
Isn't that great?

20
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,170
I have to hear for myself if this is
really the truth.

21
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,350
Huh?!

22
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,300
What are you doing?

23
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,950
Stay still for a second.

24
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,100
It's racing!
It's going thump thump, right now!

25
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:29,070
If it doesn't beat, I'll die.

26
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,660
Thump thump, thumpity thump.

27
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,260
That's how it normally beats for anyone.

28
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,690
It's not supposed to go whoosh whoosh
or zoom zoom.

29
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,630
It sounds like it's zoom zooming a little.

30
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,430
That's why you should be careful
about how you rub yourself on people.

31
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,040
No matter how regular my heartbeat may be,

32
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,310
if you come at me and rub like this, then...

33
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,260
What's this about, Gu Ae Jeong?

34
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:55,120
Are you feeling disappointed, by any chance?

35
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:03,020
That my heart isn't going zoom zoom
but just thump thumping?

36
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,010
You are disappointed, aren't you? Huh?

37
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,540
Ah, ah, that stings!

38
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,300
What is it now?

39
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,320
I came because I was worried about
your sickly azalea.

40
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,290
It's a relief that you're fine.

41
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:20,040
Your hands sting like crazy.

42
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,460
But...

43
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:25,790
The song you heard when you were
receiving heart surgery 10 years ago

44
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,900
and your body reacting to it now...

45
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,960
Medically, does that even make sense?

46
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,310
Isn't it a little strange?

47
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,940
It's not strange, it's unfair.

48
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,670
I was tricked by this punk into thinking
I liked you so I shaved off my mustache

49
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,250
and lost all of my cheek fat.
I find it totally unfair.

50
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,400
I'm sorry for making you feel wronged.

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,530
But then, it does make more sense than
you saying I put a spell on you.

52
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,230
Now this is something I've never
seen before...

53
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,790
Hearing a song that was playing during
one's heart surgery

54
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,350
makes that person's heart react to it?

55
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,080
Ha, my goodness.

56
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,420
Even so...

57
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:18,590
If his heart was fine for the past 10 years,
why would it react now to this song?

58
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,540
I know, right?

59
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:28,310
This song was originally used to revive
his dying heart.

60
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:35,320
It can't be that this song has somehow
become vital to that same heart, can it?

61
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:40,170
I think I'm going to have to look over
Dok Go Jin's test results one more time.

62
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,390
Bring them to me.

63
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,070
You see...

64
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,480
There's something kind of strange going on.

65
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:51,960
Since you're a doctor, could you tell me
if you think this makes sense?

66
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:52,940
Sure.

67
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,740
Can the heart...

68
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,990
Umm... does the heart...

69
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,880
Well, you know how the heart normally
thump thumps.

70
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,910
But when that happens,
when you're looking at someone,

71
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:07,490
could you mistakenly believe you like them?

72
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:11,320
So are you asking if the thump thumping
of a heart can mistakenly

73
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:13,030
lead a person to think they're in love
with someone?

74
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,490
It's strange, isn't it?

75
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,840
You can't get confused about something
like that, can you?

76
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,030
I guess you could.

77
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:23,200
When a person sees another,
after the heart rate has increased,

78
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,650
as a result of riding a roller coaster,

79
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:30,100
I've seen research results of a sudden rush
of feelings that occurred for the person.

80
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,260
Then you can be mistaken about love too?

81
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:37,960
When that situation is experienced
repeatedly, then I guess it is possible.

82
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:46,100
Because of that person,
my heart is going thump, thump

83
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,540
[Oppa]

84
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:50,160
I love that person

85
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:56,130
Your "Heartbeat" song is what made me waver.

86
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:10,150
So if the stimulus is continuously repeated,
it's possible for a connection to form.

87
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,650
Now I feel wronged.

88
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,450
We're just going to go with the CF.

89
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,750
I won't be wronged anymore from here on out.

90
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,860
That's right. This was all just
a misunderstanding, wasn't it?

91
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,130
What was?

92
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,550
I was thinking that Ae Jeong unni

93
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,680
discovered a weakness of yours and
was using it to blackmail you.

94
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,390
It's gone now!

95
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:42,380
I was shocked when I momentarily thought
that I was a person, who had weaknesses

96
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,420
but that wasn't the case after all.

97
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:48,560
Then it's definitely not true that
Dok Go Jin likes Gu Ae Jeong, right?

98
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,450
Who was it?

99
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,420
Who was the person who spread around
such rumors?

100
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,600
I'm going to press charges. Was it you?!

101
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:05,000
I let go of my head and wasn't able
to control my surroundings enough.

102
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,070
I have to resolve all this before
the rumors begin.

103
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,910
I feel bad for Dok Go hyungnim.

104
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,630
He was kicked to the curb by Ae Jeong noona!

105
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,700
Don't be so loose-lipped.

106
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,730
If this gets around, it'll result in
a lawsuit.

107
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:24,330
- Of course, President Moon is on my side.
- With Dok Go hyungnim's personality

108
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,850
that's definitely what'll happen, right?

109
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:30,870
But of course, I'm feeling
a little satisfied.

110
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,450
You are too, President?

111
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,660
All the times I bent over backwards to
accommodate his dictator-like personality.

112
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:39,100
And the pent up anger I have now...
Why wouldn't I be?

113
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,470
I feel the same way!

114
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,860
Our Dok Go has believed until now that
he's superior to everyone else.

115
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,760
But the fact that he was dumped
by a woman...

116
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,400
Gu Ae Jeong...

117
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,180
I commend you.

118
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,300
Dok Go hyungnim doesn't know this

119
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:57,400
but Ae Jeong noona's family members
don't really like him either.

120
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,720
How pitiful our Dok Go has become.

121
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,380
It's a good thing though.

122
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,240
Does it taste good?

123
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,400
Yes.

124
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:12,510
That's good. Now why don't you explain to me
exactly what's going on at your house?

125
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,330
What have they been yapping about me,
for instance?

126
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,590
Hey, Ding-Dong.

127
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:22,050
At the age of 7, you can run your mouth

128
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,190
and say whatever you want without
worrying about other people.

129
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,760
So, go ahead and tell me, okay?

130
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:26,570
It's fine.

131
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:30,480
- Dok Go Jin is a butthole...
- That's enough, I got it.

132
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:37,740
Ahjussi, do you want to stick to
my aunt's side like this?

133
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,810
That's what I thought but I don't anymore.

134
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:45,920
I thought that something impossibly strong
was pulling me towards your aunt

135
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,710
but that's disappeared now.

136
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,770
It no longer pulls at me.

137
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,680
See, see? It's not sticking.
It's not sticking!

138
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,230
It's not sticking.

139
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,940
It's stuck.

140
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,970
I won't be pulled in by her any longer.

141
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,850
Wow...

142
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:15,990
Why are you watching TV here,
Hyung Gyu? Let's go!

143
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,800
I don't want to, I want to watch some more.

144
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,090
Gu Hyung Gyu, do you want to get
in trouble? Let's go.

145
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,750
Just leave him be.

146
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,650
There's a 3-D program beckoning to him
right now.

147
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,570
Do you really think his feet
will follow you willingly?

148
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,770
Why don't you come over here
and talk with me for a second.

149
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,230
Come on, let's go.

150
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,500
Look here.

151
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:45,700
The rumors going around are saying
that I've been chasing after you

152
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,220
and you've been running away because
you don't want me.

153
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,150
That's what people are saying. Up until now.

154
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,640
But all that is correct.

155
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:54,170
It's so humiliating I can't take it anymore.

156
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,730
My situation has been reversed.

157
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,470
I'm going to go in this direction.

158
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,850
Oh my... And now...

159
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,850
Gu Ae Jeong is latching onto me.

160
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,070
Oh my, it must be crazy!
Why is it latching on like that?

161
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,680
Gu Ae Jeong.

162
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,770
Do you feel pulled in by me right now?

163
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,760
You are feeling pulled in, aren't you?

164
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,870
Who do you think you're talking about?
It's only the magnets that are.

165
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,730
Just like this magnet, now that I'm turning
my back and saying I want to go on my way,

166
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,790
you're compelled to follow, aren't you?

167
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,270
Don't generalize our situation
like the magnets.

168
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:41,610
Then do you want to try putting
this on again to confirm?

169
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,280
Why should I?

170
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,530
I'm curious now, so I'd like for you to
try it on so we could know for sure.

171
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,200
Here, here, here. Yes?

172
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,300
I don't want to!

173
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:52,130
Oh, since you're saying
you can't put it on...

174
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:55,390
You're attracted to me, aren't you?

175
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,720
You're attracted, you're attracted!
Gu Ae Jeong, you're attracted!

176
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,400
You're attracted, you're attracted!
You're attracted!

177
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,770
- You're attracted!
- Hyung Gyu, let's go!

178
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:04,480
You're attracted, you're attracted!
Gu Ae Jeong is attracted to me! See?

179
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,400
Hyung Gyu, let's go!

180
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,640
You're attracted, you're attracted.
Gu Ae Jeong, you're attracted.

181
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:15,190
I feel so bad I don't know what to do
since I've decided to go my way.

182
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,910
Hyung Gyu, hurry up. Let's go.

183
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,660
It's almost over though.

184
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,520
Hey, Ding Dong, why don't you watch
till the end?

185
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:23,060
You can stay and watch the second
and third ones too if you'd like.

186
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,320
Take care, Gu Ae Jeong.

187
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:31,110
I'm now going to remain in my 60 to 90
range and be at peace.

188
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,640
This humiliating unrequited love
is now yours, Gu Ae Jeong.

189
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,400
- Does it make you that happy?
- Yes.

190
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:38,360
I feel like all the humiliation
I've suffered is finally fading away.

191
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:41,540
Why don't you go ahead and agree
I'm right before you go

192
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,520
so my pride will be revived as well?

193
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,670
You're attracted, you're attracted.
Gu Ae Jeong is attracted to me!

194
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,150
Too bad.

195
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,690
I can't ever admit to it because
I'd rather drown and die in the humiliation.

196
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,210
Hyung Gyu, I'm really going now.

197
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,290
So, get up now. Hurry up.
Get up! Hurry!

198
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,710
Quickly! Get up! Quickly, quickly!

199
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:09,030
Leave the glasses here.
The glasses. That's right.

200
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,710
You're attracted, you're attracted.
Gu Ae Jeong is attracted to me.

201
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,920
She's attracted to Dok Go Jin!

202
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:40,770
Gu Ae Jeong was right next to me
but I'm still at 88.

203
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,310
She's definitely attracted to me.

204
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,370
What should I do? I feel so bad for her...

205
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:50,250
Oh my, I feel so sorry now...

206
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:55,250
Restoration! Recovery! Happiness!

207
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:13,810
Oh my!

208
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,690
Pil Joo.

209
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:36,120
I was wrong to force you when you didn't
want to do the broadcast in the beginning.

210
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,080
Just go to China and study like you wanted.

211
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:41,520
I won't stop you from going any longer.

212
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,670
I'll do as you wanted, just like always.

213
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,290
- I'm not going.
- Is this because of Gu Ae Jeong?

214
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,480
I won't ever accept her!

215
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,340
Since you're sincerely trying to stop me,

216
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,780
I guess you've realized that my feelings
for her are sincere as well.

217
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:00,040
I've been so embarrassed ever since
that report about you and Gu Ae Jeong

218
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,530
that I can't even show my face
in public anymore!

219
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,250
I can't even play golf!

220
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,390
If you keep this up, I'm going to end up
an outcast!

221
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,050
Then I'll keep you company.

222
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,000
If the information on
the patient chart is correct,

223
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,400
Gu Ae Jeong's house is somewhere
around here.

224
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:29,620
It says that the girlfriend of a yakuza
is supposed to live in a palace.

225
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:36,190
I need to storm in there and find
some evidence to dissuade my Pil Joo.

226
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,060
You've arrived at your destination.

227
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,210
Huh? What is this?

228
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,550
What is this?

229
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,910
Where exactly is the palace?

230
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,820
Oh my, you scared me!

231
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:59,350
But... what are you doing here?

232
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:05,170
Is... is this Gu Ae Jeong's house?

233
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,800
Yes.

234
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,940
Her family members are the ones
who live here while Gu Ae Jeong

235
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:15,330
lives somewhere else with another
person, right?

236
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:21,340
Ae Jeong has lived here with our three
family members for 7 years now.

237
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:24,080
And also, there's no one else!

238
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,000
This wasn't supposed to happen.

239
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:34,810
It'd be much easier to dissuade him
from a girl with a past.

240
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:37,840
It's going to be even harder if
she's shabby.

241
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:40,400
What? What is she talking about? What?

242
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,400
Sh-shabby? She...

243
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,980
So the way I've been acting until now

244
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:52,170
was all due to a side effect from
my heart surgery.

245
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,950
Do the two of you understand?

246
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,740
So you'd better not make any assumptions.

247
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,040
Wow, things like that do happen.

248
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:03,060
I took Ae Jeong noona's side for nothing.

249
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:07,990
All of the problems that occurred because
of Loser Ddong Go Jin need to be resolved.

250
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,410
The CF contract with Kang Se Ri,
let's do it!

251
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,420
Good! That's a relief.

252
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,220
Thank you for coming back, Dok Go Jin.

253
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,630
And also...

254
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,550
The sneaker donation project.

255
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,720
Tell Gu Ae Jeong to take care of it.

256
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,340
But why? You don't like giving glory
to others.

257
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:27,440
I've been giving her lots of grief,

258
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,750
so I might as well do something
to make up for it.

259
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:33,890
It'll also improve her negative image
with the public.

260
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,490
Okay, we'll do that.

261
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,970
Oh, but as long as she's with Yoon Pil Joo,

262
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,990
her negative image will automatically
improve.

263
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,820
So you don't have to worry about that,
Dok Go.

264
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:43,850
Okay.

265
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,540
The doctor should accompany her.

266
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:57,670
I won't need the van for the time being,
so tell him and Gu Ae Jeong to use it.

267
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:03,670
But she and that doctor might use your van
to film themselves on dates...

268
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,480
Good for them then.

269
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:07,720
We have to rid ourselves of our
cheap reputation.

270
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:13,460
If they need it, tell them to ride
in it together.

271
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:24,960
Our Ae Jeong will do her best
with Yoon Pil Joo on Real Love Corner.

272
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,080
Do well! Gu Ae Jeong has jackpot potential.

273
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:33,330
You can't tell Yoon Pil Joo yet that
you've agreed to this, alright?

274
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:36,140
Because then the realistic shock
will be diminished.

275
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:37,990
Y- yes.

276
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:42,450
Oh my... Manager Gu!

277
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,450
Are you crying?!

278
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:53,110
This is the first time in ten years
that our Ae Jeong has been sought out.

279
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:58,320
Throughout the past decade,
everyone would curse her every move.

280
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,980
And I couldn't do anything to help her
because I'm such a fool.

281
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,800
To me...

282
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,810
This program is important to me
as her manager...

283
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,920
But as her brother, our Ae Jeong really...

284
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:22,770
Please help us so she can do well.

285
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,990
Oh my...

286
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:27,960
Here, for your tears.

287
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,340
Don't cry, stop crying.

288
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,190
How can a man cry so much? Huh?!

289
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,460
Enough! Enough! Enough!

290
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:45,750
This is the first time I feel this pleased
about being her manager.

291
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:49,710
Ah, it's been so long! It's wonderful
being able to be in a broadcast station.

292
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,070
Should I travel around with
Ae Jeong instead?

293
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,590
So I could keep an eye on Se Ri as well.

294
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,620
Really?

295
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:57,590
Then if we get married,

296
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,840
will our roles change and I get
to run the store?

297
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:05,610
No, Noona!

298
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,870
I'm going to take over Noona's shop.

299
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,840
What's this? Why are you butting in?

300
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,010
Why are you here?

301
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,970
I came because of Dok Go hyungnim's
special, Noona.

302
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:17,790
Ae Jeong will be coming out with a
new album, appearing on variety shows.

303
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,730
If she acts as well, she'll get
the triple crown!

304
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,180
What, you think Ae Jeong is
Lee Seung Gi or something?

305
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:27,810
Oh! It's the real Lee Seung Gi!

306
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,810
Because you're my woman, Noona

307
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:34,040
Because you're my woman

308
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,550
How have you been?

309
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:40,920
Hello!

310
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:43,200
I'm a huge fan of yours, Lee Seung Gi.

311
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,820
- Can I shake your hand?
- Ah, yes.

312
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,000
It's a pleasure.

313
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:47,380
Thank you.

314
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,370
Goodbye.

315
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,570
One second!

316
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:53,400
You're wearing the same scarf as her!

317
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,390
It's the same one as mine.

318
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,410
Yes.

319
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,120
Thank you.

320
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,600
He's so polite and kind!

321
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,380
He looks the same in person
as he does on TV.

322
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,570
I know, right?

323
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,760
He's a top star but he's so nice
and knows how to greet people.

324
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,510
He's the complete opposite of
Dok Go hyungnim.

325
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,840
When I first met Dok Go hyungnim,

326
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:44,750
I thought he was a nice person as well
and I completely fell for his act.

327
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,080
This...

328
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:06,900
Is this something a dog or mackerel
can wear?

329
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:10,050
- It's a limited edition...
- So what? Apparently, anyone can wear it.

330
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,600
I can't wear things like this.

331
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,730
Sunbaenim.

332
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,800
Yes, hello.

333
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,550
- Ah, Seung Gi.
- Yes, Sunbaenim?

334
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,780
The program that you worked so hard
to get MC for, Steel Heart...

335
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:33,620
Get our company's newbie Gu Ae Jeong
to appear on it.

336
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:34,670
Ah, yes.

337
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,950
The guests are chosen by the PD and writer,
so how could I...

338
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,350
Why are you being like this?
We're both pros.

Isn't anything possible when you want it?

You still haven't reached that level yet?

341
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,290
If you put it that way, Sunbaenim...

342
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,090
I'll try and speak with them about it.

343
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,090
But...

344
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:02,450
Is it that important to you that you ask
such a big favor of me?

345
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,770
If you do this for me,

346
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:12,550
I won't lay a finger on your
refrigerator CF.

347
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,160

No matter the fact that you're my sunbae,

350
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:26,770
I'm not someone who you can steal
CF deals so easily from.

351
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:29,650
I've protected my CFs diligently until now.

352
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,550

You can't do that.

- It's Lee Seung Gi!

Yes, thank you. Thank you.

Dok Go Jin said he's over you

No, if you're not careful, he'll be sure

425
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:10,280
I was worried you weren't keeping
your heart rate under control.

426
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,320
It's a relief that's not the case.

I still want you to undergo some tests

428
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,030
since you said that you were experiencing
some pain.

00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,510
No, we don't need to do that.

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,870
It was all due to hypnosis.

431
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,180
Are you sure it was because of hypnosis

432
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,980
that your heart was thumping so rapidly and
endured such strong feelings?

433
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:25,640
Of course I am.

434
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:27,650
Isn't it possible that instead of you liking
her because your heart was thumping,

435
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:30,230
your heart was thumping because
you liked her?

436
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,010
Are you certain which is which?

437
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:12,210
I went to the hospital for nothing,
now I'm getting paranoid.

438
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:16,630
Now! Time for mind control.

439
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:35,000
Thump, thump...

440
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:37,480
What is this?

441
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:39,270
Why am I singing this song?

442
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,250
What?

443
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,370
Why did you do it again, Dok Go Jin?

444
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:59,940
Did you have a sudden change of heart again
and decide you liked me again?

445
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,530
Ding dong or something?

446
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:04,890
You might be saying this because
you're still disappointed but that's not it.

447
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:08,190
Then what is it?

448
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,590
I'm feeling guilty and thankful and
I felt bad for you. That's why.

449
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,390
For what?

450
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,570
I felt guilty about pursing you
so relentlessly,

451
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,970
thankful that you didn't accept me

452
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:20,690
and I felt bad for you that you started
feeling for me when it was too late.

Don't feel burdened because
I'm doing this to compensate.

455
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,590
Really?

456
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:35,190
You're so proper now, Dok Go Jin.

457
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,610
One second.

458
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,090
What is it now?

459
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,310
I'm so disappointed and attracted to you
I can't just leave.

460
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,770
- What?
- You're right, Dok Go Jin.

461
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,470
It's disappointing that the Loser
Ddong Go Jin

462
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,670
who claimed he liked me so much is gone.

463
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:05,610
And when you say that I'm attracted to
the Proper Dok Go Jin you've become...

464
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,600
You're right.

465
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:10,540
Gu Ae Jeong, you said you'd never
admit to it.

466
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:12,450
Why are you suddenly admitting to it now?

467
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,900
Dok Go Jin.

468
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:16,260
Just give me 10 seconds.

469
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:22,230
Let me confirm that you don't pass
the safety zone from 60 to the 90.

470
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:33,840
Are you really feeling disappointed
and attracted to me?

471
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,780
Yes.

472
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:42,530
Since you're standing so close to me,
I want to stick even closer like a magnet.

473
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:01,640
Did you try doing this because
you felt so wronged?

474
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:05,560
You can't even throw yourself
at me properly. Leave.

475
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,700
When you were throwing yourself at me,

476
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,700
did you actually want to be with me?

477
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:20,340
Did you want actually wanted to
stick with me till the end?

478
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:27,610
I guess that heart turned of its own accord
without the need

479
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:32,800
for those complicated, realistic thoughts.

480
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,890
You said it was a transplanted heart, right?

481
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,850
Your heart is so proper.

482
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:05,040
What is this, have you gone insane again?
Why are you racing?

483
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:10,590
I didn't have the time to think
those complicated, realistic thoughts.

484
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,790
Right?

485
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,240
So you're saying Dok Go Jin really turned
his back on her.

486
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,590
That's what he said.

487
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,590
He was in the best mood yesterday and today.

488
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:26,750
If he was going to be so happy
once he had a change of heart, why?

489
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,180
Seriously why did he pursue Ae Jeong
so relentlessly?!

490
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,090
After making it seem weird for her
to go to Yoon Pil Joo?

491
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:36,580
Wasn't Ae Jeong noona's decision
about Yoon Pil Joo certain?

492
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:42,050
Yes, if we want to make them
a couple for sure,

493
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:47,120
I should start by setting the mood
for them first!

494
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,390
Yes, I'll be sure to stop by your place
for dinner, Jenny.

495
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,040
Yes.

496
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:58,450
I guess it does help when the people
around you step in.

497
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:03,920
It'll be hard to try and carry
the conversation during dinner again.

498
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,130
Calm down.

499
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,870
Because you got nervous, you almost became
a troublemaker again.

500
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,460

00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,650
Kang Se Ri?

503
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:52,970
Ah... you were my next appointment.

504
00:32:57,190 --> 00:33:00,840
Don't I seem too thin and exhausted?

505
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:02,670
You do.

506
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,240
I almost overdosed on the medicine
you prescribed last time.

507
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,950
My insides felt like they were going
to explode

508
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,850
but it was great at emptying them out.

509
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,800
You shouldn't do that.

510
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:12,200
Let me take a look.

511
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,770
You're lacking energy, aren't you?

512
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:17,490
Are you displaying other symptoms?

513
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,450
No matter how carefully you examine me,

514
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:23,650
you won't figure out why I'm in pain,
Yoon Pil Joo.

515
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,910
I'm not that much of a blockhead.

516
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,640
You know that Ae Jeong unni
has a bad reputation, don't you?

517
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:34,540
If you do the show with her,
you'll only be criticized more.

518
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:35,910
But do you still want to do it?

519
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,310
If I show everyone that I really like her,

520
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:42,530
won't everyone else start to like her
as well?

521
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:45,010
You know that Ae Jeong unni likes
someone else, right?

522
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:50,510
I'm hoping that if I like her enough,
something will happen in my favor.

523
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:56,760
It hurts so much to watch someone
you like like someone else.

524
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,380
You don't even have a backup plan.
You really are a blockhead.

525
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,590
That blockhead.

526
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,980
You don't have to worry anymore.

527
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:43,170
Kang Se Ri, can we get your autograph?

528
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,960
I'm a huge fan.

529
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:47,710
For me, too.

530
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:52,310
Please give us your autograph.

531
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,950
Kang Se Ri.

532
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:55,660
Kang Se Ri!

533
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,860
Kang Se Ri, are you all right?

534
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,530
Are you okay?

535
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:04,920
Director!

536
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:11,340
Kang Se Ri, are you okay? Can you stand up?

537
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,500
Please prepare a bed.

538
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,770
Okay.

539
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:27,690
Even though Gu Ae Jeong threw herself
at me, I feel completely fine.

540
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:36,480
Why do I feel so ashamed that
it's behaving so properly?

541
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:48,510
Instead of changing just my heart,
I should return everything to normal.

542
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:01,430
The bribe that I sent to Peter.

543
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:05,130
Grapes... that were made into wine.

544
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:10,820
It started with this so I'll end it
with this.

545
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,740
I think you're a really incredible cook!

546
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:19,910
- Oh, hello!
- Why did you prepare so much?!

547
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,170
Where's Ae Hwan?

548
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,500
Oh, he said he needs to look over
Hyung Gyu's homework.

549
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:27,040
Is today a special day?

550
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:28,570
It's a celebration!

551
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,970
These days, there are only things
to celebrate for you!

552
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,240
It must be your good lucky charm!

553
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:34,450
Lucky charm!

554
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:38,260
He's coming. He should be here soon.

555
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,960
You sure did prepare a lot.

556
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,780
It must be your good luck charm!

557
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:57,160
Was it you...?

558
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:00,470
I am a powerless manager.

559
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:12,070
This is the thing that played a crucial role
in bringing us to this point.

560
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,330
Sent to Peter but sent back.

561
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:17,980
You know... the grapes!
The grapes that were made into wine.

562
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,280
Why did you bring this here?

563
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:23,290
Awkwardness? Gratefulness?

564
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:26,290
Pity? Are you here to compensate
for those things?

565
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:29,550
I forgot to add one thing.

566
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,570
Gu Ae Jeong.

567
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,130
I'm...

568
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,590
*Sorry! (*play-on-words: it sounds as
the word "sound" in Korean)

569
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,820
Can't you hear it?

570
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:42,360
You can hear that sound, right?

571
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:45,590
That sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Can't you hear it?
Sorry, sorry, sorry?

572
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,540
Sorry, sorry!
Sorry, sorry!

573
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:50,200
I can't hear it.

574
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,370
Anyways, there's something like that,
so I brought it.

575
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:57,380
With this, Gu Ae Jeong,
I would like you to recover as well.

576
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:58,300
Recover?

577
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:02,500
This was our beginning so if we drink this,
you will recover.

578
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:03,530
How does that make any sense?

579
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:06,860
Believe me. I recovered because
I firmly believed it.

580
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:08,080
You'll be the same way too.

581
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:09,680
Red sun!

582
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:11,900
I just put a spell on you.

583
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:15,590
If you open up our beginning,

584
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:22,390
everything will also end for you.

585
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,740
Nice! Gu Ae Jeong!

586
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,840
Gu Ae Jeong! Recovery! Recovery!

587
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:37,840
Gu Ae Jeong is fully recovered.

588
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:44,510
One shot...

589
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,880
Gu Ae Jeong, what are you doing?

590
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:51,500
That's $15,000!

591
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:56,320
- Ae Jeong noona!
- Ae Jeong!

592
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,270
I'm all recovered now.

593
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:33,220
Because you idiotically chugged it down,
it wants to come back out.

594
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:36,610
I'm never going to throw this up.

595
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:43,260
I'm going to eat up everything
that happened,

596
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:48,390
digest it all and make it into poop.

597
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:10,490
I seem to have something in my eyes

598
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,680
Are you okay, Ae Jeong noona?

599
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:09,120
Ae Jeong, are you okay? Are you okay?

600
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:10,800
Are you alright? You okay?

601
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:17,920
That's why my tears keep flowing

602
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:14,160
Be careful with her.

603
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,940
Are you alright?

604
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:24,710
I have been hiding a part of my heart

605
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:23,170
Dok Go Jin.

606
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:28,320
Yoon Pil Joo will be coming.
Can you please excuse yourself?

607
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:33,170
A certain person can't even sense it
thus bringing me to tears

608
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:34,080
Yoon Pil Joo is an excellent man
who really cares for Ae Jeong.

609
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:36,710
Even if you cannot hear me

610
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:36,910
He cares for her so much that even when
Ae Jeong lost something special of his,

611
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:39,700
Even if you cannot hear my heart

612
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,690
he worried that she would feel horrible

613
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:44,840
so he bought another one and pretended
to have found it.

614
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:43,490
The love my tears convey

615
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:47,200
Will you finally hear it someday?

616
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:47,780
Something? What's that?

617
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,610
Because you are my man

618
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:49,160
A pen.

619
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:53,560
The pen that you threw away and
retrieved again.

620
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:54,350
Because you are my love

621
00:40:54,550 --> 00:41:01,950
After sending you away and letting go,
you still remain and make me cry

622
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:58,730
That pen... Didn't Gu Ae Jeong buy then
say she found it?

623
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:02,200
That's just a misunderstanding that
you believed by yourself.

624
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:05,360
Because you are my man

625
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:09,640
It's because you are still my man

626
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:16,910
I can't hold back these foolish tears

627
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,280
I thought about what you said earlier.

628
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:21,820
Watching someone you like like someone else...

629
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,840
How much it hurts...

630
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:29,520
Does it hurt a lot to break up with
Dok Go Jin?

631
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:35,070
If you have been so weak from that,

632
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:37,320
you must have been really sincere about it.

633
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:40,070
Yes, I am sincere.

634
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:44,120
I didn't know that it was this much.

635
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:50,110
But when I see him, I like him more.

636
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:54,590
Since I'm in the same situation,
I can't give you a solution

637
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:56,610
But feel better.

638
00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:00,770
You are a person who received love
from a lot of people.

639
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:05,520
But if they knew you were feeling so blue,
they would be upset.

640
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:08,990
Feel better, okay?

641
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:14,730
Then stay a little bit longer.

642
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:19,260
I feel more depressed when I'm alone.

643
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:21,710
Stay a little bit more.

644
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,790
Then I'll stay a little longer.

645
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,670
Do you usually feel depressed?

646
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:39,640
I guess so...

647
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:43,030
For depression, you should drink some tea.

648
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,960
I'll write down what tea will make you
feel better.

649
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,770
Chen Pi tea.

650
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,460
Longan tea.

651
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:01,250
Rose petal tea.

652
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:18,910
Ae Jeong's not in the bathroom.

653
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:19,690
Did she go out?

654
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:22,170
I was watching Dok Go Jin go,
so I didn't see.

655
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:23,830
Where did she go?

656
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:27,170
Since she chugged all that down,
she's probably drunk now!

657
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,960
Hurry and call her.

658
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:46,550
Gu Ae Jeong?

659
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:08,570
Gu Ae Jeong.

660
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,150
Gu Ae Jeong, why are you here?

661
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:22,720
Please pick up.

662
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:24,260
She's not picking up?

663
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:26,180
Where is she?

664
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:27,270
Why is it only you two.

665
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,370
Ae Hwan, did you see Ae Jeong
on your way in?

666
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:31,060
I didn't see her. Why?

667
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:34,620
She chugged down a bottle of wine
then disappeared.

668
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,280
Ae Jeong's drunk?

669
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:40,420
She can't show her drinking habits
to a harsh person.

670
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:45,880
Wasn't Ae Jeong involved in a case involving
intoxication and violence a long time ago?

671
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:50,660
Are you okay?

672
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,450
Are you drunk?

673
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,450
Are you okay? Are you drunk?

674
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,650
What is this?

675
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,840
What is this?

676
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:02,590
Gu Ae Jeong, wake up.

677
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,160
Wake up.

678
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:08,690
When she gets drunk, she repeats
everything someone says.

679
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:12,620
At that time, it was a middle aged woman.

680
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:16,650
And she started talking informally and that
woman caused a scene because she was angry.

681
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:19,170
And Ae Jeong continued to follow her.

682
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:22,530
Then the woman said, "Is this bitch crazy?"

683
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:26,960
and Ae Jeong repeated that.

684
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:33,880
What are you two doing? Hurry and find her!

685
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:37,920
Gu Ae Jeong.

686
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,140
Gu Ae Jeong.

687
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:41,520
Stupid.

688
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:43,200
Stupid.

689
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:50,390
Is your drinking habit repeating everything?

690
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:53,240
Repeating everything.

691
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:56,070
Why didn't you explain about the pen?

692
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,340
Didn't explain.

693
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:01,740
You didn't trust me, did you?

694
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:04,840
Didn't trust you.

695
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:10,970
Then when you said you wouldn't
like me back,

696
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:16,120
were you really going to cancel them?

697
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:18,550
Really going to cancel them.

698
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:24,260
And you brought those potatoes for me?

699
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:27,390
Brought for you.

700
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:34,060
Then you came to feed the fish.

701
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,740
I came.

702
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,450
I'm sorry.

703
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:28,110
Hello.

704
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:29,740
You came!

705
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:33,560
Ae Jeong is a bit drunk and she went out.

706
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:36,420
Ae Hwan and Jae Suk are looking for her.

707
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:38,130
Is she really drunk?

708
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,760
I'll go look for her too.

709
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:52,720
Gu Ae Jeong!

710
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,440
Are you okay?

711
00:47:56,450 --> 00:47:58,190
Are you okay?

712
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:00,670
Can you stand up?

713
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:08,970
How much did you drink?

714
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:20,800
Can you stand up?

715
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:43,090
This faraway thing called love

716
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:43,220
Gu Ae Jeong...

717
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:50,750
If it comes into sight,
it will bring heartache and tears, right?

718
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:49,420
Tomorrow, you will hold my hand
for sure, right?

719
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:53,840
That's why I left you

720
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:57,160
So that I can fall in love with my love

721
00:48:57,470 --> 00:49:04,550
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

722
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:10,410
Don't forget me

723
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:14,490
Even if I only lived for a second

724
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:14,210
It's a promise.

725
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:20,780
I'll be the one and only heart who loves you

726
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:24,640
For that one and only

727
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:29,400
I've concealed sorrowful tears and left

728
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:34,000
So please remember me

729
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:39,740
I should have raised an animal that
could talk.

730
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:46,580
A dog would have gone "woof, woof"
if I asked if Gu Ae Jeong came.

731
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:44,810
Don't forget me

732
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:51,140
Why didn't you guys say a thing?

733
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:57,770
Manager Jang.

734
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:00,310
When National Treasure Girls broke up,

735
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,670
it would have been okay to continue on.

736
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:07,680
But why did we break up as Ae Jeong said,
even when she was the one who hit me?

737
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:12,370
At that time, there was definitely someone
backing Ae Jeong up from somewhere.

738
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:16,480
The company's CEO received money
from that person

739
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:20,280
and immediately decided on a break up.

740
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:24,270
Ae Jeong had a person like that? Who?

741
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:27,550
If I knew that, do you think I would
leave Ae Jeong alone?

742
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:34,590
Do you think Han Mi Na would know
since they were close?

743
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,470
That's my guess.

744
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:40,770
If I find her, I have a lot to ask her.

745
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:48,070
I want to ask her everything too.
But there are a lot of things in the air.

746
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:51,360
I don't know if I should find her or not.

747
00:50:51,370 --> 00:50:53,030
If you find her, let me know.

748
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:57,320
I'll make sure to dig up Gu Ae Jeong's
secrets without troubling you.

749
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:09,650
Gu Ae Jeong, take your medicine.

750
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:11,780
Not right now, Unni.

751
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:17,670
Yoon Pil Joo brought this here,
saying that your insides will hurt.

752
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:20,550
He firmly requested that I heat it up.

753
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:25,130
Yoon Pil Joo is such a great man.

754
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:26,560
Ae Jeong.

755
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:33,320
I want you to live without getting hurt
anymore.

756
00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:38,930
So even though I know what's making you
worry or hesitant,

757
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,160
I'm going to pretend I don't know.

758
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:45,940
I'm going to go. Make sure you take
your medicine!

759
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:57,930
I'm going to die...

760
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,050
It's cold.

761
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:30,330
It's warm.

762
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,610
The weather's so nice.

763
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:51,280
It's hot.

764
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,100
Dok Go Jin... Why is he here again?

765
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:07,620
Do you think he's trying to stop you
from filming?

766
00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:09,960
He's probably here because he felt
uncomfortable

767
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,660
listening to my drunk ramblings.

768
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:15,570
I should set him straight before I go.

769
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:16,980
Ae Hwan, you go first.

770
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:22,340
Ae Jeong, you're definitely going
to come, right?

771
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:25,310
I'm going to believe that you're going
to come.

772
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,180
Gu Ae Jeong, are you okay?

773
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:44,080
Your wine has given me quite the hangover.

774
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,350
Please get rid of it.

775
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:49,040
Then take me to the filming.

776
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:00,880
I'm going to cure my headache and
my insides with hangover soup.

777
00:54:00,890 --> 00:54:03,660
So until I'm done, don't get on my bad side.

778
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:08,000
Now that I think about,

779
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:12,090
I never sat face to face with you
and stayed until the very end.

780
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:15,140
You always made me storm out.

781
00:54:15,170 --> 00:54:18,710
You never let me rest comfortably before.

782
00:54:20,210 --> 00:54:23,540
But that's a good thing.

783
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:27,910
If I didn't storm out and stayed with you
until the end,

784
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,000
we would have come out over there.

785
00:54:32,830 --> 00:54:34,710
Then it would have plummeted.

786
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,960
For you, it wouldn't have mattered
that much, since you're at the bottom.

787
00:54:37,970 --> 00:54:41,970
But for me, who's at the top, it would
have been a completely different story.

788
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:46,040
If you knew that so well, why didn't you
like me without letting me know?

789
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:49,300
I liked you so much that I couldn't do it.

790
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:52,790
- Did you even really like me?
- Yes.

791
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:56,790
You witnessed me plummeting down
to my pathetic one-sided love state.

792
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:59,230
I can say this honestly since it's not
the case anymore

793
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,210
but if I hadn't come to my senses,

794
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:05,200
I really would have hit rock bottom
and my heart would have broken.

795
00:55:06,610 --> 00:55:09,400
Why are you laughing at me?
Are you mocking me?

796
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,790
You turned away from me not because
I was pathetic.

797
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:18,820
You still liked me a lot and it makes me
feel good.

798
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,550
Even if you smile like that,
I'm perfectly fine.

799
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:32,930
You're right.

800
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,880
It's behaving so properly that
I sort of hate it.

801
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:41,090
I'm Dok Go Jin, the master of mind control.

802
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:45,250
What are you doing?

803
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:48,060
I wanted to check how good you were
with mind control.

804
00:55:48,070 --> 00:55:49,560
- Check?
- Yes.

805
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:51,860
I just confirmed that you're perfectly fine.

806
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:54,910
It's here.

807
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:00,780
- Eat deliciously.
- Thank you.

808
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:08,460
I should eat this heartily and become
perfectly fine too.

809
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:12,510
Since my head and my insides hurt a little.

810
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:55,020
- Did you check all the supplies?
- Yes.

811
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:59,850
How about the lights? Go check them. Run.

812
00:56:59,910 --> 00:57:02,060
I just wanted to check on the lighting.

813
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:05,150
You have to be careful.
Keep everything a secret.

814
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:08,230
Okay. Did you check everything else?

815
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,560
We're getting ready for the night filming!

816
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:14,660
Get ready to go on air!

817
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:20,040
Yoon Pil Joo.

818
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:23,580
You believe that Ae Jeong will definitely
come out, right?

819
00:57:24,590 --> 00:57:28,770
- But I don't think she'll come out.
- What?

820
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:30,250
You seem really flustered.

821
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:32,110
Was that a joke?

822
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:36,220
I'm already nervous, so please don't joke
around like that.

823
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:40,150
You were flustered and now,
you're angry, aren't you?

824
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:46,260
Don't forget that feeling and remember it
so that it's easier to explain.

825
00:57:59,670 --> 00:58:03,520
I'll film really well over there.

826
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,900
Thank you dropping me off.

827
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:13,020
The doctor is waiting for you
over there, right?

828
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:14,300
Yes.

829
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:22,220
Dok Go Jin.

830
00:58:23,130 --> 00:58:30,510
Since you were honest with me,
I'll be honest with you before I go.

831
00:58:32,990 --> 00:58:37,710
Truthfully, you made my heart flutter.

832
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:45,990
After meeting you, cherry blossoms bloomed
in my heart...

833
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,220
then camellias bloomed...

834
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:51,740
and azaleas too.

835
00:58:55,220 --> 00:59:00,020
But after flowers blossom, they fall off
at some point.

836
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:07,000
So even though I felt excited and happy,
I was afraid.

837
00:59:07,390 --> 00:59:10,820
I was slowly approaching you one step
at a time.

838
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:16,110
But luckily, the flowers fell off
on their own first.

839
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:30,160
Thank you so much for showing me
beautiful flowers this spring.

840
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:41,520
Something's wrong.

841
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:45,550
My heart is thumping.

842
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:48,670
I'll be going.

843
00:59:49,770 --> 00:59:51,060
Gu Ae Jeong.

844
00:59:55,870 --> 00:59:58,290
It seems like something's wrong.

845
00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:03,310
I have to confirm something for sure.

846
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,710
Because you are my man

847
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:13,550
Because you are my love

848
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:21,150
After sending you away and letting go,
you still remain and make me cry

849
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:24,560
Because you are my man

850
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:28,840
It's because you are still my man

851
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:34,490
I can't hold back these foolish tears

852
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:38,360
It's completely fine.

853
01:00:36,790 --> 01:00:39,660
Why can't you hear?

854
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:41,090
Completely fine?

855
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:43,510
Why can't you see me?

856
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:46,720
Turn around, I'm here

857
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:50,600
What I'm saying is that I love you, you fool

858
01:00:47,030 --> 01:00:48,610

you're nervous but happy

883
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:36,180
at the thought of starting a relationship
with Ae Jeong, right?

884
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:44,210
But, I don't want to stand here
and just watch so I'm going to tell you.

885

That feeling I told you to remember
is how I'm feeling right now.

Because I like you.

887
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:09,830
What's wrong with his expression?

888
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:13,060
Really. Why does he look like that?

889
01:03:13,970 --> 01:03:15,490
It's Gu Ae Jeong!

890
01:03:15,570 --> 01:03:17,020
Keep the camera on her.

891
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:31,390

coming to start a new beginning
with Yoon Pil Joo.

896
01:03:44,830 --> 01:03:48,780
Or is she coming to painfully reject him?

897
01:03:48,790 --> 01:03:51,980

898
01:03:51,990 --> 01:03:55,880

899
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:59,480
Viewers, just wait a little more.

900
01:04:10,510 --> 01:04:14,490
Gu Ae Jeong suddenly stopped walking.

901
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:17,560
Is she wavering in the most
important moment?

902
01:04:17,570 --> 01:04:24,010
Is her swaying for a happy ending
or a beautiful departure?

903
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:35,400
It is a very tense moment.

904
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:57,060

Yoon Pil Joo.

905
01:04:57,540 --> 01:05:00,980

906
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:13,390
Yoon Pil Joo is all ready.

907
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:17,670
Gu Ae Jeong, please let your heart decide.

908
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:37,840
Gu Ae Jeong...

909
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:46,890
This faraway thing called love

910
01:05:47,370 --> 01:05:54,100
If it comes into sight,
it will bring heartache and tears, right?

911
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:57,600
That's why I left you

912
01:05:57,650 --> 01:06:00,960
So that I can fall in love with my love

913
01:06:01,270 --> 01:06:08,350
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

914
01:06:09,910 --> 01:06:14,210
Don't forget me

915
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:16,430
Gu Ae Jeong, it hurts so much.

916
01:06:14,210 --> 01:06:18,290
Even if I only lived for a second

917
01:06:16,850 --> 01:06:18,950
I think I'm going to die.
