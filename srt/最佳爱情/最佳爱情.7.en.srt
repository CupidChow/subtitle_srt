1
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,666
Don't look.

2
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:10,472
You're Dokgo Jin.

3
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:19,778
Don't look.

4
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:33,085
Go.

5
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:37,655
Go. Don't look.

6
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:48,806
CURRY

7
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:02,092
I wonder if she talked about her album
with Dokgo Jin.

8
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:04,455
Why would she do that?

9
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:06,994
Remember that actor she dated
a long time ago?

10
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:09,964
Don't you know that turned into
a rumor about how she used him

11
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,500
to become an actress?

12
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:13,574
That's not going to happen.

13
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,644
Dokgo Jin has feelings for her.

14
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:17,402
That guy had feelings for her, too.

15
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:20,467
Plus, she can't date Dokgo Jin.

16
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,770
He's dating Kang Se-ri.

17
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:24,778
-He's going to break up with her.
-That guy said the same thing.

18
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:27,951
He said he ended things,
but then he stabbed Ae-jeong in the back.

19
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:32,194
He made it seem like Ae-jeong
stole someone else's boyfriend.

20
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:34,288
Maybe I shouldn't have said that
to Dokgo Jin.

21
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:37,024
You should think
before you do anything, okay?

22
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:40,887
And plus, you're rooting
for the wrong guy.

23
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:43,901
Give up Jin, go for Pil-joo.

24
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:46,874
So you went to that clinic
and got all this expensive medicine

25
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:50,067
because you want her to date Pil-joo?

26
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:51,536
Don't eat that.

27
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:53,238
I'm going to return this.

28
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:59,047
I'm okay now.

29
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,846
The truth is, I wasn't hurt.

30
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,676
I was embarrassed about something.

31
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:09,886
In the entertainment industry,
I'm known to be cheap and dirty,

32
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:14,933
and I thought I was fine with it
since I know that I'm not.

33
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:20,795
But today, I felt like I really seemed
like a cheap and dirty person.

34
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:23,101
I feel so ashamed.

35
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:27,535
Didn't you say you're a national treasure

36
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:29,277
that no one can buy,
even with ten billion won?

37
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:33,106
A national treasure is precious,
not dirty.

38
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:38,016
Thank you for saying that.

39
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:42,124
I couldn't do anything when
the first national treasure got ruined,

40
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:47,059
but I promised I'd heal the national
treasure in front of me if she's hurt.

41
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,269
When I was a National Treasure Girl,

42
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,544
I was the second oldest,
so I was the second national treasure.

43
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,368
You were a tower, then.

44
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:04,483
Yes, I was sitting on a tower
of popularity at the time.

45
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:07,908
No, I mean a stone tower.

46
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:11,348
The second national treasure
is the Wongaksa Pagoda.

47
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:14,852
Wasn't it Dongdaemun?

48
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,761
That's the number one treasure.

49
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,131
-Oh, right.
-You should study some more.

50
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:22,897
Then what's the third national treasure?

51
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:25,829
Bukhansan Monument,
commemorating King Jinheung.

52
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:28,939
Then what about
the 128th national treasure?

53
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,870
That's...

54
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:36,508
I don't know.

55
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,590
Curry without potatoes is really horrible.

56
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,760
I just got fooled by a kid's toy.

57
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:24,622
I should've known better.

58
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:29,903
Is it fun to play with my feelings
because you're a top celebrity?

59
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:35,273
PRINT

60
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:00,194
Did you tell Gu Ae-jeong

61
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:03,727
that you'd help her with her album?

62
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:07,096
They talked to you about it, too?

63
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:11,371
I heard Mr. Gu was going around
saying that.

64
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:15,582
Did you two decide on something?

65
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:16,681
No!

66
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:18,807
Really?

67
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:23,384
Your guest is here.

68
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:30,361
Come in, Ms. Gu.

69
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,894
I invited her over for a meal.
It's okay with you, right?

70
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:41,829
There was an article about A and C

71
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:45,135
after that incident at the studio.

72
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,135
I should handle any uncomfortable
situations

73
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:49,707
among our agency family members.

74
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,376
Get your facts straight.

75
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:53,654
C isn't really a family member.

76
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:55,246
She's just a guest.

77
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:57,548
If a guest caused trouble,

78
00:06:57,617 --> 00:07:01,647
the CEO shouldn't resolve it,
they should punish the guest.

79
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,426
Why are you saying such a thing
when she's right in front of you?

80
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:09,258
Ms. Gu isn't the kind of person
who'd get upset about such things.

81
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:10,558
She's really shameless.

82
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:12,203
Isn't that right, Ms. Gu?

83
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,543
Yes. I don't get upset about such things.

84
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,768
I just ignore crap like that.

85
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:24,676
What should we have?

86
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:26,314
Let's have something expensive.

87
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:27,946
The A Course here is okay.

88
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,124
Let's have that.

89
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:32,249
I don't actually want a course.

90
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,122
I'll just have a single menu.

91
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,324
Why are you refusing?

92
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:39,187
You want to get on Ms. Moon's good side

93
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:41,228
by eating something cheap, don't you?

94
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:43,904
Well, you're releasing an album,

95
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,703
so of course you'd want to get
on her good side.

96
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:56,006
The CEO of Coen Entertainment
is in the next room,

97
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:57,935
and he wants to see you for a minute.

98
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,551
I'll just go out for a minute to see him.

99
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,120
I was trying to see if they were dating,

100
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:12,926
but they seem to be on really bad terms.

101
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:16,256
You seem to have come here
to talk about your album with Ms. Moon.

102
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,932
You two can talk. I'm leaving.

103
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:22,336
You can't leave.

104
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:25,539
You need to promote my album,

105
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:27,605
and film the music video, too.

106
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,283
-You should discuss things with us.
-What?

107
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,775
You told me to ask you to do it.
What's the problem?

108
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,050
You're not going to do it since you
didn't get my body that you lust for?

109
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:38,246
What did you say?

110
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:40,317
You kept talking about The Camellias,

111
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:42,416
so I thought it was all pure and innocent.

112
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:45,732
But yesterday, I realized
you wanted to shoot an erotic film.

113
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,331
What? "An erotic film"?

114
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:52,333
Your body isn't even the quality
to be in an erotic film.

115
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:55,425
Your body is the quality
to be in my music video.

116
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:58,673
Who says I'm going to be in it?

117
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:00,708
You can't afford to not be in it.

118
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:03,337
Your mouth is an asshole,

119
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:05,139
so everything that comes out is crap,

120
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:08,608
but my mouth is a bomb, so it's
going to explode if I say anything.

121
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:10,921
-What do you think you're doing?
-What happened last night...

122
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:14,821
Would it be better for me to open
my mouth and write a novel about it,

123
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:19,664
or would it be better to sell my albums
by making you film my music video?

124
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:22,032
I made some calculations,

125
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:25,099
and both options seemed okay.

126
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:27,065
I'll give you a chance to choose.

127
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,800
Which would it be?

128
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:31,502
If you want to get on my good side,

129
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,871
you should choose the expensive choice,
not the cheap one.

130
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,150
He's not the only one
who can look down on me.

131
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,646
I can do the same to him. That jerk.

132
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:58,255
What do you think you're doing?

133
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,995
Are you blackmailing me into helping

134
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:04,337
with your album, or are you protesting
about your hurt feelings?

135
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:08,274
Get something out of this,
or reclaim your pride. Pick one.

136
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:09,681
Don't make me confused.

137
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:11,242
What's there to be confused about?

138
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:14,084
Think however you want.

139
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:16,154
That's the person you are anyway.

140
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:25,023
You treated me like a pathetic person
who tried to use you.

141
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:28,431
So you can be someone pathetic
who gets used by me.

142
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:32,901
Fine.

143
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:36,636
I'll become someone pathetic for you,
so use me properly.

144
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:40,712
Do it in a way so that I won't
get confused again,

145
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:41,813
Gu Ae-jeong.

146
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:51,683
Ms. Moon.

147
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,985
I told Ms. Gu that I'd help her
with the stuff we talked about.

148
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:59,859
Call the best music producers in Korea.

149
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:01,433
When?

150
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,201
Right now.

151
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,626
ALBUM PROPOSAL
SINGLE ALBUM

152
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:07,297
It's a proposal for the production
of your single album.

153
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:14,070
As you can see, they're the best
producers in the nation.

154
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,680
This team is going to work

155
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:18,782
not for Uhm Jung-hwa or Baek Ji-young,
or Lee Hyo-ri,

156
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:21,181
just you, Ms. Gu.

157
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,954
Jin asked for it.

158
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:28,015
If we're making an album

159
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:31,418
with a team like this,
it's going to cost a fortune.

160
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,860
Of course it is.

161
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:35,933
But Jin asked for it.

162
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,158
But even with such a great team,

163
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,530
the artist is Ae-jeong,

164
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,240
so it would be hard to earn
enough profit...

165
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:46,273
It would be.

166
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:49,406
But Jin told me it wouldn't matter.

167
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:53,453
Then, what should I do?

168
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,847
ALBUM CONTRACT

169
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:58,877
It's your contract.

170
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,289
You just have to sign this,

171
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,821
and your album will be made right away,

172
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,860
just as Jin planned.

173
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:17,136
This will show me the real reason
why you came here.

174
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,110
If she signs that contract,

175
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:22,636
I'll consider you all meaningless,

176
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,709
and execute you.

177
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:36,892
Ae-jeong, this is a huge chance for you.

178
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:38,723
Why are you hesitating?

179
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:42,362
I know it's shameless to accept the terms,

180
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,762
but let's just do it this time.

181
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:50,473
Get something out of this,
or reclaim your pride. Pick one.

182
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:53,707
Jin is testing me right now.

183
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:57,043
But still, the conditions
for the test are great.

184
00:12:57,743 --> 00:13:01,183
We got by with just one song,
"Heartbeat", for ten years,

185
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:03,217
but we reached the limit.

186
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,416
If you succeed with just one new song,

187
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:09,391
you can keep doing performances
even if you leave this agency.

188
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:12,788
You can even sing at Misari. Come on.

189
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,689
Just think about it, okay?

190
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:55,401
ARTIST
GU AE-JEONG

191
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:02,538
GU AE-JEONG

192
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:03,738
She signed it?

193
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:06,377
Okay.

194
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:14,150
Now I know for sure why you came here.

195
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:17,417
You were meaningless.

196
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:19,727
I'm going to execute you.

197
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:46,093
Ae-jeong, you really are cruel.

198
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,413
Getting rid of all of these at once

199
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:11,642
could make me go into shock.

200
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,583
Think of this as a prison.

201
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:18,178
I'm executing you later.

202
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:24,185
Ms. Gu.

203
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,388
Are you ashamed about signing that?

204
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:29,601
What?

205
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:32,772
This was a battle of pride
between you and Jin, right?

206
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,736
If you kept your pride
and refused to sign,

207
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:38,202
you would've lost your chance

208
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,610
but you would've gotten Jin's heart.

209
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:46,548
I don't intend to get his heart,

210
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:51,717
and I'm not in the situation
to refuse such an opportunity.

211
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:52,854
You made a good choice.

212
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,015
If you'd refused to sign

213
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:58,764
and kept leading him on
by keeping your pride,

214
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,792
I would have kicked you out.

215
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:04,195
You have a sense of reality.

216
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,030
Keep it going.

217
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:09,573
She's totally like a mother-in-law.

218
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,995
You know, like mothers-in-law in dramas

219
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:14,044
where they give you money,

220
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:15,536
telling you to break up with their sons.

221
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,708
The women in those dramas
don't accept things like this.

222
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:20,651
I just accepted.

223
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:21,853
You did a good job.

224
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:25,554
Plus, Ms. Moon isn't
the only mother-in-law.

225
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,248
The whole nation is his mother-in-law.

226
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:30,289
If I get trampled on by the whole nation,
I'd turn into dust and disappear.

227
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:32,486
Don't worry, that won't happen.

228
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,788
You said he treats you
like some gold digger now, right?

229
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:37,861
-Don't ever meet him again.
-A gold digger?

230
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:40,167
Stop thinking about it.

231
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:43,572
You don't have feelings for him anyway.

232
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:44,842
Right?

233
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,641
Of course. I don't like him.

234
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:49,337
Gold diggers don't like anyone.

235
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:51,378
I have absolutely no feelings for him.

236
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,349
I feel so stuffy.

237
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:57,584
Let's go get some fresh air.

238
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:00,745
It's a lie.

239
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:02,863
You shouldn't lie!

240
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:07,233
This Pororo toy is making me so angry.

241
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,629
I'm going to destroy this.
I'll break it with a hammer.

242
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:12,528
Don't do that to this cute Pororo.

243
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:16,737
If I was a top celebrity too,

244
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:19,142
I'd be an innocent penguin,
not a lame gold digger.

245
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,739
Looking at this thing makes me so annoyed!

246
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:24,444
What's wrong with her today?

247
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:25,676
Ae-jeong!

248
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:31,576
The medicine you gave me last time
helped with the bloating.

249
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:33,247
It's a relief it was helpful.

250
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:35,188
I need to lose weight

251
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:39,324
and look pale and weak
for a personal reason.

252
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:43,356
Would eating two pills
at once be more effective?

253
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:45,459
If you overuse it, you'll get diarrhea.

254
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:50,098
And I don't think you need
to look more skinny.

255
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:54,006
You're already slim and pretty.

256
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:03,324
Do you usually tell people
that they're pretty so casually?

257
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:06,789
You're not just anyone.

258
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:09,716
You're one of
the most beautiful people in Korea.

259
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:15,331
People do say my beauty
is a national treasure.

260
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:17,298
I see. "National treasure."

261
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:23,172
You would've been
the fourth national treasure in the group.

262
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:24,935
Did Ae-jeong say that?

263
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:26,614
I was the fourth popular?

264
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:30,382
No, I meant that you were the youngest,
so the fourth...

265
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,978
Were you the fourth popular as well?

266
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,015
Why are you asking that?

267
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:41,022
I was just wondering if you know
what the fourth national treasure is.

268
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:42,887
The fourth national treasure?

269
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,859
The first is Namdaemun,
and the second is Dongdaemun.

270
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:48,261
And is the third Seodaemun?

271
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:52,803
I'm not sure about the fourth.

272
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,743
I guess your group wasn't interested
in the national treasures.

273
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:02,107
The fourth one is Godal Temple in Yeoju.

274
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:09,548
You must be really interested
in the national treasures.

275
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:13,245
I recently got interested,
so I'm thinking of studying about it.

276
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:18,593
Studying something you're interested in
from a distance

277
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:21,792
is boring, isn't it?

278
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:26,771
I'm going to

279
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:32,343
announce that Jin and I
are officially over.

280
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:37,812
-Really?
-If I look really pale and thin,

281
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:41,906
you'll know that's the reason.

282
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:54,487
Over here, Mr. Kang.

283
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,130
Oh, hello.

284
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:03,574
One, two, three.

285
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:08,074
I only ate three, so I'll return the rest.

286
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,783
And I'll tell her

287
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,178
that my daughter is Ae-jeong.

288
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:17,178
Hello.

289
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:20,016
You asked to meet me so suddenly

290
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:22,885
so I just told you to come here.
Is that okay with you?

291
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:25,955
Yes, well... It's fine.

292
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:29,164
One of my friends opened
this restaurant recently.

293
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:31,334
We have a gathering here today.

294
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:32,756
Oh, really?

295
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:39,268
Would you like to join us?

296
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,238
What? Me?

297
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:42,983
No, I'm okay.

298
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:45,105
Have some,

299
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:49,107
and next time, come with Se-ri
and help promote this place.

300
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,350
The meat...

301
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:57,117
looks really nice.

302
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,829
The meat here is all top quality.

303
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,455
Have some, and ask Se-ri

304
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:05,027
to recommend this place
as a great restaurant.

305
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:09,838
But actually, my daughter is...

306
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,010
She's actually...

307
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,040
Yes?

308
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:25,349
She's actually a huge meat lover.

309
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:31,562
If I come here with Se-ri next time,
she'll really love it.

310
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,130
This is really delicious.

311
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:39,361
Who can go and find it

312
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:45,969
The noodles that can't walk for long

313
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,142
Ae-jeong.

314
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:53,909
We came here to cheer you up
and congratulate you.

315
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:55,612
Why are you still looking so down?

316
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:57,481
I'm just a bit dazed, that's all.

317
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:59,819
Have fun, don't worry about me.

318
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:04,387
Hey, Jenny! Come over here, come on!

319
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:06,634
-Chicken soup
-Chicken soup

320
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:10,227
-Chicken soup
-Chicken soup

321
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:14,925
-Trust his firm legs
-Trust his firm legs

322
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,540
-Trust his rough skin
-Trust his rough skin

323
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:17,671
-Chicken soup
-Chicken soup

324
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:26,783
Why did you drink so much water?

325
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:31,948
You must be feeling down
because of Ae-jeong.

326
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:33,854
Instead of this...

327
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:35,916
Here, drink this.

328
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:54,842
Jae-seok.

329
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:58,337
A manager could be clueless
about some stuff.

330
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:00,647
They could have a big mouth.

331
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,612
It's okay. They're people, after all.

332
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:05,152
But...

333
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,060
I won't let my manager be like that.

334
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:17,401
Okay.

335
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:20,471
I'll go, then.

336
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:28,242
Hey, Jenny.

337
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,335
I'm at Jin's house.
I'll be there right away.

338
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:36,782
Is it okay not to bring anything
when you're celebrating?

339
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:40,487
Okay, I'll buy a cake
and go to the karaoke room.

340
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,523
-All right.
-A karaoke room?

341
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:44,121
Jae-seok.

342
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,960
Are you going to buy a cake

343
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:55,100
and go to a karaoke room to celebrate?

344
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:56,701
Yes.

345
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,768
And the one who's getting congratulated

346
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:01,338
-is Ae-jeong?
-Yes.

347
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:05,407
Well, it's to congratulate her
for releasing her album.

348
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:06,977
Did Ae-jeong hold that party?

349
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:08,245
No.

350
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:11,253
Jenny started it to cheer her up
since she was looking down.

351
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:16,154
I guess she does have a conscience,
since she's looking down.

352
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:20,587
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

353
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:29,204
Ae-jeong, don't sit there like that.
Cheer up a little.

354
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:30,837
I'm not in the mood, Jenny.

355
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:32,872
Hey, just think about the good stuff.

356
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:34,908
Go, Ae-jeong!

357
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,113
Go!

358
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:38,635
Come on, Ae-jeong!

359
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:39,850
Hurry up.

360
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:47,117
Gross, it's gum!

361
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:50,959
Gosh. Hey, there's a fly.

362
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:54,063
It's a fly. Gosh!

363
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,229
A fly?

364
00:24:57,963 --> 00:24:59,633
What's with this fly?

365
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,544
What do I do with this, Jenny?

366
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:06,166
Oh, no.

367
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:14,347
What should I do? Ae-hwan!

368
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:32,159
Get rid of this!

369
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:36,944
Jin!

370
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:40,042
Try to get a perfect score next time!

371
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,724
You seem really excited, Ae-jeong.

372
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,320
What brings you here?

373
00:25:58,189 --> 00:25:59,929
I came to congratulate her.

374
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,029
Congratulations.

375
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:04,158
Good luck to you.

376
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,910
-Since you're here...
-Okay, fine.

377
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:20,881
What are you doing? Sing.

378
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,080
Sing something upbeat.

379
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:35,328
I don't fall behind wherever I am

380
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:37,103
I'm still useful, I haven't died yet

381
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:38,802
My body was ruined because of you

382
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:40,473
Broken dreams, missing heart

383
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:42,702
I can risk myself if it's for you

384
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,437
I will race to where you are

385
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:46,502
But you still say goodbye to me

386
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:47,871
Goodbye

387
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,709
You say you hate me

388
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,544
What is the reason?

389
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:55,010
Your confident expression shows it all
And it saddens me

390
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,850
But even if I say I still like you

391
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:58,415
Even if I ask for a chance

392
00:26:58,483 --> 00:26:59,723
You turn your back on me

393
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:02,254
I hate that cold look you give me

394
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:12,131
What did I do wrong?

395
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:21,074
I'm going to leave you

396
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,839
I really am

397
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:24,544
Let's see how well you'll do

398
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:28,508
I'm really sick of this

399
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,250
It's so unsteady

400
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,115
My tragic love

401
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:45,458
My heart almost broke for real.

402
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:47,925
Jin.

403
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,437
Are you okay?

404
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:57,708
Yes, I'm fine.

405
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:01,346
Anyhow, I'm really grateful.

406
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:07,251
Well, I do deserve your gratitude.

407
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:10,315
Yes. Thank you so much.

408
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:13,594
Hey, Ae-jeong.

409
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:17,234
Let's talk for a minute.

410
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:29,812
Since you signed that contract,

411
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:33,908
I'm going to believe that the potatoes
you brought were for your album.

412
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:35,976
Are you okay with that?

413
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,922
Think however you want.

414
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:45,763
Right. I was harsh to you that day.

415
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:47,487
You were right to get angry.

416
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:52,396
If you tell me now that you came
that day not just for the album,

417
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:55,330
but to make me curry as well,

418
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,900
I'll understand you.

419
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:58,568
There's no need.

420
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:04,675
Are you really going to make me
someone pathetic who gets used?

421
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,283
You're not pathetic.

422
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:08,054
You're someone I'm grateful for.

423
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,350
I just feel grateful.

424
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:21,226
If you're really that grateful,
give me just one minute of your time.

425
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:30,867
What are you doing?

426
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:41,175
If your heart rate doesn't go over
the safety zone of 60 to 90,

427
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:44,521
I'll just be a person you're grateful for.

428
00:30:08,873 --> 00:30:09,973
What?

429
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:13,276
Don't do this.

430
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:16,305
Just let me use you and leave.

431
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,951
If I want to earn a living,

432
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,418
I shouldn't have feelings
for someone like you.

433
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,922
Just leave me alone so I can live

434
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:27,861
in the 60 to 90 safety zone.

435
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:38,074
Okay, I won't look. Give that back.

436
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:45,609
Just take this.

437
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:52,979
-This is...
-Yes.

438
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:55,719
It's that doctor's pen.

439
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:58,115
I found it.

440
00:30:58,489 --> 00:30:59,919
You found this?

441
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:02,831
I found that pen
that got lost in the ball pool.

442
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:05,064
But you even lied to that doctor

443
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:06,799
that you found it to win his favor.

444
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,125
That's why I was angry at you.

445
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,740
You get why I did that, don't you?

446
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:13,637
Why?

447
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:17,379
Are you embarrassed that I found out
that you lied?

448
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:21,009
But I'll still understand,
since I know what your situation is like.

449
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:26,578
It's amazing how someone like you
made a fool of me.

450
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:28,715
Don't go around telling people.

451
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:31,788
Or else I'll sue you.

452
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:38,528
In the cake box...

453
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,096
Never mind.

454
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:00,387
What's this?

455
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:03,715
Isn't this the shoe you lost
in that ball pool?

456
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:04,788
It is.

457
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,230
And...

458
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,029
This is Pil-joo's pen.

459
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,904
But you already found it
and gave it back to him.

460
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:25,539
Hi, Ae-jeong.

461
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:28,407
Did Mr. Yun buy another pen
and give it to her

462
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:30,619
so she wouldn't feel so bad
about losing it?

463
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:33,453
I knew he was the right guy.

464
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,892
He's so considerate.

465
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:40,528
But I think Ae-jeong is feeling really
confused because of his consideration.

466
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:44,356
It's totally over between her and Jin.

467
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:47,129
Look at how he treated her.

468
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:50,968
He totally looked down on her.
He has an awful personality.

469
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:52,865
He might have a bad personality,

470
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:55,507
but he actually gave Ae-jeong
a lot of help.

471
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:59,044
If you think about it,
he was pretty considerate toward her.

472
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:01,380
If he's going to be nice to her,
he should keep being nice.

473
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:03,246
If he's going to be mean,
he should keep being mean.

474
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:07,024
Going back and forth is worse.
He's such a bad boy.

475
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:09,715
Jin has a terrible personality,

476
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:12,021
and Mr. Yun is really considerate.

477
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,130
But women always go for the bad guy

478
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:16,462
instead of the nice guy.
That's the cause of all this.

479
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:17,627
I'm not like that.

480
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:22,166
I like men who are really sweet to me

481
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:25,543
and do everything for me.

482
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:30,507
-Jenny.
-Jenny.

483
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,440
You should just pick one.

484
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,775
I want to have both.

485
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:44,818
-She's a bad girl.
-She's a bad girl.

486
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:54,465
It seemed like you were feeling bad
about losing this pen,

487
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:58,443
so I made you think they found it.
I'm sorry.

488
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:01,514
You did it for me.

489
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:04,112
And you said it was
a precious gift from your father.

490
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:06,279
It's a relief you got the real pen.

491
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:07,984
I really did something useless.

492
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:10,984
I think I just made you
more uncomfortable.

493
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:14,652
I don't feel uncomfortable, I just...

494
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:17,857
feel frustrated.

495
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:21,534
There was a misunderstanding.

496
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:24,897
It keeps bothering me.

497
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:27,666
If I caused a misunderstanding,
it should be cleared up.

498
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,399
I can explain things myself if needed.

499
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:33,838
No, it's fine.
It doesn't need to be cleared up.

500
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:36,236
I don't think it can be.

501
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:41,347
How can I clear that up now?

502
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:43,876
I already accepted the offer

503
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:47,386
and I can't undo it.

504
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:55,034
Since it is a done deal,

505
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:58,627
the only thing I can do
is help him snap out of it.

506
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:22,724
Even after seeing that,
I guess she still won't make excuses

507
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:25,861
or explain what happened.

508
00:35:56,854 --> 00:36:00,564
I don't have any feelings for you.

509
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:03,555
I'm never ever going to like you.

510
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:04,934
You're so evil and selfish,

511
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:08,266
your first love at that age
will never come true.

512
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:17,882
No matter how much I bully, hold,
or try to test her feelings for me,

513
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,410
there's only one answer.

514
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:23,482
I have to admit it. My love...

515
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:29,121
is an embarrassing one-sided love.

516
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:41,871
You're sprouting.

517
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,241
Potato sprouts are poisonous.

518
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,637
I should remove it.

519
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:07,455
Jin, I didn't lie to you.

520
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:13,034
I was about to take back what I said about

521
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:15,068
never ever liking you.

522
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,010
I look great. Perfect.

523
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:07,218
I have to look better than ever
if I don't want to look like

524
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:10,445
the pathetic guy who's suffering
from unrequited love.

525
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:18,263
You didn't forget today's schedule, right?

526
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,070
We're having lunch
with the president of MBS,

527
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,373
and we're going to discuss productions
for a Dokgo Jin special.

528
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:27,405
I'm going to refuse
if it's going to be shorter

529
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:28,842
than the Kim Myung-min special.

530
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:53,856
Whether you're poisonous or not,

531
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:56,732
it sprouted,
so I'll keep taking care of it.

532
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:06,782
I know Challenge, I Can Do It
makes you do all kinds of things,

533
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:09,905
But doing a frog leap race is a bit much.

534
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:13,518
It's better than a flying race as eagles.

535
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:18,561
Ae-jeong, we're releasing
a high-quality album soon.

536
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:20,523
Shouldn't we be more careful

537
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:22,985
about choosing shows to appear in
for your image?

538
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,930
I'm going to discuss that album
over again with Ms. Moon.

539
00:39:25,996 --> 00:39:27,026
What?

540
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:29,368
Are you going to say you won't do it?

541
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:31,803
We need to talk about adjusting
the production costs.

542
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:35,043
I shouldn't just waste away
other people's money.

543
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:36,206
You're right.

544
00:39:36,273 --> 00:39:39,183
It is a bit unrealistic to make an album
like some top singer.

545
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:41,583
Let's live with a sense of reality.

546
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:45,053
I should focus on
this frog leap competition for now.

547
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:48,116
Right. I saw some
positive comments about you

548
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:50,615
posted on the website recently.

549
00:39:51,288 --> 00:39:52,318
Really?

550
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,027
I guess I'm gaining more fans.

551
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:55,932
Of course.

552
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:58,603
They said you can participate
in the personal items auction.

553
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,303
-Really?
-Yes.

554
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:03,625
I said you'll donate these.

555
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:04,741
That's okay, right?

556
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:08,514
You're going to give them these?

557
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:11,312
You said you weren't going to wear
these anymore, didn't you?

558
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:13,142
Should I take these back?

559
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:15,177
No, it's a good idea.

560
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,650
It'll give me some closure.

561
00:40:21,952 --> 00:40:23,422
The documentary special on Dokgo Jin

562
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:26,717
will be made in collaboration
with Japan's NHK.

563
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:30,331
We would like the documentary
to be different

564
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:32,264
from the former celebrity specials.

565
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:33,399
Of course.

566
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:35,804
We're thinking of having it
shown in prime time.

567
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:40,467
It's Dokgo Jin we're talking about.
We should put in our best efforts.

568
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:45,383
-Come on, we're late.
-Ae-hwan, this is so embarrassing.

569
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:46,683
It's fine, it's really funny.

570
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:48,084
-Ae-hwan.
-What is it?

571
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:51,679
It's going to be hard to
go to the bathroom with this on.

572
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:53,979
I should have gone
to the bathroom earlier.

573
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:57,085
Then go before we begin.

574
00:40:57,154 --> 00:41:01,234
And I gave your sneakers
to the Couple Making team.

575
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,632
-You already gave it to them?
-Yes.

576
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:05,803
I'll head to the studio first,
so hurry up, okay?

577
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:06,833
Okay.

578
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:13,872
That's the sneaker Jin found for me.

579
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:18,807
Should I get it back? I can just keep it.

580
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:20,336
There's nothing wrong with keeping it.

581
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:22,081
I should go get them.

582
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,320
The Dokgo Jin special...

583
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:26,523
Oh, my gosh!

584
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:35,357
Oh, this is Gu Ae-jeong,
she's in our agency, too.

585
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,398
Hello.

586
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:40,596
She's really funny.

587
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:43,296
Ms. Gu, good luck!

588
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:46,535
As I was saying...

589
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:44,655
Are you doing a sexy dance
in that frog costume today?

590
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:48,065
No, I'm doing jumps on the field
since I'm a frog.

591
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:51,239
Can you jump with that fat belly?

592
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:54,710
But I'm a human,

593
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:57,372
so I need a handicap
to compete with a frog.

594
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:00,382
It's pretty hot outside.

595
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:02,154
You're going to get exhausted.

596
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:13,385
He's the president of MBS.

597
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:14,857
You should go.

598
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,061
All right, Ae-jeong the frog.

599
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:21,871
Do your best.

600
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:33,142
He should just yell at me.

601
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:34,680
Why is he being so nice?

602
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:37,483
He's going to drive me crazy.

603
00:43:38,582 --> 00:43:40,282
I should just leave those sneakers.

604
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,619
If I have them, I'm going to want
to wear them.

605
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:47,522
And if I'm wearing them,
I'll want to run to him.

606
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:50,729
I shouldn't have any lingering feelings.

607
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:57,967
You wanted to meet me in person.

608
00:43:58,168 --> 00:43:59,798
I guess you got sick of just studying.

609
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,344
I have something I want to ask you.

610
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:04,443
I don't know much about this industry.

611
00:44:04,508 --> 00:44:05,638
What do you want to know?

612
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:09,749
What exactly is the relationship
between you and Dokgo Jin?

613
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:13,184
Officially, we're still dating.

614
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:15,920
You told me last time that
you're going to reveal your breakup.

615
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,620
Are you two over now?

616
00:44:17,888 --> 00:44:21,828
The way celebrities break up
is different from other people's.

617
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:25,663
Normally, when two people break up,

618
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:27,926
it's just their relationship that ends.

619
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,926
But for us,
there are many things at stake.

620
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:33,902
Even if our relationship is over,

621
00:44:33,971 --> 00:44:36,071
we have to be careful not to damage
each other's images,

622
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:40,283
and we have to take care of
all kinds of contracts involved.

623
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,175
All those things have to be taken care of

624
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,450
to say that we're completely over.

625
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:48,846
Then if people find out that
there's someone involved between you,

626
00:44:49,787 --> 00:44:51,787
that person would get severely hurt.

627
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:54,285
That's why we have to be very careful.

628
00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:59,663
But why are you curious about that?

629
00:44:59,897 --> 00:45:02,767
I'm worried about someone getting hurt.

630
00:45:13,577 --> 00:45:14,607
Hello.

631
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:18,052
I saw you when you were
doing that event for Se-ri.

632
00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:20,375
I'm the assistant writer
for Couple Making.

633
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:21,848
Oh, right.

634
00:45:22,953 --> 00:45:25,023
-What is all that?
-Oh, this?

635
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:28,759
We're holding a charity auction
on our website.

636
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:31,359
The guests on our show donated
personal items for the auction.

637
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:33,829
There's a bag Se-ri donated, too.

638
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:34,797
I see.

639
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:37,372
I'll be going, then.

640
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:39,004
-Good luck.
-Okay.

641
00:45:41,605 --> 00:45:44,875
I found that shoe for her,
and she just gave it to them.

642
00:45:45,275 --> 00:45:46,535
Mr. Yun.

643
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:48,050
-Hello.
-Hello.

644
00:45:48,112 --> 00:45:49,712
Are you here to see Mr. Kim?

645
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:51,523
He's in the editing room right now.

646
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:04,226
-This is Ae-jeong's.
-Yes.

647
00:46:23,046 --> 00:46:24,106
Give that to me.

648
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:27,379
It's better for me to take that.

649
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:46,595
I'm letting you take that.

650
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:48,270
Be careful with it.

651
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,072
Anyone could try to take it

652
00:46:52,075 --> 00:46:55,245
if you drop it like that.

653
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:03,388
Let me take that for you.

654
00:47:04,855 --> 00:47:08,025
I'm not "anyone," right?

655
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:28,047
PERSONAL ITEMS AUCTION

656
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:31,221
GU AE-JEONG'S SNEAKERS

657
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:33,151
Ae-jeong's sneakers are on the website.

658
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:39,123
"I'm not 'anyone,' right?"

659
00:47:40,724 --> 00:47:44,394
That's what he said,
so he'll probably buy this

660
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:47,431
to show that he's not just "anyone."

661
00:47:47,497 --> 00:47:48,397
PERSONAL ITEMS AUCTION

662
00:47:48,465 --> 00:47:50,095
GU AE-JEONG'S SNEAKERS

663
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:51,537
It's 30,000 won right now.

664
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:55,643
How much do I have to bid to get it?

665
00:47:58,175 --> 00:48:01,175
Where did all those
National Treasure Girls fans go?

666
00:48:01,612 --> 00:48:03,382
Thirty thousand is way too low.

667
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:08,321
All those fans are my anti-fans
or Se-ri's fans now.

668
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:10,092
This won't do.

669
00:48:10,254 --> 00:48:12,164
I should raise it up
to about 100 thousand.

670
00:48:12,322 --> 00:48:14,592
Don't do that. That's more pathetic.

671
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:18,159
Plus, it's better for someone to take that

672
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:20,828
for 30,000 won than for it
to return to me.

673
00:48:22,132 --> 00:48:23,232
Gosh.

674
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,902
Hey, it went up!

675
00:48:28,872 --> 00:48:31,582
It's 500 thousand won!

676
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:32,712
Five hundred thousand?

677
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:35,207
I still had such a dedicated fan?

678
00:48:38,815 --> 00:48:40,115
Would this be enough?

679
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:41,694
HIGHEST BID: 500 THOUSAND WON

680
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:42,852
Five hundred thousand?

681
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:46,191
If it costs 500 thousand won,

682
00:48:46,957 --> 00:48:49,087
that "anyone" could get it right away.

683
00:48:50,193 --> 00:48:52,163
Then they'll just be sneakers
that anyone can get.

684
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:57,199
No.

685
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:00,471
Someone special like me found it for her.

686
00:49:01,004 --> 00:49:03,644
I can't let those be something
just anyone can get easily.

687
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:07,409
I should raise the cost a bit.

688
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:11,852
PLACE BID: 1 MILLION WON

689
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:15,347
HIGHEST BID: 1 MILLION WON

690
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:16,519
One million won?

691
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:18,591
It rose so suddenly.

692
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:20,920
Could it be Ae-jeong's fan?

693
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:25,063
Be careful with it.

694
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:26,732
Anyone could try to take it

695
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:31,635
if you drop it like that.

696
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:35,267
Could it be him?

697
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:45,648
What?

698
00:49:46,249 --> 00:49:47,519
Two million won?

699
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:52,894
What am I doing with this guy?

700
00:49:53,724 --> 00:49:55,634
Forget it. I'm Dokgo Jin.

701
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,956
Getting involved will just
make me more pathetic.

702
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:08,940
You paid two million won for my sneakers?

703
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:12,576
Yes, I'm not just anyone to you, right?

704
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:17,149
No, you are "anyone."

705
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:23,349
Three million won!

706
00:50:24,287 --> 00:50:25,957
All right, then.

707
00:50:26,256 --> 00:50:28,886
Mr. Anyone, try wasting
all your money on this.

708
00:50:31,561 --> 00:50:33,401
I guess he doesn't want me to take it.

709
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:36,225
Then...

710
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:38,340
I should take it.

711
00:50:39,302 --> 00:50:41,572
PLACE BID: 4 MILLION WON

712
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:44,469
Ms. Han! There's something strange
on the website.

713
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:45,481
What is it?

714
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:47,612
-What about this?
-All right.

715
00:50:47,677 --> 00:50:48,747
Let's do it.

716
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:50,152
Until a moment ago,

717
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:52,883
Ae-jeong's sneakers were only
30 thousand won,

718
00:50:53,316 --> 00:50:56,046
but it suddenly went up
to four million won.

719
00:50:58,288 --> 00:50:59,688
Five million...

720
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:02,990
Mr. Kim! Come over here, come on!

721
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:04,433
Come look at this!

722
00:51:06,863 --> 00:51:09,533
Ae-jeong's sneakers
went up to five million won.

723
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:12,338
Six million.

724
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:18,777
Six million won?

725
00:51:21,211 --> 00:51:23,051
All right, then I'll bid seven million.

726
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:24,483
Eight million, then.

727
00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:31,015
Eight million. That's a lot.

728
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:32,218
Then I'll...

729
00:51:33,023 --> 00:51:35,333
attack with nine million won!

730
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:36,859
Nine million?

731
00:51:37,127 --> 00:51:38,797
-Is this for real?
-Isn't time almost over?

732
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:40,462
It's almost time to end.

733
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:41,830
PLACE BID

734
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,800
Dr. Yun, there's an atopy patient.

735
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:47,736
Please wait over there.

736
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:50,211
Please have a seat and wait.

737
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:52,177
PLACE BID: 10 MILLION WON

738
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:54,643
Please be seated for a minute.

739
00:52:03,687 --> 00:52:05,517
DIRECTOR YUN PIL-JOO

740
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,830
Sorry, it's something urgent.
Could I use this?

741
00:52:08,892 --> 00:52:09,832
Sure.

742
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:17,930
Time's up.

743
00:52:18,201 --> 00:52:19,601
SOLD

744
00:52:20,103 --> 00:52:21,573
It's sold.

745
00:52:22,005 --> 00:52:24,465
Ae-jeong's sneakers
got sold for 10 million won?

746
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:27,308
Look at this. Your sneakers
sold for 10 million won.

747
00:52:27,377 --> 00:52:28,647
Wow, you're right.

748
00:52:29,012 --> 00:52:30,212
This is crazy.

749
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,420
Who would buy sneakers for 10 million won?

750
00:52:32,716 --> 00:52:34,676
Ten million?

751
00:52:35,685 --> 00:52:37,445
Maybe something went wrong.

752
00:52:37,787 --> 00:52:39,387
GU AE-JEONG'S SNEAKERS
10 MILLION WON

753
00:52:39,456 --> 00:52:41,216
SOLD

754
00:52:58,175 --> 00:52:59,505
I've won.

755
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:02,950
The special Dokgo Jin won
against Dr. Anyone.

756
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:10,915
Wait a minute. 10 million won?

757
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,489
Why did you just do that?

758
00:53:14,925 --> 00:53:16,955
Please. It's my fault.

759
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:19,398
He took it.

760
00:53:20,797 --> 00:53:21,897
He got it.

761
00:53:22,432 --> 00:53:24,502
GU AE-JEONG'S SNEAKERS
10 MILLION WON

762
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:35,079
Even if I got these sneakers,

763
00:53:36,813 --> 00:53:39,383
I can't give them back to Gu Ae-jeong.

764
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:48,829
Don't you think it's Dokgo Jin.
I think it's him.

765
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:52,832
But there's another person
who was raising the price with that guy.

766
00:53:53,496 --> 00:53:54,626
Who would that be?

767
00:53:55,432 --> 00:53:57,232
It's probably one of her fans.

768
00:53:57,834 --> 00:53:59,904
Or someone could've been
doing that as a joke.

769
00:54:01,037 --> 00:54:02,367
PERSONAL ITEMS AUCTION

770
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:07,384
Who is the one who got
Ae-jeong's sneakers?

771
00:54:07,844 --> 00:54:10,114
It was a man in his mid-20s.

772
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,380
But there's a bigger problem right now.

773
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:15,850
-What?
-I'm the only one who knows this.

774
00:54:16,386 --> 00:54:18,756
The other guy who was raising the bid

775
00:54:19,222 --> 00:54:20,662
was Yun Pil-joo.

776
00:54:20,957 --> 00:54:22,287
Yun Pil-joo?

777
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:24,929
Yes. He used his own ID on the website

778
00:54:24,995 --> 00:54:26,525
to bid in the auction.

779
00:54:26,963 --> 00:54:28,933
He was totally bent on buying
those sneakers.

780
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,269
He raised the price to eight million won.

781
00:54:31,735 --> 00:54:32,835
It must have been a prank.

782
00:54:32,902 --> 00:54:34,772
Is he the type to play pranks like that?

783
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:36,538
He even tells jokes seriously.

784
00:54:38,475 --> 00:54:42,775
So the National Treasure Girl
he was interested in

785
00:54:44,314 --> 00:54:45,854
was Ae-jeong?

786
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:53,321
I got pushed aside by Ae-jeong?

787
00:54:55,158 --> 00:54:56,228
That's ridiculous.

788
00:54:57,427 --> 00:54:58,427
Ms. Kang.

789
00:55:01,264 --> 00:55:02,404
Hello, Mr. Kim.

790
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:06,395
The celebrity personal items auction
you did is quite a hot topic.

791
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:09,710
It's just a few people talking about it
on the website.

792
00:55:09,773 --> 00:55:12,943
But everyone is curious about who paid

793
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:16,383
ten million won to buy
Gu Ae-jeong's sneakers.

794
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,180
Do you know who it is?

795
00:55:18,348 --> 00:55:20,248
It's personal information.

796
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:22,147
We can't reveal that.

797
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:25,957
I don't need details.

798
00:55:26,022 --> 00:55:30,792
Please just tell me if it's a fan of hers
or a fan of the show, things like that.

799
00:55:39,402 --> 00:55:42,542
The truth is, the production crew
doesn't know, either.

800
00:55:42,972 --> 00:55:47,112
Anyone can use any kind of ID
on the internet, you know.

801
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:50,148
Someone could have used ten million won

802
00:55:50,213 --> 00:55:52,383
to make news about Ae-jeong go viral.

803
00:55:52,816 --> 00:55:54,216
She could've done it herself as a joke.

804
00:55:54,284 --> 00:55:55,354
Herself?

805
00:55:56,453 --> 00:55:59,693
Anyway, Ae-jeong really wanted
some attention,

806
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:03,630
and it's great that she's getting
that for a positive incident.

807
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:12,172
It feels like Jin could have done it.

808
00:56:13,737 --> 00:56:15,167
But he hasn't said anything to me.

809
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,240
That's weird.

810
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:23,251
Ae-jeong!

811
00:56:24,848 --> 00:56:28,548
There's a weird article posted online.

812
00:56:28,618 --> 00:56:29,918
-What?
-Well,

813
00:56:29,986 --> 00:56:32,286
about how your sneakers
got sold for ten million won...

814
00:56:32,455 --> 00:56:36,185
The article's saying that you did it
yourself to make yourself a hot topic.

815
00:56:36,259 --> 00:56:38,699
What do you mean? That's ridiculous!

816
00:56:38,762 --> 00:56:41,632
GU AE-JEONG SUSPECTED OF BIDDING
ON HER OWN ITEM

817
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:50,708
You didn't do it, did you?

818
00:56:50,774 --> 00:56:53,684
I didn't. I don't have that much money.

819
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:56,710
If that person who bought the sneakers
doesn't reveal himself,

820
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:59,780
you're going to be in quite a tight spot.

821
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:01,790
We have a shooting tomorrow.

822
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:04,485
It'll get swarmed with reporters.

823
00:57:05,622 --> 00:57:07,192
This is a pain in my neck.

824
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:10,130
I'm sorry. I really am.

825
00:57:10,994 --> 00:57:13,934
Ae-jeong doesn't have the money
to do such a stupid thing.

826
00:57:14,063 --> 00:57:16,973
You used my ID to get it,
so should I go say something?

827
00:57:17,033 --> 00:57:20,203
Saying a manager in the same agency
bought them for ten million won

828
00:57:20,737 --> 00:57:22,467
is the same as admitting
to the suspicions.

829
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:24,610
I guess you're right.

830
00:57:25,809 --> 00:57:29,179
There will be tons of reporters at the
Couple Making shooting site tomorrow.

831
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:31,453
If the truth doesn't get revealed,

832
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,881
people will just assume
that the suspicions are true.

833
00:57:39,055 --> 00:57:40,985
Don't worry too much.

834
00:57:41,324 --> 00:57:43,994
The production team knows that
I didn't do the bidding myself.

835
00:57:44,227 --> 00:57:46,127
So there's no reason
I'd get kicked off the show.

836
00:57:46,362 --> 00:57:47,502
She's right.

837
00:57:47,864 --> 00:57:51,674
They're just rumors with no evidence
of you doing it.

838
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:55,165
Rumors are the worst.

839
00:57:55,238 --> 00:57:58,838
Right. You never did such a thing.

840
00:57:58,908 --> 00:58:00,508
Just tell everyone it's not true.

841
00:58:01,044 --> 00:58:03,254
All those stupid rumors

842
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,050
will go away soon.

843
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,320
Auntie, what's a "sponsor"?

844
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:12,516
Hey! I told you not to look
at the computer.

845
00:58:13,256 --> 00:58:17,356
People are saying that she bought
the sneakers using her sponsor's money.

846
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:22,201
Why are they calling you a "slut"?

847
00:58:35,411 --> 00:58:38,251
Hyeong-gyu, don't read stuff
like that on the internet.

848
00:58:38,314 --> 00:58:39,924
I told you that it's all a lie.

849
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:47,391
Dad said your sneakers would be
at Jin's house.

850
00:58:47,757 --> 00:58:49,427
Should I go find them?

851
00:58:49,926 --> 00:58:52,756
No. You shouldn't go to him, okay?

852
00:58:53,396 --> 00:58:56,096
And don't tell anyone about this.

853
00:58:57,433 --> 00:58:59,803
And Hyeong-gyu. Like I told you before,

854
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:04,039
don't ever tell your friends
that Gu Ae-jeong is your aunt.

855
00:59:07,644 --> 00:59:11,714
And also, don't use words like "slut."

856
00:59:11,948 --> 00:59:13,648
You shouldn't say that word, okay?

857
01:00:12,709 --> 01:00:13,909
Isn't Ae-jeong saying anything?

858
01:00:13,977 --> 01:00:15,777
She'll give some sort of explanation.

859
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:17,382
Did anyone hear anything?

860
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:19,977
-What would she say?
-Well...

861
01:00:23,686 --> 01:00:24,746
I'm sorry.

862
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:29,794
I'm sorry about this.

863
01:00:34,697 --> 01:00:35,927
I'm sorry.

864
01:00:36,432 --> 01:00:39,142
I'm sorry for all the reporters out there.

865
01:00:40,336 --> 01:00:43,806
You should do something about
the reporters before we start shooting.

866
01:00:43,873 --> 01:00:45,583
DRESSING ROOM

867
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:48,882
All this happened for doing
an online event on our website.

868
01:00:48,945 --> 01:00:51,405
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

869
01:01:00,523 --> 01:01:02,093
I'm sorry, Mr. Jang.

870
01:01:02,558 --> 01:01:03,728
Sorry, Ru-mi.

871
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:13,301
Does this even make sense?

872
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,370
This was a charity event.

873
01:01:15,438 --> 01:01:17,738
She should take responsibility
for causing this.

874
01:01:17,807 --> 01:01:21,377
She didn't really bid on it herself, so
I can't tell her to take responsibility.

875
01:01:21,444 --> 01:01:22,754
In other variety shows,

876
01:01:22,812 --> 01:01:26,322
if someone is in a scandal, they
get kicked out of the show right away.

877
01:01:26,382 --> 01:01:27,452
Why can't we do that?

878
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:30,647
Let's discuss it after we see
how the reporters react today.

879
01:01:34,323 --> 01:01:35,593
Please give us an explanation.

880
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:39,902
-Gu Ae-jeong is coming out!
-She's coming out.

881
01:01:40,163 --> 01:01:42,273
-Tell us what happened.
-Gu Ae-jeong!

882
01:01:42,331 --> 01:01:44,471
What do you have to say
about the suspicions?

883
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:46,804
-Please give us a comment.
-Please tell us something.

884
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:48,339
-What happened?
-Tell us the truth.

885
01:01:49,906 --> 01:01:52,336
-Give us a comment.
-Just one comment.

886
01:01:55,912 --> 01:01:58,382
-What really happened?
-If it's not you, who did it?

887
01:01:58,915 --> 01:01:59,915
I'm sorry.

888
01:02:00,416 --> 01:02:02,516
Ms. Gu, did you really
do the bidding yourself?

889
01:02:02,585 --> 01:02:04,285
Did you really buy your own item

890
01:02:04,353 --> 01:02:06,193
for ten million won?

891
01:02:06,255 --> 01:02:08,685
Ms. Gu, was it really you?

892
01:02:08,758 --> 01:02:10,988
Ms. Gu, did you really bid
on your own item?

893
01:02:11,294 --> 01:02:13,334
Did you pay ten million won
on your own item

894
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:15,356
-to get attention from the public?
-It is you, right?

895
01:02:15,431 --> 01:02:16,531
Why did you do it?

896
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:18,699
-Whose ID did you use?
-Where are the sneakers?

897
01:02:18,768 --> 01:02:20,698
Are you keeping them for yourself?

898
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:22,840
I don't know what's going on.

899
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:25,035
-We'll talk when my manager comes.
-Who do you think it was?

900
01:02:25,341 --> 01:02:26,911
Sorry.

901
01:02:26,976 --> 01:02:29,206
-Please give us a comment!
-Please give us a comment!

902
01:02:33,716 --> 01:02:34,676
It's her shoe!

903
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,591
-It's her shoe.
-Take a photo!

904
01:02:36,652 --> 01:02:38,822
-Her shoe.
-Do you have anything to say?

905
01:02:39,021 --> 01:02:41,121
I don't know anything about what happened.

906
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:42,734
Please give an explanation.

907
01:02:43,292 --> 01:02:44,332
Mr. Yun.

908
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:48,929
If you get involved, you'll just put her
in a tighter spot.

909
01:02:49,966 --> 01:02:52,966
You don't know much about this industry.
Just stay here.

910
01:02:53,169 --> 01:02:54,999
-Tell us something.
-Give us a comment.

911
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:58,605
-I really don't know.
-Tell us about what happened.

912
01:02:58,908 --> 01:03:00,078
Give us an explanation.

913
01:03:00,476 --> 01:03:02,576
Give us a comment.

914
01:03:02,645 --> 01:03:04,245
-Tell us about what happened.
-Say something.

915
01:03:06,749 --> 01:03:07,919
Are you saying it wasn't you?

916
01:03:12,054 --> 01:03:13,124
Come on, tell us.

917
01:03:13,389 --> 01:03:15,259
Give us an explanation.

918
01:03:15,324 --> 01:03:16,534
Please.

919
01:03:17,093 --> 01:03:18,933
-They're here.
-Tell us what happened.

920
01:03:19,362 --> 01:03:21,862
-Please explain.
-It's Dokgo Jin.

921
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:30,210
I have Ae-jeong's sneakers right here.

922
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:34,375
Hey, take a photo.

923
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:04,869
The one who bought Ae-jeong's shoes

924
01:04:05,107 --> 01:04:07,777
is me, Dokgo Jin.

925
01:04:08,945 --> 01:04:10,075
This is surprising.

926
01:04:27,597 --> 01:04:28,927
Take photos!

927
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,740
I can't believe it.

928
01:04:45,281 --> 01:04:46,451
He put on her shoes for her.

929
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:01,159
Aren't you afraid

930
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:03,370
of getting a bad reputation
for being involved with me?

931
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:05,943
Don’t be concerned about
what I do with my business.

932
01:05:06,369 --> 01:05:08,369
Does Ae-jeong have some sort
of leverage on you?

933
01:05:08,838 --> 01:05:11,008
Yes, an extremely big one.

934
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:13,177
Do I really have to eliminate Ae-jeong?

935
01:05:14,277 --> 01:05:16,007
The way to protect Gu Ae-jeong

936
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:18,209
is to help her go through another week.

937
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:20,415
You may think
you were protecting Ae-jeong,

938
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,750
but I think you just made it
harder and more confusing.

939
01:05:22,885 --> 01:05:24,315
I like you.

940
01:05:25,621 --> 01:05:28,721
"When you are disgusted
to see me and leave..."

941
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:32,228
Did he ever listen to this song...

942
01:05:33,129 --> 01:05:35,299
