It smells bad, right?

00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,090
Pretending to hiccup should be easy.

Why so?

175
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,550
Hiccups are caused by
the contraction of the diaphragm.

176
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,460
But I think you're hiccupping
from your throat.

If you continue to force out
that kind of sound,

00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,010
I guess it's obvious.

181
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:12,040
Then what should I do
if I really have hiccups?

182
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:15,300
If you pressed at the accupoint here,

183
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:17,450
it should stop.

184
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,220
Here.

185
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,290
If pressed wrongly, it can kill someone.

186
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:27,520
So someone can die
from hiccupping improperly.

187
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:30,540
No, I didn't mean it that way.

188
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:33,800
It seems you tend to think of matters
in extreme ways.

189
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:36,060
Do I tend to exaggerate things?

190
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:38,540
Well, no matter what you do in the future,

191
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:42,170
I'll be able to come up
with a huge reaction.

192
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,730
- Reaction?
- Yes.

193
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,960
What's most important in TV shows
are the reactions captured during the show.

194
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:50,930
For example, even if you made
a very sarcastic joke...

195
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,610
Like that, making that kind of laughter.

196
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,900
And also, even if you did something
only bordering charming,

197
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:00,390
I'll feel touched and say,
"Oh, how char... ming!"

198
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:05,560
The formal name for this is,
"Reactions used in TV shows."

199
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,860
- Oh, reactions used in TV shows...
- In any case,

200
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,980
thank you for not eliminating me today.

201
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:16,300
In return for not eliminating me,
choose what you want with this 500 won.

202
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,660
Aren't you worth 10 billion won?

203
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,440
Please give me 10 billion won.

204
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,260
What?

205
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:25,900
Exaggerating matters like that
is one of the reactions used on TV, right?

206
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:30,610
I wasn't joking about the 10 billion won.

207
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:36,610
Didn't I tell you that I'm someone who
cannot be bought even with 10 billion won?

208
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,550
Sorry, I shouldn't have joked about it.

209
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,380
That was an example
of pretending to be serious.

210
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,370
If you get the timing right,
it can be really effective.

211
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,890
How annoying.
Get it away!

212
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,230
My flower...

213
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,730
You meanie.

214
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,260
Hyung, you here.

215
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:23,630
Hi, Dok Go Jin.

216
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,700
What is this?

217
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,700
Why are you here?

218
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:32,710
I used this van today.

219
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,550
I'm going to use it so get off.

220
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,420
We were going to get off anyway.
Oppa, let's go.

221
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,630
Wait a moment.

222
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,270
Well, Dok Go Jin...

223
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,390
Our house isn't too far away from here.

224
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,530
Can you drop us off on your way back?

225
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,480
We have a lot of things to carry.

226
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:54,480
Actually, I drank beer
during dinner just now so I can't drive.

227
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,890
Hyungnim!

228
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:02,110
Oppa, let's just take a cab home.
Let's get off.

229
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,940
- We can't get a cab now.
- Quickly!

230
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,280
Forget it, just ride along.

231
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,940
It's okay, we can handle it.

232
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:10,170
I said ride along so just do it!

233
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,590
What's with this?
Why is this car so dirty?

234
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,450
Get the car cleaned right away tomorrow.

235
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,850
Dok Go hyungnim...

236
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,090
I'll have to make a detour
if I take you home first

237
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,550
so I'll drive to Gu Ae Jeong's place first.

238
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,840
No.

239
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,420
Let me get off first
and you guys can make a trip back.

240
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,350
Ae Jeong,

241
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,210
shall we stop by Jenny's place for a drink?

242
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:52,520
Is this Jenny the Jenny noona
from National Treasure Girls?

243
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,020
I'm a fan of her!

244
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,990
Is that so?
Do you want to go with us?

245
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,150
Really?

246
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,400
Can I?

247
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:00,340
Jenny is really good at cooking.

248
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:02,130
She's amazing at it.

249
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,560
I didn't have a proper dinner today
and am starving!

250
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:07,770
Shut up! Keep quiet!

251
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:18,310
Ae Jeong, Yoon Pil Joo stays
in the same area as we do.

252
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,780
Shall we ask him along?

253
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,870
Oppa, it's too late in the night.

254
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,010
I've already made arrangements for him
to eat at Jenny unni's shop next time.

255
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:28,700
Yoon Pil Joo is the doctor
said to be the perfect man, right?

256
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:29,840
He stays near you?

257
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,710
Yeah, both his hospital and his house
are close by.

258
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,060
His relationship with Ae Jeong
will grow close too.

259
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,950
That man is really not bad.

260
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,360
I took a look too.

261
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:42,730
Calling him the perfect man
isn't an exaggeration.

262
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:46,490
He's both handsome and smart.

263
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,410
He's good at sports too.

264
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,590
He can draw well
and can play various musical instruments.

265
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,460
I doubt there's anything he cannot do.

266
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:55,210
He became a doctor at such a young age.

267
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,230
He's even the hospital's director.

268
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,750
He's really perfect.

269
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,330
Ae Jeong, how do you find him?

270
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:06,560
Assuming that it isn't a TV show,
if you were to come across such a man,

271
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,750
wouldn't you be attracted to him?

272
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,490
If I were to pretend
that this isn't a TV show...

273
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,380
How would you find him?

274
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,630
You'll like him, right?

275
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,180
He meets every one of your expectations.

276
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:23,190
In my opinion, Yoon Pil Joo is...

277
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,360
Oh, we're here!

278
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:28,360
Isn't this Dok Go Jin's house?
Am I right?

279
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,920
Am I right?

280
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,930
- Have we taken everything with us?
- Yup.

281
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,910
- Don't leave anything behind.
- Of course.

282
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,460
Hyungnim, the key.

283
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,750
Please go in, Hyungnim.

284
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,490
Are the three of you going together?

285
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,000
Thanks for the ride.

286
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:51,970
Are you going to walk all the way there?

287
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,270
It's near.

288
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,140
We'll get going then.

289
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,180
Thanks.

290
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,470
Sweet dreams, Hyungnim.

291
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,780
Take this.

292
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,620
So how do you find Yoon Pil Joo?

293
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,970
How do you find him?

294
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:07,320
Actually, as I was saying just now...

295
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,550
Dok...

296
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,710
Go.

297
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,970
Tell us!

298
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,740
Just now...

299
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,870
It seems you like him!

300
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,840
- This is great.
- He's awesome.

301
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:31,060
They just won't invite me along.

302
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:33,490
Petty people.

303
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,240
Shut up!

304
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:03,100
Mr. Yoon Pil Joo's last choice
is Gu Ae Jeong.

305
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,660
Why did I bother to bring such a thing back?

306
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,840
It's so dirty.

307
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:34,360
You've really fallen off.

308
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:40,080
But why do you still leave a mark?

309
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,950
Cheers!

310
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,260
That middle school fan who asked me
to autograph a marriage registration form

311
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,660
was you?

312
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,650
I still remember that!

313
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,130
Oh! Really?

314
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,180
I still have that
autographed marriage registration form.

315
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:02,840
You shouldn't pull
that kind of dangerous prank!

316
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:07,640
Can you register a marriage using a
registration form signed ten years back?

317
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,140
Shall we take it to the Registry of Marriage
and give it a try?

318
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:11,860
You shouldn't joke about this!

319
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,520
It will be fun.

320
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:16,770
If they accept it,
shall we just register our marriage?

321
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:21,200
Jenny! Aren't you going too far
with the joke in front of such a young fan?

322
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:23,070
Well, if you get married to a fan

323
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,540
through an autographed marriage
registration form from ten years back,

324
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:29,850
Unni, you'll make the headlines!

325
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,500
If I were to get onto the headlines
under such circumstances,

326
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:35,060
it will be an honor.

327
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:38,930
I haven't felt like this in a long while.

328
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,590
All right, it's my treat today!

329
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:47,700
To be able to try
Jenny noona's cooking today

330
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,530
is a great honor.

331
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,560
Come here often.

332
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:53,390
I'll serve you good food.

333
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:57,830
Seok, it's getting late.

334
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,880
Shouldn't you be going back?

335
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:01,450
Dok Go hyung doesn't have
anything scheduled for tomorrow.

336
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,280
Didn't he ask you to clean the car just now?

337
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:06,010
I can do that in the afternoon.

338
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,810
[Dok Go Jin]

339
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,440
Oh, it's... it's Dok Go Jin.

340
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:20,360
Yes, Hyungnim?

341
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,590
Are you still there?

342
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,080
There's no more water in the refrigerator.

343
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,380
Buy some immediately.

344
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:26,850
Now?

345
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,710
Can I buy it tomorrow?

346
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,660
I'm thirsty.

347
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,720
Drink some juice instead of water.

348
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:34,460
I think there's juice.

349
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:37,800
Since you're nearby,
I think it's better for you to buy it now.

350
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:42,330
Do you want to come all the way from
your home in the middle of the night?

351
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,950
Got it, Hyungnim.

352
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,230
I'll buy it and bring it over now.

353
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,810
Yes...

354
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,450
I'm thirsty.

355
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,220
That was nasty.

356
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,850
He knows I'm having dinner right now.

357
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,250
He just wants to order me around.

358
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,460
Seok, eat this before you go.

359
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,840
You have to eat something.

360
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:06,420
Dok Go hyung's temper is really bad.

361
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:08,840
If he says to go immediately,
I have to go immediately.

362
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:11,680
I'll get going.

363
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:16,830
If you just need to replenish the water
in the refrigerator,

364
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,240
Oppa can do it!

365
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,090
I can't.

366
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,840
Do you think I can leave these two alone?

367
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,710
It's not like you can't eat pizza
ever again.

368
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,990
Seok, just go and return soon.

369
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,400
Yes.

370
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:34,490
No, just carry on eating.

371
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,660
I'll go and come back soon.

372
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,590
Really?

373
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,020
Oh, yeah!

374
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,480
Hey!

375
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:22,190
Dok Go Jin?
Are you here?

376
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,400
Dok Go Jin?

377
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,800
Is he asleep?

378
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:35,180
Dok Go Jin?

379
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,030
The medicinal tonic?

380
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:57,440
If I knew what a great person
Yoon Pil Joo is,

381
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,590
I wouldn't have given this to Dok Go Jin.

382
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,560
It's wasted on him.

383
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:07,330
Dok Go Jin...

384
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,190
Where is it?

385
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,140
Just a bit more...

386
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,850
A bit more...

387
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:38,990
It's Dok Go Jin's world.

388
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:41,590
It's Dok Go Jin's world.

389
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,480
It's Dok Go Jin's world.

390
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,490
What is this?

391
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,040
He has already come by and left?

392
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:58,100
I wanted to ask that dude something.

393
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:13,530
La la la la la la la...

394
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:27,900
Why did I hide?

395
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,000
You pull yourself together too.

396
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:43,240
I really hope that because of Gu Ae Jeong

397
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:48,110
you won't display anything above 100
on your display again in the future.

398
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:48,950
That's right.

399
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,210
The normal heart rate should be
between 60 to 90.

400
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:54,800
Let's maintain that.

401
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,140
My control time...

402
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:18,350
Oh, the iron man's artificial heart
will not race willfully.

403
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,490
It will not. It will not.

404
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,760
Definitely not!

405
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:25,600
Where is it?

406
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:31,640
Because of you my chest,
my heart goes "thump thump"

407
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:39,330
I love only you,
I yell with my whole heart

408
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,290
What?

409
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,080
Stop ringing.

410
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:41,090
Am I hearing things now?

411
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:46,870
I'm dreaming you'll see me with
trembling lips waiting and my eyes closed

412
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:53,830
and that you'll act first to give me a hug

413
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,640
120! 12...

414
00:24:54,300 --> 00:25:01,740
Because of you my chest,
my heart goes "thump thump"

415
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:06,860
I love only you, I yell...

416
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:18,640
The security system is activated.

417
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:00,590
Who is it?!

418
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,060
There are 20 other people in my family.

419
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,380
20 people...

420
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:42,230
Jae Seok, come out.

421
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,750
Jae Seok, come out...

422
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:55,710
Jae Seok, come out.

423
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,680
Jae Seok, come out from the toilet.

424
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:58,990
Jae Seok.

425
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,220
Who is it?

426
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,610
Who is it?

427
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,260
Stay put!

428
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,650
You... you stay there!

429
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,000
What...?

430
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,550
Huh? What is happening?

431
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,250
What should I do?

432
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:35,720
[We'll get into action within 3 minutes.]

433
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:37,600
We'll get into action within 3 minutes.

434
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:40,150
KEEPS.
[Security Specialists - KEEPS]

435
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,870
What is this?

436
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,940
You've been cornered!
See what I'll do to...

437
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:02,090
Gu Ae Jeong?

438
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,340
Hello.

439
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:10,040
What are you doing here?

440
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,740
I said, what are you doing here?!

441
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,890
Answer me!

442
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,610
You're the spokesperson for our company.
How can we be slow in action?

443
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,090
It seems this is the advantage
of taking on the commercial.

444
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,130
You really keep to the promised time.

445
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,930
Are you really all right?

446
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,510
Do you want us
to take a look inside the house?

447
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,950
No, you don't have to.

448
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,470
Thank you for not handing me over.

449
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,540
Gu Ae Jeong sneaked into Dok Go Jin's house.

450
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:53,080
She stole Dok Go Jin's briefs
and was caught while trying to leave.

451
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:56,910
She was arrested by the security company
Dok Go Jin is a spokesperson for.

452
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:01,810
I cannot let this joke
become tomorrow's headlines.

453
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,290
That's why I let you off.

454
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,550
I didn't steal your briefs.

455
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,350
It was because the floor got wet.

456
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,340
Why did you hide yourself then?

457
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:12,340
Because you came down undressed
so I got flustered and decided to hide.

458
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:14,430
Once I did that, I had to keep hiding.

459
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:20,420
Oh... In short, you hid yourself
so you could see me undressed.

460
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:23,420
Did you take photos
with your camera or something?

461
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:26,260
I didn't.
I'm not a stalker.

462
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:28,420
Hand over your cell phone.

463
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:30,570
- Hand it over.
- I didn't.

464
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:34,760
Why do you keep checking
other people's cell phone?

465
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:38,880
I really didn't take any photos.

466
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:50,230
What did you store my number as?

467
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,370
It's not under the 'dd' list.

468
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,470
If it's not Ddong* Go Jin, what did you
store it under this time? (*poop Go Jin)

469
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,530
I changed it.

470
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:59,710
What did you change it to?

471
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:10,910
There's someone called
'lump of bad luck' here.

472
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:25,450
Am I called a lump of bad luck?

473
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,580
Didn't you call me a lump of annoyance?

474
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:29,540
Isn't it the truth that Gu Ae Jeong
is an annoyance?

475
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:31,780
It's also true that Dok Go Jin is bad luck.

476
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:32,610
What?

477
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:35,320
Never mind, I'll erase it.

478
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:39,240
Don't call me again then.

479
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:44,500
Yoon Pil Joo called just now.

480
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:52,340
What are you so happy about?

481
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:54,150
Look at this.

482
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,980
He called at 11:11 pm.
[Caller: Perfect Man Yoon Pil Joo]

483
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:59,120
Having the same number in a row
is good luck.

484
00:31:59,130 --> 00:31:59,930
11:11.

485
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:05,410
I had such a fright at that 11:11 moment
that I nearly had a heart attack.

486
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:07,950
I'm sorry.

487
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,440
You must have been really shocked just now.

488
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:10,650
That's right.

489
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:13,000
Because of you,

490
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:16,880
it hit 120 again!

491
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:18,440
I'm sorry.

492
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,370
Out of curiosity, what is that?

493
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,860
It doesn't look like a watch.

494
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,200
It's a heart rate monitor.

495
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:28,950
Why do you wear it?
Are you suffering from some illness?

496
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:32,860
I am a special person.

497
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:38,310
I wear that in order to exercise
total control over my body and mind.

498
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,210
But it seems it isn't of much use.

499
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:43,300
I don't think you're that good
at controlling yourself.

500
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:45,250
The problem is you!

501
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:48,320
I want to live peacefully with my
heart rate in the safety range of 60 to 90.

502
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:53,860
But every time you come into the picture,
it exceeds the safety range!

503
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,550
Why did you follow me all the way here?

504
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,770
Got it.

505
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,790
I'll get out right away.

506
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,300
I won't cause you anymore trouble.

507
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:07,840
Please keep to the 60 and 90 range
and stay healthy.

508
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:10,060
I'm sorry.

509
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,520
That again?
I can't stand that ringtone the most.

510
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:23,810
Oh, my... Yoon Pil Joo?

511
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:29,610
You called me right?
I didn't manage to answer it just now.

512
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:33,130
Your brother borrowed a pen from me
this morning but didn't return it.

513
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:38,130
It is a gift from someone
so I can't lose it.

514
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,860
Is that so? I'm sorry.

515
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:41,790
I'll keep it safe for you.

516
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,260
It's okay, just return it to me.

517
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:47,130
I'll bring it to your hospital.
It's not too far.

518
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:50,520
I want to get more
of that medicinal tonic too.

519
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:54,160
Medicinal tonic?

520
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:58,510
The tonic seems really concentrated.

521
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:01,350
A lot of good herbs must have been used
to make it, right?

522
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,460
No, I'm not going to sleep yet.

523
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:05,910
I intend to go for a stroll right now.

524
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:10,160
Put down my briefs before you go.

525
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:15,730
Isn't that my briefs that you're holding?

526
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:18,750
Put down that briefs before you go!

527
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,460
My brother is arguing with my nephew.

528
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:23,530
Please wait a moment.

529
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:31,200
Wash my briefs before you go!

530
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:37,150
My ill-fated briefs

Why is he acting up
over such a small matter?

535
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:03,240
To think
that he likes to exert self-control...

536
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:07,510
I shouldn't have come here today.

537
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:19,200
Why wouldn't I just let Gu Ae Jeong leave?

538
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,760
You can be certain of it

Gu Ae Jeong,

544
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,640
I am Dok Go Jin.

545
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:55,670
I am a special person.

546
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,270
Why did someone like you come in?

547
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,290
That's why I won't come in here again.

548
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,450
Let me out.

549
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:10,390
I'm not the kind of easy person to allow you

550
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,580
to come and go as you wish.

551
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:14,650
I'm really sorry for coming and going.

552
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:20,580
So, what is the code for this?

553
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,930
Do you think I'll let you know
the code that protects my safety?

554
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:30,190
I've been protecting it like it's a
metal cage and have lived my life in safety.

555
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,480
I'll do the same in the future.

556
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:33,140
I have to do that.

557
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:37,450
I won't ever let you come and go
as you wish.

558
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,000
The system is now disarmed.

559
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:43,200
It has been disarmed.

560
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:50,980
I just randomly tried a code
and it actually got disarmed.

561
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:56,260
You mentioned that the safety range
is 60 to 90 just now.

562
00:36:56,270 --> 00:37:00,450
So I pressed 6090 and it worked.

563
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:03,490
Who are you exactly?

564
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:06,630
Since I've gotten to know the code,

565
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,220
if you're worried
that I'll come and go as I wish,

566
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:12,160
just change the code immediately.

567
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:15,280
I'm leaving.

568
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:33,090

going by market rates?

Didn't I say that
she came for a visit before?

627

That person said
he is Kang Se Ri's father.

628
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:23,470

eliminate the actress Kim Hee Jin

else's man and had their affair found out?

to do that! Pil Joo has such high standards.

It doesn't suit my image.

706
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:21,040
Your image has been too dark recently,
especially in your Fighter movie.

707
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:26,740
Give this kind of bright image a try too.

708
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:27,860
Your fans would want to see that.

709
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:30,560
The company sponsoring your commercial
seems to like it very much too.

710
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:33,710
[Mr. Tick-Tock's Lady]

711
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,780
To my son?
[To my son]

712
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:37,770
He said that it is a gift from someone.

713
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:41,290
So it's a gift from his parents.

714
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:43,380
Madam, you're out.

715
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:44,110
Yes.

716
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,390
How are you?

717
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,370
How was she?

718
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:48,090
Good.

719
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,980
- Our Han Bi is a good child.
- Mi Na.

720
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:54,340
This week's number one song is...

721
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:56,600
National Treasure Girls, "Du Geun Du Geun*"!
(*Heart Beat)

722
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:05,420
Let's go home, Han Bi.

723
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:07,610
Don't cry, don't cry.

724
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:09,200
Let's go, let's go.

725
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:10,650
Mi Na.

726
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:12,530
She didn't cry and behaved herself.

727
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,260
I think she had fun today.

728
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:15,490
Mi Na.

729
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:24,690
My Han Bi is a good child.

730
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:25,990
She didn't cry at all
while we were waiting for you.

731
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,920
She had her meal and took a nap.

732
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:31,850
Mi Na!

733
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:33,080
Don't do it, Mi Na!

734
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:34,420
- Let go!
- Mi Na.

735
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:35,310
- Let go.
- Don't!

736
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:38,910
- Let go. I said to let go!
- Don't do it!

737
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:42,140
Unni, I just want to quit all of these

738
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:44,950
and forgot it completely.

739
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,250
Help me.

740
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:53,070
Here?

741
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:57,140
Director, Gu Ae Jeong came.

742
00:45:57,150 --> 00:45:58,740
Really?

743
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:03,690
She was sitting here.
Did she go outside?

744
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:05,060
I'll look for her.

745
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:06,690
Okay.

746
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,340
Regarding the singer
for your wedding ceremony...

747
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:11,520
- Yes?
- I'll try to get Gu Ae Jeong to help.

748
00:46:11,530 --> 00:46:12,930
Okay.

749
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:20,540
Gu Ae Jeong.

750
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:23,610
Why are you standing here?

751
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:26,250
I thought it was better for us not to meet.

752
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:29,860
I wanted to pretend I didn't see her.

753
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,080
It's nothing.

754
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:33,730
Please take your leave.

755
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:35,240
Okay.

756
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:37,380
Madam.

757
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:45,100
She left and didn't see you.

758
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:47,790
Is that so?
Thank you.

759
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,680
You must have been shocked.
I'm sorry.

760
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:53,800
- It's just that...
- I'm going crazy.

761
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:56,100
The director is really making me mad.

762
00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:57,100
What happened?

763
00:46:57,110 --> 00:47:00,550
Why is he so oblivious to things?

764
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:04,340
Yeah, the director is really too dense.

765
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:09,060
He's not just dense, he's thickheaded.

766
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,380
He's so good looking,
but why does he lack such sense?

767
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:12,490
You're really thickheaded
to walk in your staff

768
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,340
when they're speaking about their boss
behind his back.

769
00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:15,910
Is that so?

770
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,060
It's better to just pretend you didn't hear.

771
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:20,200
Block your ears.

772
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:21,540
Why did he do that?

773
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:22,380
What?

774
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:28,050
But don't you think it's ridiculous
to get Gu Ae Jeong to sing at my wedding?

775
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:31,200
The director doesn't know much
about such things.

776
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:32,740
She's totally annoying.

777
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:37,060
Does her negative image suit the wedding?

778
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:41,120
If my husband knew that I got Gu Ae Jeong to
sing at the wedding, he'll surely be angry.

779
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:46,280
He always gets irritated when
he sees celebrities involved in scandals.

780
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:47,470
What should I do?

781
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:50,820
Should I just reject him directly?

782
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:54,870
Isn't it ridiculous to get Gu Ae Jeong
to sing at my wedding?

783
00:47:54,880 --> 00:48:00,180
Reject the director indirectly
by saying you've found a friend to sing.

784
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:01,070
Will that work?

785
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,100
Yeah.

786
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:04,990
Let's go, let's go.

787
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:08,710
Oh, dear.

788
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:14,650
You were called thickheaded idiot
because of me.

789
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:19,080
I'll make a move first.

790
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:23,300
Oh, I came to give this to you.

791
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:27,070
I'm all right.

792
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:29,190
It's not the first time I got lambasted.

793
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,880
Besides, it's only right
for the singer at a wedding

794
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:34,300
to be someone
with a bright and likeable image.

795
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:37,350
If someone as annoying and disliked as I
were to sing,

796
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:41,600
it might mess up the wedding
and cause the bride to cry.

797
00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:45,250
Then won't everyone present
become my anti-fan?

798
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:46,930
I don't need those kind of fans.

799
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:48,990
I'll clip the pen here.

800
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:56,560
This is the Shin Jung accupoint.

801
00:48:57,270 --> 00:49:02,020
When this accupoint is pressed,
you cannot speak.

802
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,730
When your heart feels hurt,

803
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:06,470
instead of forcing yourself to smile,

804
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:10,570
it's better to just stay silent
and press this accupoint.

805
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:14,970
The Gu Ae Jeong I've seen
is someone bright and likeable.

806
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:20,680
I don't consider things
like celebrity images.

807
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:26,660
I'm really sorry
for causing you to feel upset.

808
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:39,510
Unni...

809
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:42,540
It's been ten years since our debut, right?

810
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:45,000
I read that Se Ri is holding a fan meeting

811
00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:48,100
to celebrate the tenth anniversary
of her debut.

812
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:53,240
If I had worked at an ordinary company
for about ten years,

813
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:55,600
even if I fought with a colleague
in the earlier years

814
00:49:55,610 --> 00:49:58,090
or dated someone from the office,

815
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:01,040
I don't think I'll continue
to be criticized until now.

816
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:04,810
This is part of a celebrity's job.

817
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:10,820
That's why I quit early
and switched jobs.

818
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:14,090
Ae Jeong,

819
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:15,980
on the day of our tenth anniversary,

820
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:19,710
let's get together and enjoy ourselves.

821
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,430
I have a performance scheduled
outside Seoul.

822
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,300
But wasn't that arranged before you joined
your current management company?

823
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:26,310
Is it okay for you to take it on?

824
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:28,350
That's why I have to settle
my duty quickly.

825
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:31,710
The outdoor shooting for Couple Making
is also nearby.

826
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:35,450
I'll go there earlier
and get it settled quickly.

827
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:42,110
These are the terms and conditions
for the cell phone commercial.

828
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:44,140
Because it plays on your image as a couple,

829
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:47,220
there's a condition that you two can't
break up for the duration of the contract.

830
00:50:47,230 --> 00:50:48,750
The contract is worth 1 billion won a year.

831
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:51,650
If one party causes a scandal
during that duration,

832
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:53,400
that party
will take responsibility for it, right?

833
00:50:53,410 --> 00:50:54,460
Of course.

834
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:57,490
I'll be very busy in the coming year

835
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:00,770
so I won't be able to get together
with other men.

836
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:01,600
What about you?

837
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:04,800
How convenient it is
to formally announce us as lovers.

838
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:07,880
That makes it hard on us
to break that condition.

839
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:09,510
So?

840
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:12,430
I will not break it.

841
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:15,000
I'll continue to live my life peacefully.

842
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:16,730
Well then, we'll sign the contract.

843
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,710
To commemorate the signing of the contract,

844
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:22,700
can you appear as the special guest

845
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:24,920
for my tenth anniversary
fan meeting celebrations?

846
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:29,080
By showing concern for your lover publicly,
you can add points to your image.

847
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:37,440
Let's accept Se Ri's proposal for her
tenth anniversary event.

848
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:43,350
Didn't Kang Se Ri and Gu Ae Jeong debut
together as National Treasure Sisters?

849
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:46,650
Yeah, the National Treasure Girls.

850
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:52,180
Oh, that means it's also been ten years
since Gu Ae Jeong's debut.

851
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:55,080
Although the two of them
made their debut on the exact same day,

852
00:51:55,090 --> 00:52:00,180
their situations are really different now.

853
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:25,140
Seeing how rundown this place is,
it must be Gu Ae Jeong's house.

854
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:38,550
[In-coming call]
Aren't you going to answer?

855
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:40,180
It's Dok Go Jin.

856
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:42,010
He must be calling to pick a fight.

857
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:43,540
Just answer it.

858
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:45,200
If you don't answer it,
he'll pick a fight over that.

859
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:46,920
What should I say if he asks where I am?

860
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:49,020
If he finds out about the performance
outside Seoul,

861
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:50,810
he'll find a reason to drive me away.

862
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:52,480
He'll say something like, "You're out."

863
00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:57,620
- The number you dialed is not available.
- She's not picking up again.

864
00:52:58,790 --> 00:53:01,210
In any case, you're out.

865
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:11,920
Hey, Ding Dong.

866
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:15,050
You recognize me, right?

867
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:18,990
Hello.

868
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,030
Is your aunt inside?

869
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:24,280
She's not home.

870
00:53:29,430 --> 00:53:31,620
Hey, Ding Dong.

871
00:53:31,630 --> 00:53:33,080
How long have you lived here for?

872
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:34,570
I've lived here all my life.

873
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:35,560
How old are you?

874
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:37,070
Seven years old.

875
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:40,220
Seven years...

876
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:49,950
Is this house under long-term lease
or monthly rental?

877
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:54,680
Looking at the state of the house,
it doesn't seem to be under long-term lease.

878
00:53:56,010 --> 00:54:01,990
If it's under monthly rental,

Gu Ae Jeong...

1063
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:43,970
Because you are my love

1064
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:43,840
You look really beautiful today.

1065
01:05:43,850 --> 01:05:47,600
Oh, Dok Go, you look too cute.
Oh, our Dok Go.

1066
01:05:43,970 --> 01:05:51,380
After sending you away and letting go,
you still remain and make me cry.

1067
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:50,240
It was so embarrassing, my eyes, nose
and mouth were going to disappear but...

1068
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:51,110
I succeeded.

1069
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:53,290
Is Dok Go Jin in love with someone?

1070
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:54,970
Because you are my man
(You are my love)

1071
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:56,480
Why would Dok Go Jin do that?

1072
01:05:54,970 --> 01:05:58,900
I cannot give you up at all

1073
01:05:56,490 --> 01:05:59,070
There is only one answer
to all these questions.

1074
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:09,600
I'm begging you not to go
any further away

1075
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:00,380
What do you think it is?

1076
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:02,540
Do you like me?

1077
01:06:02,550 --> 01:06:03,940
Ding Dong.

1078
01:06:03,950 --> 01:06:08,380
I'll do what I'm best at
to make you tremble.
