00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:17,730
Because of you my chest,
my heart goes "thump thump"

4
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:25,820
I love only you,
I yell with my whole heart

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,440
I'm dreaming you'll see me with

6
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,750
trembling lips waiting and my eyes closed

7
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:45,380
And that you'll act first to give me a hug

8
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,300
Let's stop the heart functions now.

9
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:52,410
Yes, the heart functions has been stopped.

10
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,880
Episode 15

11
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,930
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

12
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,540
As Dok Go Jin needs complete bed rest
during this period,

13
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:29,170
he is currently recovering abroad to avoid
the media's attention for the time being.

14
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,500
What is Dok Go Jin's current progress?

15
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:33,880
Why didn't Dok Go Jin show himself during
the period he was preparing for the surgery?

16
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:37,080
Could the reason for going abroad be
to avoid the media

17
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,830
because the surgery wasn't successful?

18
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,780
I'll use this opportunity
to tell all his fans this...

19
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:50,820
Dok Go Jin's heart surgery
was a perfect success.

20
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,810
They say that Dok Go Jin survived it.

21
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,440
I don't have to worry anymore.

22
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,370
Is that really the truth?

23
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,320
How can we believe it
before we see him showing up in person?

24
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,840
- Why can't we believe it?
- Because there are so many rumors.

25
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,970
Some say he is in a comatose state.

26
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:09,740
And others say he's already dead,
but they're hiding this fact from us.

27
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,250
There are even rumors that some
people saw Dok Go Jin's ghost.

28
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,900
If Dok Go Jin's fans
hear you talk like this...

29
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:16,260
You probably are going to be badmouthed,
like Gu Ae Jeong.

30
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,290
Gu Ae Jeong?

31
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:20,300
She caused an incident on a TV program on
the day of Dok Go Jin's surgery, didn't she?

32
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,760
She really knows
how to pick the perfect timing.

33
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,660
No matter how urgent* the situation is,
(*ties in with Dok Go Jin's urgent news)

34
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,000
there are some things
you just can't hold back.

35
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,570
Have you seen the video
they uploaded on the video website?

36
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,520
It's so funny!

37
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,220
Forget it, I'm not interested.

38
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,510
Found it...

39
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,280
It's so hilarious.

40
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,640
We've just received an urgent piece of news.

41
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,870
Actor Dok Go Jin

42
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,670
- collapsed from a heart attack
- Don't you find it really funny?

43
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,770
[Me too!!! It's really urgent!]

44
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,770
and will be undergoing surgery
earlier than scheduled.

45
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,560
All right, we will now continue
with other news.

46
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,530
Gu Ae Jeong will present the next segment
to everyone.

47
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,390
Yes, I heard that you met Shin Min Ah
on Star Date this time.

48
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,110
[What do I do?]

49
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,700
[Hurry!
I must hold it!]

50
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,090
Yes.

51
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,580
Gu Ae Jeong?

52
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,690
I heard you visited
the youth district of Hongdae.

53
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,600
How did you feel meeting Shin Min Ah?

54
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,470
Gu Ae Jeong.
Gu Ae Jeong.

55
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:04,140
[I can't hold it any more.]

56
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,620
I am sorry.

57
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:21,030
[Gu Ae Jeong gets swept away
by the unstoppable typhoon in her stomach]

58
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:24,310
[Gu Ae Jeong gets swept away
by the unstoppable typhoon in her stomach]

59
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,670
You left the seat with such a heavy heart.

60
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,090
This moment of desperation and distress

61
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:34,120
became a comedy because everyone is mistaken
that you left to relieve yourself?

62
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,560
But thanks to that video, what I did
didn't draw unnecessary attention.

63
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:39,610
I thought I'll be fired from the program.

64
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,190
It's thanks to this kind of comedic videos

65
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,190
that they only took away
my individual segment instead.

66
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:48,180
Yeah, congrats for being a comedian.

67
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:53,680
Anyway, when is Dok Go Jin
coming back to Korea?

68
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,320
He'll be pestered by people everywhere
when he comes back

69
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,700
so I guess he'll be staying away
for a bit more.

70
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,370
When he comes back,
what will happen to you two?

71
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,870
When he thought he was going to die,

72
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:05,630
didn't he say
he'll reveal his relationship with you?

73
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:12,260
You don't think he changed his mind
after surviving this, do you?

74
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:16,010
After seeing how this incident stirred up
the entire country, I've realized this...

75
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:19,710
Dok Go Jin is someone with a huge following
and is loved by everyone in the country.

76
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,230
To be loved by such a person

77
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,430
doesn't feel real to me.

78
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,560
So... you've overcome a near-death crisis.

79
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,150
You've overcome it for real.

80
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,760
Are you okay with letting go of it all?

81
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,690
I said I'll let go of him
even if he swishes past me.

82
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,310
I promised him that with my own lips.

83
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,890
But you like Dok Go Jin so much...

84
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,560
Don't you miss your boyfriend
who has survived a brush with death?

85
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,880
I miss him very, very much.

86
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:49,100
But when we meet, I have to ask things like,
"What will you do with me now?"

87
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,250
I don't want to do that.

88
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:53,860
"Now that you've survived the surgery,

89
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:56,160
you're going to jump
into my pile of dog sh**, right?"

90
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,490
How can I bring it up?

91
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,290
Hyungnim, Hyungnim.

92
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,120
Hyungnim, I missed you so much.

93
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,980
How have you been?
You've became more handsome!

94
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,950
Hyungnim, are you really okay now?

95
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,180
My heart is perfect now.

96
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,780
Oh.

97
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,370
Oh.

98
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,150
You came back
without informing Representative Moon.

99
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,500
Is it because of Ae Jeong noonim?

100
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,910
I've got to handle real life problems now.

101
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:33,310
Hyungnim, did you prepare
any of those cheesy surprise events?

102
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,730
When you meet your girlfriend
after a long period apart,

103
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,500
You have to prepare this kind of thing
in order to receive her love in return.

104
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,290
You didn't prepare anything, did you?

105
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,420
Shall I give you some ideas?

106
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,240
Tie a ribbon around your neck like this.

107
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,920
"Dokko is Ae Jeong's present."

108
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,700
Say it while doing this.

109
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:56,140
Jae Seok, take the blue shopping bag
from all the stuff I brought back

110
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,140
and throw it away.

111
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,830
This?
What is this?

112
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,460
That is Jae Seok's present.

113
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,020
Throw it away.

114
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,760
You have no other ideas?

115
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,310
What should I do
about the cocky behavior of my manager

116
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,700
whom I've not seen in a long while?

117
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,850
Jae Seok, when I was sick,

118
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,700
I was really easy on you, wasn't it?

119
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,080
That's not true, Hyungnim.

120
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,740
Lower your eye level.

121
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,320
I've undergone upgrading
and became an even more special Dok Go Jin.

122
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,630
I am not some unimportant present
to offer to the Gu Ae Jeong

123
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:32,370
who didn't even show her face
during the past 2 months.

124
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,780
- Grandpa.
- What?

125
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:43,040
Why hasn't Dok Go Jin ahjussi
been coming over?

126
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,870
That's true.

127
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,190
If he survived,
he would have come running here right away.

128
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,750
Did he die and become a ghost?
There's no news from him at all.

129
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,990
But he promised he'll become stronger...

130
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,890
He has to come and give this to Aunt.

131
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,130
Hyung Gyu,
what are you doing in your aunt's room?

132
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,540
Huh?

133
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,920
Hey...

134
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,560
How can you touch your aunt's stuff?

135
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:35,480
I'm running late
for an appointment with my friend.

136
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,320
Go to Aunt Jenny's house.

137
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,150
What is this pot doing...?

138
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:55,640
Could you be Potato?

139
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,400
That's right...
You're Potato.

140
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,080
I thought you were dead.

141
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,010
You're still alive.

142
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,210
Ae Jeong noona planted it there.

143
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,960
Gu Ae Jeong?

144
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:07,130
Yes, after Hyungnim collapsed,

145
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,630
I didn't come here for several days.

146
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,690
I thought it would have wilted and died.

147
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,150
But Ae Jeong noona, she...

148
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,850
Oh...

149
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:19,670
This looks like it's already dead.

150
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,470
It can't die.

151
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:24,750
Hyungnim has been caring for it very dearly.

152
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:31,410
Don't forget me

153
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:35,490
Even if I only lived for a second

154
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:41,780
I'll be the one and only heart who loves you

155
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:50,980
For that one and only,
I've concealed sorrowful tears and left

156
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:57,250
So please remember me

157
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,280
You are a special potato.

158
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:57,120
You can't wilt and be beaten like this.

159
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,590
Did she?

160
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:04,840
She should have come
to take care of me then.

161
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,770
Why did she only take care of Potato?

162
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:08,450
The hospital was full of reporters.

163
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,370
How could she have come?

164
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,950
She's always worrying
about things that don't matter.

165
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,080
Then why didn't she come

166
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,760
even when I asked her to?

167
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,780
It's because they said
you needed complete bed rest to recuperate.

168
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:22,220
She didn't appear either
when I ended that stage of recuperation.

169
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,400
Ah, that...

170
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:30,050
You should go ask Ae Jeong noonim yourself.

171
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:34,970
When Dok Go Jin returns, there will be
three new advertisements for him to shoot.

172
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,970
So that makes eighteen of them already?

173
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,710
That is two more than the total he had
at the peak of his career.

174
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,420
Isn't he amazing?

175
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,620
I think it's because of the aura he now has
after he miraculously beat death.

176
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,090
It seems so.

177
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:51,750
There's also this famous director,
whose movies are akin to a ticket to Cannes,

178
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,700
who wants to cast him in a movie.

179
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:58,030
Another box-office director
wants to cast him as well.

180
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,490
Which one should we start with first?

181
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:00,870
I'm really unsure.

182
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,550
Well, Dok Go Jin likes to receive awards

183
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,140
so I guess he'll like the Cannes one?

184
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,040
He'll really be able
to swish off and speed ahead,

185
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,780
provided that there's nothing
holding him back.

186
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:17,050
I know why you keep asking me over,

187
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,090
telling me how well Dok Go Jin will do
in the future.

188
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,480
- I understand.
- All right.

189
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,910
You understand quite well.

190
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:28,110
Didn't you tell me before
that

191
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,770
as long as nothing happens to him,
when he swishes off and speeds ahead,

192
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:34,220
you'll be able to clap for him.

193
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,790
Now, what's left for us to do
is to clap for him.

194
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:49,230
Well done, Potato.

195
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:54,660
Thanks to Gu Ae Jeong,
both of us are still alive and well.

196
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,420
I had intended to bear with it
until Gu Ae Jeong comes running to me first.

197
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:01,050
Dang, but I miss her so much.

198
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,290
Hyungnim, please rest well.
I'm leaving.

199
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,200
Jae Seok.

200
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,530
That cheesy surprise ribbon
you mentioned earlier,

201
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:10,830
Those ideas about how to surprise her...

202
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,410
Brief me about them again.

203
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,810
What?

204
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,140
Tie a ribbon around your neck like this.

205
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,230
"Dokko is Ae Jeong's present."

206
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,490
How can I do...?
I have to do it.

207
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,680
Dokko is Ae Jeong's present!

208
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:25,960
Is that right?

209
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,110
Where did this guy go again?

210
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:34,210
Where did Director Yoon go?
Did you see him?

211
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,500
He went to the herbal market.

212
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:38,160
Aigoo,
I told him not to go there personally.

213
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,610
Why has this kid been so disobedient
recently?

214
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,660
Aigoo, really.

215
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,170
The one person my heart loves

216
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:01,950
The one person I miss every single day

217
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:06,500
Because I still long for you even now

218
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,600
Here are the words so difficult to hold back

219
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,000
So much so that my tears are falling

220
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,400
I love you

221
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,490
I'm missing you
(I'm missing you)

222
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:19,460
Even if a day or a year passes

223
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:24,250
That won't change

224
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:29,410
The person I like more by the day
(more by the day)

225
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:33,820
That person is you

226
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,770
I love you

227
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:38,850
If it isn't you with me

228
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:43,910
I'll cry every single day

229
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:48,170
Just by looking at you,
those words hidden in my heart

230
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,530
Hello.

231
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:49,090
I thought you left to study in China.

232
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,410
Those words that overwhelmed my heart

233
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,990
That's right, but there are still
some things holding me back.

234
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:53,610
So much so that my tears are falling

235
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,680
You don't go on TV nowadays?

236
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:57,270
I love you

237
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:58,450
I'm going to be on TV today.

238
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,120
Oh, is that right?
Which program?

239
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:07,290
It's a show hosted by the lady
who was on the same show with you.

240
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:07,370
The one person my heart loves

241
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:10,440
- Gu Ae Jeong?
- Yes, that's right.

242
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:14,810
You are the only such person in this world

243
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,490
It's great that Gu Ae Jeong managed
to get hold of another program to host.

244
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,420
- Is she confirmed for the position?
- Yes.

245
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,610
The producer of "Say it, Do it"
is filming a new program on food tasting

246
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,550
and got Ae Jeong to be the host.

247
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,810
I heard they went in search
of good ingredients

248
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,960
and even hiked all the way
to the summit of Mount Jiri.

249
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:26,550
Mount Jiri's summit?

250
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,630
Aigoo, she really must have had a hard time.

251
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,320
The viewer response was good.

252
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:35,070
Oh, I heard you'll be shooting
a cooking program next month.

253
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,290
Do you have a vacancy for Ae Jeong?

254
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,580
We're still at the planning stage.

255
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,840
Hold on.

256
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,210
I forgot I have another appointment.

257
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:45,090
I have to go now.

258
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,240
Wait a minute.

259
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,070
This kind of show is tiring so only
newcomers are willing to participate, right?

260
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,810
Our Ae Jeong won't mind at all.

261
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,890
That's right, okay...

262
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,070
Oh, Writer Han has a new program
coming up too.

263
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,800
She has to arrange for a lot of
guest appearances so try speaking with her.

264
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,760
I'm late.

265
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,530
Is that true?

266
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,220
Aigoo, what kind of program is it?

267
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:06,270
Ah, nothing is confirmed yet.

268
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,270
Oh, I have to work overnight tonight
for a fright night filming.

269
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,650
I am leaving now.

270
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:11,650
Aigoo, that's great.

271
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,430
I'll bring some supper over
and show you support!

272
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:15,790
Aigoo, you don't have to!

273
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,710
That place is very scary.
Don't come lest you get scared to death.

274
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,070
Writer Han,
you know our Ae Jeong work especially hard.

275
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,400
Of course.

276
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:27,060
- I'm leaving.
- Yes, be safe.

277
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,100
Hello, I am Mat Jang Geum*
from "Searching for Tastes."

278
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,100
(*pun on "Dae Jang Geum" "Mat Jang
Geum" means "The Taster Jang Geum")

279
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,520
Today, we're here in the herbal market

280
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:37,060
to discover the secret to using herbs
in preparing delicious dishes.

281
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:40,160
Cut. The opening is too weak.
Too weak.

282
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:42,070
Yeah, it's too weak.

283
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,100
Since you're wearing Dae Jang Geum's attire,

284
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,510
why don't you try singing "Onara"? (*theme
song of MBC drama on Dae Jang Guem's life)

285
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,870
Shall I?
"Onara Onara..." Shall I do that?

286
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,890
Dance like this as well.

287
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,470
But I can't dance well.
What should I do?

288
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,900
Aren't you one of those singers
who also dance?

289
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:01,600
I saw you dance and sing at the same time
back then.

290
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:04,130
That was more than 10 years ago.

291
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:10,320
Besides, I was mainly an idol singer
so I can't dance well. What should I do?

292
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,680
In that case,
how about I enter with a cartwheel?

293
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,100
I'm really good at doing cartwheels.

294
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:20,860
What do you think about a Jang Geum
who sings "Onara" while doing cartwheel?

295
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,960
Aigoo...
Aigoo, that would be interesting.

296
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,030
Can you do it here?

297
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,420
Of course, I can do it anywhere.

298
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,340
I'll try it out once.

299
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:34,350
That lady is going to do a cartwheel
on the market concrete ground?

300
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,170
I am going to try it now.

301
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:40,170
I don't intend to stretch that high up,
but please hold it slightly further away.

302
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,120
Here it goes.

303
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,480
There!

304
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,440
Aren't I good at cartwheels?

305
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:04,010
The ground seems really...

306
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,010
I scratched myself.
It seems it's going to bleed.

307
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:21,170
Excuse me...
Ajumeoni can I ask you for a favor?

308
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:27,390
Director, so I will sing "Onara" while doing
cartwheel to start the show. Is that okay?

309
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,280
Perfect.

310
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:31,810
Good.
I will do it again then.

311
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:32,620
Aja!

312
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:33,920
Aja!

313
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,420
Thank you.

314
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,570
All right then...

315
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,970
I will clean it up for you
so you won't hurt yourself.

316
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:51,240
It's fine.
Thank you.

317
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:54,720
I am cleaning it because I want our market
to look clean on TV.

318
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,470
Thank you.

319
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,330
Thank you, aigoo.

320
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,580
Thank you.

321
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,580
Let's start.

322
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:09,980
Well then, I'll start the show
by singing "Onara" and cart wheeling in!

323
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:10,790
Aja!

324
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,700
Aja!

325
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:22,470
Dokko is Ae Jeong's present!

326
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:25,320
What am I doing
for that heartless Gu Ae Jeong...?

327
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:32,020
Long time no see, Ding Dong!

328
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:37,080
Did Ding Dong lose his manners
since the last time we met?

329
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,660
Why aren't you greeting me?

330
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,930
What are you doing?

331
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,900
That's great.
You're not a ghost.

332
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,680
Who said I am dead and has become a ghost?

333
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,530
All my friends say so.

334
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,650
Make a list of people who said that.
I am going to sue them.

335
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,160
Ahjussi, are you a present?

336
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:05,530
I'm your aunt's present.

337
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:08,260
And this is your present.

338
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,230
Since you welcome me so warmly,

339
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,330
I will be your present too.

340
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:22,090
But Ding Dong, your bodyline
is totally ruined.

341
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:25,400
We'll have to manage your figure a little.
What, what did you eat?

342
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,840
Come over, come over.

343
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,370
- Thank you.
- See you.

344
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,040
Thank you.
You worked hard.

345
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:40,920
Oh, dear... Are your feet hurting,
Miss Jang Geum?

346
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,460
Yes, it seems it's a little bit hurt.

347
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:46,070
It felt painful
when I was doing the last cartwheel.

348
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,410
Are you okay?

349
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:49,230
Yes. After I apply a medicated patch,
it should be fine.

350
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,820
I know a really good
oriental medicine doctor.

351
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:53,700
Go there for an acupuncture treatment.

352
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:56,780
Shall I do that?
Please introduce me to him then.

353
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,480
The doctor is right over here.

354
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:01,530
Yoon Pil Joo.

355
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:05,680
Aigoo, Doctor Yoon, you haven't left yet?

356
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,180
Ah, you two know each other
because you were on a program together.

357
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:14,980
In that case, you should just let
Doctor Yoon take a look at your ankle.

358
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:18,370
Well, you've worked hard.
Goodbye.

359
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:21,480
You worked hard.
Thank you.

360
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,770
I was watching you film the show.

361
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,850
You did more than thirty
cartwheels on the pavement.

362
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,870
It's natural to feel strain on your ankles.

363
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,860
Are your wrists okay?

364
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,480
What are you doing here?

365
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,720
Ah, here... I come here often
to buy herbs for use at the hospital.

366
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,180
So you came here and met me by chance?

367
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,860
It's by chance but also a bit intentional.

368
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,400
I heard you were coming to film
so I waited.

369
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,860
I have been wondering
how you were doing recently.

370
00:20:56,070 --> 00:21:00,060
I can actually find out easily
by visiting your filming locations.

371
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,810
Have you been well?

372
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:07,470
I've been going around on location shoots
for "Searching for Tastes."

373
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,700
Before we catch up on news of each other,

374
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:14,370
shall I take a look at Miss Jang Geum's leg
so that you can continue to travel around?

375
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,710
All done.

376
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:21,070
Hey...

377
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,730
You can't wear high heels.

378
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,050
Just a minute.

379
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,940
Wear this.

380
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,220
It's clean.

381
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,700
I'll be thankful for it even if it's dirty.

382
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,880
This is exactly how Gu Ae Jeong smells like.

383
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:10,250
Ahjussi, it's gone.

384
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,800
You lost the thing I entrusted you with?

385
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,590
I placed the ring in Aunt's sneakers.

386
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,000
It was still here yesterday though.

387
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:26,840
Maybe Aunt threw it away.

388
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:30,020
What? Did she throw it away
together with the sneakers?

389
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,880
It disappeared.
It was here.

390
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,870
Gu Ae Jeong, I'll take it

391
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,840
that you threw away that very expensive
ring because you didn't know about it.

392
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:41,170
But how can you even think of throwing
the sneakers away?

393
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,680
She threw it away once before.

394
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:46,580
I got it back for her.

395
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,970
What?

396
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:50,580
She threw it away before?

397
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,980
That heartless Gu Ae Jeong...

398
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,220
From where did you get it back last time?

399
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,230
Outside,
from the trash can for used clothes.

400
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:02,650
Ahjussi, shall we go look for it together?

401
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:04,040
Ding Dong!

402
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,040
I am Dok Go Jin.

403
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,600
I've undergone upgrading
and became even more special.

404
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:11,070
How can I rummage the trash can for...?
I have to do it.

405
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,170
Where is it?
Let's go.

406
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:22,210
Ding Dong.

407
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,510
It would be embarrassing
if someone sees this.

408
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,160
Keep watch.

409
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:54,720
Hey, you...
Hey, you, Ahjussi.

410
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,440
- Ah. What is it?
- Ahjussi.

411
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,850
Ahjussi.

412
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:02,860
Ahjussi, you can't hear me?

413
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,140
What are all these?

414
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:06,720
What are you doing?
Such a mess...

415
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:09,890
Ahjussi, what are you doing?

416
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,350
We're looking for something.

417
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:17,900
If you want to look for something,
you should clean up the mess as you go.

418
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,750
If you throw things around like that,

419
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:22,240
it just clutters up the area.

420
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:25,020
I will clean it up.

421
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:26,920
You don't need to.

422
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,890
Let your father do it.

423
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,670
It's okay, I will do it.

424
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:35,100
As a father, he really...

425
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:38,930
Young Child, just leave it.
We'll do it for you.

426
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,820
It's okay, I can handle it.

427
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,350
It looks like what we were looking for
isn't here. Let's go.

428
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:50,260
What is this?
How could you leave like this?

429
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:52,050
Clean this up first before you leave.

430
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,730
Didn't you say you are going to clean it up?

431
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:58,800
We said that because the child said
he is going to do it himself.

432
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:01,520
The child's father should clean it up
before leaving.

433
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,100
What are you doing?
Hurry up and do it.

434
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,030
How can you just throw
them in like that?

435
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:26,170
You should fold them nicely
before putting them in.

436
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,270
They were put in like that before.

437
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:30,580
Please fold them nicely
before putting them in.

438
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:34,090
Ahjumma, this ahjussi is very special...

439
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:39,630
A superhero's real identity
can't be revealed at whim.

440
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:43,160
For the sake of the neighborhood’s peace
and these ladies' sanity,

441
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:45,920
let's clean this up quietly, okay?

442
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:51,760
Just with one look, one can tell
the father is an unemployed homeless.

443
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:54,490
He is covering his face
so it won't get tanned, right?

444
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:58,080
Why is a man afraid of getting tanned?

445
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,810
Hey, you!

446
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:02,650
Clean it up properly before leaving.

447
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,630
Let's go.

448
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:19,930
In any case, the important thing is, your
aunt didn't throw away the sneakers here.

449
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:22,850
Let's go back home and search for it again.

450
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,500
Being with you like this

451
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:34,760
reminds me of the Pil line
which I had put behind me.

452
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,650
That safe, comfortable, and strong Pil line?

453
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,030
It's a pity, right?

454
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,180
That you let the Pil line vanish
just like that...

455
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:45,200
In my opinion, it was a pretty good line.

456
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:49,060
Yeah, Yoon Pil Joo
is the perfect man, right?

457
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:53,220
However, from a woman's point of view,

458
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:56,900
Yoon Pil Joo wasn't that perfect.

459
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,010
Why is that so?

460
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:01,770
Your mother is terrifying!

461
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,190
If I rebel, my mother can't do anything.

462
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:06,360
Oh, like rebelling by eating ramen?

463
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,290
That's right.

464
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,720
If I eat ramen three meals in a row,

465
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:12,200
I can make her surrender completely.

466
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:15,210
That's because she's thinking
about her son's welfare.

467
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,320
If she had a daughter-in-law,

468
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:19,530
she'll really nag at the daughter-in-law
for letting her son eat ramen.

469
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:23,010
Wow, you found a major flaw
in that perfect Pil line.

470
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,940
I was kidding.

471
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,710
Mentioning such excuses
makes me feel a little less guilty.

472
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,360
I'm...

473
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:35,080
the kind of woman who runs away
from even the smallest ordeal.

474
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:38,280
So...

475
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:42,460
Are you afraid
because of this great ordeal facing you now?

476
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,710
I am.

477
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:49,800
What should I do with a man with the
whole country acting as my mother-in-law?

478
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,460
You must go to the hospital tomorrow.

479
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,860
If you leave your ankle like that,
it will become a persistent ailment.

480
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,870
I need to film in the mountain.
It's going to be a problem.

481
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:19,850
Go in.

482
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:22,490
Even though I can't give you
a piggyback ride up to there,

483
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,200
I can help you carry these.

484
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,500
- Hold onto me.
- Thank you.

485
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:32,130
It's because the hill is too steep...

486
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,320
- Hold on.
- Thank you.

487
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:47,340
Be careful, be careful.

488
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,450
Be careful.

489
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,360
Ahjussi, Ahjussi.

490
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,990
Aunt is here, Aunt.

491
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,300
It's a special moment.

492
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:05,090
Ding Dong...
You understand, right?

493
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:09,900
I will sneak quietly out through that door

494
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,800
and go to Aunt Jenny's shop.

495
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:13,240
Ahjussi, fighting!

496
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,650
Fighting!

497
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:23,140
I'll have to start off well
from the beginning.

498
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,210
Keep the butthole shut.

499
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,720
Dokko is Ae Jeong's present.

500
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,870
Start with that.

501
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:36,310
Dokko is Ae Jeong's pres...

502
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,850
Change in plans...

503
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:46,180
Be careful.

504
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:48,330
Maybe I should just have given you
a piggyback ride.

505
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:49,920
It's okay.

506
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,160
Thank you.

507
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,400
It's good to see...

508
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:04,760
you enduring well and being strong.

509
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,350
Don't touch her!

510
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:10,700
Thank you.

511
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:13,140
- Goodbye.
- Yes.

512
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:25,430
Oh, my...!

513
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:27,240
Dok Go Jin!

514
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:29,500
Our first scene was a dramatic melodrama.

515
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,130
So for the continuing scene, I thought
it will surely be a similar melodrama.

516
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:37,970
Perhaps it might change into a light
romantic comedy or a hot erotica even.

517
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:43,480
So tell me what this scream inducing,
horror scene of infidelity is all about?!

518
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:47,110
Since you're yelling and saying whatever
you want, you really must be Dok Go Jin!

519
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,850
I really want to keep my butthole shut
this time around at least

520
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:52,370
However, I can't hold it back any more,
I am going to explode.

521
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:55,570
I thought you avoided me during this period
because you were thinking for my sake.

522
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,210
But you've been developing things
with that "just anyone" doctor!

523
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,370
- Gu Ae...
- Enough, Enough!

524
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,370
Before it really turns into a horror serial,
calm down.

525
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:13,520
What are you doing?

526
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,000
Let me check how well it is.

527
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:17,230
I want to hear to see
if it's thump-thumping normally.

528
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:20,380
I've been completely upgraded.

529
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,440
Oh, it is.

530
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,980
It sounds different from how it used to.
It used to sound weird.

531
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:32,850
If we change the genre
so it would become more exciting,

532
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:35,150
you'll be able to find out
how well it has become.

533
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:38,660
Genre?
Let's change to family drama first, okay?

534
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:40,080
Have you eaten yet?

535
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,420
What is this?
Why ask about a meal all of a sudden?

536
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,600
Even in a romantic drama,
one still needs to eat first.

537
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,300
We all have to eat to live.

538
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:55,440
What the heck?

539
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:03,210
Ah, what's this about?

540
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:05,870
Dok Go Jin, did you do this?

541
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,510
I was looking for something.

542
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,500
Even so how could you make it like this?

543
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:15,410
Turning someone else's house upside down
like this...

544
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:17,630
You talk just like
those ahjummas in the neighborhood.

545
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,910
What were you looking for?

546
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,680
Couldn’t you have just called me to ask?

547
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:24,680
I was going to give you a surprise,
how could I call you?

548
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:28,870
What is this?

549
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,600
Gu Ae Jeong...

550
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,690
Where are the sneakers I gave you?

551
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,020
You did all this
because you were trying to find that?

552
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,170
That's right! Where is it?
Did you throw it away?

553
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,630
Do you really need to turn the house
upside down just to find a shoe?

554
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,800
Sneakers should of course
be in the shoe cupboard.

555
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,570
Is this it?

556
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:00,060
I thought you would treat this special
and treat it preciously.

557
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,400
So it's just casually stacked
with other shoes.

558
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:06,210
You were looking for it just to confirm
if it's treated in a special way?

559
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,010
What's that?

560
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:16,090
What is that?

561
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,100
Are you curious about it?

562
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:20,880
Ahh...

563
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:26,410
Although the distance is a bit short,
go stand at that end.

564
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:30,510
Run to me like a wind
and welcome me with full enthusiasm.

565
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:38,110
Or, with tears full of appreciation
and let me hold you and comfort you.

566
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:43,130
I don't like this messy and awkward reunion
so let's change the scenario.

567
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:46,310
How can we change it
when this is the reality?

568
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,430
It really makes me wonder.

569
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:50,460
Let me see.
What did you find in my sneakers?

570
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:52,040
Never mind, now isn't the right time yet.

571
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:54,080
Look forward to the future.

572
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:55,760
Cancel today's reunion.

573
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:57,980
Pretend this never happened
and edit it all out from memory.

574
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,700
I will come again tomorrow.

575
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:03,650
Keep yourself in a happy mood and choose
one of the genres we mentioned earlier.

576
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:06,730
Melodrama, erotica, or romantic comedy,
got it?

577
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,540
What about lunch?

578
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:29,110
It is not a pair of shoes
that I casually wear.

579
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:32,220
I took it out so I can wear it to meet you.

580
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:48,990
New heart... mind control.

581
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:51,040
Well done.
You managed to hold it back well.

582
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:54,500
It was good to turn and leave
instead of saying whatever came to mind.

583
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,390
You did fine.

584
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,510
We'll erase today.

585
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,540
And start anew tomorrow.

586
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:32,010
Change of plans...

587
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:55,090
I was hoping he'll misunderstand again
and leave her completely.

588
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:58,670
Even though it is childish...

589
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,730
But you still have feelings for her,
don't you?

590
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:05,960
Gu Ae Jeong.

591
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:09,850
This is a documentary program plan
that is still under development.

592
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:12,890
The concept is the culture of world cuisine.

593
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,810
Would you like to try something like this?

594
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:17,740
Me?

595
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:22,230
Because it will be filming abroad
for two months or so, it might be tiring.

596
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:24,650
However, once you finish
this kind of program,

597
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:29,560
I think you will have a steady cooking show
once you come back.

598
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,520
That's true.

599
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:34,160
This is a very good opportunity for me.

600
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:39,860
You might think it's because of Dok Go
that I'm sending you so far away, right?

601
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:42,420
- Yes.
- You're right.

602
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:47,040
Before Dok Go does anything,
I'm hoping you can give him more time.

603
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:49,320
However, if I give him that much time,

604
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,430
he would have gone to a faraway place
where I can't hold on to him.

605
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:55,420
I believe that this route

606
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,060
is the right one for you too.

607
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,250
These...

608
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:08,310
are the contracts that you are going
to carry out from now on.

609
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,620
Commercial, movies, and everything else
are all much better than before.

610
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,820
Don't sign a commercial contract though.

611
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:16,710
Once my relationship with Gu Ae Jeong
is exposed,

612
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:18,860
we might have to pay the penalty fee
for breaking the contract.

613
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,060
Do you know how much those are worth?

614
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:22,800
Not just for the money...

615
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,750
but because they are things you can do
only because you're the best.

616
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:28,400
Anyway, whatever decision I make from now on
are all out of my own will.

617
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:31,470
So, don't let Gu Ae Jeong,
who is going to be following alongside me,

618
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:33,470
take any responsibility.

619
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:37,420
In show business, Dok Go Jin
and Gu Ae Jeong are on different levels.

620
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,810
Is it because of this that you feel
you're going to lose a lot more,

621
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,190
so you're totally ignoring
Gu Ae Jeong's position?

622
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:47,310
First, I have to praise you
for being so eloquent.

623
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:49,970
And for doing so many things for me
as my manager.

624
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:51,450
However...

625
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:54,640
I would like to make one thing clear.

626
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:59,810
I will never let go of that woman
for any reason.

627
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,450
The things I have prepared are really great
such that your praise won't go to waste.

628
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,820
So please consider carefully.

629
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,470
Ah.

630
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:16,000
There's a script inside that.

631
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:18,070
Script?

632
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:22,120
[Script: Director Kim Ki Wook]

633
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:25,060
It's directed by Kim Ki Wook.

634
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:28,460
Director Kim Ki Wook has asked for you.

635
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:33,100
You know filming Director Kim's movies is
akin to reserving tickets to Cannes, right?

636
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,150
That script plus Director Kim and you...

637
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:41,850
It wouldn't be presumptuous to now purchase
your tickets to Cannes for next spring.

638
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,220
Take the bait.

639
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,220
Carefully read it.

640
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,210
Representative.

641
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:05,730
That...

642
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,510
Although this isn't something
I should interfere with...

643
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,690
I just don't quite understand
why you want to separate

644
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:14,680
Dok Go hyungnim and Ae Jeong noonim
who couldn't even be separated by death.

645
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:16,120
He is alive, isn't he?

646
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:21,120
Since he is alive,
then we must find ways to live even better.

647
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:26,760
I am just a person who plans the best things
for them as an agency representative.

648
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:42,690
Shouldn't the title of this movie be
"I'm on my way to Cannes"?

649
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,540
If I were to film this,

650
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:52,470
then I need to delay things
with Gu Ae Jeong.

651
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,050
I can't.

652
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,220
Potato.

653
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,780
Do you know what I am doing now?

654
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:02,160
I am canning Cannes.

655
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:15,170
[Script: Director Kim Ki Wook]

656
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,700
Doing this discharges me really fast.

657
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:30,700
Where is the charger? Why isn't she
giving me strength in times like this?

658
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,310
What?

659
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,520
Did she come?

660
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:40,160
The system is now disarmed.

661
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:47,720
What is this?

662
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,150
You can just press 6090 and enter.

663
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,560
Why press the door bell?

664
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,580
Since you've got a new heart,

665
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,510
I wasn't sure if I could come straight in.

666
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:57,360
Of course you can.

667
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:59,400
Come in, hurry.

668
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,000
You, seriously...

669
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,730
Here.

670
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:19,190
I'll sit over here.

671
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:32,520
What is with these endless awkward meetings?

672
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:33,770
Why are you acting like this?

673
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,860
It's just the continuation of the scene
when you left this place two months ago.

674
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,190
What's so different now?

675
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:41,100
When I thought there was not much time left

676
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:44,220
and was treasuring every single second,

677
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:49,010
and when I was looking
at the difficult road ahead of us,

678
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,500
of course there is a difference.

679
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:54,900
We're now facing reality.

680
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:58,820
I really don't want
to bring up this topic first...

681
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,410
But what are we going to do next?

682
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:01,410
What do you mean what?

683
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:05,310
Since we've found a future where we can be
together, of course we should stay together.

684
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:07,590
Okay, fine then.

685
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:13,200
However, I...
don't know if I can ask this or not.

686
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:17,890
I heard there are a lot of commercials
and movie offers that came in.

687
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:21,650
Are you okay without all of those
in the future?

688
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,820
Gu Ae Jeong.

689
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,810
All I need is you.

690
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:28,040
I want to be able to say that
in a romantic fashion.

691
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,570
But when facing reality,
it's difficult to say that kind of thing.

692
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:33,350
But I have to conquer that.

693
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:37,240
Um... Is this house on monthly rental?

694
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,250
Don't think about those annoying details.

695
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,280
We really have gone through
so much difficulties to meet again.

696
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,870
How could I not be bothered about it?

697
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,950
This is not that kind of romantic comedy
where love would conquer all.

698
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:48,320
Gu Ae Jeong.

699
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:51,080
Should I bring in my accountant tomorrow
so he can check how much wealth I have,

700
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,040
how much taxes I pay,
and how much the hospital bill is?

701
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,800
Should I show them to you in figures

702
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:56,820
so you can feel more relieved
and break away from the mundane reality?

703
00:42:56,870 --> 00:43:00,340
I'm more concerned
about whether you'll be fine.

704
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:01,210
What is it this time?

705
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:05,030
You're a person who has to brag
and receive praises from people.

706
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:05,970
Can you live with

707
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:09,320
having to watch your actions
and with being constantly criticized?

708
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,610
That would really require that Gu Ae Jeong
be by my side for me to live through.

709
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:16,270
So stop trying to scare me
with what we might encounter in the future.

710
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:20,420
I just think I'm being too shameless.

711
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:23,100
Dok Go Jin said he wants to enter
my pile of poop.

712
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:28,380
I thought I should at least clean out
the dirty things before I welcome you in.

713
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:31,510
However, it's not possible to do that
in just a day or two.

714
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:34,130
I am really sorry.

715
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:38,190
If that's how you feel,
you should be encouraging me more.

716
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,390
You need to encourage me to catch hold of
what's really important

717
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:42,840
and not become a coward.

718
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:52,790
Recharge.

719
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:54,360
What's that?

720
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:56,220
Is that all?

721
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:58,740
Dok Go Jin.

722
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:00,640
I will give you a last chance.

723
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:05,220
This is the last chance for you to swish
past me so please carefully consider it.

724
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:14,140
Just who is it who made Gu Ae Jeong
lose so much of her spirit?

725
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:21,590
Hey... It was you, right?

726
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,450
It was you who discouraged and scared
Gu Ae Jeong, right?

727
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:25,040
I didn't say anything wrong.

728
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:27,890
I'm saying it's okay so what's the problem?
Why is everyone meddling?

729
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:30,310
If your relationship is exposed, who do you
think will receive more public censure?

730
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:32,800
In any case, since we'll be censured as a
pair, we can share the censure between us.

731
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,410
Do you think it's possible?

732
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:37,330
Every citizen in the nation
is going to act like her mother-in-law.

733
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:39,230
A mother-in-law doesn't blame her own son.

734
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:41,770
She will only blame everything
on the daughter-in-law.

735
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:43,780
Once the relationship is exposed,

736
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:47,400
there will be rumors right away that
she is pregnant so she is clinging onto you.

737
00:44:47,570 --> 00:44:51,470
She probably could even receive threats
from your overly rabid fans.

738
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:54,460
When you didn't manage go to Hollywood
the last time,

739
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:58,980
don't you know how hard a time
your fans gave Ae Jeong?

740
00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:01,100
Even if she can bear with all that
and marry you,

741
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:05,330
there will be rumors of discord, separation,
and divorce arising every other day.

742
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,510
You guys will not have even one quiet day.

743
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:10,830
You easily thought of the worst scenario.

744
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,160
This scenario is reality.

745
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,680
Dok Go Jin...

746
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:17,520
You should just head for Cannes
in a cool fashion.

747
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:19,620
If you leave Ae Jeong alone,

748
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:22,120
she will find a good man.

749
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:24,290
Who is that good man you're refering to?

750
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:27,490
Gu Ae Jeong, why aren't you coming over
to have your ankle treated?

751
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:30,230
I've applied some medical patch on it
at home and it has recovered.

752
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,080
Even so,
if you don't receive proper treatment,

753
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,930
you might never be able to do another
Mat Jang Geum-style cartwheel again.

754
00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:39,520
I think I will not be doing cartwheels again
because I'll be taking on another program.

755
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,290
Are you?
I should congratulate you then.

756
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:45,040
I think I might do an overseas program.

757
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,160
An announcer originally
was supposed to do that show.

758
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,380
If I take on that assignment,

759
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:52,470
I think it might improve my public image.

760
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:55,200
Are you trying to win points
from your mothers-in-law?

761
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,540
Yes.

762
00:45:57,910 --> 00:46:00,080
If I ascend even just one step
from the bottom,

763
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:04,360
maybe I can reduce one step
from the distance he'll fall.

764
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:09,260
Falling and getting hurt is the share
he should bear from the relationship.

765
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,670
If you were to bear that share yourself,

766
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:13,730
you'll be hurt even more.

767
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:15,360
And that man...

768
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:19,720
He'll use you as a cushion and lose
all intentions to fall from his position.

769
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:23,540
I am really happy to see you so healthy.

770
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:25,680
When do you plan to marry Ae Jeong unni?

771
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:28,290
- Hurry, hurry.
- Kang Se Ri...

772
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:31,660
When our scandal got exposed in the past,

773
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:35,050
did you get attacked by my fans too?

774
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:38,530
You're asking that only now?

775
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:43,360
I am a top class top star, yet I received
all sorts of unreasonable censures.

776
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:46,040
They said things like I sold my body
to go up a level

777
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:48,500
and said they'll wait and look
how long I can last as your girlfriend.

778
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:49,400
Do you know how many times

779
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,020
I changed my phone number because
of the sms terror group they formed?

780
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:53,080
Did you?

781
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:56,470
Actually, I did like you a little bit
at that time.

782
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:58,330
However, compared to your bad temper,

783
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,910
the pressure coming from everyone around you
made me lose my feelings for you.

784
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:03,210
It even caused feelings to be lost?

785
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:05,350
It's already too late to say this but...

786
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:08,550
One woman even stuck a knife into my photo
and sent it to me.

787
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:11,040
She said I was not on your level
so she told me to get lost.

788
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:13,310
How could they do such things?

789
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:15,550
Why?
Are you worried?

790
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:17,730
If someone of Kang Se Ri's level
is treated that way,

791
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:20,880
how would Ae Jeong unni be treated?

792
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,000
If we were to reveal our relationship
and expect to face this kind of things,

793
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,640
it's better to just hide ourselves
and avoid everyone.

794
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:27,380
Where can you hide?
And for how long?

795
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:30,360
In today's world, where can you hide?

796
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:35,190
Besides, if you stay quiet,
you'll become a weak target for censure.

797
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,580
In that case, that won't work either?

798
00:47:49,850 --> 00:47:53,560
Ahjussi, why didn't you give it to my aunt
after you found it?

799
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:55,630
This is not something
that a 7-year old can understand.

800
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:57,820
There are many complications.

801
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:01,790
I also have complicated things on mind.

802
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:05,480
What are they?
Do you want me to ask you about it?

803
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,890
I share a desk with Doo Bin...

804
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:11,560
And I saw some vandalism
on the restroom door.

805
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:22,150
[Doo Bin... heart... Hyung Gyu]

806
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:19,620
Doo Bin... heart...

807
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:28,160
You're involved in a scandal.
Is this true?

808
00:48:28,970 --> 00:48:33,600
I made this for her.

809
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:37,170
What's so complicated about that?

810
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:43,080
My friends kept teasing about us
and I just kept quiet

811
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:45,730
so Doo Bin went home crying.

812
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:47,840
How could you just keep quiet?

813
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:50,910
You should have said that Doo Bin is
your mate. And that this belongs to Doo Bin.

814
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:54,230
You should have stepped out
and explained this to everyone.

815
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,920
If I do that then they will tease me.

816
00:48:57,020 --> 00:49:00,700
If this is true,
you'll have to manage that kind of teasing.

817
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:05,030
The answer to the problem of a 7-year old
and a 30-year old is the same.

818
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:08,540
You have to tell your friends
who this belongs to.

819
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:11,300
As for who this belongs to...

820
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:13,880
I'll tell everyone about it as well.

821
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:24,220
Dok Go hyungnim is recording a talk show
right now.

822
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:29,680
They filmed this to announce
he has returned healthy, right?

823
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:33,530
That's right, Dok Go Jin's health condition
is being followed in the news.

824
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:35,380
Of course he'll have to make a proper
announcement that he's in good health.

825
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:37,100
What is he planning to say?

826
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:40,850
Representative Moon said he'll talk
about doing a movie and about his schedule.

827
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:42,730
If he is going to do
all those scheduled jobs,

828
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,320
does it mean
he is not going to disclose his relationship

829
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:48,020
with Ae Jeong until he finishes the filming?

830
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,710
They can keep dating secretly.

831
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:55,110
But, if people find out they're dating,
it will be an even bigger blow to Ae Jeong.

832
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:56,900
That's right!

833
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,490
You must stop her!
Oppa, you must stop her.

834
00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:01,360
I did try to stop her.

835
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:04,500
I'm using the overseas show Representative
Moon introduced to persuade her.

836
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:06,380
She must do that show.

837
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:09,560
It will get her away from Dok Go Jin.

838
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:11,740
And...

839
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:14,430
Is the first stop in China?

840
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:19,420
I think Yoon Pil Joo is going to China too.

841
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:22,250
I will go find out where he will be.

842
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:26,160
I'll go with her.

843
00:50:27,590 --> 00:50:30,930
Jae Seok,
stop putting so much effort on Jenny.

844
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,580
Why?

845
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:36,140
You had red wine with Jenny, right?

846
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,370
I had too.

847
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,440
You only had red wine, right?

848
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:44,980
Don't tell me...

849
00:50:49,570 --> 00:50:51,550
You bad woman...!

850
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:59,570
Jae Seok, let's not be fools,

851
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:01,800
played around by that bad woman anymore.

852
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:14,880
I recorded a talk show.

853
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:18,740
I saw the news,
the response is amazing.

854
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:21,190
They estimated the rating
could be 50 percent!

855
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:23,290
Of course, that's the kind of rating
it's supposed to get.

856
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:27,820
I think the whole nation
is going to watch it.

857
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,130
We have to let your fans see
how healthy you are.

858
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,510
What will you be doing
during the night of the broadcast?

859
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:36,790
Oh, I have a filming session.

860
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:39,670
The topic is late-night food
so we have to shoot at night.

861
00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:42,260
I probably won't be able to see your show.

862
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:46,710
Gu Ae Jeong, you did say you are giving me
a chance to run away, right?

863
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,090
Yes.

864
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:52,100
I talked about my future plans
after coming to a decision calmly.

865
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:57,250
If you watch the program, you will know
what I intend to do in the future.

866
00:51:58,410 --> 00:52:00,360
In that case,
I'll try to catch the broadcast.

867
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:01,660
Right, watch it.

868
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:06,890
I went and bragged to my heart's desire
about Dok Go Jin's world in the future.

869
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:08,660
Is that so?

870
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:09,980
How about going to Cannes?

871
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:12,080
Yes, I mentioned Cannes.

872
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:16,750
I'll definitely try to catch it.

873
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:18,970
You better go home now.

874
00:52:22,850 --> 00:52:24,330
Gu Ae Jeong.

875
00:52:25,170 --> 00:52:28,320
Why don't you ever cling onto me?

876
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,660
Is it because of our circumstances?

877
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:32,310
No matter how hard the reality is,

878
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:35,630
I can like you to the extent
that will make you ignore all that.

879
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:40,230
How can I ask you to ignore it
when it is so clearly visible ahead of us?

880
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:42,350
I have fallen before.

881
00:52:42,490 --> 00:52:47,250
I fell from the very top to the rock bottom
in an instant.

882
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:54,330
I am very scared that you will suffer
what I went through before.

883
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:58,260
And I also know
how much you will resent me for it later.

884
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,360
Because I have been there before...

885
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:04,650
Do you think I am so nice
that I never blamed Mi Na and Se Ri?

886
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:07,260
Did you think I had covered up for them
without resentment?

887
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,190
That's not the case.

888
00:53:09,410 --> 00:53:13,380
Honestly, I have hated and resented them
a 1,000... 10,000 times in my heart.

889
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:17,850
The thing I am most afraid of
is you will feel the same way towards me.

890
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:28,110
If you have decided to swish past me,
don't delay any longer, just go.

891
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:32,280
I will not blame you
for taking me out from your future.

892
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:34,480
I mean it.

893
00:53:35,090 --> 00:53:38,600
I will not blame you at all.

894
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:42,190
Because you sincerely loved me before.

895
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:47,410
Don't forget me

896
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:51,490
Even if I only lived for a second

897
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:57,780
I'll be the one and only heart who loves you

898
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:06,980
For that one and only,
I've concealed sorrowful tears and left

899
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:13,250
So please remember me

900
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:18,360
Oh, did you find the comics
"Paul's Miraculous Adventure"?

901
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:20,940
Did you prepare the thing I asked you to?

902
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:26,750
My photoshop techniques are poor
but I tried to do it.

903
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:28,290
Let me see.
Bring it here.

904
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:29,700
Yes.

905
00:54:32,650 --> 00:54:34,290
So cute...

906
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:38,180
Look at this, Paul and Mushroom Head
seem to be very close.

907
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:40,670
I am going to tell Yoon Pil Joo
that I did this.

908
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:42,900
You are going to show him this?

909
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:44,520
What's wrong?

910
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,370
Do you think Yoon Pil Joo
will not be happy after he sees this?

911
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,380
He will think you are a stalker.

912
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,220
Really?

913
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:55,580
Yeah, he'll probably think I'm a pervert.

914
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,260
In that case, I will use it
as my cell phone’s background then.

915
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:01,630
Oh, I miss Paul.

916
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:08,800
- Have a nice dinner.
- Thank you.

917
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:13,860
Yoon Pil Joo,
you said you will study in China, right?

918
00:55:13,950 --> 00:55:15,630
Yes, I am getting ready for that.

919
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:20,360
That's great! Ae Jeong
is also getting ready to go to China.

920
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:24,040
You two can just get ready
and go there together.

921
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:27,270
I heard Gu Ae Jeong
is going to film a program abroad.

922
00:55:27,370 --> 00:55:29,710
That...
If your Chinese is good,

923
00:55:29,830 --> 00:55:31,530
please teach Ae Jeong.

924
00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:33,960
Teaching her English would be good too.

925
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:39,340
Jenny unni, I'm here.

926
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:45,660
Oh, Yoon Pil Joo is here.

927
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:49,650
Didn't you just call me to ask
if Yoon Pil Joo came here or not?

928
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:52,590
I want to eat together.

929
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:57,600
Kang Se Ri.

930
00:55:58,030 --> 00:56:00,570
I ignore you and push you away

931
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:02,830
yet you still keep doing this,
aren't you embarrassed?

932
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:04,520
You have been like this from the beginning.

933
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:07,910
I've decided not to be bothered by that
since I like you.

934
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:10,580
You don't hesitate when you do things

935
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:12,890
and you do whatever you want to do.

936
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:14,640
You are very similar to him.

937
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:17,100
Him? Who is he?
The evil king?

938
00:56:17,230 --> 00:56:20,630
You two are very similar
and match very well.

939
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,660
Why didn't your relationship develop well?

940
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:26,540
Yoon Pil Joo, do you dislike Dok Go Jin?

941
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:29,350
That's right.

942
00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:31,570
You said he and I are similar.

943
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:34,350
Does that mean you dislike me too?

944
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:38,570
Ah... no no no.
Please don't answer me.

945
00:56:38,850 --> 00:56:40,660
I can accept you saying you don't like me.

946
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:42,940
I'll be very embarrassed
if you say you dislike me.

947
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:45,340
I won't listen.

948
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,600
Well... I called you Mushroom Head,
who is close to Paul.

949
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:55,900
What did you say?

950
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,220
Welcome.

951
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,100
Yes.
How are you?

952
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:07,690
Welcome, please come in.

953
00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:08,930
It feels really good here.

954
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:09,720
It is good.

955
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:10,780
Let's take a look over there.

956
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:12,590
Thank you.

957
00:57:29,150 --> 00:57:34,590
Why is it so hard to get you to flower?

958
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:45,040
Aigoo, such a hot day...
Have a drink.

959
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:46,610
Thank you.

960
00:57:46,790 --> 00:57:49,220
You are so pretty.

961
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:53,970
Our potatoes are planted by hand in
Gangwon-do*. (*district famous for potatoes)

962
00:57:54,090 --> 00:57:55,720
You grow potato?

963
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:57,650
Isn't potato hard to grow?

964
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:59,970
Potato is very easy to grow.

965
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:02,520
And it bears a lot of harvest.

966
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,830
They also have very pretty flowers.

967
00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:07,910
Ah, potatoes really bloom?

968
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:09,200
I have never seen it.

969
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,410
Potato flowers are really very pretty.

970
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,720
It's right before your eyes
and yet you don't know?

971
00:58:13,830 --> 00:58:15,060
What?

972
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:18,630
Those are potato flowers.

973
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:20,730
Those are potato flowers?

974
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:22,650
Yes.

975
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:31,880
They're potato flowers.

976
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:36,670
If our potato flowers too,
it will look this pretty.

977
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:41,730
I thought potatoes do not bloom.

978
00:58:41,930 --> 00:58:43,720
This is Kim Gu Ra,
your host for "Kim Gu Ra's Star Date."

979
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,480
- Yet they bloom so prettily.
- Let's introduce tonight's guest.

980
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:48,990
He nearly caused everyone in the country
heart attacks.

981
00:58:48,990 --> 00:58:49,920
Now, he returns with a steel heart...

982
00:58:49,930 --> 00:58:52,390
- Oh, it's Dok Go Jin.
- Welcome, Dok Go Jin.

983
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:54,140
Dok Go Jin?

984
00:58:57,210 --> 00:58:58,780
I am Dok Go Jin.

985
00:58:58,930 --> 00:59:00,370
Everyone is very worried about you.

986
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:01,230
Yes.

987
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:03,320
I'm sorry for making everyone worry.

988
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:04,890
I am in a healthy state now.

989
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:07,800
You do look healthy.

990
00:59:07,890 --> 00:59:11,710
I think seeing you healthy
will make many citizens and fans happy.

991
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:14,000
Are you completely recovered?

992
00:59:14,070 --> 00:59:16,960
Of course, the surgery was successful.

993
00:59:17,270 --> 00:59:18,640
So everything has returned back to normal.

994
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:21,250
In that case please let everyone
see Dok Go Jin's famous trick.

995
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,930
100 pushups in a minute.

996
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,110
Can you do it now?

997
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,220
Yes, of course.

998
00:59:28,370 --> 00:59:31,440
Here, let's start the filming.

999
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:33,210
I am a fan of Dok Go Jin.

1000
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:35,190
May we start the filming after this is done?

1001
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:38,870
Watch it after the filming please.
Sorry.

1002
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:44,410
I'll show it to you next time.

1003
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:49,170
- That's a pity.
- True.

1004
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:53,440
Dok Go Jin was really worried
about Ae Jeong unni not long ago.

1005
00:59:53,570 --> 00:59:54,900
What's the use?

1006
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:56,980
Ae Jeong is leaving soon.

1007
00:59:57,370 --> 01:00:01,770
And he is going to film a movie and an ad
so he is going to be very busy too.

1008
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:06,000
Do you think you look better with
or without moustache?

1009
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:12,890
Our restaurant uses organic potatoes
which are planted by hand in Gangwon-do.

1010
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:15,870
Wow... That must be really good
for the health then, President.

1011
01:00:15,950 --> 01:00:17,180
Of course.

1012
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:19,750
And what's the picture behind us?

1013
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:21,600
Ah, that picture

1014
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:26,600
is our potato field blooming in Gangwon-do.

1015
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:28,530
NG NG

1016
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,880
Aigoo, we are recording the audio
together with the video footage right now.

1017
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:34,220
Please switch off the television.

1018
01:00:34,350 --> 01:00:37,540
It's going to end soon.
Let's watch for a bit.

1019
01:00:39,810 --> 01:00:43,300
He's on television after such a long time.
We have to watch it.

1020
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:45,990
Aigoo, please sit.
Please sit down.

1021
01:00:46,070 --> 01:00:50,170
Can we watch TV
and take a break for a while?

1022
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:51,870
Okay, let's do that then.

1023
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:53,680
Everyone take a break.

1024
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:56,110
Thank you. Thank you.

1025
01:00:56,470 --> 01:00:58,550
Ae Jeong take a break also.

1026
01:00:58,650 --> 01:00:59,870
Yes.

1027
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:03,860
That is what I meant.

1028
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,540
That's why we prepared something for you.

1029
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:10,640
The Ideal Type World Cup
for the ever cool Dok Go Jin.

1030
01:01:10,690 --> 01:01:13,980
You just have to select the female celebrity

1031
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:17,030
who is closest to your ideal type.

1032
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:20,170
- They are all top celebrities.
- Those are the potato flowers.

1033
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,910
How nice it would be
if you could see it too.

1034
01:01:25,210 --> 01:01:25,700
[Let's find out Dok Go Jin's ideal type!]

1035
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:27,690
Let's take a look then.

1036
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:29,000
- There is Shin Mi Ah
- Correct.

1037
01:01:29,090 --> 01:01:30,840
and many other beauties too.

1038
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:34,060
There's also Park Han Byul and Lee Hyori.
What a fierce fight!

1039
01:01:34,750 --> 01:01:36,520
The first round...

1040
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:40,760
Both with the innocent image.
Shin Min Ah vs Park Shin Hye.

1041
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:41,770
Shin Min Ah.

1042
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:44,780
Ah, it's Shin Min Ah.
Not a bad choice...

1043
01:01:45,050 --> 01:01:47,920
Here's the next round.

1044
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:50,040
Han Jung Min vs Lee Da Hae...

1045
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:51,440
Lee Da Hae.

1046
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:54,470
It's my first time seeing Dok Go Jin
playing this kind of thing.

1047
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:56,080
Oh, the next one...

1048
01:01:56,290 --> 01:01:57,700
This one is quite simple.

1049
01:01:57,870 --> 01:02:01,530
It's After School's Uee vs
National Treasure Girl's Gu Ae Jeong.

1050
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:03,470
It's the current idol vs the past idol!

1051
01:02:03,810 --> 01:02:05,080
- Uee?
- Gu Ae Jeong.

1052
01:02:05,410 --> 01:02:07,390
Oh, really?

1053
01:02:07,530 --> 01:02:09,960
- What's going on?
- That's a good choice too... Okay.

1054
01:02:10,070 --> 01:02:13,470
Next, Park Han Byul vs Gu Ae Jeong.

1055
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:14,540
Here.

1056
01:02:16,570 --> 01:02:17,270
Gu Ae Jeong.

1057
01:02:17,290 --> 01:02:20,250
Oh, Gu Ae Jeong is going strong today.

1058
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:23,360
This time it's
Park Shi Yeon vs Gu Ae Jeong. Now...

1059
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:24,340
Gu Ae Jeong.

1060
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:29,000
What's going on?

1061
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:33,000
Gu Ae Jeong has been winning consecutively.

1062
01:02:33,110 --> 01:02:36,280
Now, this time it's
Lee Sheo Nan vs Gu Ae Jeong. Here...

1063
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:39,820
This time around...

1064
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,320
Still Gu Ae Jeong.

1065
01:02:41,450 --> 01:02:44,430
Ah, still Gu Ae Jeong!

1066
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:45,790
Gu Ae Jeong is that attractive?

1067
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,700
- I wonder how much longer Gu Ae Jeong
can continue. - Oh, my goodness!

1068
01:02:47,710 --> 01:02:49,630
I wonder how long
he will continue to choose her.

1069
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:53,280
Here, will she able to defeat Han Ye Seul?

1070
01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:57,160
This round is Gu Ae Jeong vs Han Ye Seul.

1071
01:02:57,410 --> 01:02:58,240
Still, Gu Ae Jeong.

1072
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:00,940
What? How could it be?
Anyone would have chosen Han Ye Seul!

1073
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:03,210
Ah... What's going on?

1074
01:03:03,210 --> 01:03:06,380
I don't know what's happening.

1075
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:09,790
All right. It's Gu Ae Jeong
versus Shin Min Ah! What's your choice?

1076
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:11,460
Gu Ae Jeong!

1077
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,850
Ah, This is...

1078
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,250
It's totally ridiculous.

1079
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:17,840
Aigoo, how could it be possible?

1080
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:20,720
This is incredible.

1081
01:03:21,710 --> 01:03:25,240
I can't understand
why he keeps picking Gu Ae Jeong.

1082
01:03:34,030 --> 01:03:36,350
Gu Ae Jeong has now advanced
to the final round.

1083
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:40,250
This is a scenario
which no one has imagined possible.

1084
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:43,270
Let's go into the final round.

1085
01:03:43,270 --> 01:03:49,270
The Nation's Goddess Jun Ji Hyun
vs Gu Ae Jeong, now.

1086
01:03:51,890 --> 01:03:52,850
Gu Ae Jeong.

1087
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:54,560
Gu Ae Jeong!

1088
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:02,670
What should you do?
You are Dok Go Jin's ideal type!

1089
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,350
You must be very excited!

1090
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:06,260
My, gosh!

1091
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:09,310
What is this?

1092
01:04:11,410 --> 01:04:13,700
My ideal type is Gu Ae Jeong.

1093
01:04:13,770 --> 01:04:16,320
We know that already.

1094
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:18,100
Yes, we do.

1095
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:20,690
She's not just my ideal type.

1096
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:24,060
The person whom I love right now

1097
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:25,820
is Gu Ae Jeong.

1098
01:04:26,930 --> 01:04:31,570
I cannot live without you

1099
01:04:31,570 --> 01:04:36,780
I am fine even if it's hard or painful

1100
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:39,480
You're right, we are in a relationship

1101
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:41,700
I can't stop my love for you

1102
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,700
where we are mutually in love.

1103
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:46,760
It will never change even if the world ends

1104
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:49,410
My love

1105
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:56,180
I cannot live without you

1106
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:59,320
She is the greatest love that I,
Dok Go Jin, have found.

1107
01:04:56,930 --> 01:05:02,030
I am fine even if it's hard or painful

1108
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:01,750
Gu Ae Jeong, I love you.

1109
01:05:01,990 --> 01:05:05,350
Having revealed everything in the program,
I can't take back what I said.

1110
01:05:02,030 --> 01:05:07,060
I can't stop my love for you

1111
01:05:05,410 --> 01:05:07,360
Have you caught hold of me properly now?

1112
01:05:07,060 --> 01:05:12,000
It will never change even if the world ends

1113
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,080
I'll definitely not let go.

1114
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:11,040
I think your current situation
is the worst possible.

1115
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:12,970
I've almost finished
putting everything away.

1116
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,690
My love

1117
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:14,430
I've started making preparations to leave.

1118
01:05:14,290 --> 01:05:16,690
I cannot hide

1119
01:05:14,430 --> 01:05:17,470
I'm also going to start having activities
in China regularly.

1120
01:05:16,690 --> 01:05:19,350
I cannot conceal

1121
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,160
Dok Go Jin's video?

1122
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:21,350
Is there really such a thing?

1123
01:05:19,350 --> 01:05:26,230
My love for you

1124
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:26,270
Gu Ae Jeong...
