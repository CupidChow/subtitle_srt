00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,370
- Gu Ae Jeong?
- Yes, Gu Ae Jeong's amazing.

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,460
All right. It's Gu Ae Jeong
versus Shin Min Ah!

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,270
Ok, what's your choice?

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,260
Gu Ae Jeong!

7
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,720
-This is...
-It's totally ridiculous.

8
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,750
Seems like after he went through
that life-changing event,

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,380
Dok Go Jin's taste has changed.

10
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,170
In any case, we got it.
Now, let's proceed to the final round.

11
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,640
No one expected Gu Ae Jeong
to reach the final round.

12
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:28,470
- That's right.
- Yes, Gu Ae Jeong's reached the final round.

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,270
Yes, for the final round, it's
Jeon Ji Hyeon versus Gu Ae Jeong!

14
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,650
And your choice is?

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,520
- Gu Ae Jeong!
- Gu Ae Jeong!

16
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,150
Is he serious about it?

17
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,420
Lady, how can you...

18
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:47,790
You're Dok Go Jin's ideal type?

19
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,320
You must be very famous!

20
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,960
My gosh!

21
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,470
He chose Gu Ae Jeong.

22
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,710
From the look of this,

23
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,550
her luck has improved lately.

24
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,330
My ideal type is Gu Ae Jeong.

25
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,740
We know that already.

26
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,790
Yes, we do.

27
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,400
She's not just my ideal type.

28
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:11,420
The person whom I love
right now is Gu Ae Jeong.

29
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,250
We have a pretty sensitive question next.

30
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,850
In that case,

31
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,320
I'll ask you once more.

32
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,900
Are you and Gu Ae Jeong mutually
in love and in a relationship?

33
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:38,330
You're right, we are in a relationship
where we are mutually in love.

34
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,890
This is ridiculous.

35
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,270
Are you Dok Go Jin's girlfriend?

36
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,700
Yes.

37
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,910
That man is my boyfriend.

38
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,850
Are they putting up a show?

39
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,630
What is happening?

40
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,980
How can this be true?

41
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:19,090
Yes, let's take a look at some data
on Gu Ae Jeong.

42
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,590
We know that she was a member
of the National Treasure Girls.

43
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:22,910
That's right.

44
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,570
The National Treasure Girls
had a hit song called "Heartbeat".

45
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,420
- Dok Go Jin is really cool.
- The person who made my heart race

46
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,180
by singing that song is Gu Ae Jeong.

47
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:35,970
Although you've revealed
your relationship with her,

48
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,530
it's quite hard for the public to accept.

49
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:43,880
News of your romance will probably be
the focus of all the media outlets.

50
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,770
I'll use this opportunity
to ask everyone for their blessing.

51
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,460
I hope that everyone will give us
unconditional support.

52
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,320
Yes, we understand.

53
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:57,290
Where is Ae Jeong right now?

54
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,190
At the potato soup restaurant.

55
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,560
What?

56
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:03,350
Does she know that you were
going to reveal the relationship?

57
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:08,660
She does not know.
She's probably in great shock right now.

58
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:11,270
It's not just Gu Ae Jeong who is in shock.

59
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,570
I think the entire nation
is in shock right now.

60
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,420
Actually, we also feel that things are
getting a little unbelievable right now.

61
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,330
That's right. I'm very curious.

62
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,360
I'm sure everyone watching is very shocked,

63
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,230
especially all the female viewers.

64
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,800
They must all be sighing right now.

65
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,700
Did you know about it long ago?

66
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,180
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,600
We'll have to fight another battle again.

68
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,860
What are you doing?
Why aren't you answering the call?

69
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,010
What shall I say?

70
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,410
They had developed feelings for each other
and became lovers not long ago.

71
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,720
We hope everyone will give them support

72
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,470
so that their relationship
can develop smoothly.

73
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,720
Ok.

74
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,820
Yes, Reporter Lee.

75
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,570
Yes, yes, I wanted to call you too.

76
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,300
Yes.

77
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,480
Oh, about that?

78
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,340
- Yes, Reporter Choi.
- They developed feelings for each other.

79
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,090
Of course.

80
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,680
- Yes, they are deeply in love.
- They became lovers not long ago.

81
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,460
All right, Dok Go Jin,

82
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:18,020
Which part of Gu Ae Jeong
captured your heart?

83
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:23,740
Firstly, she's pretty.
She's extremely pretty like an idol singer.

84
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,980
I fell in love like I was under hypnosis,

85
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:32,960
and couldn't control myself
like I had broken down.

86
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,060
Even if it ended just like this,
I think I'd still be happy.

87
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,740
That's how great it is.

88
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,140
Gu Ae Jeong...

89
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:45,300
is the greatest love that I,
Dok Go Jin, have found.

90
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,420
Gu Ae Jeong,

91
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,210
I love you.

92
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,510
Dokko is Ae Jeong's present.

93
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:44,350
I've clung onto you again this time round.

94
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,540
Having revealed everything in the program,

95
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,570
I can't take back what I said.

96
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,600
Take responsibility for that!

97
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:59,520
This is the future that I can give you.

98
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,250
Accept it.

99
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,620
Have you caught hold of me properly now?

100
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:33,370
You've finally been properly
caught hold of?

101
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,400
Don't try to escape and ask me
to let go of you again.

102
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:37,740
Escape?

103
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,030
Don't even dream about it.

104
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,620
I'll definitely not let go.

105
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:46,200
Because you are my man

106
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,780
Because you are my love

107
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:57,510
After sending you away and letting go,
you still remain and make me cry

108
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,990
Because you are my man

109
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:05,120
It's because you are still my man

110
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:08,000
I can't hold back...

111
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:11,640
Dok Go Jin, I saw potato flowers today.

112
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:12,330
Where?

113
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,640
There was a photo of potato flowers
at the potato soup restaurant.

114
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,260
Do you want to see it?

115
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,000
How I hope our potato will flower too.

116
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,940
But why does it look like that?

117
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:38,780
Because it was thrown around,
stamped on and hit a few times.

118
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,480
Will it flower safely?

119
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,610
It'll flower if we wait.

120
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,240
It fits just nice.

121
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,870
It's beautiful.

122
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:56,590
[Shocking! Dok Go Jin and Gu Ae Jeong
passionately in love]

123
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,260
[Dok Go Jin's girlfriend is Gu Ae Jeong?
Dok Go Jin's fans are astounded]

124
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:02,000
[Dok Go Jin's girlfriend is Gu Ae Jeong?
Dok Go Jin's fans are astounded]

125
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:10,260
All the reports have words like
"shocked" and "astounded" in their title.

126
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,780
No...

127
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,100
Are we committing an affair or something?

128
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:18,050
Is it that shocking and astonishing
that we are going out?

129
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,110
This is all within expectations.

130
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,730
Top star Dok Go Jin's girlfriend
is neither Shin Min Ah nor Han Ye Seul.

131
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,380
It's Gu Ae Jeong.

132
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,580
If they accepted it without feeling shocked,

133
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:33,270
from my perspective,
it'd be a blow to my pride.

134
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,290
It's great that you managed
to protect your pride.

135
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:40,550
They've also posted a lot of comments
on the reports, right?

136
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:44,790
What did they say? Did they scold me?

137
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:48,710
It's better not to see them.
It feels like you've received a massage,

138
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,040
being beaten every inch of your body
from hand to toe.

139
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,710
Feels great.

140
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,850
But don't worry, Gu Ae Jeong.

141
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:01,530
I have reliable fans
who will be our protectors.

142
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,110
They stayed up all night
when I was undergoing surgery

143
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,240
They are faithful fans who support me
every single day.

144
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:11,220
Those fans will be able to
defend us to some extent.

145
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,010
Ok, here.

146
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,180
What are you doing?

147
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,940
If I post this up,

148
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:20,520
fans who like me will
post their reactions, too.

149
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:23,780
When we see that,
we'll feel slightly better.

150
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:26,430
Now, smile. Gu Ae Jeong, smile.

151
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,050
Smile.

152
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,470
Gu Ae Jeong, if you still have a conscience,
leave on your own accord!

153
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,190
Even if we don't take action,
it seems like they'll break up soon.

154
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,300
It's understandable for a fan to get
jealous like that. Tolerate that much.

155
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,670
This one.

156
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,650
I think you two look good together.

157
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,550
See!

158
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:56,150
My fans have unconditional trust
and love for me.

159
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,840
Dok Go Jin, I'm disappointed with you.
You're an embarrassment.

160
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,760
The pitiful Dok Go Jin
is seduced by Gu Ae Jeong, the fox.

161
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,790
They're also scolding you.

162
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,280
Are you sure these are your faithful fans?

163
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:13,390
There are also fake fans.
This is no big deal.

164
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,980
Did Dok Go Jin lose his sexual ability
after the heart surgery,

165
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:19,250
and is feigning a relationship
with Gu Ae Jeong to hide that fact?

166
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,160
I have to sue all those
who wrote this kind of comment!

167
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,280
Don't read anymore too.

168
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,050
It's better to just not read
or listen to their comments.

169
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,950
Gu Ae Jeong, leave a comment there.

170
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,060
Say that it's not true. Quick!

171
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,170
Hey, hey, hey, it's not true, right?

172
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,580
Do you want to self-destruct?

173
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,830
You have to get your senses together, too.

174
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,090
It's just starting,
and you're already reacting like this.

175
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,840
Dokko, you were really cool
on yesterday's show.

176
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,580
As a woman,

177
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,460
although it may feel like
Gu Ae Jeong's quite shameless,

178
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,330
I'm envious of her.

179
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,320
However, as the representative
of the management company,

180
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,750
I think your current situation
is the worst possible.

181
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,130
This is something I've set out to do
even if it means risking everything.

182
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:05,300
All right, I've prepared myself for it,
so just let me know. How bad is it?

183
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:09,290
Of the eighteen advertisements that
came to us, seventeen have been lost.

184
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,400
Which is the loyal one that still remains?

185
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:13,030
An advertisement for moneylenders.

186
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,540
" When you're going through the
lowest point in life, we'll look for you. "

187
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,750
Something along that line.

188
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,430
That one is a money lending advertisement
which you have never thought of doing.

189
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,950
Once my image recovers, those advertisements
will come sticking to me again.

190
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,340
If my next movie becomes a hit,
it'll recover.

191
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,260
There is no next movie.

192
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,090
What?

193
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,480
Even if the Cannes movie is lost,

194
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,000
there are still many other scripts, right?

195
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,270
There isn't any now.

196
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:38,690
Those producers who used to keep
calling me won't answer my calls now.

197
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,110
Dokko,

198
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:43,080
didn't I say that this is
the worst situation ever?

199
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,290
Here.

200
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,030
It's really beautiful.

201
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,010
Ae Jeong, I'll have to
congratulate you now, right?

202
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,080
Unni, I've received a marriage proposal,

203
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,840
and it's from the person I like best.

204
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,950
I don't care about what other people say,

205
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:06,900
but my family has to congratulate me,
that's for sure.

206
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:09,200
Congratulations, my daughter.

207
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,440
Aigoo. It must be a difficult time for you.

208
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,150
Are you all right?

209
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,300
Father, please ask me if I'm happy,

210
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:20,140
since I've received a marriage proposal.

211
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:23,270
Ae Jeong, are you happy?

212
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,240
Yeah, I am happy.

213
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,500
Hap... py.

214
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,950
Ae Jeong, you have to start preparing
for the wedding from scratch now.

215
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,070
No matter what other people say now,

216
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,580
once you two get married,
what can they do?

217
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,450
Ae Jeong unni received a marriage proposal.

218
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,470
They'll probably be holding the
wedding ceremony within this month.

219
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,110
Did you come deliberately
just to tell me that?

220
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,880
Well, you looked quite calm
while watching the program yesterday.

221
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:00,800
I'm telling you all that because I think
you've managed to put away your feelings.

222
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:04,970
I've almost finished putting everything away.
I've started making preparations to leave.

223
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,140
Are you really leaving?

224
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:11,180
I'm also going to start having
activities in China regularly.

225
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,580
You mean you're going to China?

226
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,730
Yes.

227
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,480
I'm in this movie which has
filming locations in China.

228
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,520
Well, since we'll be close by
each other, let's meet up often.

229
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,110
You'll be staying in Beijing, right?

230
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,030
Yes.

231
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,830
The place where I'll be is about
two hours from Beijing by train.

232
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,780
It's really far away.

233
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,800
China is an extremely large country.

234
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,530
Drink this, it'll freshen you up.

235
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,530
We're really sorry that it messed up
the filming of the program.

236
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:51,700
It's not like Gu Ae Jeong committed
a vice like gambling or adultery.

237
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:56,200
To receive a confession from someone
she likes isn't messing up the filming.

238
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,640
Thank you for saying that.

239
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:02,670
I was worried that this incident would
cause her to be fired from this program.

240
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,260
Viewers on the program's
online message board

241
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,230
say that if Ae Jeong is not fired
from the program,

242
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,780
they will not watch this program again.

243
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,320
This is strange.

244
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:13,980
The viewership for Gu Ae Jeong's
segment on the program has doubled.

245
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:16,130
Are they watching her
even as they scold her?

246
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,580
You got fired from the advertisements
and the movie offers,

247
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:26,320
but I'm still able to continue with my
"Searching for Tastes" program. I'm sorry.

248
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,760
You've got to earn
some money on my behalf.

249
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:31,380
Hang in there and persevere
in keeping your work.

250
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,670
I will.

251
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,170
I like that program very much.
I like working with my colleagues,

252
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,390
and getting to meet people
as we head to the market.

253
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,200
The people I meet there
treat me really well.

254
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:46,410
They call me Mat Jang Geum, Mat Jang Geum. *
( * The Taster Jang Geum )

255
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,820
Mat Jjang* Geum? ( * best )
Is she Dae Jang Geum's friend?

256
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,920
"Dae Jang Geum" means "The Great Jang Geum",
a fictional Korean cook and the King's first female physician.

257
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:52,950
You can call her one of the imitations
of Dae Jang Geum* .

258
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,810
The Mat Jang Geum who is better than
Dae Jang Geum in searching for good food.

259
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,990
Oh, Mat Jjwang* Geum.
( *Jjwang is a colloquial expression for "awesome" )

260
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:04,840
The great Mat Jjwang Geum,
please give me an autograph.

261
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,370
All right then.

Is it ok to progress so quickly?

When I first met you,

270
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:43,590
I gave you an autograph without much thought,
and we ended up coming all this way.

271
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,030
Mat Jang Geum,
shouldn't you put aside your worries

272
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,240
and just follow along?

273
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:54,760
Why are you rushing like this?

274
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,900
I studied the public's reactions,

275
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,960
and the most common remark
is they don't think we'll last.

276
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:02,580
To show them we're more serious
than boyfriend and girlfriend.

277
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,430

When you first gave me
your autograph back then,

281
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:19,400
you told me not to hover around
and to go away.

282
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:22,720
Because you didn't go away
but instead, hovered around steadily,

283
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:26,550
congratulations for becoming
Dok Go Jin's wife.

284

Dok Go Jin and Gu Ae Jeong
have registered their marriage.

I thought they wouldn't last long.

294
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:15,140
This is really shocking.

295
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,900
I still cannot believe
that they are getting married...

296
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,800
This is a crazy pairing.

297
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:21,900
I prayed for him every day when he was
about to undergo the heart surgery.

298
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:25,570
I think Gu Ae Jeong and Dok Go Jin
look quite well together.

299
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,540
What do you mean?
He looks better with Kang Se Ri.

Why is it Gu Ae Jeong?

301
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,630
You first revealed the relationship
on the TV talk show.

302
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,220
Now you're even announcing a wedding.

303
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:41,000
Every time you reveal something, the
entire nation falls into a state of panic.

304
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,660
Why are you straining yourself so hard?

305
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,740
Only if I keep on revealing things

306
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,520
will the arrow be directed towards me?

307

about you recently.

I can put up with those scandals and rumors,

310
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:59,210
but I'm really upset that people
are looking down on you.

311
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,670
How can my Dokko be mocked
by elementary school kids?

312
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:06,420
Even if I sued those elementary
school kids, they won't be arrested.

313
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:08,650
Children of that age are rash like that.

314
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,500
While you're going through all these,

If only we could win the role in Director
Kim Ki Wook's new movie and advance to Cannes.

I've read the script for that.

No matter who takes that role,

320
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:25,660
it'll surely be his first step
towards the red carpet at Cannes.

321
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:28,710
Since you're not doing it,
Kim Joon Sung will surely get the role.

00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:49,180
That kind of rumor is bound to happen
once or twice when someone is famous.

343
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:54,860
But there is indeed a video
of Dok Go hyung.

344
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,440
Really?

345
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,850
Have you watched it before?

346
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,850
It's not the kind of video
you are imagining.

347
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,800
- Dok Go Jin's video?
- Look at yourself.

348
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:06,920
It's this kind of curiosity
that gives rise to rumors.

349
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,510
You must have watched a lot of porn.

350
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,400
How interesting.

351
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,670
- Oh gosh!
- It's Dok Go Jin. It's Dok Go Jin.

352
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,150
Oh my!

353
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,420
Why are they together?

354
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,090
She's driving me crazy.

355
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,480
What's wrong with him?

356
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,950
It feels really odd to be together
in such a crowded place.

357
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:38,110
I feel like I have to hide
and conceal myself.

358
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,290
I revealed our relationship
so we could go out like this.

359
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,780
If we can't even do this,
it'll be too unfair.

360
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,640
I am the Dok Go Jin
who does whatever he wants.

361
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:49,070
Oh...

362
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,070
Seriously!

363
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,300
Which movie shall we watch then?

364
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:08,460
[Phungsan Dog]

365
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:11,240
Seems like it's a story about a dog.

366
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,010
I like stories about dogs.
How about this?

367
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,650
Well, the lead character is similar
to a dog in that they both don't speak.

368
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,070
Let's watch this.

369
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,120
[Phungsan Dog]

370
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:33,910
Do they still want to behave
like that despite being scolded?

371
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,010
If it was me, I'd just stay at home.

372
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,990
They're trying to gain attention
by getting their photos taken.

373
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,630
You over there...

374
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,580
Don't listen to them.

375
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:48,200
Since they're doing that so I can hear,
shouldn't I listen?

376
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,650
Don't listen to words that make you upset.

377
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,940
How about listening to me sing "Heartbeat"?

378
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,530
I haven't sung it to you live before.

379
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:59,100
Will you sing it for me?

380
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:02,100
Ok, sing it then.

381
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:10,490
At first, we didn't get along

382
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:16,230
We only fought and frustrated each...

383
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,640
It's ok.

384
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:24,360
It's so strange.

385
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:28,400
Suddenly our hearts connected.

386
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:36,480
When you're not around,
I miss you like crazy.

387
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:39,450
My special someone.

388
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,560
You scared me.

389
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:42,700
Don't hover around here and move away.

390
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,680
You have to be careful
in front of me from now on.

391
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:46,540
I'll just go and...

392
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,860
Do you get it?

393
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:50,810
Dok Go Creep.

394
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,530
It was a fib.

395
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,980
I'm going to call them
and tell them everything.

396
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,930
- Come here!
- What are you doing?

397
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,430
Come over!

398
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,830
I fell in love like I was under hypnosis,

399
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,860
and couldn't control myself
like I had broken down.

400
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:12,410
Even if it ended just like this,
I think I'd still be happy.

401
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,100
That's how great it is.

402
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,530
Gu Ae Jeong...

403
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:19,680
...is the greatest love that I,
Dok Go Jin, have found.

404
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,690
Gu Ae Jeong.

405
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,450
I love you.

406
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:32,080
...and my eyes closed

407
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:39,530
and that you'll act first
to give me a hug.

408
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,370
You sang it well, Gu Ae Jeong.

409
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,810
You should have sung for me sooner.

410
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,140
[Bon Entertainment]

411
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:46,820
Representative Moon,

412
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:50,230
do you remember the CD which Dok Go hyung
entrusted to you before his surgery?

413
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,050
Yes, what about it?

414
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,010
Because of the rumor about his video,

415
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,610
there are a lot of people saying
ridiculous things about it.

416
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,710
I want to show them the video.

417
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,890
Dok Go Jin's video?

418
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:02,630
When said in such a way,
it does sound very exciting.

419
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,370
Among the rumors
surrounding the two of them,

420
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,600
there's also one which says that
they shot a video together.

421
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:08,100
Yeah, that rumor has been floating around.

422
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,290
Dok Go Jin's video.

423
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,340
Please lend me that video.

424
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,410
They must be expecting a porn video

425
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:18,590
so they'll be shocked when what
appears is as innocent as *Pororo.

426
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:18,590
(*A Korean cartoon character)

427
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:24,500
Have you told other people
about the content of the video?

428
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,970
Don't tell them, ok?

429
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:28,750
Ok.

430
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,580
You may leave first.

431
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,840
Thanks for the hard work.

432
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,460
Dok Go Jin's video?

433
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:44,340
It sounds exciting.

434
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,990
It'll succeed.

435
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,710
Dok Go Jin's video?

436
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,800
Is there really such a thing?

437
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:53,320
There's a rumor that you are
in it as well. Are you?

438
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:55,240
What did I film?

439
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:59,580
If we were to select the top three rumors
surrounding Dok Go Jin's video,

440
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:06,440
the first version would be
you co-playing as Sailor Moon.

441
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,140
Dok Go Jin,

442
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:14,040
in the name of love and righteousness,

443
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:17,290
I will not show you any mercy tonight.

444
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,380
That's just my wish!

445
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,020
I like that.

446
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,120
Why am I Sailor Moon?

447
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,890
What else is there?

448
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:34,460
In the second version,
you are holding something.

449
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:36,580
What am I holding?

450
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:40,070
A rope.

451
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:43,830
He's tied up by a rope.

452
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:50,450
Dok Go Jin,

453
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:55,600
I'll tie you up with a rope tonight.
How do you like that?

454
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:58,150
I like that, Gu Ae Jeong.

455
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,680
What are you doing it so softly?
Do it more strongly.

456
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,200
More strongly!

457
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,200
Is Dok Go Jin some sort of pervert?

458
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:14,290
As for the third version,

459
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:17,510
it'll make you even more amazed.

460
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,780
Unni, don't tell me!

461
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:22,390
We never shot anything like that!

462
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:25,230
In any case,

463
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:28,050
the focus is now on Kim Joon Sung,
since he won the best actor award

464
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:30,410
at the International Film Festival.

465
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:33,720
Dok Go Jin must be upset about that.

466
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:34,900
Especially since
he's caught in the video rumor.

467
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:37,030
Why isn't the situation gradually improving?

468
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,050
Instead, bad things just keep happening.

469
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:44,380
They must want to see you completely ruined

470
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:46,800
in order to feel good.

471
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:56,170
I'm here.

472
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,120
Are you watching the TV?

473
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,620
What are you watching?

474
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:03,400
Why did you switch it off?

475
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:05,730
Because it's airing something
I don't want to see.

476
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:27,490
It must be Kim Joon Sung's
award ceremony airing on TV.

477
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:43,620
He seems upset.

478
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,930
Do you want to go for a stroll?

479
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:05,050
Shall we go and get some ingredients
to make kimbap for tomorrow's picnic?

480
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,250
No.

481
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,530
Gu Ae Jeong, cling onto him.

482
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:31,460
What's the matter?

483
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:33,440
Recharge.

484
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:38,330
Aren't you upset
because of Kim Joon Sung?

485
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:40,920
Why would I be upset because of him?

486
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,570
He received a much coveted award,

487
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:47,630
but you're stuck here with me,
getting scolded every day.

488
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:51,230
I'll surely go to Cannes in the future.

489
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:55,710
I'll bring you there too,
and show you how great I am.

490
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,220
Here.

491
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,540
I'm glad that you are still
as conceited as ever.

492
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:12,750
I'm angry. MBS is annoying me.

493
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,630
Why?

494
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:19,720
The program you filmed with that anyone
Oriental physician was just aired on TV.

495
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:21,560
I think they're airing it on purpose.

496
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:23,600
I looked up the program schedules.

497
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:26,280
If you combined the airtime here and
there, it's airing for the entire day.

498
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:28,950
Was the program you were
watching Couple Making?

499
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,500
That's right!

500
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:33,440
Why is it aired so frequently everywhere?

501
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,480
Complain and make them not air it.

502
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:38,070
Sue them for infringing
your portrait rights.

503
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,790
Did you get angry after watching that?

504
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,140
What, are you mocking me?

505
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,960
Why are you so happy for?

506
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:48,800
No, you got jealous because
you like me, so of course I'm happy.

507
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:53,220
I was watching the program,

508
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:55,240
and in order to impress
the Oriental physician,

509
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:57,810
you wore a helmet
and did a really sexy dance.

510
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:00,050
Do that once in front of me.

511
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,320
I don't want to.

512
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:02,730
Why not?

513
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:05,660
I'll lend you the helmet which you said
you wanted to borrow from me that time.

514
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,620
Do it explosively.

515
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:09,830
I don't want to wear the helmet now.

516
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:12,920
Do you want to wear a cap then?

517
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:15,230
The cap you signed on.

518
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,180
When did I sign a cap for you?

519
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,870
I have one.

520
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,510
Here!

521
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,080
I shall now reveal my identity.

522
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:38,200
I was the only person who supported
Gu Ae Jeong in Couple Making.

523
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:41,100
I'm DK1974.

524
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:46,060
I participated regularly
in the popularity polls.

525
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:50,040
That's why I even won such prizes.

526
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:56,820
The popularity polls took place
during the start of Couple Making.

527
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:01,150
Did you like me even then?

528
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:12,620
Gu Ae Jeong.

529
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,350
Shall we put this on and go for a picnic?

530
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,630
To somewhere with great scenery.

531
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,850
All right, let's go somewhere
with great scenery.

532
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,390
Gu Ae Jeong.

533
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,040
I'm saying this since
the atmosphere is becoming better.

534
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:31,880
You didn't have any feelings for that
anyone Oriental physician back then, right?

535
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:32,660
Am I right?

536
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:35,180
It's ok, I won't get angry.

537
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:36,820
I won't get angry.

538
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,910
I won't get angry.

539
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,580
- So?
- Hmm...

540
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,730
A little...

541
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,830
A little what?

542
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,090
I won't get angry.

543
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,240
I won't get angry.

544
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:50,600
I won't get angry about that
anyone Oriental physician.

545
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,670
Are you angry?

546
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,630
I won't get angry.

547
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,670
- Do I look like I'm angry?
- Are you angry?

548
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,950
No, I'm not angry.

549
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:00,420
That anyone Oriental physician.

550
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:03,520
Disappear! That anyone Oriental physician.

551
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,350
It's ok.

552
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:16,890
Yes, I'm on my way
to the filming location.

553
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:21,080
Where is our Mat Jang Geum
heading to today?

554
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:25,040
Do you like buckwheat noodles?

555
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:26,810
Yeah, just bring some back first.

556
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,930
After I've tasted it,

557
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:31,440
I'll comment on our Mat Jang Geum's
capability as a food gourmet.

558
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,260
I'll finish filming
and return around dinner time.

559
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:35,900
Goodbye.

560
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:42,300
Hey, are those potato flowers?

561
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:45,010
Yes, our potato is flowering.

562
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,770
But this is not the season
for potato flowers.

563
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:51,330
No, our potato flower is in full bloom.

564
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,790
Ahjussi, what is the meaning of 'ho gu' ?
( Korean for 'pushover' )

565
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:22,330
What?

566
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:26,270
Everyone is saying that you're a ho gu.

567
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:30,840
Ding Dong, ho gu is short for
*ho rang i mok gu meong.

568
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:30,840
(*Korean for 'tiger's throat')

569
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:34,460
If they get trapped in there,
they'll surely die.

570
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,020
Post this in response to the comment.

571
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:37,450
Ok.

572
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,340
What's the matter?

573
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:54,920
Huh?

574
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:19,040
Gu Ae Jeong.

575
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:20,360
Gu...

576
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:28,190
Dok Go Jin.

577
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:32,960
You must be very shocked.

578
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:34,530
I'm al...

579
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:38,370
Thank goodness.

580
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:40,350
Thank you, Gu Ae Jeong.

581
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,930
Thank you.

582
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,580
My Dokko must have been really worried.

583
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,690
I wasn't just worried.

584
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,750
I thought my heart was going
to burst and I was going to die.

585
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,890
Are you all right?

586
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:59,390
It's thumping too quickly.

587
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,680
Is it?

588
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,010
Quickly try your mind control.

589
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:07,500
Oh, mind control.

590
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,810
I'm all right now.

591
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,040
Those scornful comments...

592
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:40,830
They're posting them again.

593
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,390
I brought some things from home.

594
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,700
Check if there's anything else she'll need.

595
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,090
Got it, wait a moment.

596
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,060
What are you doing?

597
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:19,650
There are some people who keep posting
scornful comments about Ae Jeong.

598
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:22,450
How can they say such things to
a person who just had an accident?

599
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,700
I'll report them to the website

600
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:26,030
and get those comments deleted immediately.

601
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,300
Are they that harsh?

602
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,170
Why are you...?

603
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,960
[What a pity, she could have died.]

604
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:36,080
[Do you think Dok Go Jin is also
regretting it, and wishing that she'd died?]

605
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:39,550
[Why didn't she die?!]

606
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,100
[We could have sent her off at one go
via the accident, what a pity.]

607
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:42,160
[It'd be great if Dok Go Jin
could make a comeback soon.]

608
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:43,310
[I don't like seeing Gu Ae Jeong. Guess she
won't show her face for the time being.]

609
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,600
[Is this heaven's punishment
for stealing Dokko oppa?]

610
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:45,940
[Isn't this the curse from Dok Go Jin's fans?]
[Gu Ae Jeong, just disappear!]

611
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:08,570
I won't put up with it any longer.
Track them all down and sue them.

612
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,850
Even if we tracked them down,

613
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,850
all we'll do is give them a verbal
warning before letting them off.

614
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,760
If we resort to taking
legal action against them,

615
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:16,210
we'll be under fire by the public again.

616
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:18,960
It's better to just let it pass
and not make a fuss.

617
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,220
I won't let it pass!

618
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:24,210
I'll sue them and make them
receive punishment.

619
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,330
What action will Dok Go Jin take
against them?

620
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:35,470
Please let us know.

621
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,430
Please express a stand.

622
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,460
Please give us some information.

623
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:40,990
Please turn towards us.

624
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,850
[Notice of lawsuit]

625
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,870
I'm Shin Bo Yang.

626
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,040
Shin Bo Yang.

627
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:45,950
What's your name?

628
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,690
- I'm Go Mi Gyung.
- Go Mi Gyung.

629
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,660
Was there any basis for what you wrote?

630
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,760
I heard that you work
at a large corporation.

631
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:52,860
Why did you post this kind of comment?

632
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,570
I'm sorry.

633
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:58,700
You've got a good career
and look so refined.

634
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,600
Why did you do such a thing?

635
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,460
Why did you do that?

636
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,680
What's wrong with you?

637
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:02,780
What do you work as?

638
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:04,470
I'm just an office worker.

639
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,990
After tracking them down,

640
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,740
we're even more speechless
about the situation.

641
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:10,700
The ones who kept asking her to die
are actually junior high school students.

642
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:14,440
The one who accused her of unwed
pregnancy is a normal housewife.

643
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:17,480
I read from the news articles that
a few are even university lecturers

644
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:20,250
and employees of large corporations.

645
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,160
Seriously, why did they do it?

646
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:25,320
Do they have some vengeance
against the two of them?

647
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:26,950
[Bon Entertainment]

648
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:30,970
All of them said they wish to meet
with you personally and apologize.

649
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:33,550
They said they won't do it again
and asked that you let them off.

650
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,290
Are you going to sue them?

651
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,040
I understand why you're angry.

652
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,580
You're trying to use this opportunity

653
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:44,060
to put an end to all of this so that
it won't be repeated in the future.

654
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:46,690
But I'm sure you know that's impossible.

655
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:49,900
Why did they do it?

656
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,470
No particular reason.

657
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,990
They said they did it
without giving it a thought.

658
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,660
They said they're sorry.

659
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,430
Just withdraw the lawsuits.

660
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,780
Never.

661
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:06,180
I'll sue them till the very end.

662
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:08,490
I'll continue to sue anyone
who does it in the future, too.

663
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,920
Then, what will happen to the
kind Dok Go Jin people see you as?

664
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:13,940
That's why I'll just be the
righteous Dok Go Jin instead.

665
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:16,200
You're lying here right now.

666
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:18,360
Is this time to worry about image?

667
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,000
Hyungnim!

668
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,800
Erm, more trouble's happened.

669
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:30,470
What again?
What's happened this time?

670
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:34,280
Dok Go Jin's video is the top search phrase.

671
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:38,620
That kind of thing doesn't exist.
This must be another prank.

672
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:42,520
Whether it's real or not, once news of it
spreads, it'll definitely affect them badly.

673
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:46,110
Even when photo-shopped nude photos
of female celebrities get circulated,

674
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,960
those celebrities' image will plunge.

675
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,090
Aigoo, should we try to watch it then?

676
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:55,310
It's widely circulated all over already.

677
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,250
We can watch it right away.

678
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:58,900
Are you going to watch it?

679
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,200
I'm going crazy, seriously.

680
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:04,330
Shall we take a look
at the hot topic for today?

681
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,510
It says Dok Go Jin's video here.

682
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,970
- Where?
- Over here, over here.

683
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:07,650
- Search that phrase.
- Ok.

684
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:10,430
- Search that phrase.
- Dok Go Jin's video.

685
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,040
It says Dok Go Jin's video here.

686
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:15,320
Come quickly.

687
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:18,750
- Dok Go Jin!
- Dok Go Jin?

688
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,030
Have you watched this video?

689
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:20,840
Which one?

690
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:21,800
Where, where?

691
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:23,840
It's all over the internet,
come and watch it quickly!

692
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:26,170
- Dok Go Jin.
- Over here, over here.

693
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,620
What's this?

694
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:31,160
It's the hottest thing right now.

695
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,150
Is that so?

696
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:40,520
What is it about?
Did he really film it?

697
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:43,690
[Dok Go Jin's video]

698
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:53,560
[Dok Go Jin's video]

699
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,800
If this video is made public,

700
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:29,380
the heart surgery most probably has failed,

701
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:31,980
and I'm no longer of this world.

702
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:36,250
To the many of you who loved me,

703
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:38,770
I wish to entrust to you

704
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,970
the person I loved.

705
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:43,470
In a way,

706
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:48,140
I received love from many of you

707
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:50,050
because I, Dok Go Jin,
was very well-managed.

708
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:52,930
On the other hand, the woman I loved

709
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:58,220
was disliked by many of you due
to all sorts of misunderstanding.

710
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:00,280
But if you get to know her,

711
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:03,960
she, Gu Ae Jeong, is a very good woman.

712
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:09,890
Because she'll receive scorn and be
misunderstood no matter what she does,

713
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,840
I'm leaving this as evidence.

714
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:22,680
Dok Go Jin truly loved Gu Ae Jeong.

715
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:28,930
Please watch over her so that
she won't be scorned or misunderstood.

716
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:32,240
I'm asking this favor from all of you.

717
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:56,420
This...

718
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:00,110
I left this just in case something happened.

719
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,910
But the 'just in case' didn't happen,

720
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,160
so why are you watching this?

721
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,910
That's true.

722
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:12,060
Whether you live or die,
you'll still confess your love for me.

723
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:15,440
Just how much do you like me?

724
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:19,510
Know that it's an honor.

725
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:24,330
Don't forget me

726
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:28,630
Even if I only lived for a second

727
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,030
Gu Ae Jeong.

728
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:34,840
I'll be the one and only heart who loves you

729
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:43,990
For that one and only,
I've concealed sorrowful tears and left

730
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:48,360
So please remember me

731
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:49,490
Representative, Representative.

732
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,280
The number of viewers for
Dok Go hyungnim's video has now

733
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:54,260
exceeded a hundred million.

734
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:58,720
It means that many people have seen
Dok Go Jin's real feelings.

735
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:01,600
Many more people must have
heard of it, too.

736
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:03,250
But then...

737
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:07,910
why did talk about Dok Go hyungnim's
video spread so quickly?

738
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:10,030
Isn't it a bit strange?

739
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:12,390
Is it?

740
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:17,530
I catch the smell of oil
being added to fuel the fire.

741
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:21,310
The smell is really strong.

742
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:24,040
Watch me and learn, Kim Jae Seok.

743
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:29,680
Moon Jin Young is the best
image maker in showbiz.

744
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:33,850
Thanks everyone.

745
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:35,280
Since the National Treasure Girls disbanded,

746
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:37,730
this is the first time
we're linked together in good news.

747
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:39,090
There was an article saying that although
the National Treasure Girls have disbanded,

748
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,930
the sense of loyalty, which is as valuable
as a national treasure, has gathered again.

749
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:42,620
Have you read it?

750
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:46,870
Seriously speaking, it was a tough
decision for me to be your bridesmaid.

751
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,240
With me agreeing to be your bridesmaid,

752
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:51,650
you won't be scolded that harshly by fans.

753
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:53,250
- You're right.
- That's right.

754
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:56,310
You did something great, Kang Se Ri.

755
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:00,260
But then, Mi Na,
what made you change your mind

756
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:03,340
and return to Korea to be her bridesmaid?

757
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:05,540
That's the least I should do.

758
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:08,030
Are there a lot of reporters outside?

759
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:11,850
Of course. Dok Go Jin called them,
and the whole bunch of them came.

760
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:12,860
But seriously!

761
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:16,400
Why are all the bridesmaid's
dresses so old fashioned?

762
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:19,670
This looks like what we wore when
we were in National Treasure Girls.

763
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:22,540
Sorry about that.

764
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:24,020
Hey!

765
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:26,850
Shall we meet up occasionally?

766
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:30,020
It'll be fun if we form an informal group!

767
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:33,210
I am a top star.

768
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:34,960
Yeah, you're great.

769
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:39,650
Well, since you rose to the top position
through the National Treasure Girls,

770
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:41,780
I'm also a little proud of you.

771
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:43,620
Of course you should.

772
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:47,090
I was the key member of
the National Treasure Girls.

773
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,730
If you acknowledge that,

774
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:51,240
I'll consider joining your informal group.

775
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,270
Let's have some snacks.

776
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,310
Aigoo. I bought this.

777
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,810
What is it?

778
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,380
Clover.

779
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:00,880
Do you remember?

780
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,040
We have to share the good fortune

781
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:09,290
so that all things good
will happen to us.

782
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:11,820
Here.

783
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:13,970
One, two, three.

784
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,030
It's tasty.

785
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,380
It's really tasty!

786
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:19,140
- It tastes the same as before.
- Yes.

787
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:21,250
It was also tasty back then.

788
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,990
I love this...
Memories from the past are coming back.

789
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:26,210
- You can't eat this.
- Ae Jeong unni, you can't eat it.

790
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,270
What if you can't fit into the gown?

791
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,140
Which gown are you wearing?

792
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:30,660
- Really.
- Definitely you can't.

793
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:33,540
- You won't be able to fit in if you eat this.
- Unni, wear the gown for us to take a look.

794
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:37,380
Gu Ae Jeong,

795
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:38,480
I see you on the news every day.

796
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:40,550
- You're getting married, right?
- Yes.

797
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,560
Aigoo, congratulations.

798
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:43,650
Thank you.

799
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:44,380
Go your way.

800
00:46:44,390 --> 00:46:46,200
Goodbye.

801
00:46:58,150 --> 00:46:59,690
Gu Ae Jeong.

802
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,380
It's been a while.

803
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,200
Seems like your leg is ok now.

804
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:14,920
Yes.

805
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:18,250
This time round, it has healed nicely
without any lingering pain.

806
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,950
I took your advice

807
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,700
and paid more attention to it,
so it healed nicely.

808
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:27,090
I'm glad that it's not
painful for you anymore.

809
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:29,150
It's not painful anymore.

810
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:34,510
I'm glad to see Nina smiling
like this at the end.

811
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:41,420
I'm leaving for my studies
in a few days.

812
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:45,190
Oh... Are you going this time?

813
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,890
I'm not using it as an excuse
or as an escape this time.

814
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:53,010
I'm joining a research institute
which I really want to be a part of.

815
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:58,620
That's a great thing for you since
you find studying easy and enjoyable.

816
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:02,570
I...

817
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:06,320
Can you do me a favor for the last time?

818
00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:15,000
Please press at my Shin Jung* acupoint.

819
00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:15,000
(*In ep. 4, Yoon Pil Joo said pressing
this point helped soothe heartache)

820
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,670
Here?

821
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:46,190
Now, I've really put away all that
had happened and calmed down.

822
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:50,270
Thank you for everything.

823
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,610
Thanks to you,

824
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:55,020
the feeling of my heart racing
as I entered into a really strange world,

825
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:58,030
is now imprinted here.

826
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,840
If I try to take it out sometimes,

827
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:08,090
it'll probably hurt a little.

828
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:12,250
But it'll all be washed away one day.

829
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:19,360
Yoon Pil Joo...

830
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:21,820
I'm really thankful
for your feelings towards me.

831
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:25,410
Hearing those words from you
makes me happy.

832
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:41,730
Said to be the wedding ceremony
of the century,

833
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:43,990
Dok Go Jin and Gu Ae Jeong's wedding
is about to start.

834
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,590
We are now in front of the hotel
where the wedding is being held.

835
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,770
Although the wedding ceremony
is closed to the public,

836
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:51,920
the groom and the bride will come out
and say a few words to their fans

837
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:53,950
before the ceremony starts.

838
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,320
Let's take a look at the wedding gown
that Gu Ae Jeong is wearing

839
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:57,890
at the wedding ceremony of
Dok Go Jin and Gu Ae Jeong,

840
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,980
one of showbiz's most talked-about couple.

841
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:04,300
Contrary to expectations, Gu Ae Jeong
will be wearing a wedding gown

842
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:06,000
designed by a local designer.

843
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:08,830
Let's take a look at the scene right now.

844
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:13,430
Why is it so tiring?

845
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,880
It's draining all my energy
before the wedding ceremony.

846
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:20,670
It was difficult and exhausting
to get to this stage, right?

847
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:24,830
But thanks to my excellent charger,
my battery didn't die,

848
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,710
and I managed to gain energy
to come to this stage.

849
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:29,750
I'll also sing you a song of encouragement.

850
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,650
Shall I also show you a song
of encouragement to give you energy?

851
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:34,950
What?

852
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:38,780
Here, look at this.

853
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:40,420
What is this?

854
00:50:40,770 --> 00:50:44,600
A song of encouragement
from fans around the world.

855
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:46,350
From fans?

856
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:47,400
Yeah.

857
00:50:47,410 --> 00:50:50,310
You're no longer the Gu Ae Jeong who's
disliked by people no matter what you do.

858
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:53,430
There are also many people
sending us their blessings.

859
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:54,840
Gu Ae Jeong.

860
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,080
We conquered it.

861
00:50:57,090 --> 00:50:58,080
Conquered.

862
00:50:58,090 --> 00:50:59,760
You did that well.

863
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,180
Dok Go Jin, Gu Ae Jeong,

864
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:05,730
Congratulations on your marriage.

865
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:07,200
Please be happy.

866
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:09,940
I love the both of you!

867
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:12,030
Congratulations on your marriage.

868
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:13,250
- Hello.
- Be happy.

869
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:15,370
We love you so much.

870
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:18,660
Dok Go Jin, Gu Ae Jeong,

871
00:51:18,670 --> 00:51:21,010
Congratulations.

872
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:22,900
All right, we'll have another
round of shots.

873
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:24,270
Great.

874
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,120
Look here.

875
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:29,920
Please show the hand phone.

876
00:51:31,330 --> 00:51:33,530
Please give another pose.

877
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:34,500
Ok.

878
00:51:34,510 --> 00:51:36,500
Once more.

879
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:37,650
One more.

880
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:39,410
Yes.

881
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:41,090
- Great job.
- Ok.

882
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:43,670
- Thanks for the hard work.
- Thanks for the hard work.

883
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,380
- Thanks for the hard work.
- Thanks for the hard work.

884
00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:48,250
- Thanks for the hard work.
- Thanks for the hard work.

885
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:59,040
Hyungnim, you looked really cool today.

886
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:02,390
Don't say such unnecessary things...
Thank you!

887
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:07,220
Hyungnim, Ginny said
she wants to buy you dinner.

888
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,400
I'm going back first.

889
00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:15,870
You take my place and enjoy dinner.

890
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:17,830
We can leave together.
Are you in a rush?

891
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:20,500
Yeah, I'm rushing to do
something very urgent.

892
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:22,250
You poor youth.

893
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:42,800
Ok.

894
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,040
Ah, is that Dok Go Jin?

895
00:53:20,050 --> 00:53:21,070
It's Dok Go Jin.

896
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:22,200
Dok Go Jin, Dok Go Jin!

897
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:24,810
Please look here!

898
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:27,240
Excuse me, please look here!

899
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:48,430
Because of you my chest,

900
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,620
my heart goes "thump"...

901
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:53,070
Hello, Director?

902
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:55,910
Yes, I've looked at the script.

903
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,540
Yes, I'm going to the studio now.

904
00:53:57,550 --> 00:53:58,910
Ok.

905
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:16,010
I'm going for a shoot.

906
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:17,810
I might be back late.

907
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:20,410
Ok?

908
00:55:17,970 --> 00:55:20,380
The image that Dokko needs right now

909
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:24,310
is the image of a warm,
approachable family-oriented man.

910
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:28,240
So look for a way to build up that image.

911
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:30,140
Ok, we got it.

912
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:31,300
Representative,

913
00:55:31,310 --> 00:55:34,310
I heard that one of cable programs on
infant care is looking for a new host.

914
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:36,400
It'll be great if Ae Jeong noonim
gets that role.

915
00:55:36,410 --> 00:55:38,790
Good! We have to catch hold
of this opportunity.

916
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:41,270
Manager Kim Jae Seok, great job.

917
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:45,090
Ma-Manager?

918
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:46,490
Yes.

919
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:48,410
Manager Kim.

920
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:51,230
Ma-Manager?

921
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:52,520
You...

922
00:55:52,530 --> 00:55:54,170
You mean me?

923
00:55:55,010 --> 00:55:56,770
Oh! Thank you, Representative!

924
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:58,370
Thank you!

925
00:56:02,550 --> 00:56:04,980
I'm Manager Kim, I'm Manager Kim!

926
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:08,030
You're so dead.

927
00:56:12,850 --> 00:56:13,780
Cheers!

928
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:15,430
Thank you.

929
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:21,010
Jae Seok, congratulations.

930
00:56:21,870 --> 00:56:24,970
In that case, you'll be able
to talent scout fresh faces,

931
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:27,170
and do things like venture into Japan?

932
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:28,950
I guess I'll slowly take over those roles.

933
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,450
There's still a long way to go
before you get to do those things.

934
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:33,780
I was a manager when
I joined this management company.

935
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:35,910
But up till now, I've only been tasked
with handling Ae Jeong's schedule.

936
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:38,560
Our work experience is different.

937
00:56:38,570 --> 00:56:39,850
I passed through the official interviews

938
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:41,360
and entered the company
as an official employee.

939
00:56:41,370 --> 00:56:42,720
But you?

940
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:45,960
You pulled strings to enter.

941
00:56:48,330 --> 00:56:51,590
Although I pulled strings, I still
have greater influence in the company.

942
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:55,100
Do you know that the management company
is controlled by Dok Go Jin?

943
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:56,500
Dok Go Jin is my brother-in-law.

944
00:56:56,510 --> 00:56:59,430
If you want to put it that way,
I have influence too.

945
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,860
Other than Representative Moon,

946
00:57:00,870 --> 00:57:04,020
the person whom Dokko hyungnim
trusts most is...

947
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:06,190
me.

948
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:07,930
Hey.

949
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:10,160
Jae Seok.

950
00:57:10,170 --> 00:57:12,220
Do you actually think that the
second-in-command at the company is you?

951
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:17,170
In the future, please call me Manager Kim.

952
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:19,300
Manager Gu.

953
00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:27,130
Why are the two of you
fighting over this?

954
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:29,630
Just act like how you usually do.

955
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:31,490
Fight over me.

956
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:32,440
- Over me.
- Stay out of this!

957
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:34,540
Noona, stay out of this!

958
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:47,120
Doctor, do you have a girlfriend?

959
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,150
I don't.

960
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:53,040
My God, how old are you this year?

961
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:56,540
I think you're just the person
for my daughter.

962
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:02,000
[Resume]

963
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:06,170
What is this?

964
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:08,320
Many people asked me about it,
so I've prepared this in advance.

965
00:58:08,930 --> 00:58:11,470
Fill in your daughter's details
at the back of this,

966
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:13,470
and send it to this address.

967
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:16,550
My mother will contact you
within a week.

968
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,540
But... This...

969
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:20,650
I am going to start with the acupuncture.

970
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:23,590
Please don't talk. Here.

971
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,100
She's so pretty.

972
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:27,150
Unni, you're so pretty.

973
00:58:29,470 --> 00:58:31,840
Unni, you're really pretty.

974
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:33,680
I'll always support you.

975
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:34,410
Thank you.

976
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:35,650
Thank you.

977
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:37,440
- Hello.
- Hello.

978
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:38,740
What is your name?

979
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:40,780
Noona, you're really pretty.

980
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:45,200
One, two, three.

981
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:46,730
Thank you.

982
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:48,770
Goodbye.

983
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:58,810
The Kong Jin Pills haven't been
selling well recently, have they?

984
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:00,280
Yes.

985
00:59:00,690 --> 00:59:02,660
We can't let this continue.

986
00:59:02,670 --> 00:59:05,550
I've got to gather more friends
and promote it to them.

987
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:09,290
My God, Dok Go Jin's
father-in-law is here.

988
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:11,270
I came to confirm something.

989
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,270
Confirm what?

990
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:15,760
I heard rumors saying that my son-in-law
ate medicine from your hospital

991
00:59:15,770 --> 00:59:18,040
and had my granddaughter.

992
00:59:18,050 --> 00:59:20,300
Did you spread this rumor?

993
00:59:20,310 --> 00:59:24,470
No, I mean, the herbal soup
I gave them for free the last time,

994
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,080
didn't they say that it was effective?

995
00:59:26,090 --> 00:59:28,080
They said that
it was effective in curing colds.

996
00:59:28,090 --> 00:59:30,040
Did they say that it was effective
in other areas?

997
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:32,810
Please don't spread
this kind of rumor again.

998
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:33,940
Ok?

999
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:36,880
If it spoils my daughter
and my son-in-law's image,

1000
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:41,260
I'll sue you for doing that!

1001
00:59:44,510 --> 00:59:45,650
Seriously!

1002
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:49,310
Why is he so arrogant that
he has a top star as son-in-law?

1003
00:59:49,450 --> 00:59:53,300
Don't attend to that person or give
him free herbal soup in the future!

1004
00:59:53,830 --> 00:59:55,250
I heard that Kang Se Ri comes here often.

1005
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:56,500
Give it to Kang Se Ri. Kang Se Ri.

1006
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:58,790
Give Kang Se Ri a lot of the herbal soup!

1007
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,130
Ok.

1008
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:16,930
Unni, hiking the first thing
in the morning

1009
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:19,200
is really killing my legs.

1010
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:24,040
Will Yoon Pil Joo really come here?

1011
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:26,750
I confirmed it
with the staff at the hospital.

1012
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:30,870
Hey, if we just stand here,
it'll be obvious what we're up to.

1013
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,560
Let's go up there before we descend.

1014
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:34,020
Hurry, hurry.

1015
01:00:49,510 --> 01:00:51,250
He's here!

1016
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:53,040
Where?

1017
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:54,480
Aigoo.

1018
01:00:58,380 --> 01:00:59,890
What should I do?

1019
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:00,850
Let's go down.

1020
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:05,280
No, if I start to descend,
I can't hike up with him.

1021
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:09,450
Unni, he's heading that way.

1022
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:34,310
Are you ok?

1023
01:01:34,910 --> 01:01:37,670
I saw you heading
in that direction just now.

1024
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,360
Did you run all the way here?

1025
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:43,770
Of course you'll fall if you
ran on the mountain slope.

1026
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:45,670
You saw it all?

1027
01:01:46,190 --> 01:01:48,100
So you saw me standing there

1028
01:01:48,110 --> 01:01:50,270
and headed this way
to avoid me deliberately?

1029
01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:52,630
Hold my hand.

1030
01:01:56,410 --> 01:02:00,210
This route is steep and rough,
so it's not easy to climb up.

1031
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:02,250
Do you still want to go by this route?

1032
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:05,040
Yes, I want to.

1033
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:13,280
Isn't it beautiful?

1034
01:02:13,290 --> 01:02:14,780
It's really beautiful.

1035
01:02:14,790 --> 01:02:17,750
Yoon Pil Joo, I brought
a portable gas stove and pan.

1036
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,060
Let's have some ramyun here.

1037
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:22,250
We're not allowed to cook
on the mountain.

1038
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:25,110
Let's just descend and cook it
somewhere else. All right?

1039
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:34,060
The scenery is really beautiful.

1040
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:38,370
I'm so happy to have come
to such a place with you.

1041
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:46,700
What is this?

1042
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:51,560
What is this?

1043
01:02:51,570 --> 01:02:53,320
Read it, this.

1044
01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:56,270
What is this?

1045
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:58,520
Shi Hyun, Shi Hyun,
repeat after me, repeat after me.

1046
01:02:58,530 --> 01:03:00,400
Goldfish, goldfish.

1047
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:08,720
Uncle, I think
Dok Go Shi Hyun is a fool.

1048
01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:11,650
She can't say a single word.

1049
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:16,130
Ding Dong, the intellect of a baby
who is only ten months old

1050
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:19,360
cannot be measured using
that kind of picture flip cards.

1051
01:03:19,370 --> 01:03:21,230
Look at me.

1052
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,280
(Baby talk) Ga ga.

1053
01:03:28,450 --> 01:03:31,060
(Baby talk) Bu dik gu bi di di
di dik di dik...

1054
01:03:31,070 --> 01:03:31,820
(Baby talk) Gu gu...

1055
01:03:31,830 --> 01:03:32,920
Aigoo.

1056
01:03:32,930 --> 01:03:35,680
See? She's a genius. She's normal.

1057
01:03:35,690 --> 01:03:38,150
Hyung Gyu, drink a glass of milk.

1058
01:03:42,550 --> 01:03:44,800
Here. Drink a glass.

1059
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:52,580
- Oh, it's the milk Uncle endorses.
- [Korean Milk]

1060
01:03:52,590 --> 01:03:55,770
My friends only drink that milk every day.

1061
01:03:55,780 --> 01:03:57,110
Is that so?

1062
01:03:57,120 --> 01:04:02,210
I'll send you a few boxes of the milk,
and sign my autograph on the photo label.

1063
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:02,960
Distribute them.

1064
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:03,720
Ok.

1065
01:04:03,730 --> 01:04:04,950
Whenever your face is printed
on a merchandise,

1066
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,450
it has the same marketing effect as launching
an extensive advertisement campaign.

1067
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:10,160
Of course. I am Dok Go Jin.

1068
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:12,150
My body is so perfect from head to toe,

1069
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:14,130
such that I'm the number one married man
whom women want to steal away.

1070
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:16,780
I also top the ranking for fathers
who are helpless towards their daughters.

1071
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:21,440
You really drive me crazy
whenever you open your mouth.

1072
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:23,600
The perfect Dok Gok Jin,

1073
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:25,640
did you see the article
talking about us in the newspaper?

1074
01:04:25,650 --> 01:04:27,270
What did they write about again?

1075
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:30,500
That we're facing marital discord?
That we're getting a divorce?

1076
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:34,450
That we're getting a separation.

1077
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:36,680
[Dok Go Jin and Gu Ae Jeong
in the midst of a separation?]

1078
01:04:35,490 --> 01:04:38,770
Didn't you stay at a hotel at the city's
outskirts while filming your new movie?

1079
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:41,730
They wrote that we've already
separated for three months.

1080
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:43,950
We'll have to go for a picnic again.

1081
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:46,080
We have to appear in front of many people,

1082
01:04:46,190 --> 01:04:49,020
and show ourselves to them.

1083
01:04:49,180 --> 01:04:51,410
I think a picnic might be too weak.

1084
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:54,730
In that case, what would be better?

1085
01:04:55,290 --> 01:04:58,710
Celebrities with a lot of children

1086
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:00,220
seem to have been better received
by the public recently.

1087
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:02,800
Oh, ding dong!

1088
01:05:02,810 --> 01:05:07,990
Gu Ae Jeong, let's start
on managing our image right away.

1089
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:13,170
Then I'll have to recharge
your battery to full.

1090
01:05:14,770 --> 01:05:16,430
Recharge.

1091
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:18,410
In the process of recharging.

1092
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:19,830
Fully charged!

1096

Shi Hyun!

1097
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:32,500
Aigoo, aigoo.
Father and Mother are here.

1098
01:05:32,510 --> 01:05:34,120
Look at me, look at me.

1099
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:35,340
Shi Hyun! Shi Hyun!

1100
01:05:35,350 --> 01:05:38,250
(Baby talk) Bang bang bang bang bang...

1101
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:40,550
- I'll carry her.
- Shi Hyun, Father's going to carry you.

1102
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:42,870
- All right, your father will do that.
- I'll do that.

1103
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:50,910
Know that it's an honor
to have watched such a drama.

1104
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:51,900
Conquered!

1105
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:53,790
- Conquered!
- Conquered!

1106
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:54,980
Shi Hyun.

1107
01:05:54,990 --> 01:05:56,500
Conquered!

1108
01:05:56,510 --> 01:05:58,930
Thank you to all who loved and
supported The Greatest Love.
