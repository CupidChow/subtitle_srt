1
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:13,950
The thing you want to know...
It's about my heart, isn't it?

2
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:15,850
Yes.

3
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,460
Regarding your heart,

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,560
Miss Gu Ae Jeong still
doesn't know anything, right?

5
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,960
Please tell me honestly.

6
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:33,170
Isn't there a possibility that you'll die?

7
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,270
Then let me answer you honestly.

8
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,070
There's also a possibility that I'll live.

9
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,780
And let me tell you another thing.

10
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,680
If you tell Gu Ae Jeong about this,

11
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,080
you, the "just anyone" doctor

12
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,890
are sure to die.

13
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,110
Ae Jeong eonni.
(Eonni - Older sister)

14
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,010
Mi Na.

15
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,820
Eonni.

16
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,020
Save me.

17
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:36,830
<i>You've changed your name to Han Hye Jin.</i>

18
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,030
<i>Why did you even change your name</i>

19
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,240
<i>and keep low, quietly living your life?</i>

20
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,040
<i>I just want to completely leave the past behind.</i>

21
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,240
<i>Because I have completely
left the entertainment industry.</i>

22
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,640
<i>The thing with this line of work is that</i>

23
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,550
<i>you may have left, but
you'll stay in people's memories.</i>

24
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:57,150
<i>So you can never completely leave it behind.</i>

25
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,350
<i>If something happens to Han Hye Jin right now,</i>

26
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,550
<i>it'll surely appear in tomorrow morning's newspaper</i>

27
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,060
<i>with National Treasure Girl Han Mi Na's name.</i>

28
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,860
<i>What's the reason you wanted to see me?</i>

29
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,760
<i>I want to know,
when National Treasure Girls disbanded,</i>

30
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,960
<i>what happened with Gu Ae Jeong.</i>

31
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,070
<i>That's why I wanted to meet you.</i>

32
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,370
<i>Slapping Kang Se Ri,</i>

33
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,370
<i>if you guys had explained it and then reconciled,</i>

34
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,270
<i>you wouldn't have needed to disband, right?</i>

35
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:25,180
<i>But, then what was the reason that you guys had to disband?</i>

36
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,180
<i>I've already forgotten about matters of the past.</i>

37
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,390
<i>You always
stuck together with Gu Ae Jeong,</i>

38
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,290
<i>so shouldn't you know?</i>

39
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,790
<i>I don't know anything.</i>

40
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,490
<i>What exactly is Gu Ae Jeong hiding?</i>

41
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,290
<i>There's a man backing her right?</i>

42
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,000
<i>Ae Jeong eonni is not that kind of person.</i>

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,300
<i>Then, was there a problem with Han Mi Na?</i>

44
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,010
<i>Even if you've left for 10 years,</i>

45
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:55,510
<i>with just 1 report,
you'll immediately be back in the spotlight.</i>

46
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,810
<i>If you wish to continue
living this quiet life of yours,</i>

47
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:59,310
<i>then tell me what you know.</i>

48
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,720
<i>What exactly is Gu Ae Jeong hiding?</i>

49
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:06,620
<i>Because of your friendship with her,
you can't tell me?</i>

50
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:14,430
<i>Then, go take a look at your
husband's and child's faces. We'll talk again.</i>

51
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,430
Just like 10 years ago,

52
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:21,440
when you didn't tell anyone about my matter,

53
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,640
you'll protect me this time too, right?

54
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,440
But, Mi Na...

55
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,040
I also have something I want to hold unto.

56
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:35,850
I'm really sorry about
hiding behind you like a coward again.

57
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:41,860
But I...
I'm really happy now.

58
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,860
I don't want to destroy it
but to protect it.

59
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,660
I beg you, please help me.

60
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,170
I wish I'm a superwoman.

61
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,770
So that I can protect everyone.

62
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:15,690
I want to escape from all of these, too.

63
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:22,600
It's driving me crazy...

64
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,530
Mr. Dok Go Jin.

65
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,530
No matter how long I waited,
you didn't come to rescue me.

66
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,830
So I came down by myself.

67
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,440
You should feel honored.

68
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,540
Hearing you say this,

69
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,940
it seems like my "become kindhearted"
incantation had no effect at all.

70
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,940
The thing that has an  effect on me is your song.

71
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,040
Come.

72
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,350
Sing the "Thump Thump" song for me.

73
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:15,250
I don't want to sing that song ever again.

74
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:20,750
This time, I want to leave the
"Thump Thump" National Treasure Girls image behind.

75
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,660
I... am going to release a new song.

76
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,260
Is that so?

77
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,860
If it's not "Thump Thump",
what will it be?

78
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,170
Oh, is it woo lung woo lung,
kong dak kong dak?

79
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,170
It's not like that.

80
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,870
It's a ballad,
ballad.

81
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,870
Do you want to listen to it?

82
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:51,890
Wow, this singer...
sings really well.

83
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,090
I know, right?

84
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:57,090
She's just a demo singer,
yet she sings so well.

85
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:00,790
Asking me to sing this song,
I'll only be insulted.

86
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,500
It's all right.

87
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,300
Because you're

88
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,000
a singer who didn't
get famous for her singing, right?

89
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,800
How did you know?

90
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm a beauty who won with my looks and body.

91
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,410
Beauty?

92
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,510
Based on what?

93
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:17,110
I'm someone who is liked
by everyone from head to toe.

94
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,610
My body was called a national treasure.

95
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,420
Didn't you like me because I'm beautiful?

96
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:25,620
Forget it.
I'd rather not see.

97
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,720
Aigoo.
(Aigoo - Oh Dear, Oh My God)

98
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,430
Just stay still.

99
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:41,030
I've gone too long without charging,
so I've no strength.

100
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,540
Mr. Dok Go Jin, if you're broken here,

101
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,140
and that's why it's always going thump thump,

102
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,950
then shouldn't it be safe to say,
that your eyes are also broken?

103
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,950
For saying that I'm the most beautiful,
your mouth is also broken.

104
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:56,050
That's why you have to say
I'm the most beautiful, right?

105
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:00,150
Only then would being with someone broken have meaning.

106
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:05,560
Yes, I'm broken.

107
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,360
<i>Gu Ae Jeong will be hurt.</i>

108
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:15,670
<i>Haven't you thought "what if something happens"?</i>

109
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:22,780
<i>So what you're saying is,
I should back out because I care for her?</i>

110
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,880
<i>That way I'll hurt her less,</i>

111
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,980
<i>and it wouldn't be as heartbreaking.</i>

112
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,580
<i>The less hurt she is,
the faster she'll recover.</i>

113
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,590
<i>Oriental doctor, I'm too famous.</i>

114
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:35,190
<i>I cannot quietly disappear without hurting her.</i>

115
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,990
<i>In case something happens to me,
I'll surely die spectacularly.</i>

116
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,990
<i>Even after I die,
I will not be easily forgotten.</i>

117
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:46,300
<i>Why? Because
through the image I leave behind,</i>

118
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,500
<i>I'll continue to hurt her.</i>

119
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,610
<i>Are you saying she might never forget?</i>

120
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:01,620
Gu Ae Jeong.

121
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,620
My eyes are broken,
so you're the most beautiful in my eyes.

122
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:09,720
My mouth is also broken,
so I'm able to blurt out such nonsense.

123
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,730
I adore you to death!

124
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:18,230
Did you spill some oil because you're broken?

125
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,330
It's so greasy,

126
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:23,140
I feel like I'm about to slip.

127
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:28,340
Since I'm already greasy anyway,
should we light a fire?

128
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,440
Should we?

129
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,350
Should we play with fire,

130
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,350
or should we just detonate the bomb instead?

131
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,650
What's gotten into you?

132
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,850
I'd better not.

133
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:46,160
I cannot take responsibility for you until the end.

134
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,560
I have to protect you.

135
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,670
There's nothing to protect.

136
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:55,870
I will definitely protect you.

137
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,700
Mr. Dok Go Jin.

138
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,800
What?

139
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:32,110
Once you're fixed,
you can just leave anytime you want.

140
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,910
I won't grab unto you.

141
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:42,520
If one day I come to my senses,
and ask you to let me go,

142
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:46,320
you must let me go, too.

143
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:55,730
Pinky promise.
Let's pinky promise.

144
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:17,150
Okay. Even if I leave you,

145
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:22,360
don't be hurt and just leave my side.

146
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,260
You must endure it.

147
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:32,930
<i>Are you saying she might never forget?</i>

148
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:37,230
<i>So what I can do,</i>

149
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,230
<i>is not to hurt her less,</i>

150
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,440
<i>but to give her more
love for her to overcome it.</i>

151
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,740
<i>So I have to seize every minute,
every second and be by her side.</i>

152
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:48,840
<i>Even if it's just for another
minute or second, I have to be with her.</i>

153
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:54,150
<i>This might be all the time I have left.</i>

154
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,650
<i>So just let go.</i>

155
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,250
<i>Is that a threat?</i>

156
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,750
<i>Compared to threatening,
begging will be more effective on you,</i>

157
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,760
<i>I can beg.</i>

158
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,160
<i>I do not have the
time to worry about my pride.</i>

159
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,760
<i>For me,</i>

160
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,260
<i>time is running out.</i>

161
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:27,280
About last time,
I'm sorry.

162
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,580
It's nothing.

163
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,990
You were right.

164
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:35,490
I really thought I was.

165
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,490
Where did you just come from?

166
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:43,200
I feel like I came from another dimension.

167
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,100
Another dimension?

168
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:49,000
Do you know the comic
"Paul's Miraculous Adventure"?

169
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,910
Comic?
Why did you you suddenly mention a comic?

170
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,710
It's about a boy named Paul

171
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:59,810
and how he rescued Nina from
the evil king of a strange land.

172
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:03,720
He sat in a magic car,
and even brought along a helper.

173
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,920
Don't you know about it?

174
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,420
I think I've seen it before.

175
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,730
Wanting to save Nina,
who was crying,

176
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,630
Paul bravely ran to her side.

177
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:18,430
But his timing was always wrong,

178
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,640
and the evil king captured Nina.

179
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,240
All little children's comics are like that.

180
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,340
If he saves Nina,
the story is over.

181
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:30,140
But there was this one time,
when Paul managed to grab unto her hand,

182
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,250
and finally rescued her.

183
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:39,150
But Nina said the evil king is too pitiful
so she let go of Paul's hand.

184
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:43,460
So she left him and went back to the strange dimension.

185
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,460
She is such a strange girl.

186
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:53,770
Even if Paul goes to the
evil king and asks him to let Nina go,

187
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:56,470
Nina said she's very happy there right now,

188
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:00,470
and doesn't need anyone to save her.

189
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:07,180
Paul should not have returned to that strange
dimension and attempted to save Nina, right?

190
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:12,990
Even if he continued to try to save Nina,

191
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:19,990
Paul would really become a strange guy, right?

192
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,200
Are you Paul from the story?

193
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,810
You want to run and save
Gu Ae Jeong, who is with Dok Go Jin.

194
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:38,310
Then, who am I?

195
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,610
Miss Kang Se Ri?

196
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,820
A mushroom fairy.

197
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:50,120
She used to work for the evil King
but became close to Paul later on.

198
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:55,230
Did they really became close?

199
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,730
Yes.

200
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:15,350
Because of personal reasons,
Mr. Yun Pil Ju decided to end the program?

201
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:19,450
Yes. He said he wants
to end it after the next filming.

202
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:21,660
<i>Can't you persuade him?</i>

203
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,560
The program is getting such good ratings.

204
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,960
Honestly, if this program continues,
it'll be good for you too.

205
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,860
<i>That's right.</i>

206
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,060
I'm really sorry,

207
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,970
but I also want to end the program.

208
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,070
What?

209
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:39,970
I think Mr. Yun Pil Ju was trying to spare me.
That's why he said it was his problem.

210
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:43,280
Actually, I was the first one to suggest ending the program.

211
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,680
Why would you...?

212
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,280
I heard Mr. Yun Pil Ju's family oppose the two of you dating.

213
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,080
Is it because of this?

214
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:54,390
It's not because of him.
It's all because of me.

215
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,390
I can't go on.

216
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,390
<i>I'm really sorry.</i>

217
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:04,300
Then, have things ended between you and Mr. Yun Pil Ju?

218
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,700
Yes.

219
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,200
For the final shooting,
I'll try not to shock him too much.

220
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,200
It must have a good ending.

221
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:23,020
This guy should really...

222
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,020
Don't mind him.
Let's go.

223
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:33,230
You've met Mi Na?

224
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:38,130
"When National Treasure Girls disbanded,
what exactly happened with Gu Ae Jeong?"

225
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:41,330
Her face immediately turned pale,
and she couldn't say a word.

226
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:43,640
Mi Na and Ae Jeong eonni are really close,

227
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,040
so she won't easily say anything.

228
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,840
If it gets her into trouble,
and if she wants to protect everything,

229
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,440
then she'll speak.

230
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:58,150
But... if you're going to mess with Ae Jeong eonni,

231
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:01,860
you wouldn't get me involved too, right?

232
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:07,360
About that...
if Han Mi Na appears,

233
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,360
then you'll be involved no matter what.

234
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:14,570
If anyone discovers that you got slapped
by Gu Ae Jeong because you wronged Han Mi Na,

235
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:17,370
you'll be in trouble.

236
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,170
Don't bring me into this matter.

237
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:22,780
Then, when we drop the news about Gu Ae Jeong,

238
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:25,380
you'll just have to say one thing.

239
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,180
For example...

240
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:33,990
That the reason you broke up
with Dok Go Jin was because of Gu Ae Jeong.

241
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,090
Something like that.

242
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:38,790
Don't tell me you want
to bring Dok Go Jin into this too?

243
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:41,290
Precisely because I cannot touch him,

244
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,600
that's why I need you to do it.

245
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,700
Just like that.

246
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:54,010
When I've settled it with Han Mi Na,
I'll let you know.

247
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:07,120
I only wanted to find something
to talk about with Yun Pil Ju.

248
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,630
My friend has an appointment today, right?

249
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:12,830
What to do?

250
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,930
That patient canceled her appointment today.

251
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,130
I have to meet her to talk about something important.

252
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:22,040
Can you give me her phone number?

253
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,440
- She's doesn't have a contact number.
- What?

254
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,640
I wanted to call her for her next appointment,

255
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,940
but it was a disconnected number.

256
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,740
I'm sorry.

257
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:38,450
After she met Manager Jang,
she disconnected her number?

258
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,360
Miss Kang Se Ri, right?

259
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,060
Yes.

260
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,960
I'm Dr. Yun's mother.

261
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:55,070
Omo, are you?
Hello.
(Omo - Oh My)

262
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,170
Shall we get a cup of tea?

263
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,170
Sure!

264
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:06,280
After Dr. Yun is done with his shooting,
you're still welcome to come here.

265
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,180
For skin care.

266
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,490
I'll give you a discount,
so help me promote it.

267
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,690
Okay.

268
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:20,990
I just hope that after the shooting,
he won't be affected too much.

269
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:24,600
Just thinking about
how he's under Gu Ae Jeong's spell

270
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,600
really ticks me off.

271
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,810
Actually, there are some faults on our side too.

272
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:34,110
If we had known that
Ae Jeong eonni had a boyfriend,

273
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:36,910
then we wouldn't have asked
Mr. Yun Pil Ju to participate in the program.

274
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,610
What?

275
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:42,120
Gu Ae Jeong is already dating another guy?

276
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,620
Yet she still appeared
on the matchmaking program,

277
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,320
and even accepted Pil Ju's flowers?

278
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,820
She really did that?

279
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:53,030
I'm so sorry. We didn't look into it properly at the beginning.

280
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:57,130
Ae Jeong eonni's boyfriend is also a celebrity.
That's why she couldn't announce it.

281
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:00,830
A celebrity?

282
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:04,540
I've said things I shouldn't have.

283
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:07,840
Just pretend as if you
never heard all these okay, auntie?

284
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,950
Isn't this Gu Ae Jeong a little too much?

285
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:12,850
Yes, yes.

286
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:18,250
Why is she still on a matchmaking show
if she already has a boyfriend?

287
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:22,360
We're really sorry.
We didn't know about this either.

288
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,560
<i>Please calm down.</i>

289
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:29,460
The ratings for Yun Pil Ju and Gu Ae Jeong
true love documentaries weren't bad, right?

290
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,260
Why did they suddenly stop filming?

291
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:35,670
They said that it was recorded
before the start of a new season,

292
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:39,570
but because the cast was already selected,
they will stop filming.

293
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,270
<i>Gu Ae Jeong already has a boyfriend!</i>

294
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,980
<i>And this will be aired on TV!</i>

295
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:46,180
About the detailed cast list,
I'll include it in the report and send it to you.

296
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,580
She already has a boyfriend!

297
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:52,290
How can she be on this program
and still be looking for a boyfriend?

298
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:55,890
I'm really ashamed on her behalf!

299
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:56,890
<i>What is the meaning of this?</i>

300
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,990
<i>How did such a thing happen?</i>

301
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,100
Hello.

302
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,900
I'm Reporter Hwang Da Gyeong
from Entertainment Weekly.

303
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,110
- Reporter?
- Yes.

304
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:17,010
You're the mother of Couple Making's
perfect man Mr. Yun Pil Ju, right?

305
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:18,510
Yes, that's me.

306
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:21,820
Recently, everyone has been very interested
in the perfect man's mother.

307
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,620
Will you accept our interview?

308
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,320
Interview?

309
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,720
Then, I'll appear in the news?

310
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,320
Yes.

311
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,330
Can you talk about how
you raised such a perfect son?

312
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:36,830
If you could talk a little about the behind-the-scene story
of the program, that'd be better.

313
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:40,430
There's something I'm unhappy about right now.

314
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:44,340
If it's such a thing,
would you guys write about it?

315
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,040
Of course.

316
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,840
Is this your shirt?

317
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,350
Red shirt.

318
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,950
Correct!
Yes.

319
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,450
The last question.

320
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:58,550
Is this your shirt?

321
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:01,250
Thank you for tutoring me, ajussi.

322
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,560
Seeing your huge backlog of homework,

323
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,060
I'm afraid you won't be able to go on the picnic.
That's why I'm helping you.

324
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:08,360
Then, can I also come along for the picnic?

325
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,960
Right, your aunt and I are going on a picnic

326
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,970
and I'm letting you come along
to act as a fire extinguisher.

327
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:15,170
It's a pity,
but a fire cannot break out.

328
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,570
Okay.

329
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:18,970
Although I'm letting you act as a fire extinguisher,

330
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,970
but during some important moments,

331
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:22,480
when you see my cue,
you'll have to avoid us.

332
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,680
What are important moments?

333
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:33,090
Asking a 7-year-old to look for a cue,
it really is too difficult.

334
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:36,590
Ah, I'll give you a signal.

335
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,390
When I say

336
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:41,800
"Ding Dong, you understand, right?"
and then I do this gesture,

337
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,500
you'll have to avoid us for a while.

338
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,600
Okay.

339
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,400
Ding Dong,
you understand, right?

340
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,110
Are you in?

341
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,320
=Yes=

342
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,120
Where?

343
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,120
=On your right,
I see both of you.=

344
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,720
Oh, I see you,
I see you.

345
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:19,130
Isn't Gu Ae Jeong a little too obvious?

346
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:20,230
We can't be discovered.

347
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:21,640
You're right.

348
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,740
Hey, Ding Dong.

349
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,450
Well, we'll start passing information.

350
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,550
What do you want to drink?

351
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,560
I'll just order as I wish then.

352
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,460
Hello, customer.

353
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,960
Two cups of iced coffee,

354
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,560
a cup of coffee.

355
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,960
and a glass of iced cocoa.

356
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,860
The total is 19 000 Won.

357
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,770
=I've bought it.=

358
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:53,870
Where did Mr. Jae Seok go?

359
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:55,770
He went to the washroom
because of a stomach ache.

360
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,770
I'll buy you a hot dog.

361
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:01,380
=Okay, hot dog.=

362
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,980
Two plain, one with mustard.

363
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:09,980
Let's go.

364
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,080
Thank you.

365
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,190
Gu Ae Jeong,
I'm dying of hunger.

366
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:16,590
Give me the hot dog.

367
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,290
I'll pass it to you.
Wait a minute.

368
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:18,690
Hyeong Kyu.

369
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,590
Give this to ajussi.

370
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:20,790
Okay!

371
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:21,800
Okay.

372
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,820
The weather is so hot,
you should have bought it iced.

373
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,620
Why did you buy it hot?

374
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:53,430
Why isn't there any mustard on this hot dog?

375
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:56,730
Really?
This is the one with mustard.

376
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:57,530
Shall I give you this?

377
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:00,230
Yes, there's iced coffee here.

378
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:00,630
Let's switch.

379
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:01,340
Change.

380
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,340
Okay.

381
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,140
Hyeong Kyu, Hyeong Kyu.
Wait a moment.

382
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,540
Please take this.

383
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,040
Exchange it and come back, got it?

384
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,140
- Okay.
- Okay.

385
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,650
Good job, Ding Dong.

386
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:17,850
Here.

387
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,960
Thank you.

388
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:27,960
Gu Ae Jeong.

389
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,160
Gu Ae Jeong.

390
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,760
Enjoy your meal.

391
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,570
Enjoy your meal too.

392
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,180
Gu Ae Jeong.

393
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,680
It's really delicious.

394
00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:00,290
Gu Ae Jeong, I don't have napkins.

395
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:01,290
You lost it?

396
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:02,100
Yes.

397
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,000
Wait a moment.

398
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,900
Hyeong Kyu,
bring this over there.

399
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,210
Take this

400
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:13,110
and use this.

401
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:16,010
- Wipe it beautifully,okay.
- Okay.

402
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:18,110
Hurry and come back.

403
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,520
What? What? What?

404
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,120
What?

405
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,420
Auntie told me to wipe your mouth.

406
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,720
Hey, my lips are almost gone.

407
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:37,630
Come back soon.

408
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,340
Manager Gu.

409
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,440
Miss Gu Ae Jeong and Mr. Yun Pil Ju,
what is the meaning of this?

410
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,340
<i>Gu Ae Jeong has a celebrity boyfriend.</i>

411
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:52,150
Perfect Man got deceived perfectly.

412
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:53,950
What is this all about?

413
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:57,350
How can there be such a rumor?

414
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,760
Miss Gu Ae Jeong, where is she now?

415
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,560
She's on the phone.

416
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,370
We've finished eating now.

417
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:14,270
Another hour will do, right?

418
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:19,670
Hyeong Kyu and I have to buy snacks.

419
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:21,980
Hey, isn't that Gu Ae Jeong?

420
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,380
It's her.

421
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,780
Oh, there's this news.

422
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,390
What is she doing here?

423
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,890
It looks like she came to play.

424
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:37,490
Is her boyfriend here, too?

425
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,790
Really?

426
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:40,890
It's this one.

427
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:42,400
Hyeong Kyu,
wipe it.

428
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,610
Is there anything Ding Dong particularly likes?

429
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:57,510
I've bought that.

430
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,410
Don't go anywhere
and wait for me.

431
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,210
I'll be right there.

432
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,920
You're Mr. Dok Go Jin, right?

433
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:16,030
Seems like she's waiting for someone.

434
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:18,530
Didn't they say her boyfriend is a celebrity?

435
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,230
We'll know who it is when we see him.

436
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,540
Should we take her picture?

437
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,440
Be careful.

438
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,540
Okay.

439
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,540
Yes, Representative?

440
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:34,150
I'm at the store with Dok Go Jin hyeongnim now.

441
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:35,450
Is something wrong?

442
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:38,450
You two must come back immediately.

443
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,650
There's a problem with Miss Gu Ae Jeong.

444
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,960
The picnic hasn't even started yet.

445
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,260
Is the picnic the problem now?

446
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:48,860
Being seen together with
Dok Go Jin will cause trouble.

447
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,060
Come back carefully right now.

448
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:53,470
Hyeongnim!
Hyeongnim!

449
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:56,970
Quiet.

450
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:58,970
Take this.

451
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:00,470
Hyeongnim, wait a moment.

452
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,580
There's a problem about Ae Jeong nuna.

453
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,780
What?

454
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,880
Why isn't ajussi here yet?

455
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:15,390
Hyeong Kyu, clean up the trash,
and let's go.

456
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,290
Let's go.

457
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,600
- What's that?
- It seems like she's not.

458
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,910
The both of you being seen
together by others will cause trouble.

459
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:33,910
I will take care of it.

460
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:36,710
Don't tell Gu Ae Jeong anything about the news.

461
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:38,010
Understand?

462
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,410
Yes.

463
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:41,920
Hyeongnim.

464
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,020
Gu Ae Jeong.

465
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:48,720
Ding Dong.

466
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,630
Today's picnic will have to be
postponed until next time.

467
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:53,630
Go home with Jae Seok hyeong.

468
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:54,730
Why?

469
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:56,730
Gu Hyeong Kyu,

470
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,130
you understand, right?

471
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,040
I understand.

472
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,240
The both of you go on ahead.

473
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,840
I'll go with Jae Seok ajussi.

474
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,550
You saw that, right?

475
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:13,250
Ding Dong already understands.

476
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,250
Gu Ae Jeong, let's go.

477
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:14,850
What?

478
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:15,950
Where are we going?

479
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,160
Go home safely.

480
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:54,090
Wait a moment!
Wait a moment! Wait a moment!

481
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:56,390
Mr. Yun Pil Ju is inside, right?

482
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:58,290
He's currently seeing his patients.

483
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:00,790
You all are only
making things difficult for us.

484
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:04,000
Please tell him that we only
want a 5 minute interview with him.

485
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:12,910
Doctor.

486
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:16,810
No matter how we chase the
reporters away, they just won't leave.

487
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:18,210
What should we do?

488
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:22,020
Tell them I'll go out right now.

489
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,020
Yes.

490
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,330
<i>Mr. Yun Pil Ju.</i>

491
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:33,930
<i>Please say something!</i>

492
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:34,930
<i>Mr. Yun Pil Ju!</i>

493
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:38,730
This is a hospital.

494
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,830
You're making things difficult for us.

495
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:43,040
Do you know the news about
Gu Ae Jeong having a celebrity boyfriend?

496
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,840
Do you know who that person is?

497
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,440
<i>How do you feel right now?</i>

498
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,540
About having a crush on Miss Gu Ae Jeong,

499
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:53,050
just like what you
saw on the program, is true.

500
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:55,650
Miss Gu Ae Jeong did not hide anything from me.

501
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:58,350
and we decided to end the program
after discussing it with each other.

502
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,450
What's the reason?
Please tell us!

503
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:02,060
How do you feel right now?

504
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,670
-=Perfect Man has a crush.
Gu Ae Jeong's awkward betrayal=-

505
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:14,670
-=Perfect Man knew Gu Ae Jeong has a boyfriend!=-

506
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:16,970
-=Gu Ae Jeong's boyfriend fact confirmed!=-

507
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,970
This wasn't what I said.

508
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:23,280
Why did they write it this way?

509
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,580
Hyeong, you know these people, right?

510
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,780
Meet them and ask them to change it.

511
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:29,380
But... what people want to know,

512
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:32,590
isn't about your sincerity
and Gu Ae Jeong's situation.

513
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:37,990
The Perfect Man lost to
Gu Ae Jeong's boyfriend and got dumped.

514
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,690
That is the main point.

515
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:41,400
But if the news is like this,

516
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,400
in Gu Ae Jeong's heart,
wouldn't I become a bad man?

517
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,500
Mr. Yun Pil Ju.

518
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,200
Even if you're upset, there is nothing you can do.

519
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,200
We're also very upset.

520
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,200
But at a time like this,
tolerating is the best way.

521
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,310
Miss Gu Ae Jeong's company will take action.

522
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:00,210
Miss Kang Se Ri, because you
also know many reporters,

523
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:03,020
I hope you'll help me
clarify all this.

524
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:05,920
Mr. Yun Pil Ju, don't do anything
and just stay out of it.

525
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:11,530
Anyway, right now, everybody's focus
is the celebrity Gu Ae Jeong is dating.

526
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:18,130
You're not going to be the one
who says it's Dok Go Jin, right?

527
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:21,130
The things I want to withhold and not say

528
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,540
are growing larger and larger.

529
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:32,750
Mr. Yun Pil Ju, stop thinking about
that Land of Wonders story anymore.

530
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:39,050
No matter what happens with Nina,
the evil King will take care of it.

531
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,160
Where are we going?

532
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,460
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

533
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,660
My original plan was this.

534
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,670
I already discussed it with Ding Dong.

535
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:54,970
You heard it too just now,
that Ding Dong understands.

536
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:58,070
Aren't we going to the
place we originally planned to?

537
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,570
The weather today is too nice,

538
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,170
so it would definitely be crowded.

539
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:02,480
We need to find another place.

540
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,280
Another place?
Where?

541
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,080
South Korea is so broad.

542
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:09,080
How can there not be
a place where we can chat at ease?

543
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:16,290
What about Hyeong Kyu?
Where is he going to play?

544
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:18,190
What are you doing?

545
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,500
Until this picnic is over,
don't turn on the phone.

546
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,600
Give it to me.

547
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,200
Gu Ae Jeong.

548
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,810
This is the first picnic of my life.

549
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:34,510
Before we smoothly complete this picnic,

550
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:37,310
any other thoughts or communications are prohibited.

551
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:52,530
I cannot contact her right now.

552
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:54,330
The company has not been informed.

553
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:56,430
Once we confirm it,
we will inform everybody.

554
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:57,930
Gu Ae Jeong...

555
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:59,630
and the celebrity she's rumored to be with,

556
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,540
not once were they ever seen together.

557
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:05,140
Reporter Kim,
didn't I say it's not?

558
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,440
I've already personally denied it.

559
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,140
Why are you still being like this?

560
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,540
No.

561
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,050
Yes, we're sure.

562
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:14,350
Isn't Gu Ae Jeong a little shameless?

563
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:16,050
How embarrassed is the Perfect Man now?

564
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:18,950
But, who's the celebrity she's dating?

565
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,560
Is it the one when they went
to Han Gang and even held hands?

566
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:26,260
My friend and her boyfriend are really close friends.

567
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,060
According to him,
they were both seen there.

568
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:30,860
Vote on who Gu Ae Jeong's boyfriend might be.

569
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,170
I've posted it on the blog.

570
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:33,670
That's right.

571
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:36,370
Delete Dok Go Jin from the list.

572
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:38,070
Their levels are not the same.

573
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:41,270
They're in the same company,
and can even be together till the wee morning.

574
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:42,680
It's very possible.

575
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,880
Even so, Dok Go Jin and her is impossible.

576
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,280
I'm a Dok Go Jin fan,
quickly delete it.

577
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,780
Okay.

578
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:53,890
<i>There's now a vote speculating
on who Ae Jeong nuna's boyfriend is.</i>

579
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:56,990
The reporters wrote the news without
any confirmation, it's creating all sorts of chaos.

580
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:58,990
Is Dok Go still not answering his phone?

581
00:35:58,990 --> 00:35:59,790
Yes.

582
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:02,900
What are they thinking?
Being together during such a situation?

583
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:06,300
Dok Go hyeongnim seems to have made up his mind.

584
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,200
What?

585
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,100
About his relationship with Ae Jeong nunim.

586
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,410
It seems he wants to go public with it.

587
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:40,930
Because the scenery isn't nice,
there's no one here.

588
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:42,140
It's good!

589
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,440
We can have our picnic here, okay?

590
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,480
There's really no one here.

591
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,280
You're right.

592
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,980
Although there's nothing to see,

593
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,780
but it's very reassuring.

594
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,890
Let's go to that field there.

595
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:33,390
You want to walk?

596
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:35,390
There'll be leeches.

597
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:36,690
There will be, won't there?

598
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:40,890
The scenery is bad,
so there's nothing to do.

599
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,900
Jae Seok packed a cooler in my car.

600
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,900
There should be some good things inside.

601
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:57,610
A picnic should have a blanket
spread out with delicious food to eat, right?

602
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:59,410
This is a little...

603
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:02,220
There's no shade,
it's too hot.

604
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:13,130
That's why cool places will be crowded.

605
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:16,630
Since there's no one here,
no one will bother us.

606
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:22,640
Cow! There's a cow here.

607
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,940
It's staring at us.

608
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:26,140
The cow is looking at us.

609
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:30,840
I hope the cow won't tell the reporters.

610
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:34,250
<i>Hey, cow!</i>

611
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:36,850
If you say anything,
I'll sue you.

612
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:38,650
Talking to the cow like that,
do you think it'll understand?

613
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,550
You must moo for it to understand.

614
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:42,060
Okay.

615
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:51,470
Moo, I'm Dok Go Jin moo.

616
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:54,070
I'm very rich moo.

617
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:57,670
If you say anything,
I will sue you moo.

618
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:00,170
End of negotiation.

619
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:03,780
But, if the cow here,
doesn't that mean the owner is here, too?

620
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:08,080
True, it couldn't be a wild cow.

621
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:12,490
Then before the owner comes,
we better go somewhere else.

622
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:16,090
Since we're sitting down.

623
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:18,990
shall we take a photo?

624
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:22,300
Photo?
With the fields as background?

625
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,000
It's all right.
Since I'm the model,

626
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,600
for this kind of background,
I'll just use my perfect face to block it.

627
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,010
But can we take a photo together?

628
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:33,710
It's better to not leave any evidence.

629
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:35,610
Let's just take 1.

630
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,410
I want to leave evidence,

631
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:44,720
evidence that I came here
with you for a picnic, okay?

632
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:50,420
Then how about we take a photo with that cow?

633
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:54,130
Okay.

634
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:57,630
Ready?

635
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:02,440
<i>Hey, look here, look here.</i>

636
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:28,060
Success.

637
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:39,170
This is quite nice.

638
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:45,680
In the future, let's pick more of such places,
and go for walks more often.

639
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,680
We can do that.

640
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:52,790
We can also go to abandoned factories,
play in abandoned houses,
and eat boxed lunch there, right?

641
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:56,090
Being under the sun is so hot.

642
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:03,000
Our top star's face is becoming tan.

643
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:06,000
A star who makes money with his looks,
has to be nicely taken care of.

644
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:12,010
Gu Ae Jeong, where is
the place you really wish to go?

645
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:12,910
Why?

646
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:16,610
Shall I accept another
interview from the Section TV program?

647
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:19,310
Where do you want to go to film the program?

648
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:22,820
You've done an interview once,
doing it again will be too obvious.

649
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:29,620
Then I'll accept Section TV's interview and reveal

650
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:33,230
that I'm your man.
How about that?

651
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:36,830
That way, we don't have to go
to places like farms, and abandoned factories.

652
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:39,730
Then we can go to places with beautiful scenery.

653
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:41,540
How about it?

654
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,740
Are you suffering from heat stroke?

655
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,840
You'll have to drink some iced water.

656
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,940
I'll bring back a few bottles.

657
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:42,500
Oh, where did you come from?

658
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,800
Dok Go Jin?

659
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,200
You're Dok Go Jin, right?

660
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:56,510
You're quite old and
yet you can still recognize me.

661
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:59,710
Aigoo, you're really Dok Go Jin.

662
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:05,020
This grandmother,
can you pretend you didn't see me?

663
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,720
Let's take a photo.

664
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,420
You even carry along a camera.

665
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:15,230
When did all our
country's citizens became paparazzi.

666
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:19,230
Squat down.
Let's take a photo.

667
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:24,240
If you take it, you'll leave it
as your phone wallpaper and collect it, right?

668
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:27,340
Of course I have to show off about
it to my friends in the senior citizen center.

669
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:31,550
And I have to send it to my children over at Seoul.

670
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:35,850
1... 2... 3...

671
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:48,360
What are all these?

672
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:01,380
Ae Jeong, where are you?

673
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:03,680
All hell has broken loose here.

674
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:06,780
=You're with Dok Go Jin now, right?=

675
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:10,080
If at this time,
the both of you are seen together,

676
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,890
everything would be exposed.

677
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:13,590
Eonni, no one has mentioned him, right?

678
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:16,390
Who would have thought it's him!

679
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:19,290
All the celebrities that were speculated
to be your boyfriend, has all refuted the news.

680
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:23,800
They're even saying
how unhappy they are bring
dragged into this, it's chaos everywhere.

681
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,400
You, quickly come back.

682
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,400
I understand, eonni.

683
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:43,420
Did you know such a thing happened?

684
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:48,120
The picnic's atmosphere would have been ruined.

685
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:49,720
I have to quickly go back.

686
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:53,330
Furthermore, you should know that
what you said just now did not make any sense.

687
00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:55,530
You absolutely cannot do it.

688
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:59,230
The picnic ends here,
let's quickly head back.

689
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:10,440
Dok Go Jin, if you want to protect Gu Ae Jeong,

690
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,350
you'll have to be frank to her.

691
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:26,060
Dok Go Jin really suggested
going public about your relationship?

692
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,260
That's what he said.

693
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:31,770
Hey, in my opinion, you two
shouldn't just announce you're dating.

694
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:34,770
When you're announcing your relationship,
you two will have to say you're getting married.

695
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:36,070
Getting married, my foot.

696
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:42,080
If you just say you're dating,
everyone will be looking forward
to the day you two break up.

697
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:46,080
You have to get married
immediately for the public to accept it.

698
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:54,190
If he really realizes this,
then just let him do it.

699
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:58,190
How can he do it as such a time?

700
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:02,000
It should die down soon, right?

701
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,700
Such a thing is not my first time anyway.

702
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:08,600
But, Ae Jeong,
it feels different this time.

703
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,800
Hasn't there been a lot of
people observing you recently?

704
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:14,910
That's why,
it feels a little uneasy.

705
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:18,210
<i>Gu Ae Jeong...</i>

706
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:20,010
When she was a National Treasure Girl,

707
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:23,220
she betrayed her own members,
and went solo.

708
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:25,820
This time, in the Couple Making program too,

709
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:30,520
she brought bad luck to others,
just so she could continue on living.

710
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:31,730
And she even lied.

711
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:34,330
During her National Treasure Girls day,
she was like this too, right?

712
00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:36,630
That's right.

713
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:38,230
When she was with the National Treasure Girls,

714
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:41,940
she herself switched to a good management company.

715
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,640
I think it's the same this time too.

716
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:47,340
What do you think is the
reason she suddenly became famous?

717
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:50,140
She went into such a great entertainment company,

718
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,650
continuously accepted several programs,

719
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:53,450
and she's even releasing an album.

720
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:57,550
The way I see it, it's all because
she managed to grab unto a good man.

721
00:46:58,150 --> 00:46:59,550
Ah...

722
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:02,460
Since Gu Ae Jeong is receiving
so much attention right now,

723
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:05,660
You reporters should dig around
as to the real reason
National Treasure Girls disbanded.

724
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:08,260
There should be some
really interesting discoveries.

725
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,470
-=Gu Ae Jeong continues to be
plagued by rumors of a sponsor=-

726
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:14,470
-=The real reason National Treasure Girls disbanded?=-

727
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:17,670
Just because your boyfriend is a celebrity,

728
00:47:17,870 --> 00:47:20,070
the media is guessing you have a sponsor.

729
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:22,480
They can even twist the story to this.

730
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:26,680
I've made an appointment
with a newspaper that has
quite a good relationship with us.

731
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:29,780
To prevent the reporters
from writing such baseless news,

732
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,990
go and show the real you.

733
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:34,290
What real me?

734
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:37,990
Let them see that you didn't
get here because of a sponsor.

735
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:41,400
The fact that you stay in a
cheap rental house with your family,

736
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,700
you have to let the world see.

737
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,000
Show them my house?

738
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:46,300
Yes. And also tell them,
since your father's failed business venture,

739
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:50,000
how your financial situation is.

740
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,810
And also tell about how you and your manager oppa

741
00:47:53,010 --> 00:47:55,610
worked so hard every day
going from activity to activity.

742
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:58,410
Make it known to the public that you're
the one taking responsibility for your family.

743
00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:01,110
A young parent who works very hard.

744
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:07,820
If it's like this, others
will look down on my father and oppa.

745
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:10,620
To me, they're family, not a burden.

746
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,930
That is not bad,
say it like that.

747
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:17,730
Also, for all the people who
thinks your nephew is your illegitimate son,

748
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:19,930
explain clearly that when your
brother and sister-in-law got a divorce,

749
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:25,040
you raised him like your own son.

750
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,740
Even Hyeong Kyu?

751
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,640
Yes.

752
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,340
And also why
National Treasure Girls disbanded,

753
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,350
and the reason you fought with Se Ri.

754
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:35,450
I heard all about it from your friend Jenny.

755
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:41,660
You must make it clear
that it was all Se Ri's fault.

756
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:45,160
It's all in the past, why bother?

757
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,460
And also,

758
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,760
the member called Mi Na,
she has a secret too, right?

759
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,170
What is it?

760
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:55,370
Just unload all of it.

761
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:58,470
The fact that you carried all the responsibility

762
00:48:58,670 --> 00:49:00,170
and have lived a hard life...

763
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:02,480
If you let the public see this,

764
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:06,080
all of your bad image will disappear.

765
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:11,990
So you want me to sell out
my family, colleagues and friends?

766
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:13,690
If you want to save yourself,

767
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:15,590
you must.

768
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:19,290
If not,

769
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:21,500
you have to end it here.

770
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:29,500
And one more thing, I beg you.

771
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:36,210
If you want to end it,
don't drag Dok Go down with you.

772
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:40,210
This is not asking,
I'm begging you.

773
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:42,820
Dok Go is living a top life.

774
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:48,520
I don't want him to fall,

775
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:52,530
and neither do I want him to end here.

776
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:02,440
Your present condition is good.

777
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,940
The preparation for the surgery is going well too.

778
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:07,340
There's not much time left.

779
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:12,650
I hear that your Miss Thump Thump
is in a very difficult situation recently.

780
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:17,450
You shouldn't be concerning yourself
over entertainment news at such a time.

781
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:20,950
Because this is very important
to my patient, that's why I followed the news.

782
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:25,860
Is it because you cannot guarantee
the outcome of your surgery,
that's why you can't come forward?

783
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:29,860
It has nothing to do with the results,
I'm looking for ways to protect her.

784
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:35,770
Seeing the present situation, if I really save your life,
you're most likely going to live a very long life.

785
00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:37,470
If rumors of both of you spread,

786
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:38,970
you'll most likely be
badmouthed by the whole world.

787
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:42,980
There's a saying,
"better a bad life than a good death."

788
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:46,680
Recently,

789
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,580
I really want to continue on living,

790
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:54,090
and live crazily with that woman.

791
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:59,490
<i>Wow, this Gu Ae Jeong,
is really very terrible.</i>

792
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:03,400
I heard when National Treasure Girls disbanded,
she used her connections for her own benefit and went solo.

793
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:09,800
I heard that after that career was put on hold,
she went on and found a new man,
and started going to programs.

794
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:13,010
I heard from my son that because
everyone wanted to discover Gu Ae Jeong's boyfriend,

795
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:15,710
they even commissioned
a web search unit to investigate.

796
00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:17,110
There's such a search team?

797
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:20,010
Yes, doesn't she still live in our district?

798
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:22,220
When I met her occasionally,
she seemed pretty quiet.

799
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:25,220
I never thought she'll do
something so sickening.

800
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:31,020
Hey, child, why are you crying?

801
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:33,830
Child, why are you crying?

802
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:37,730
Why?
Why are you crying?

803
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:40,530
Child, are you all right?

804
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:46,140
Looks like you'll have to
take a break from all the programs.

805
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,840
They say to let you rest for some time,
for you to self-reflect.

806
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:53,050
Then the album won't be released?

807
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:55,550
That song was pretty good.

808
00:51:57,250 --> 00:52:00,150
Father.
Oppa.

809
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:07,460
What have I done wrong that I must self-reflect?

810
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:14,370
What have I done wrong
that the whole country hates me?

811
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:21,270
Did I really do something so disgusting?

812
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:24,480
I only did my work diligently,

813
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,880
smiling when I'm sad,

814
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:30,280
and smile a little more when I'm happy.

815
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,390
I've been living this way.

816
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:37,590
Is living like this a crime?

817
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:42,000
What exactly have I done wrong?

818
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:47,200
What exactly have I done wrong?

819
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:20,130
A doctor reading the patient records
and finding the patient's address.

820
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:21,540
Isn't that considered immoral?

821
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:24,240
You yourself said Miss Gu Ae Jeong is your savior.

822
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:27,040
But when she's in trouble,
you don't even care at all.

823
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:30,640
Just thinking about living a good life,
that's not right, either.

824
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:33,250
I have nothing to say.

825
00:53:33,850 --> 00:53:39,350
I can only ask Ae Jeong eonni to
continue to be tight-lipped about past events.

826
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:41,660
I can't do anything else.

827
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:43,160
So, that's why...

828
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:46,160
Just like 10 years ago and even now,

829
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,760
you want her to bear all the responsibility,

830
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:51,260
letting 1 person be hurt to resolve it all?

831
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:53,870
How can all of you be so selfish?

832
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:57,770
Why are you letting a weak woman
step forward and suffer it all by herself?

833
00:53:57,970 --> 00:54:00,470
None of you have anywhere else to hide?

834
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:07,780
If I act pitiful,
will others pity and forgive me?

835
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:10,380
Isn't that the only way?

836
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:13,490
Shall I do an interview too and
spill everything out about you and Se Ri?

837
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:17,490
I don't know what's
the right thing to do either.

838
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:23,400
Hey, look over there!
Quickly, quickly, quickly!

839
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:27,700
It's a reporter, right?
What to do?

840
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:29,100
Hey, quickly go!

841
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,100
Quickly, quickly, quickly!

842
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:35,910
Hello, I'm Reporter Hwang Da Gyeong
from Entertainment Weekly.

843
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:36,910
You're Miss Jenny, right?

844
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:38,610
What can I do for you?

845
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:40,710
Regarding National Treasure Girls disbandment...

846
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:42,320
Quickly go!
Quickly go!

847
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:44,920
Oh, it's Miss Gu Ae Jeong, right?

848
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,020
Miss Gu Ae Jeong!

849
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,120
Miss Gu Ae Jeong!
Please wait a moment!

850
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,520
Miss Gu Ae Jeong.

851
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:52,330
Miss Gu Ae Jeong.
Hello.

852
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:54,730
I'm Reporter Hwang Da Gyeong
from Entertainment Weekly.

853
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:57,330
Regarding National Treasure Girls disbandment,

854
00:54:57,330 --> 00:54:58,630
I would like to ask you a few questions about it.

855
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:00,230
I don't know.

856
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:02,740
What happened at the time of
National Treasure Girls disbandment...

857
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:04,440
What are you doing?

858
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:08,240
Are you all right?

859
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:13,650
Yun... Mr. Yun Pil Ju.

860
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:16,650
Miss Gu Ae Jeong has nothing to say.

861
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:17,950
Let's go.

862
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,660
That cannot be ignored.

863
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:30,760
It's all right.

864
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:33,570
As time passes,
it'll heal.

865
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:37,370
You really make me upset.

866
00:55:37,370 --> 00:55:39,470
Why do you always ignore it,
thinking it'll heal by itself?

867
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:41,580
That's why you have scars
that will never heal for years.

868
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:43,280
But, what else can I do?

869
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:46,580
With such a small injury,
if I continue digging deeper,

870
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:49,180
it might become more serious,
my whole leg might even be crippled.

871
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:50,780
Walk away.

872
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:54,390
Walk away from this strange place
that only brings you pain.

873
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:56,290
Doesn't matter if it's Dok Go Jin,
or the Entertainment industry,

874
00:55:56,290 --> 00:55:58,690
maybe that world has moved you.

875
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:00,690
But you're always getting hurt,
always being harmed by others.

876
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:03,300
And you always have to
prepare yourself to get hurt again.

877
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:05,200
If there's a need,

878
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,900
you can use me to leave that place.

879
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:10,300
I'll help you run far far away.

880
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:14,010
If I run,

881
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:16,410
I can't protect it.

882
00:56:17,310 --> 00:56:19,710
Even though I've been injured along the way,

883
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:24,420
there are things I have to protect.

884
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:27,720
If I run away,

885
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:30,320
I'm unable to protect anything.

886
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:04,860
I must protect it.

887
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:22,880
I can't spill out matters
regarding the people around me.

888
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:27,080
There's a possibility you'd be
unable to continue your career.

889
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,980
For the sake of being the celebrity Gu Ae Jeong,

890
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:32,790
I cannot just abandon
all the people around the real me.

891
00:57:32,790 --> 00:57:35,690
It's better to just end it right now.

892
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:37,190
If this were a common job,

893
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:40,290
you could just resign
and get another job elsewhere.

894
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,800
But you cannot do that.

895
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:45,300
Where else can you go?
What else can you do?

896
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:47,500
You can't do anything.

897
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:53,510
But I still don't want to sell out my family and friends.

-=The truth behind National Treasure Girls disbandment.=-

899
00:57:58,810 --> 00:58:02,820
I have to know the inside story,
only then can I reveal the truth.

900
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:04,720
What is Ae Jeong going to do?

901
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:09,520
Is there really a problem with Gu Ae Jeong?

902
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,430
Se Ri, do you know?

903
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:15,930
No matter the reason, the arrow
is pointing somewhere else.

904
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:17,730
Our show is saved.

905
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:21,230
Ae Jeong eonni is always
targeted by the arrow.

-=The truth behind National Treasure Girls disbandment=-

907
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:55,870
I'm sorry, Ae Jeong eonni.

908
00:58:58,770 --> 00:59:03,980
I'm sorry.
I have nothing to say.

909
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:06,080
I will reflect upon it behind closed doors.

910
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:14,990
I'm sorry.

911
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:19,390
I have nothing to say.

912
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:23,300
I will reflect upon it behind closed doors.

913
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,810
I'm sorry.

914
00:59:32,910 --> 00:59:35,510
I have nothing to say.

915
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:37,710
I will reflect upon it behind closed doors.

916
00:59:53,130 --> 00:59:55,030
I'm sorry.

917
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:57,330
I have nothing to say.

918
01:00:13,050 --> 01:00:14,350
Where are you going?

919
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:21,760
Miss Gu Ae Jeong... is she going to drag you down, after all?

920
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:24,060
I plan to take the fall with Gu Ae Jeong.

921
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:27,160
Dok Go, it hasn't reached the point of no return yet.

922
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:29,460
Don't fall because of this.

923
01:00:31,470 --> 01:00:34,070
I also want to continue living.

924
01:00:34,070 --> 01:00:36,670
That's why I'm taking the fall with her.

925
01:00:58,590 --> 01:01:00,690
Why are you here?

926
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:03,500
Gu Ae Jeong.

927
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:05,400
Don't talk about other things

928
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:06,600
and just talk about me.

929
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:07,300
Huh?

930
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:10,900
You and me.
Just talk about you and me...

931
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:12,810
to everyone.

932
01:01:14,910 --> 01:01:18,710
As long as you agree to be my woman,

933
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:21,110
I will acknowledge everything.

934
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:23,420
Forget it.

935
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:25,820
Even if they're empty words, I'm content with that.
Stop kidding already.

936
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:28,020
I'm not kidding.

937
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:31,930
What I said just now,
isn't a joke.

938
01:01:33,130 --> 01:01:38,230
Saying I want to immediately
announce our love, isn't a joke.

939
01:01:38,530 --> 01:01:44,740
Begging you to marry me
right now, isn't a joke either.

940
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:47,540
Thank you for not joking.

941
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:50,340
And,

942
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:53,650
this is the most serious one,

943
01:01:55,950 --> 01:02:01,660
I might die and disappear,

944
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:03,860
that is not a joke either.

945
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:07,560
Gu Ae Jeong.

946
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:10,760
I'm seriously broken

947
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:13,470
and it may not be fixed.

-=The truth regarding the rumors
about Gu Ae Jeong press conference=-

949
01:02:51,710 --> 01:02:53,310
So you're saying

950
01:02:54,010 --> 01:02:56,210
that because you might die,

951
01:02:56,210 --> 01:03:00,310
it's all right to expose our relationship, is that it?

952
01:03:17,330 --> 01:03:21,840
"Better a bad life than a good death."

953
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,840
I'm really feeling it now.

954
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,540
But...

955
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:28,840
Even if I were to leave this world,

956
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:30,740
I would definitely not let you suffer,

957
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:33,150
or let you depend on only yourself.

958
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:34,350
Tell me you're joking.

959
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:36,550
You don't need to sell out other people,

960
01:03:36,550 --> 01:03:38,050
just sell me out.

961
01:03:38,050 --> 01:03:41,860
To cover up all your problems
Dok Go Jin is expensive enough,

962
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:43,860
and I'm giving him to you.

963
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:44,760
So just sell him.

964
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:45,660
Tell me you're joking.

965
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:48,060
To achieve that,

966
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:53,070
let me be your man.

967
01:03:53,070 --> 01:03:55,470

her own development, she went solo.

red wine over to Jae Seok, too?

and now it's fate?
