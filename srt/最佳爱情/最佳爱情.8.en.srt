1
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:04,399
What are you doing?

2
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:17,008
The person who bought Ae-jeong’s sneakers

3
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,280
to donate ten million won to charity

4
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:21,353
is me.

5
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:26,546
We’re from the same agency,

6
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:28,657
and a special person in my life

7
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:34,792
is also the MC of Couple Making.

8
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:39,802
I wanted to quietly donate money
through this charity auction...

9
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,270
But things went out of hand.

10
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,340
I apologize.

11
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:48,542
Mr. Dokgo, was it just a simple donation?

12
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:51,008
Then, why did you bid
on Gu Ae-jeong’s sneakers

13
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:52,807
and not Kang Se-ri’s bag?

14
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:58,183
I guess I’ll have to reveal something else
that I wanted to keep quiet.

15
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,715
It was all for a simple reason.

16
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:03,258
Along with the ten million won,

17
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:07,257
I was planning to donate
1,000 pairs of sneakers.

18
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:11,896
-What’s that?
-Is that a truck?

19
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:13,572
What is it?

20
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,703
They're shoes!

21
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:16,898
He's awesome.

22
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:20,608
What is that?

23
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,980
-Just take a photo!
-What is it?

24
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:24,812
-So...
-He's amazing.

25
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:26,748
Whenever I do something like this...

26
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:29,347
I’m given the title,

27
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:31,152
“Charity Angel" Dokgo Jin,

28
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:35,657
or the "Wingless Angel”,
which is burdensome and embarrassing.

29
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:39,092
I really didn’t want anyone
to find out this time,

30
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:43,232
but since it has caused a stir,
I would like to bow my head

31
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:45,866
and sincerely apologize.

32
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:52,143
-Dokgo Jin is amazing.
-He really is.

33
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:59,113
-He really is something.
-Recovered!

34
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,590
GU AE-JEONG'S SCHEME IS TURNS OUT
TO BE DOKGO JIN'S ACT OF CHARITY

35
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,703
CHARITY ANGEL DOKGO JIN
SPREADS THE LOVE WITH SNEAKERS

36
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,030
Dokgo Jin supposedly bought the sneakers
to make peace with Gu Ae-jeong

37
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,797
regarding the Ankle Girl
and Riot Girl incidents.

38
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,767
Isn't a thousand sneakers a billion won?

39
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:28,042
With all his commercials,

40
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:30,507
he sure is causing a stir
over a tiny donation!

41
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:31,807
What the...

42
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:35,723
Did you ever donate 100 won?

43
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:37,645
Donating sneakers is admirable.

44
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:47,293
The general consensus
approves of my donation.

45
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,800
Your sneakers are famous, too.

46
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:51,262
If you were a little more liked,

47
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:53,528
you could’ve gotten some commercials.

48
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,840
Since you did the good deeds,

49
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:58,199
you should be getting the commercials.

50
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:00,241
That not a bad idea.

51
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:04,007
Sports athletes have always
been chosen for those commercials.

52
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,847
I'll target them with my new image.

53
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:10,247
I should tell Ms. Moon at once.

54
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:16,655
You really surprised me earlier

55
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,930
when you showed up, and--

56
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:21,563
Did you think...

57
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,532
I'd say I bought the sneakers
because I liked you?

58
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,398
Aren't you afraid

59
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:30,166
of getting a bad reputation
for being involved with me?

60
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:34,541
I don’t like it. It’s burdensome.

61
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:40,253
Although you slightly broke my heart,

62
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:43,223
my brain functions well enough
to know not to start a scandal

63
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,246
with someone who doesn't like me.

64
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:47,385
I decided to accept what you said

65
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:50,657
and the fact that
this is a one-sided love.

66
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,991
As embarrassing as it may be,

67
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,127
there seems to be a few perks.

68
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:58,326
Since it is one-sided,

69
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:02,498
we won't have to get involved
in real life.

70
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:04,636
If you know that,

71
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:08,344
from now on, don't buy
ten million won worth of sneakers.

72
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,238
I can handle my own business.

73
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,180
The upside of a one-sided love
is that I can do whatever I want.

74
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:17,324
I know you won't love me back
and I don't plan on asking you to.

75
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,920
Don’t be concerned about
what I do with my business.

76
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:34,197
It would’ve have looked better
if you had bid on my bag.

77
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:37,704
A designer bag is a collectible.
Sneakers looked better.

78
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:39,538
Jin...

79
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,940
Does Ae-jeong have some sort
of leverage on you?

80
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,407
Yes, an extremely big one.

81
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,319
So, don't treat her badly.

82
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,346
I won’t have to
deal with her anymore anyway.

83
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,285
Today will be her last taping.

84
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:57,155
What? Why?

85
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:58,663
She'll be eliminated today.

86
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:00,928
The crew is discussing it with Pil-joo.

87
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:04,655
If we want our show to keep going,

88
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:08,844
we have to take Ae-jeong out.

89
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,873
Your true feelings aren't an issue here.

90
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:15,639
But to protect our show,

91
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,282
please eliminate Ae-jeong today

92
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:22,005
to make things look good.

93
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:26,589
Eun-ho,
do I really have to eliminate Ae-jeong?

94
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:30,122
The thing is, if you fixate on Ae-jeong

95
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:32,156
and don't give the other girls a chance,

96
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:35,402
the show loses too much suspense.

97
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:39,502
We can’t force you to do anything,
since the ultimate choice is yours,

98
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,766
but try to understand our situation, okay?

99
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:17,235
So, the person who won the bid was you.

100
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:20,767
Thanks to a certain “anyone”
who kept raising the bid,

101
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:23,707
I was able to donate a large amount.

102
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:27,006
You may think
you were protecting Ae-jeong,

103
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:30,777
but I think you just made it
harder and more confusing for her.

104
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:35,150
If that's the case, then you can save her
by not eliminating her

105
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:37,721
from this show
that she’s betting her life on.

106
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,590
If only I could,
I would like to take Ae-jeong away

107
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,360
from your world that keeps hurting her.

108
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:46,099
Yes, this world is like that.

109
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,136
Yet despite how much it hurt her,
she survived.

110
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:52,272
She pathetically held out
and won each time. That's what's amazing.

111
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,969
For someone who is not a celebrity,

112
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:58,011
the only way you can protect Ae-jeong

113
00:07:58,077 --> 00:07:59,477
is to hand her the rose.

114
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:03,116
Help her by not getting her eliminated
from the show

115
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,549
that she is willing to do
whatever it takes to stay on.

116
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:08,617
Okay?

117
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:26,338
COUPLE MAKING

118
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,479
I explained everything to Pil-joo,
so he'll know what to do.

119
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:33,708
Okay.

120
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,520
You don’t look well.

121
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:39,193
We thought
your bag would be an issue-maker.

122
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:40,422
How did this happen?

123
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,289
Are you okay?

124
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:48,334
I'm sorry I was just watching by when
you were in a difficult position earlier.

125
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:50,504
Everything worked out, so it’s okay.

126
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:53,333
I don’t think I can protect you

127
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,673
the way you’re supposed
to be protected in your world.

128
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:02,014
I’m going to do it the only way I know,

129
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,042
so please forgive me.

130
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:08,354
If you have to eliminate me today,

131
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:10,675
don’t worry about it too much.

132
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,523
I won't blame you.

133
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:22,902
Hello, I’m the host of the third season
of Couple Making,

134
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,132
Kang Se-ri.

135
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:27,573
I believe today is
the second round of eliminations.

136
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:30,104
There are three roses left

137
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:33,439
with four contestants remaining.

138
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,039
Everyone seems quite nervous
as they await a rose from Pil-joo.

139
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:41,077
Who will ultimately be eliminated?

140
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,050
All right, Pil-joo. Are you ready?

141
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:48,645
Okay. It’s now time to choose.

142
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,922
Pil-joo, please hand out the roses.

143
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,417
We expected it.

144
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:24,822
He really doesn’t get it.

145
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,770
So she survived after all.

146
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:41,814
His first choice is Ae-jeong.

147
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:45,375
Now, please hand out the second--

148
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:49,152
-What?
-She got two?

149
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:50,778
What's going on?

150
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,390
What?

151
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:53,851
What's happening?

152
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,920
This is amazing.

153
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:00,088
Really?

154
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,259
What’s he trying to do?

155
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:17,906
Wow!

156
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,685
Hurry! Take a picture!

157
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,766
I told you to give her one rose.

158
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,143
Who told you to go all out?

159
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,971
Se-ri! End it!

160
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:50,384
We’re going to take a short break.

161
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,903
The leverage Ae-jeong had...

162
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:46,925
was his heart?

163
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:53,708
Why did you do that?

164
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,780
Even if they decide
not to air today’s taping,

165
00:12:56,842 --> 00:13:00,582
that won’t fix anything
since the reporters saw everything.

166
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:03,147
I told you I was going to do it my way.

167
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,524
Although I apologized to you earlier,

168
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:07,845
but it is more accurate to say...

169
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,658
that I was upset at myself.

170
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:13,961
It upset me to see you
hurt and misunderstood.

171
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,360
And to see him show up and confuse you.

172
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,600
That upset me, too.

173
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,529
Pil-joo--

174
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,300
Jin is the person
who’s on your mind, right?

175
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:27,311
I've seen you two together.

176
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:33,177
You all live in a world

177
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,119
where things don’t match up.
I don't understand it.

178
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,653
I wanted to take you out of that world.

179
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:45,321
To do that, I felt like I had to take
one honest step towards you,

180
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:49,295
and stop you from being swayed by him.

181
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,303
These...

182
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:03,805
are my way of honestly showing you
my feelings.

183
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:08,151
Now, I want to protect you

184
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:11,924
from getting even more hurt,
before I cure you.

185
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:14,986
Ae-jeong.

186
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:17,655
I...

187
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,061
like you.

188
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,844
That doctor is no good.

189
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:32,973
Ae-jeong is betting her life on the show.

190
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,908
But he just made it worse for her

191
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:36,514
by going all out with the roses.

192
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,705
She could become a doctor’s wife.

193
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:40,508
Why would the show matter?

194
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:43,279
Do you have any idea how passionate
she is for television?

195
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:46,049
She works so hard just to make a living.

196
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:48,018
If she doesn’t need to earn a living...

197
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:51,155
the show wouldn't matter.

198
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:57,595
Does it hurt again?

199
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,570
I'm fine.

200
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:02,432
Whether it’s one rose at a time

201
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:04,471
or a whole bunch of flowers at once,

202
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:05,766
they're both shocking.

203
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:07,308
I just need to get past this.

204
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:09,113
As long as I don't see her.

205
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:13,045
The thing is...
the producers are having a meeting

206
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:16,552
to discuss how to keep
the two of them on the show.

207
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:17,645
What?

208
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,890
They're not being kicked out?

209
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,517
What’s done is done.

210
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,519
Let's get a grip and straighten this out.

211
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,561
What should we do
about next week’s taping?

212
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,660
Although we’ll be able to find
new female celebrities,

213
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:33,026
how do we find the perfect man in a week?

214
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:36,038
We’ll follow
the Pil-joo and Ae-jeong storyline.

215
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:38,098
Until we reorganize the show,

216
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:41,270
we’ll just follow
the story of Pil-joo and Ae-jeong.

217
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:42,573
That's right.

218
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:45,778
Will Ae-jeong accept Pil-joo or not...

219
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:48,554
Just this would be enough
for an entire week’s episode.

220
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,524
Since Pil-joo knows what he did,

221
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:52,282
he won’t be able to say no.

222
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:56,761
And Ae-jeong
would definitely want to do it, right?

223
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,719
Ae-jeong, there’s a lot of talk

224
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,631
over the article about you and Pil-joo.

225
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,593
The women are dying of jealousy.

226
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:05,155
Once it airs, people will go wild.

227
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:09,639
It'll look nice
because they'll overexaggerate it

228
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:12,002
to make it seem like a pathetic Cinderella

229
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:13,341
was saved by a prince.

230
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:14,635
How about in real life?

231
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:17,044
Doesn't it actually feel nice?

232
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:18,706
In real life?

233
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:37,331
It’s nice.

234
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:38,803
They don’t want you to do

235
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:40,804
any interviews until the next taping.

236
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,143
So let's hurry and avoid the reporters.

237
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:45,635
-Wait here. I'll get the car.
-Okay.

238
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,182
I can't go to this person.

239
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:57,248
And what to do with this person?

240
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:00,848
I've become full of luck.

241
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,175
She was dying for joy after one rose.

242
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:33,645
Now that she has a whole bunch,
she's lost her whole mind.

243
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:38,359
All right.

244
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:43,295
Let's just drive past in a cool manner.

245
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,429
I can recover. Why?

246
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,399
Because I'm Dokgo Jin.

247
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:50,798
Depart!

248
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:03,915
Jin...

249
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:23,498
What?

250
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,736
Why did you stop me from rushing out?

251
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:29,782
I thought something was wrong
with the car.

252
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,479
If nothing is wrong, then goodbye.

253
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:33,814
No!

254
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:35,876
Might as well get in.

255
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:38,418
-I need to talk to you.
-About what?

256
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:40,794
You’ve lost your mind
after that bunch of flowers.

257
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,687
But I have to tell you
another flower story.

258
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,559
The camellia flower story?

259
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,594
That’s over. Another story.

260
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,800
Aren’t you curious? Get in.

261
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:00,638
The title is...

262
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,880
Azaleas.

263
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:07,247
The poem? I know that one.

264
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,582
"When you are disgusted to see me
and leave,

265
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,748
I will be silent
and send you off in peace."

266
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:17,558
I want to

267
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:21,327
lay down azaleas on the path you'd take.

268
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,062
You don't need to go that far.

269
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,330
No, I'll make sure that I do.

270
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:32,072
To see if you'll be able
to gently tread over them.

271
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:34,371
Listen to me carefully.

272
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:42,349
This is an elementary school.

273
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:46,348
I didn't really get to go
to elementary school.

274
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:48,815
-Why?
-Because I couldn't.

275
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:52,861
I was always in the hospital.

276
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:55,392
-Why?
-It's hard to believe

277
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,860
since I'm so healthy
and incredibly sexy right now,

278
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:01,697
but I used to be a sickly boy.

279
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:04,295
You used to be ill?

280
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:08,069
That's right. I was sick.
For a very long time.

281
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:11,441
I couldn't do anything.

282
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:14,814
After a miraculous surgery ten years ago,

283
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,650
I decided to become an actor,

284
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:19,989
because it was a job
that let me do everything.

285
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:23,893
I’ve never heard
anything like this about you.

286
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:25,086
That's right.

287
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:29,290
Hardly anyone knows
that Dokgo Jin was ever sick.

288
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:30,801
How were you sick?

289
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:40,641
I had a bad heart.

290
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:45,908
When I said I need to stay
within a 60-90 heart rate,

291
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:50,048
it really was in an effort
to protect my heart.

292
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:52,990
Really?

293
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,943
My chest has been torn.

294
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:31,488
Why are you telling me this?

295
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:34,334
So you would feel bad for me.

296
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,197
I told you
I would lay down azaleas for you.

297
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:41,796
My heart is the azalea
that I will lay in your path.

298
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:44,374
It hurts so much,

299
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:47,536
even a gentle step may kill me.

300
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:48,666
Can you...

301
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,335
tread over it?

302
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:56,379
Is your heart that weak?

303
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:57,448
Yes.

304
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,491
It hurts so much.

305
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:02,553
So you have to refrain.

306
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:04,661
-From what?
-From going to that guy!

307
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:09,932
Don't tread over this.

308
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:25,275
-Mister, pass us the ball!
-Mister, pass us the ball!

309
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:30,884
You rascals...

310
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:51,935
Stop lurking around and go away.

311
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:52,973
-Darn it.
-Darn it.

312
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,638
Hurry and get the ball.

313
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:55,736
Run!

314
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:06,754
Jin.

315
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:10,416
Aren't you healthy now?

316
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:24,842
That’s right.

317
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:28,773
I read that you ran after a truck
for several kilometers

318
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,680
in Fighter.

319
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,782
And what about the muscle pain reliever?

320
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:36,154
In the commercial for that,
you did 100 push-ups in a minute.

321
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:40,354
I watched you boast about it
on a TV interview.

322
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:42,819
Don’t think about those things

323
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:45,418
and touch here. Look here.

324
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,298
What about this? Explain this, then.

325
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:52,903
That tickles!

326
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,372
An azalea should be pure and fragile,

327
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:57,901
but your body’s too beastly.

328
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,710
This is just for show.

329
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:05,283
Are you telling me about your old surgery
to make me feel bad for you

330
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:08,113
so you can beg for my love?

331
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,080
I'm not begging you.

332
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:11,578
I'm asking for your sympathy.

333
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:14,717
Since I'm sick,
you should be more understanding.

334
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,816
When you want to go to that doctor,

335
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:18,962
imagine me collapsing in pain.

336
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:21,794
Your conscience won't let you go to him.

337
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:24,964
You're so nice that you would understand

338
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:28,802
someone as evil as I am.

339
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:38,535
Thanks to you,

340
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,013
This will be the highest ratings
in my career.

341
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,823
There were a ton of people
in the editing room, too.

342
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,446
I’m sorry.

343
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:49,791
Since you’re sorry,
you have to do another episode.

344
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:53,286
It'll be of Ae-jeong’s response
to your proposal.

345
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:55,692
The ratings will increase even more.

346
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:00,672
I’m okay but I’m not sure about Ae-jeong.

347
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:03,202
Ae-jeong would join without a doubt.

348
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:04,595
Don't you think?

349
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:14,077
I would have understood
if you didn’t give me a rose,

350
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:18,023
and I would have been thankful
if you had given me one rose.

351
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:22,220
But since you gave me three roses at once,

352
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:24,517
I don’t know what to do.

353
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:29,834
The truth is,
I don’t know what to do either.

354
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:33,002
I’ve never done anything like this before.

355
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:40,269
Does that mean you might dump me here?

356
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:50,984
Please give me some time.

357
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:55,985
Okay. How much time?

358
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:59,064
Don't ask me as if you're asking me
when I can pay back your money.

359
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:06,568
But I guess emotions are like interest.
They grow over time.

360
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:08,896
How about three days,

361
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:10,737
no interest, but paid all at once?

362
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:16,335
Can you give me some more time?

363
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,208
All right. Think about it.

364
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:21,813
But Pil-joo, we’re really desperate.

365
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:24,247
Not done right, the show could go down.

366
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:26,619
You bear a heavy burden, okay?

367
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:37,357
I’m desperate, too.

368
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,874
I should've burdened her, too.

369
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:45,469
Pil-joo.

370
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:54,706
Remember I said I was going to
officially announce my breakup?

371
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:59,747
It’s because someone has gotten
between me and Jin.

372
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:02,186
That someone...

373
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,656
is Ae-jeong.

374
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,433
Aren’t you surprised?

375
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:11,795
I already knew that.

376
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:15,674
You knew that and
still gave her three roses?

377
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:18,771
I wanted to catch her
because she was being swayed.

378
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,744
I hope you won't go out of your way

379
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:28,246
to make it hard for her
while she tries to regain her balance.

380
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:43,329
AZALEAS

381
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:45,655
"When you are disgusted
to see me and leave,

382
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,970
I will be silent
and send you off in peace.

383
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:52,368
From Mount Yak in Yongbyon,

384
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:55,337
I shall gather an armful of azaleas
and lay them on your path.

385
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,638
With each and every step you take,

386
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:02,905
gently tread over
the flowers as you leave.

387
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:10,556
When you are disgusted
to see me and leave,

388
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:13,159
I would rather die than to shed tears."

389
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:21,727
This poem isn't bidding farewell.

390
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:25,097
It’s saying that one would rather die
than to say goodbye.

391
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,820
...the host of the third season
of Couple Making,

392
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,422
-Kang Se-ri.
-Three roses at once?

393
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:41,047
With the breeze of spring

394
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:44,256
young hearts are fluttering...

395
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:49,226
Everyone seems quite nervous
as they await a rose from Pil-joo.

396
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:50,834
This is so embarrassing!

397
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:52,855
What am I going to do?

398
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:59,235
MR. KIM

399
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:01,144
What am I going to do with you, Pil-joo?

400
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:03,366
What do I say? I can't believe this.

401
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:08,781
I don’t believe this!

402
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:10,324
Three roses!

403
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:12,751
His choice is Ae-jeong.

404
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,488
With the breeze of spring

405
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:18,363
young hearts are fluttering...

406
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:29,996
GONGJIN-DAN 200,000 WON PER PIECE

407
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:31,838
TOP GRADE MEAT

00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,810
LATEST MODEL VAN
AE-JEONG'S ALBUM

409
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:45,553
YUN PIL-JOO VS DOKGO JIN

410
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,448
You're lying.

411
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:50,357
You shouldn't lie.

412
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:52,691
WE'RE FRIENDS

413
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:04,004
We even got a bonus

414
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:05,368
for getting highest ratings.

415
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:09,408
And they don’t want us
to get rid of Pil-joo and Ae-jeong,

416
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,584
but to create an exclusive spin-off
and go as far as we can with it.

417
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:14,547
A spin-off?

418
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:17,223
Do you think the two will do it?

419
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:18,852
Of course, you have to do it!

420
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:21,087
It's your first time doing it, right?

421
00:30:21,452 --> 00:30:22,352
Yes.

422
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:25,620
This is your chance
to erase your bad reputation.

423
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:29,661
The cherry-picked perfect man chose you.

424
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:34,298
If people continue to watch it,
you'll seem to have depth.

425
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:38,503
It'll seem like you have
a mysterious appeal.

426
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,810
If I have a good relationship
with him on TV,

427
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:43,312
I might get a favorable reputation?

428
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:44,835
Just wait and see.

429
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:48,109
If you get involved with Yun Pil-joo,
people will like you.

430
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,450
And why don't you actually date him?

431
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:55,653
From an agency's perspective,
we're completely on board.

432
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:58,387
THE PERFECT MAN CHOOSES GU AE-JEONG

433
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:02,186
Since it already happened,
I should reveal the truth.

434
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:06,204
But how am I going to explain

435
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:08,868
why I hid the truth?

436
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:12,338
Let's see now.

437
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,810
What a nightmare!

438
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:18,235
Ma'am.

439
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:21,411
You must've read the article.

440
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:24,417
You read this too, right?

441
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:28,252
Yes. They look so good together

442
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,020
in the picture.

443
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:33,963
Who looks good with whom?

444
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:37,355
Do you think Ae-jeong dares to be

445
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:39,198
a match for my son?

446
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,274
What?

447
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,840
Your son is the one that likes her.

448
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,813
What are you talking about?

449
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:52,812
Ae-jeong is the one
that seduced my innocent son!

450
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:56,677
How did such trash get a hold of him?

451
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,389
How dare you say such things?

452
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:02,249
Mr. Kang!

453
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,890
I’m not Kang Se-ri’s father,

454
00:32:04,188 --> 00:32:06,058
but Gu Ae-jeong’s father!

455
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:09,991
What? Gu Ae-jeong's father?

456
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:11,131
That's right!

457
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:15,033
Who are you to say such things
about my precious daughter?

458
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:18,836
How perfect could your son possibly be?

459
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,680
If you have such a precious daughter,

460
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:26,811
why did you steal from me
and say you were Se-ri’s father?

461
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:31,651
"Steal from you"?

462
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:34,123
Because I ate some gongjin-dan

463
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:36,645
and this much meat, I stole from you?

464
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:37,861
What else is it?

465
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:41,492
Both you and your daughter
are so pathetic and cheap.

466
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,290
Fine!

467
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:46,401
I’ll vomit everything I ate,

468
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:50,074
and I’m going to make sure
my daughter doesn’t accept your son!

469
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,699
Please do so!

470
00:32:57,608 --> 00:32:59,308
CHUNYEONG CLINIC

471
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:04,916
Hello, I’m the host of the third season
of Couple Making,

472
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,053
Kang Se-ri.

473
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:08,547
With the breeze of spring

474
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:11,559
young hearts are fluttering...

475
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:13,889
The new episode of Couple Making...

476
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:15,228
Dokgo, it's me!

477
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:18,958
Is it another replay of Couple Making?

478
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:23,631
They've been playing so many reruns,
and it's even on cable too.

479
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:27,111
If we add up all the reruns
on the main channel and on cable,

480
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:31,205
that means more than half of the country
has seen Gu Ae-jeong like that.

481
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:32,709
That's right.

482
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:37,320
So, the Couple Making production crew
decided to create a spin-off of the two.

483
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:39,215
-What?
-It's like a...

484
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:40,623
documentary about a real relationship.

485
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:42,622
Since they're already a huge hit,

486
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:45,517
ratings will soar once it airs!

487
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,600
You...

488
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:54,403
It’s going to be interesting
from the first date.

489
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:56,072
First date?

490
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:05,008
If they become an official couple,

491
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:08,849
they'll be portrayed as more tender lovers
than during Couple Making.

492
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:15,721
They'll be sent on their first trip, too!

493
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:19,656
No...

494
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:26,731
And the highlight of the trip
will be their first night together!

495
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,736
How can they air
that on public broadcasting?

496
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:35,135
If they do, I'll sue.

497
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:38,606
You're right, if it really happened,
they wouldn't be able to air it.

498
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:41,184
It's so unfortunate!

499
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:54,831
Oh, my stomach!

500
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:07,971
Damn it.

501
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:15,209
As Ms. Moon said,
you definitely seem more appealing now.

502
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:19,248
Pil-joo seemed like such a quiet guy.

503
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:22,017
Why did he suddenly turn proactive?

504
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:28,963
...and stop you from being swayed by him.

505
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:34,595
Was it that obvious
that I was being swayed by him?

506
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:40,672
You’ll meet with Pil-joo today
and confirm the show, right?

507
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:43,112
Yes, I should.

508
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,505
Do you want me to drop you off?

509
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:48,007
No, I said I would call him later.

510
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:52,117
Do you want me to go with you
as his in-law?

511
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:55,117
No, you guys should meet alone.

512
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:57,256
Just hurry and meet him.

513
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:01,964
Would it be better to hurry
and talk to him?

514
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:22,181
Even if I lay down azaleas,

515
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:25,147
I think she’ll stomp all over them.

516
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:31,816
Is this the next patient's chart?

517
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:33,419
No, it’s this one.

518
00:36:33,824 --> 00:36:34,834
Thanks.

519
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:40,703
I’m sorry.

520
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:44,497
I messed up again.

521
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:46,739
What’s wrong?
You’ve been like this all day.

522
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,909
I'm really nervous for something today.

523
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,454
You're sweating.

524
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:56,483
Pardon?

525
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:58,447
I’ve never seen you like this before.

526
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:00,279
This is a first for me as well.

527
00:37:20,137 --> 00:37:21,567
Hi, Jin. You're here.

528
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:23,809
What are you doing over there?

529
00:37:23,874 --> 00:37:27,754
I was told to sign for
the 1000 pairs of sneakers you donated.

530
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:29,582
They only need mine.

531
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:31,247
Yours isn’t necessary.

532
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:34,793
-Really? Then, should I just go?
-No!

533
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,390
I’m sure that out of the 1000 children

534
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,860
at least one of them
will want your autograph.

535
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:45,233
Good Ae-jeong. Don't go anywhere

536
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,930
and continue signing.

537
00:37:57,908 --> 00:38:01,878
You seemed
like a professional on television.

538
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:03,353
What do you mean?

539
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:06,084
You didn’t make a fuss
after receiving all the flowers.

540
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,920
It was classy.

541
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:10,685
You remained dignified and not affected.
That’s a pro.

542
00:38:15,926 --> 00:38:17,056
Is that how I looked?

543
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:18,695
I was really nervous.

544
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:24,735
I would've gotten 120 if I had that on.

545
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,208
Your heart must've...

546
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,910
been pounding hard enough
to reach your stomach to hit 120.

547
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:37,484
Guess lying about the pen was worth it.

548
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,179
Yes.

549
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:43,690
Lying that he'd found the pen
was him being honest.

550
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:48,826
I shouldn’t have thrown it
into the ball pool.

551
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:01,944
I guess it's because you sign a lot.

552
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,236
You sign really fast.

553
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:05,741
We’ll get through these really fast.

554
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:34,240
What?

555
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,910
I’m signing each one for my fans

556
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:43,509
by pressing all the love I have
into the signature.

557
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,320
There we go.

558
00:39:57,595 --> 00:39:58,655
Look!

559
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:01,896
"Gu Ae-jeong's hidden appeal" is
one of the most searched on the internet.

560
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:05,037
She's on television
and won Pil-joo's heart.

561
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:06,636
What if she makes it big?

562
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:10,374
She must be so confused
since two amazing men are after her.

563
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:14,082
I wonder if something like that
would've happened

564
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:15,748
if I stayed in the industry.

565
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,620
Jenny, how would you feel...

566
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:21,985
if two men...

567
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:25,218
pursued you at once?

568
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,063
I don't know.

569
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,530
I would take them both.

570
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:34,033
-She's a bad girl.
-She's a bad girl.

571
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:40,339
What's she doing here?

572
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:46,112
It’s been a long time, Jenny.

573
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:47,854
What are you doing here?

574
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,482
To see if Ae-jeong was here.

575
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:51,617
She’s not.

576
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,254
Is she out with Jin?

577
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,600
GU AE-JEONG

578
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,063
What’s that?

579
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:09,828
It’s a four-leaf clover.

580
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:13,701
I’m drawing it
to wish the people who get this good luck.

581
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:15,171
That’s so childish.

582
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:18,109
It would be better to throw in
another dollar in the box.

583
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:22,275
On the day of our debut,

584
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:26,180
one of the members, Mi-na,
found a four-leaf clover.

585
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:29,620
After that, we all became a huge success.

586
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:33,590
So, I believe that
four-leaf clovers bring good luck.

587
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:38,095
In the end, the four of you ripped apart.

588
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:42,432
But how did you end up
with such a bad reputation?

589
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:46,837
Just as everyone knows, I hit Se-ri.

590
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:48,314
Did you really hit her?

591
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:52,476
Yes, I was so mad
that my hand went up like this.

592
00:41:53,978 --> 00:41:56,878
You should’ve done it
when no one else was looking.

593
00:41:57,882 --> 00:42:00,682
Anyway, every time I see Se-ri,
it reminds me of that time

594
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:04,021
and makes me feel awkward,
and a bit uncomfortable.

595
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:07,419
Jin is the one that likes Ae-jeong.

596
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:09,488
Ae-jeong doesn't care for him.

597
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:11,961
Jin likes her?

598
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:16,269
For Ae-jeong,
things will work out well with Pil-joo.

599
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:21,407
So, make sure you two stay as a couple

600
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:23,512
and don’t drag Ae-jeong into it.

601
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:24,644
Why not?

602
00:42:25,342 --> 00:42:28,082
If Jin and I break up,

603
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:30,413
I'll blame it on Ae-jeong.

604
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:33,021
You are truly evil.

605
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:39,424
Did you forget how well Ae-jeong
used to take care of you?

606
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:41,560
I only remember getting hit by her.

607
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:43,455
Don't you know why she did that?

608
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,857
Don't you remember what you did to Mi-na?

609
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:49,573
Mi-na got sick and collapsed
because of you.

610
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:50,633
That's why...

611
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:53,936
Ae-jeong was angry at you.

612
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:56,514
Why are you bringing up the past

613
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,914
without any proof or witness?

614
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:02,176
If Han Mi-na shows up,
there will be a witness.

615
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:04,854
It won't be the past anymore.

616
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:10,488
NAME: HAN HYE-JIN

617
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:13,392
You made a late appointment.

618
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:23,765
It's better for her not to see me.

619
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:25,204
Please hide me!

620
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:27,140
It's nothing.

621
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,442
-Please get home safely.
-Okay.

622
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:35,214
You're right.

623
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:39,046
To be honest,
I considered finding a different clinic.

624
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:41,690
I saw you on television

625
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:44,053
and planned on avoiding you.

626
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:46,819
But after reading the news,

627
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:50,587
I thought I should see you at least once.

628
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:56,626
Because it seemed like you'd become
an important person in Ae-jeong’s life.

629
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,368
Are you here because of Ae-jeong?

630
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:01,074
Yes.

631
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:04,639
My previous name was Han Mi-na.

632
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:09,010
I was a member of National Treasure Girls
with Ae-jeong.

633
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:14,822
Don’t you think Mi-na sent this?

634
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:21,664
She vanished completely.

635
00:44:21,725 --> 00:44:25,625
Even if she did, if you harass Ae-jeong

636
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:27,363
I bet she'll reappear.

637
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:41,080
Do you want to drink this?

638
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:42,979
Thanks.

639
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:55,333
I feel queasy.

640
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:56,532
Is it indigestion?

641
00:44:56,593 --> 00:44:57,733
-Try this.
-Okay.

642
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:05,798
Mi-na!

643
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,669
-Goodness.
-Mi-na!

644
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:09,005
Are you okay?

645
00:45:09,673 --> 00:45:11,143
My stomach hurts so much.

646
00:45:11,575 --> 00:45:13,835
My stomach hurts so much!

647
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,310
Are you okay?

648
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:20,779
It was just a prank.

649
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:22,651
What did I do so wrong?

650
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:29,391
That was all your fault,

651
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:31,827
but Ae-jeong took all the blame for it.

652
00:45:32,596 --> 00:45:34,296
You should be grateful

653
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,832
that she kept her mouth shut.

654
00:45:37,768 --> 00:45:39,368
If you try to do something,

655
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:43,340
I’m going to find Mi-na
and expose everything.

656
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:46,481
I didn’t know Mi-na would get that sick,

657
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:50,208
and that Ae-jeong would break up
the group so easily.

658
00:45:51,648 --> 00:45:52,878
If I think about it,

659
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:56,520
Se-ri and I kept having misunderstandings.

660
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:59,024
Within our group of girls,

661
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:01,829
some of us grew closer than others,

662
00:46:01,892 --> 00:46:03,592
and shared secrets among ourselves.

663
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,630
We couldn't share them altogether.

664
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:09,734
I think that's how
the misunderstandings multiplied.

665
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:12,365
What kind of secrets?

666
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:16,739
What kind of secrets?

667
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:18,907
They wouldn’t be secrets if I told you.

668
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:20,936
Did you take all the blame

669
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:22,911
because you were too foolish
to defend yourself?

670
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:31,424
At the time, I thought
I could take full responsibility.

671
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:37,594
I didn't know it would make people
dislike me for the next ten years.

672
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:43,673
The fact that you’ve endured
all the hate for the past ten years...

673
00:46:45,035 --> 00:46:46,895
I think it's really amazing.

674
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:51,413
Are you really complimenting me?

675
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:54,108
You asked me whether I was scared
to become like you.

676
00:46:55,546 --> 00:46:56,606
I admit it.

677
00:46:58,215 --> 00:46:59,315
I'm always scared.

678
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:04,724
That's why it concerns me to see
you enduring those scary situations.

679
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:08,093
And it made me look twice at you.

680
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:11,162
Did you feel sorry for me?

681
00:47:11,228 --> 00:47:12,628
No!

682
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:15,770
This isn't pity, but...

683
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:21,939
How do I describe it?

684
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:25,835
Empathy?

685
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:29,548
Ding dong.

686
00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:43,232
It’s getting really hot.

687
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:47,867
This is nice and cool.

688
00:47:56,773 --> 00:47:59,113
The side with the picture is even cooler.

689
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:01,247
Press hard.

690
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:20,064
Ms. Moon, I’m at your office right now,
so let’s talk.

691
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:21,530
We may be here all night.

692
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:24,697
Press hard.

693
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:30,172
Should I do your autographs?

694
00:48:30,674 --> 00:48:32,844
Give it to me. Give it.

695
00:48:33,043 --> 00:48:34,613
-Really?
-Of course!

696
00:48:35,779 --> 00:48:38,349
You may be hard to get,
but your autograph is easy.

697
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:41,787
-Gu...
-That's not it.

698
00:48:41,852 --> 00:48:43,792
It's the same!

699
00:48:45,889 --> 00:48:46,919
The clover.

700
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:49,361
If Ae-jeong likes him,

701
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:53,496
then I guess I'll have to hold onto Jin
and not let go of him.

702
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:57,941
Then, Pil-joo will probably be treated
the way he treated me.

703
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:05,439
I can’t end things with Jin.

704
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:10,453
My show is in trouble because of Ae-jeong,

705
00:49:11,315 --> 00:49:13,115
and you want me to announce my breakup?

706
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:15,351
Absolutely not.

707
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:19,364
We have a contract.

708
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:22,090
If you force me to break it,

709
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:25,699
I'll round up the reporters and cry.

710
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:29,331
Ae-jeong is my savior.

711
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,500
Please treat her well.

712
00:49:32,035 --> 00:49:35,805
Yes, that's why I'm waiting for her.

713
00:49:36,573 --> 00:49:39,313
Do you want to know what she used to like?

714
00:49:46,717 --> 00:49:49,287
Ae-jeong, if your hand hurts,
take it easy.

715
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:50,693
We have all night.

716
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,785
PERFECT MAN

717
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:16,482
Hello?

718
00:50:20,584 --> 00:50:21,594
Yes.

719
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:25,661
Yes.

720
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:29,962
Yes.

721
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:38,036
That's three yes's.

722
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:42,374
Why can't you come?

723
00:50:42,906 --> 00:50:44,776
-Are you being held by Dokgo Jin?
-Yes.

724
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:49,150
Is he being pathetic and clingy to you?

725
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:51,307
Yes.

726
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:52,681
What an idiot.

727
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:55,590
Toss him a bone and hurry over.

728
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:58,089
-I'll be waiting.
-Yes.

729
00:51:12,302 --> 00:51:13,372
Ae-jeong.

730
00:51:14,371 --> 00:51:17,741
Agree to my three following questions.

731
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:21,482
I told you my heart
was an azalea flower, right?

732
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:22,752
Yes.

733
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:24,713
I told you not to step on it, right?

734
00:51:25,949 --> 00:51:26,779
Yes.

735
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:29,150
But you’re still standing on top of it.

736
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:32,819
Wouldn't it be better
if you just walked over it?

737
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:35,660
So what I'm saying is just...

738
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:37,933
go.

739
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:43,903
Okay.

740
00:52:04,554 --> 00:52:05,524
Hello?

741
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:07,186
Are you busy?

742
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:09,762
Yes.

743
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:11,900
I guess you’ll be late?

744
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:13,599
Yes.

745
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:15,197
Call me when you're on your way.

746
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:17,269
Yes.

747
00:52:31,214 --> 00:52:32,754
I'll finish this.

748
00:52:59,042 --> 00:53:00,942
During our National Treasure Girls days,

749
00:53:01,278 --> 00:53:03,978
the red bean pastries
from the bakery in front of our house

750
00:53:04,047 --> 00:53:05,477
were four-leaf clover-shaped.

751
00:53:05,615 --> 00:53:08,815
Ae-jeong really liked those.
She bought them often

752
00:53:08,885 --> 00:53:10,345
and shared them with us.

753
00:53:12,656 --> 00:53:14,786
She said we can share
the good luck that way.

754
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:19,026
Dr. Yun, buy some and share them with her.

755
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:26,339
I wanted to share them and impress her.

756
00:53:38,815 --> 00:53:42,985
GU AE-JEONG
DOKGO JIN

757
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:44,823
Are you on your way home?

758
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:50,826
Pil-joo, I'm almost home.

759
00:53:51,027 --> 00:53:53,927
Should we meet for a bit at Jenny's?

760
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:56,272
Yes.

761
00:53:58,935 --> 00:54:00,065
I was waiting for you.

762
00:54:05,942 --> 00:54:07,912
RED BEAN PASTRIES

763
00:54:10,714 --> 00:54:13,054
I heard these were really good.

764
00:54:14,384 --> 00:54:17,294
I received them as a gift
at the clinic today.

765
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:19,661
I love these pastries.

766
00:54:20,357 --> 00:54:21,657
It's from that bakery!

767
00:54:21,725 --> 00:54:23,255
-Really?
-Yes.

768
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:27,896
The National Treasure Girls
used to live in front of this place.

769
00:54:28,331 --> 00:54:31,301
It's so far from here.
I haven't had them in a long time.

770
00:54:31,368 --> 00:54:33,138
What a wonderful surprise!

771
00:54:34,037 --> 00:54:35,337
I'm glad you're happy.

772
00:54:37,374 --> 00:54:38,414
Please have one.

773
00:54:40,577 --> 00:54:43,347
These have to be shared.

774
00:54:43,647 --> 00:54:45,317
It’s shaped like a four-leaf clover.

775
00:54:46,182 --> 00:54:48,222
You shouldn't eat up good luck
by yourself.

776
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:49,748
It should be shared.

777
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:51,920
Have some.

778
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,830
Does that mean I’ll have a good day?

779
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:03,028
Since you're my good luck charm.

780
00:55:06,569 --> 00:55:09,509
Thank you for thinking of me
as your good luck charm.

781
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:13,614
You’re actually my good luck charm.

782
00:55:15,378 --> 00:55:18,078
You’re a real four-leaf clover.

783
00:55:19,716 --> 00:55:20,976
But inside of me...

784
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:25,059
there are cherry blossoms, camellias,

785
00:55:25,255 --> 00:55:27,585
and azaleas sprinkled around

786
00:55:28,558 --> 00:55:30,488
so it's hard to see the clover.

787
00:55:35,532 --> 00:55:38,132
You're right.
This looks too boring and average

788
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:40,138
to captivate a heart at once.

789
00:55:42,605 --> 00:55:45,635
But these types of bread are the best.

790
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:50,881
I think my heart's gone crazy
with the flowers.

791
00:55:52,248 --> 00:55:56,618
With time,
these do turn out to be the best.

792
00:56:07,897 --> 00:56:08,997
Ae-jeong,

793
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:12,642
should we extend our deadline?

794
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:15,506
If it's too hard to start
for real right now,

795
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:19,109
how about we start on television?

796
00:56:19,676 --> 00:56:21,176
Start on television?

797
00:56:21,244 --> 00:56:22,214
Yes.

798
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:25,149
You can do your professional gig.

799
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,975
I'll play the real me alongside you.

800
00:56:29,919 --> 00:56:31,649
I'm not losing anything.

801
00:56:33,022 --> 00:56:34,462
Because after time passes,

802
00:56:34,924 --> 00:56:38,064
the clover will turn out to be better.

803
00:56:51,274 --> 00:56:54,684
You're growing faster than I expected.

804
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:59,452
If the poison keeps growing,
won't you die?

805
00:57:14,364 --> 00:57:16,704
I didn't even go past my safety zone.

806
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:18,296
Why does it hurt so much?

807
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:22,510
One-sided love is poison, too.

808
00:57:23,673 --> 00:57:25,073
What if I end up dying?

809
00:57:26,509 --> 00:57:27,939
GWANGHYE MEDICAL CENTER

810
00:57:28,011 --> 00:57:30,151
Dr. Jeong is doing an emergency surgery.

811
00:57:30,413 --> 00:57:32,023
You'll have to wait an hour or two.

812
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:35,247
I'll wait.

813
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:59,110
Was he into girl groups?

814
00:58:03,847 --> 00:58:06,777
NATIONAL TREASURE GIRLS
"HEARTBEAT"

815
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:08,220
He has their CD, too.

816
00:58:11,554 --> 00:58:14,264
Dr. Jeong has an emergency surgery
at his hospital.

817
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:15,894
He has to take the helicopter now.

818
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:18,292
I think you have to go home today.

819
00:58:21,865 --> 00:58:26,195
Dr. Jeong listens to those
to relieve tension during his surgeries.

820
00:58:26,736 --> 00:58:29,006
Other doctors listen to classical music,

821
00:58:29,072 --> 00:58:31,812
but Dr. Jeong only listens
to girl group songs.

822
00:58:37,981 --> 00:58:38,981
Hold on!

823
00:58:42,952 --> 00:58:47,722
Did he ever listen to this song...

824
00:58:48,258 --> 00:58:50,028
My heart beats faster...

825
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:53,404
during his surgeries?

826
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:56,270
Yes. Only once in a while these days,

827
00:58:56,933 --> 00:58:58,543
but when it was a hit ten years ago

828
00:58:58,601 --> 00:59:00,871
he always had it on
during heart surgeries.

829
00:59:02,105 --> 00:59:03,505
During heart surgery

830
00:59:04,574 --> 00:59:05,814
ten years ago?

831
00:59:09,779 --> 00:59:12,079
If the song was played during my surgery,

832
00:59:12,448 --> 00:59:13,978
that explains everything.

833
00:59:43,613 --> 00:59:44,653
Doctor!

834
00:59:45,815 --> 00:59:47,315
It's Jin!

835
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:57,960
Doctor,

836
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:01,428
when you performed my heart surgery
ten years ago,

837
01:00:01,497 --> 01:00:05,537
did you play this song, “Heartbeat”
by the National Treasure Girls?

838
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:06,995
What?

839
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:09,510
I don’t have time to joke around.

840
01:00:10,173 --> 01:00:12,343
I'm going to save a heart
that’s about to stop.

841
01:00:13,242 --> 01:00:15,952
This is an important story
about my heart, too!

842
01:00:16,512 --> 01:00:17,682
Please try to remember.

843
01:00:18,181 --> 01:00:23,121
Did you play this song during my surgery?

844
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:34,728
NATIONAL TREASURE GIRLS
"HEARTBEAT"

845
01:00:36,699 --> 01:00:40,369
Doctor, isn't this song too distracting?

846
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:43,441
No, it's nice.

847
01:00:45,008 --> 01:00:47,038
They're saying their hearts
are beating fast.

848
01:00:48,044 --> 01:00:49,884
It's the perfect song

849
01:00:50,747 --> 01:00:52,477
for a patient getting heart surgery.

850
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:57,446
You're right!

851
01:00:58,388 --> 01:01:01,888
This song was playing
during your surgery ten years ago.

852
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:03,255
Are you sure?

853
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:06,856
Your surgery was one of my best ever.

854
01:01:07,463 --> 01:01:09,503
I remember everything about it.

855
01:01:14,303 --> 01:01:15,443
I see.

856
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:18,680
I see!

857
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:36,959
That's right. Ae-jeong didn't disarm me.

858
01:01:37,493 --> 01:01:39,333
I was hypnotized!

859
01:01:45,501 --> 01:01:48,841
Recovered!

860
01:01:52,608 --> 01:01:54,308
Recovered!

861
01:01:56,345 --> 01:01:59,345
Pil-joo said he would do it
if Ae-jeong is willing.

862
01:01:59,415 --> 01:02:00,875
The basic outline has been made.

863
01:02:02,018 --> 01:02:04,588
It's up to you now.

864
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:14,296
It’s not just
a small section of Couple Making.

865
01:02:15,098 --> 01:02:17,998
It can be as much as twenty minutes long.

866
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:19,167
Twenty minutes!

867
01:02:20,169 --> 01:02:22,469
If I do this,

868
01:02:22,538 --> 01:02:25,978
The entire nation
will watch me date Pil-joo, right?

869
01:02:26,809 --> 01:02:27,879
That's right.

870
01:02:28,778 --> 01:02:32,948
Ae-jeong, television is television,

871
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:37,050
but I really do hope
things work out with Pil-joo.

872
01:02:38,121 --> 01:02:40,291
Showing how things work out with him
on the show

873
01:02:41,023 --> 01:02:43,933
will help Jin find closure.

874
01:02:47,697 --> 01:02:48,797
Ae-hwan!

875
01:02:49,632 --> 01:02:50,632
Hi, Ae-jeong.

876
01:02:51,467 --> 01:02:54,067
Are you here with Jin?

877
01:02:54,137 --> 01:02:56,967
No, I came because of his documentary.

878
01:02:57,206 --> 01:02:58,776
Jin is sick and at the hospital.

879
01:02:58,841 --> 01:02:59,881
Sick?

880
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:01,609
Why didn't you go with him?

881
01:03:01,677 --> 01:03:03,307
He goes to the hospital alone.

882
01:03:03,579 --> 01:03:04,949
He hates appearing sick.

883
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:08,082
-Is it bad?
-He doesn't say.

884
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:09,687
Is he really sick?

885
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:12,819
Jin really hates hospitals.

886
01:03:13,556 --> 01:03:16,656
The fact that he went means
he's in a lot of pain.

887
01:03:22,698 --> 01:03:24,498
Is he very sick?

888
01:03:27,003 --> 01:03:29,113
Is your heart that weak?

889
01:03:30,706 --> 01:03:32,106
It hurts so much.

890
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:34,179
So you have to refrain.

891
01:03:34,243 --> 01:03:36,683
I told you my heart
was an azalea flower, right?

892
01:03:36,879 --> 01:03:37,709
Yes.

893
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:40,020
But you’re still standing on top of it.

894
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:43,793
Wouldn't it be better
if you just walked over it?

895
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,460
So what I'm saying is just...

896
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:48,720
go.

897
01:03:56,365 --> 01:03:57,565
Sneakers,

898
01:03:59,268 --> 01:04:02,308
you can't step on him, right?

899
01:04:05,942 --> 01:04:09,152
You're worried that he'll be hurt, right?

900
01:04:12,615 --> 01:04:14,145
You miss him, right?

901
01:04:19,956 --> 01:04:20,986
Ding dong.

902
01:04:36,505 --> 01:04:38,365
Will 6090 open the door?

903
01:04:40,509 --> 01:04:41,609
What should I do?

904
01:04:50,453 --> 01:04:51,523
Ae-jeong!

905
01:05:08,104 --> 01:05:09,414
The alarm has been disarmed.

906
01:05:15,278 --> 01:05:16,978
I heard you were sick. Are you okay?

907
01:05:18,014 --> 01:05:21,654
I need to confirm something first.

908
01:05:23,953 --> 01:05:27,023
AE-JEONG

909
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:36,370
AZALEA FLOWER

910
01:05:53,549 --> 01:05:55,849
As I thought, I'm back to normal.

911
01:05:56,585 --> 01:05:59,085
See. I'm between 60 and 90.

912
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:00,762
Normal, right?

913
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:06,059
Yes, does that mean you're better now?

914
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:07,158
That's right.

915
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:11,300
You'll be very happy to know this.

916
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:12,904
-What is it?
-Ae-jeong.

917
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:18,443
My heart doesn't beat faster
because of you anymore.

918
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:20,605
Why not?

919
01:06:20,676 --> 01:06:23,476
I don't have butterflies in my stomach
because of you anymore.

920
01:06:24,914 --> 01:06:25,924
Why not?

921
01:06:26,882 --> 01:06:29,022
There's only answer to all of this.

922
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:31,219
What do you think it is?

923
01:06:38,027 --> 01:06:39,057
So...

924
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:42,970
you don't like me anymore?

925
01:06:51,273 --> 01:06:52,273
Ding dong.

926
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:13,000
