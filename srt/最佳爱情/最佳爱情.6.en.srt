00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,180
Please watch the movie by yourself.
I don't want to go in.

4
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:15,730
Coming here is the most I can do.

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,320
I've come to my senses
and want to go back now.

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,360
I've bought the cola and popcorn you wanted.

7
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:23,880
I even bought potatoes.

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,940
Why are you acting like this?

9
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,440
I'm really, really, really afraid
of that potato.

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,650
Are you avoiding me because you're afraid
I'll catch your chicken and torment you?

11
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:35,410
That's right, I'm afraid.

12
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,900
I'm afraid of myself
for not avoiding your torments.

13
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,950
In fact, I don't even find it tormenting.

14
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,080
I really want to live my life
with a cool attitude.

15
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:49,720
I went through so much pain
throughout the years before I learnt that.

16
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,320
I'm really afraid
that even at such an age, I'll be moved,

17
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,490
making me forget all that I've learnt.

18
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,160
Dok Go Jin, your anger towards me might
have blinded you and made you fearless.

19
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:03,120
But what will you do
if I told you to catch hold of me?

20
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,100
So please put a stop to it right now.

21
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,710
Because you are my man

22
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,550
Because you are my love

23
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:20,150
After sending you away and letting go,
you still remain and make me cry

24
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:23,560
Because you are my man

25
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,680
[Fighter]

26
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,840
It's because you are still my man

27
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:35,110
I can't hold back these foolish tears

28
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,110
Gu...

29
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:02,370
I cannot live without you

30
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:07,580
I am fine even if it's hard or painful

31
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:12,500
I can't stop my love for you

32
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,450
I've caught hold of you.

33
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,560
It will never change
even if the world ends

34
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,450
What are you going to do now?

35
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,210
My love

36
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,630
Will you let yourself be caught

37
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,340
or will you run away?

38
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,630
I cannot live without you

39
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:29,650
I feel ashamed,
so I won't catch hold of you again.

40
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:32,880
I am fine even if it's hard or painful

41
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,760
What do you want?

42
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,250
To let go of you?

43
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,800
Should I let go?

44
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,930
Even if I am out of breath,
even if my heart stops

45
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,650
Everyone is looking.
How can you hold onto me like this?

46
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:42,810
Only if you are by my side

47
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,920
I'll be dead if someone sees us.

48
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:44,080
Let go of me before we get recognized!
Let go!

49
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:47,730
I love you, I'm just right here

50
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:50,250
Dok Go Jin, what are you doing?

51
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:52,840
Can you see or hear me?

52
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,860
Don't move.

53
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,270
It will be your fault
if people recognize us.

54
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,830
I can't stop my love for you

55
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,320
I can't see.

56
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,580
Don't show your face,
so they can't see you either.

57
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:02,760
It will never change
even if the world ends

58
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,170
Where are we going?

59
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,920
Follow me quietly.

60
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,200
I've caught hold of you.

61
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,860
My love

62
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,190
Oh... hey, hey.

63
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,210
So he was really here.

64
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,680
Since there are two cups,
he must have been with someone.

65
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,900
Who is she?
Is she also an actress?

66
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,790
Who is she?
Is she someone more famous than me?

67
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,240
It seems when it's time
for rumors to spread, they'll spread.

68
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,180
Those rumors of them breaking up
must have some truth.

69
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:29,330
Will they announce their breakup
during the broadcast of our show?

70
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,690
Dok Go Jin has to consider many factors,

71
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,140
so I guess he'll keep it under wraps
for the time being.

72
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:39,090
But... who do you think he's with?

73
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,830
Probably a top star
of the same the level as Kang Se Ri?

74
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:48,580
If rumors of them dating spread
before the breakup with Se Ri is announced,

75
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:52,550
that woman will become
the third party who came between them.

76
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,430
Third party?

77
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,810
If they had already broken up,
she wouldn't be a third party.

78
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,720
The parties involved may see it that way,
but others will see her as the third party.

79
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:05,370
People think that Dok Go Jin
and Kang Se Ri are still lovers.

80
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,640
No one will recognize you
and misunderstand things.

81
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:20,580
I can't say for sure if it was Shin Min Ah
or Han Ye Seul sitting here.

82
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:21,880
But you're Gu Ae Jeong...

83
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,760
Thank goodness I'm not a top star.

84
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:27,660
If you want to get into a scandal with me,
you should at least dress better.

85
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:31,720
Am I someone who get into scandals
with people dressed like that?

86
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,600
Thank goodness that I'm dressed so shabbily.

87
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,340
For someone who's not a top star
and dresses so shabbily,

88
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:40,280
how can you make Dok Go Jin so distressed?

89
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:43,310
You're doing a good job.

90
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,560
Dok Go Jin...

91
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,370
Is it that distressful for you to like me?

92
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,760
I've never liked anyone other than myself.

93
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,440
To find myself
liking someone else is distressful.

94
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:04,880
For that someone to be you of all people
is extremely shameful.

95
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,660
How distressful it must be...

96
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:11,230
to have felt so ashamed
and then be rejected.

97
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,990
Don't bring that up again.

98
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,810
It reminds me of the shock
I received at that time.

99
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:19,890
Was it that big of a shock? It seems
you've never thought I'd reject you.

100
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,600
Of course I haven't.

101
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,750
It would be akin to you receiving
a rice cake from heaven.

102
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,980
Wouldn't you bite into it eagerly?

103
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,200
- And if I bit into it?
- I would have let you do that.

104
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:31,660
I would have sobered up
from the pain of the bite.

105
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:35,040
If I had bitten into it at that time, you'd
have sobered up and ended this promptly?

106
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,140
That's right.

107
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:39,640
If you had bitten it immediately and ended
this promptly, it would have been so easy.

108
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,130
Really.

109
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,070
Immediately and promptly?

110
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,640
Sounds quite easy, doesn't it?

111
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,140
Don't change the meaning of my words
with your expressions.

112
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,370
Dok Go Jin...

113
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:59,460
You said you've never liked anyone
other than yourself.

114
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,520
That means I'm your first love.

115
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,590
Why are you saying that?
You're making me feel ashamed.

116
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,460
Shall I make you feel even more ashamed?

117
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:11,580
The first love you finally have at this age
shall forever remain one-sided.

118
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:17,540
I will never, never like you.

119
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,470
Hey...

120
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,570
Hey, hey, hey, Gu Ae Jeong!
Gu Ae Jeong, Gu Ae Jeong!

121
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,240
Let go!

122
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,070
I'll take back my words.
Let's do this all over again.

123
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,240
Usually, under such circumstances, we
have to first get you some branded dresses,

124
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,820
turn you into a beautiful princess
and change you from inside out.

125
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,730
I skipped that step.

126
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,420
Let's do that
before we come here again, okay?

127
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,600
I'll arrange that for you.

128
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,190
Don't leave.

129
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:51,140
If you have money for that,
just give it to me instead.

130
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,560
What?

131
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:55,380
I'll then be able to end this
simply and quickly

132
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,490
according to the outcome you wished for.

133
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,270
I'll accept rice cake to make you sober up
immediately and end this promptly.

134
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,940
Do what I wished for?
Try doing it.

135
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:07,360
Dok Go Jin, you look really easy.

136
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,550
Do you want to sleep with me?

137
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,810
What?

138
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,770
You sobered up immediately, right?

139
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,330
I'll leave promptly then.

140
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:22,200
Hey, Gu Ae...

141
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,610
I was really cool up to
when I caught hold of her.

142
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,530
Maybe I shouldn't have gone for the wine.

143
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:43,620
Now that I've let her know
how I found her easy,

144
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,890
things have gotten really difficult.

145
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:09,640
[Fighter]

146
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,790
During the coming studio recording,

147
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,490
we'll assign the outdoor date locations
during the Mission Match segment.

148
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,680
Now, look over here.

149
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:37,320
Sweet Picnic, Refreshing Hike,
Romantic Cruise, Luxury Dinner...

150
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:40,260
Since we won't know which of the four
you'll be assigned to,

151
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,740
please arrange for a more flexible schedule
during the week.

152
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:48,400
It seems everyone hasn't established
a clear screen persona yet,

153
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:51,830
especially Ae Jeong unni.

154
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:56,520
An irritating persona is quite interesting,
why don't you try to play that role?

155
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:59,970
Aren't you being too concerned about
being called unattractive by the viewers?

156
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:03,020
I'll try my best to be up in your face,
but in reaturn,

157
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,570
as the show's MC,
play along with the jokes for me.

158
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:05,590
Just like Yoo Jae Suk and Kang Ho Dong*,
(*well-known TV hosts in Korea)

159
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,200
join in alongside the participants.

160
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:11,720
And we can make things
more exciting together.

161
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,570
There's a Chicken Fight* game planned.
(*contestants on one leg knock each other)

162
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:20,310
When I ask you to join the Chicken Fight,
please accept the invitation. Please do.

163
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,480
That's right, the Chicken Fight
would be great to watch.

164
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,050
Today's filming looks like a sports meet.

165
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,580
The atmosphere is really heated up.

166
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:35,950
If you emerge champion, choose the hike
and get him to teach you to ride a bicycle.

167
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,730
I think that's probably
the most popular option.

168
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,420
What kind of comedic act
should I make today?

169
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,050
Well...

170
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:46,390
Oh, wait a moment.

171
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,710
Isn't this helium gas?

172
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,160
Look here.

173
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,560
Ae Jeong, isn't this funny?

174
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:56,820
Try this.

175
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,450
This is so funny!
Oppa, see me try it.

176
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,540
Oppa...
Oppa, oppa.

177
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,840
- This is funny! This is hilarious!
- Let's do this during the show.

178
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:08,160
- Oppa, oppa... Wow, this is so funny.
- It will be a hit.

179
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:11,280
I'll go speak to the producer.

180
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,820
Oppa.

181
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:16,260
Gu Ae Jeong.

182
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:18,720
Yoon Pil Joo.

183
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,210
What's wrong with your voice?

184
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,410
I inhaled some helium gas.

185
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:30,020
That day at the cinema, you must
have been quite shocked because of me.

186
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:33,320
I acted that way
because I had to hide for a reason.

187
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,210
- You're not upset, right?
- I'm not.

188
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:36,200
You feel it, don't you?

189
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,180
Thanks for your help.

190
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,080
You're trembling, aren't you?

191
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:39,920
Although I'm being serious,
my voice sounds really funny.

192
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:43,680
How much longer
must I try to read your mind?

193
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,270
I need to adjust it a little.

194
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,040
Tell me how you feel.

195
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,140
It sounds okay now, right?
It sounds okay.

196
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,510
Don't pretend to be indifferent.

197
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,970
This is really fun.

198
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,300
I'll give it a try too.

199
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,660
You don't have to do anything funny, right?

200
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:53,080
Do what your heart wants you to.

201
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:54,950
Are you asking me
to let you take the idea I thought up?

202
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,650
Catch hold of my hand right now.

203
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,300
I just want to try it once.

204
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,240
Are you really going to do it
during the show?

205
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,870
Quickly catch hold of my hand.

206
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,950
I've got to do it if it makes people laugh.
I'm an entertainer now too.

207
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,710
You feel it, don't you?

208
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,660
Gu Ae Jeong, is it funny?

209
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,590
You're trembling, aren't you?

210
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,730
You're such a solemn character,
this will surely make everyone laugh!

211
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:15,110
How much longer
must I try to read your mind?

212
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:15,060
Oh, no... but I'm a doctor
at the Oriental Medicine Hospital.

213
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,050
Who are you?

214
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,650
Tell me how you feel.

215
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:21,050
Don't pretend to be indifferent.

216
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:23,520
- This is really funny, Yoon Pil Joo!
- Is it... is it? Is it?!

217
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:24,860
Do what your heart wants you to.

218
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:27,130
Those two have really grown close.

219
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:27,300
Catch hold of my hand right now.

220
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:31,150
It seems he won't eliminate her
from the show anytime soon.

221
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:32,760
Just catch hold of my hand.

222
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:37,470
But is it okay to inhale too much of this?

223
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:38,640
Catch hold of my hand right now.

224
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,460
Gu Ae Jeong...

225
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,430
I'm really worried.

226
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,950
Inhaling too much of this
gives you a headache, right?

227
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,510
Yeah, I'm really worried
that you'll be really hurt.

228
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,280
I hope you won't be.

229
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,520
But if something happens to hurt you,
come to me.

230
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:57,400
I'll treat you.

231
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,540
Okay.

232
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:04,400
You seem like a really great doctor.

233
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:12,170
Are you sure you didn't see the woman
with Dok Go?

234
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,800
Yeah, I didn't see her.

235
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:18,200
I'm sure such a person exists.

236
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:20,000
Who can she be?

237
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:24,220
Representative Moon, what if Dok Go-nim
dates a kind of poop standard celebrity,

238
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,310
What will you do?

239
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,090
Dok Go? Is he such a person?
Will he lower his level like that?

240
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,470
I'm saying what if.

241
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,220
What if?

242
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:39,310
If that happens,
I'll send Dok Go to work overseas.

243
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,570
And I'll make sure the other party won't be
able to step into showbiz ever again.

244
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,370
Do you think Dok Go-nim
will let you have your way?

245
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,520
I'll have to do it
without his knowledge of course.

246
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,610
Isn't that the job of a management company?

247
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,000
I've worked so hard
to protect Dok Go's image.

248
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:57,230
I can't let that scorned artiste
destroy all of that.

249
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,640
Se Ri and her production team
went to the cinema

250
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:08,860
to watch your movie last night.
Did you see her?

251
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,410
No.

252
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:15,960
I didn't see Jae Seok secretly tagging
behind me on your orders either.

253
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,570
I think Se Ri wants to let the team
know of your close relationship.

254
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:26,030
She asked me to send flowers and a cake
to the filming studio in your name.

255
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,820
Today is the anniversary of the
official announcement of your relationship.

256
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,590
So just let her have her way.

257
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,660
What filming studio?
Is it for Couple Making?

258
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,180
Yes.

259
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:41,350
I'll personally bring
the flowers and cake there.

260
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,680
- Really?
- Yes.

261
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:46,970
I need to go take look
if I don't want to be rejected so promptly.

262
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,100
That's right.

263
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:51,430
The effect will be better
if you went personally.

264
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:57,030
Representative Moon, am I really that nasty?

265
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,790
Why did you ask that out of the blue?
You never worried about that.

266
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:05,700
I didn't... But this personality
often creates problems for me.

267
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,230
Difficult problems.

268
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:12,150
Dok Go Jin, there are things
too difficult for you?

269
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:17,410
Yeah, it's gradually becoming
extremely difficult.

270
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,730
We'll start right away.

271
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,670
Get ready.

272
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,900
Ready, Start!

273
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,080
[Chicken Fight]

274
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:28,650
The match has started.

275
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,100
Gu Ae Jeong's leg seems weak to me.

276
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,350
[Gu Ae Jeong wins!]

277
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:33,940
[Gu Ae Jeong wins!]

278
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:34,950
[Gu Ae Jeong wins!]

279
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,660
Will she be able to reach first place?

280
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,870
She did it!

281
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,570
The champion for today is Gu Ae Jeong!

282
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,040
Gu Ae Jeong, please say a few words...

283
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:49,450
Gu Ae Jeong's persistence and passion
is really shocking.

284
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:52,190
She must have been
the National Treasure Chicken!

285
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:58,070
No, the National Treasure Chicken
from our group was Kang Se Ri, not me.

286
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,310
How can that be?

287
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,290
This is the first time I've heard of it.
Is it true?

288
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:08,000
She was the best when it came
to Chicken Fight games on TV shows.

289
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:10,290
Didn't we shoot a commercial
as the National treasure Chicken?

290
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,580
Se Ri, you remember that right?

291
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,960
Yes.

292
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:17,070
Since we've all forgotten, there's no reason
not to dig that out and have a look!

293
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,640
Let's look at the old records!

294
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,530
Go search for
National Treasure Girls' chicken commercial.

295
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,430
Okay, we've just watched it.

296
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:31,520
That was ten years ago. Ten years ago!
We were really young.

297
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:37,130
And we have no reason not to see them
in a chicken fight either!

298
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:43,590
If the MC allows me to,
I'll challenge her to that.

299
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,110
I'll do my best
if that's what everyone wants to see.

300
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,290
But it won't be interesting
if we just compete like that.

301
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,830
Shall we add an incentive?

302
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:54,790
Shall we?

303
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,700
If Gu Ae Jeong wins,

304
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,390
she'll get to go on two dates.

305
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,310
If I win,

306
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:04,810
I'll go on the date on her behalf.

307
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,370
I'll just have to win, right?

308
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,770
I can't lose then.

309
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:14,300
The match is about to start.

310
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:18,920
Which of the two will become
the Chicken Queen?

311
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:20,470
Okay.

312
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,070
I'm getting nervous myself.

313
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,080
We're starting.

314
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,020
Get ready.

315
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,740
Ready, start!

316
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:32,380
Gu Ae Jeong has exerted herself a lot today

317
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,900
so the situation
is quite unfavorable for her.

318
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,270
But as for Kang Se Ri,

319
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,570
she hasn't played this in a while either.

320
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:43,810
So, who will emerge winner in the end?

321
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:48,290
- We can't tell right now.
- Gu Ae Jeong, Gu Ae Jeong.

322
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,160
Gu Ae Jeong! Gu Ae Jeong!

323
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:52,310
That's right.

324
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,720
I used to be the National Treasure Chicken.

325
00:16:55,730 --> 00:17:00,210
Despite that,
I didn't get to hold the chicken leg.

326
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:00,730
[Geudae Chicken]

327
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:08,330
Because of Geudae Chicken,
my heart goes "thump thump" forever.

328
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:15,780
I love only chicken,
my heart is filled with that rich taste.

329
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:23,740
Opening my arms widely,
I offer you this delicious chicken.

330
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:26,610
I will give you the greatest chicken.

331
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,580
Cut, cut!

332
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:30,680
Hey.
The chicken leg should be held by Ae Jeong.

333
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:33,560
Why is Se Ri holding it?

334
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:36,670
Se Ri, switch with Ae Jeong.

335
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,450
Se Ri, do you want to come to the front?

336
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:51,470
It's okay.
You're holding the chicken leg.

337
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,390
I'm holding the chicken wing
so I'll go to the back.

338
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,130
We're starting.

339
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,490
I offer you...

340
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:08,280
I will give you the greatest chicken.

341
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,310
- Kang Se Ri.
- Gu Ae Jeong.

342
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,110
Things are different now.

343
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:17,810

346
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,710
Gu Ae Jeong...

347
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:36,080
She's really strong.

348
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,100
Nice, nice.

[Refreshing Hike!]

351
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,650
Here.

352
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:49,350
Thanks.

353
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:54,020
You were really good
at the Chicken Fight game.

354
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:54,790
Was I?

355
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:59,370
It will affect a week's worth of screen time
so I tried hard like my life depended on it.

356
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:01,480
Are you good at riding the bicycle?

357
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:04,540
Actually, I can't ride bicycles.
I've got to practice.

358
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:08,230
Anyway, my screen persona
is one who is pushy and annoying.

359
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,340
So, even if I pestered you to teach me
how to ride, don't get upset.

360
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,700
Please react well to it.

361
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,240
Just do all you have to.

362
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,940
I'm an entertainer now too.

363
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,730
The Oriental Medicine physician
I respect most

364
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,730
is the Man of the Sun*, Doctor Lee Je Ma**.
(*drama about a **19th century doctor)

365
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,750
Why did I become an entertainer?

366
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:28,970
Lee Je Ma?

367
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,020
This line is really funny!

368
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:34,290
Can I bring this up in our conversation
during the show?

369
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,520
- Sure.
- I'll jolt this down.

370
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:41,830

371
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,620
Here.

372
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,810
Let me share with you
an interesting tagline I thought of.

373
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,950
The Man of the Sun,
Doctor Lee Je Ma, helps patients.

374
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,870
But the entertainer, Yoon Pil Joo,
helps Gu Ae Jeong.

375
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,020
That punch line catches on even better.

376
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,450
Thanks.

377
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,420
This is that precious pen of yours?

378
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,640
Yes.

379
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:09,730

I need to go look for Eun Ho hyung.

382
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:19,480
- Okay.
- I'll be back.

383
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,380
Yes.

384
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,950
He's really cool.

385
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,930
The Oriental Medicine physician,
Lee... Ma... Lee what?

386
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,080
Lee Je Ma.

387
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:38,660
You gave me a shock!
What are you doing?

388
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,290
Gu Ae Jeong, you're really good
at chicken fight.

389
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,450
You were just like a chicken.

390
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:48,050
Your chicken act was great.

391
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,900
Chicken act?

392
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:52,750
Is it that funny to see me
work hard to make a living?

393
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,540
Can't you say something more decent?

394
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,260
I am praising you.

395
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:00,190
I wanted to make a joke
out of the chicken analogy.

396
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,500
It's not funny at all.

397
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,010
You laughed so hard at the cold jokes
Yoon Pil Joo made.

398
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:10,730
Can't you just laugh along
for the chicken fight joke?

399
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:14,730
I laughed at Yoon Pil Joo's jokes
because they are funny.

400
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,620
That's true. You have to smile at him
to get into his good books. Work hard at it.

401
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:23,670
A pushy persona fits your image well too.
You've done a good job with the persona.

402
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,140
It will be a hit!

403
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:30,230
Are you saying
I have a pushy and easy image?

404
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,310
Are you mocking me?

405
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,000
I'm motivating you
and giving you some encouragement.

406
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,670
I don't feel encouraged by you at all.

407
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,430
If you're here to torment me again,
go over there. Over there!

408
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,480
I came to impress you.

409
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:47,050
I want to impress you so I did those
hard things to praise and encourage you.

410
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:50,200
I'm not taking you lightly,
insulting you or mocking you!

411
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,580
If you want to encourage me,
just watch the broadcast.

412
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:58,110
Oh, well...
Dok Go Jin's mouth is just like a butthole

413
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,150
so it's expected that whatever you say
turns out that way.

414
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,500
But still, just hold it in,
just hold it in a little.

415
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,470
When your real butthole
feels like letting it out,

416
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,260
you'll also hold it in
until you reach the bathroom, right?

417
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:10,100
So, when your mouth wants to let it out,

418
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:13,510
just hold it in a bit
and ask yourself if you should let it out.

419
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,520
Assess the situation before you let it out.

420
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:22,660
You're giving me an advice now, right?

421
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,660
When you give advice,
you ought to make it sound good.

422
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:28,070
Although I want to say
words coming from the messy Gu Ae Jeong

423
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:34,040
are expected to sound foul,
I'll surely hold it in and not say it out.

424
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:38,390
That's right. In any case,
thanks for the praise and encouragement.

425
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,000
I'll work hard
so as to survive till the end.

426
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:44,560
I'll surely end up as a couple
with Yoon Pil Joo.

427
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:46,400
What?
End up as a what with who?

428
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:47,960
Couple... a couple.

429
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:51,330
Isn't this show called Couple Making?

430
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:54,680
Oh, yeah...
The show is about that.

431
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:57,760
Well, I think I'll be able to make it.

432
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:01,650
Yoon Pil Joo seems to have
a good impression of me.

433
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:06,310
It will be great
if I could survive till the end.

434

435
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:12,110
This belongs to that
Oriental Medicine physician, right?

436
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,390
- Yes.
- Give it to me.

He said that
it's a very precious gift from someone.

439
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:28,650
He'll be very angry with you
if you lost this.

440
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:31,260
I think so.

441
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:40,690
What are you doing?

442
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,790
Tell him you lost it
so that he'll be angry with you.

443
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,760
Why?

444
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:48,390
Because you have to like me.

445
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,240
Drop out of this show immediately.

446
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:56,060

450
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,350
What should I do?

451
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,950
How can I find it?

452
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:21,030
How can I find it
when there are so many balls?

453
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,640
Is it a surprise for Se Ri?

454

as portrayed by his image.

00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,240
Yes, he always treats Kang Se Ri this way.

456

and won't come out from her van.

Just calm down
and let me explain the situation to you.

towards me.

00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:21,290
What do you expect me to do
by directing the issue towards me?

517
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:27,190
- Take this.
- Okay.

518
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:38,810
Regarding your declaration
that you'll never, never like me...

519
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:41,240
It's really a pity.

Where are you going?

523
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,120
She's really strange.

524
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:00,410
How annoying.

525
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,620
Top Star, Mr. A, was preparing
a surprise event for his lover Ms. B

526
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:21,850
when he got humiliated by Ms. C
for no reason.

527
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:25,580
Ms. C, who had been bearing a grudge
towards Mr. A,

528
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:28,430
even took a studio prop
and swung it around threateningly,

529
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,330
astonishing the staff who were looking on.

530
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:35,860
Ms. C and Ms. B were previously
in the same girl group.

531
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:38,590
Ms. C is first on search rankings.

532
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:42,490
But the search term below that
is Gu Ae Jeong.

533
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,860
Netizens are really scary.

534
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:50,250
Anyone reading this
can tell that it's Ae Jeong.

535
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:55,610
Ae Jeong, you've got to eat.

536

I will never, never like you.

543

Who asked you to come say those things?

544
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:03,150
Why is this so difficult to handle?

545
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,000
I'm really sorry.

546
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:11,180
I've asked the prop master to contact me
when they start to clear the ball pit.

547
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:12,480
I'll find it for you then.

548
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:16,990
Let's look for it together when they clear
the pit. Didn't you lose your sneakers too?

549
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,130
I really don't know why I'm so unlucky.

550
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:22,960
My chest feels so tight,
I'm going to die from it.

Don't stop that,
please continue to press on that spot.

What?

553
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:31,580
There is an accupoint over here.
Pressing it helps to ease chest pain.

554
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:34,550
You're giving yourself treatment unknowingly
based on your instincts.

555
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,320
I don't know why but my hand
just presses here without me knowing.

to keep themselves going.

Of course.

560
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:48,720
The most important thing
in a course of treatment is trust.

00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:52,870

that I can trust what you say.

Didn't I ask you to help me out?

- I said I got it.

So take note of it.

579
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:33,730
Is it because of the report
on Mr. A and Ms. B?

580
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:36,550
Wasn't Ms. C the only one affected?

581
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,150
That's right.

582
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,740
Ms. C was the only one sacrificed.

She was also like that in the past.

When?

587
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,480
When we were part
of National Treasure Girls.

588
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:53,780
The day when she yelled at me

589

- What did you do to provoke her that day?
- What?

591
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,750
Gu Ae Jeong must have acted that way
because you provoked her.

592
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,260
I didn't do anything.

593
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:07,840
Just like how she scolded you
although you didn't do anything to her...

594
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:10,510

596
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:15,270

Thinking that I did the same thing as you
makes me feel shameful.

that she hates you as much too,

just avoid each other.

after that incident too.

00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:38,940
We shouldn't speak to strangers.

691
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,130
He's Dok Go Jin.

692
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,280
Dok Go Jin?

693
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:42,240
You're lying!

694
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:44,030
He's really Dok Go Jin.

695
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,120
You're lying.

696
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:46,960
He's really Dok Go Jin.

697
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:48,180
You're lying.

698
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:50,960
It's not a lie!

699
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:07,410
I am Dok Go Jin.

700
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:10,220
And we know each other.

701
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,070
If you have a cell phone,
you can use it to take photos.

702
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,060
Really?

703
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:16,910
Yes, take some photos as proof.

704
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:21,220
And tell the whole neighborhood
how amazing this kid is.

705
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:22,710
Come on!

706
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:24,850
Come on!

707
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,970
Come on!

708
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,640
Come on!

709
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:33,710
Got it, Aunt.

710
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:37,610
I told her to come pick me up
so she'll come over.

711
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:40,250
Okay, good job.

712
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:45,870
Your aunt is also an entertainer.
Don't your friends know about it?

713
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,450
I didn't tell them about it.

714
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:50,110
Aunt told me not to tell anyone.

715
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,790
That's true.

716
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:56,750
Entertainers who are disliked
will cause even their family to get scorned.

717
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,940
Hey, Ding Dong.

718
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:02,170
It's okay for you to tell everyone
that we're close.

719
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:04,830
I'll send you a 100 autographs
to distribute in class.

720
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,430
Thank you.

721
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,690
What is this?

722
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,160
A lie detector.

723
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:16,010
Let me have a look.

724
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:23,820
If you lie, a red light will flash
and it will say you're lying.

725
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:26,720
You're lying, huh?

726
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:28,130
You shouldn't lie.

727
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:32,930
So it's a lie detector
which lied about being a lie detector.

728
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:37,640
But saying we're close although we aren't
is lying, right?

729
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:40,260
Is it okay for me to lie?

730
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,000
Say that you're close to me.

731
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:44,150
We're close.

732
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:46,060
The red light didn't flash.

733
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:49,630
Since this isn't a lie, you can say that.

734
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:50,800
Answer me, Ding Dong.

735
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:51,890
Okay.

736
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,150
That's right, that's right.

737
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:02,130
Security is disarmed.

738
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:13,400
Where is Hyung Gyu?

739
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:21,550
Hyung Gyu.

740
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,170
Hyung Gyu.

741
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:26,020
Let's go. Get up.

742
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,230
What are you up to?

743
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,450
Did you make me come pick up the child
because I didn't answer your phone calls?

744
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,020
I didn't.

745
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:35,260
I met him on the street
and he insisted on following me,

746
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:38,160
so I had no choice but to bring him back.

747
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,930
Do you think I waited
in front of your nephew's school

748
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:48,910
and told him to make a phone call to you
just to get you to come over?

749
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,790
I am Dok Go Jin.

750
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,290
After you said you'll never...

751
00:41:56,020 --> 00:42:01,100
never like me, do you expect
I'll do such things for you?

752
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:01,870
Never mind if you didn't.

753
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:05,380
That's right... I didn't.

754
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:08,030
I won't catch hold of you from now on.

755
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:10,870
Yeah, don't catch hold of me.

756
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,330
How great...

757
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:16,730
- You're disappointed, aren't you?
- What?

758
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:19,600
You're now at a loss because I said
I won't catch hold of you, right?

759
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:21,410
What are you talking about?
I am not.

760
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:22,910
Don't lie.

761
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,460
I'm not lying.

762
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:31,430
This is a lie detector.

763
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,300
If you lie,
it will beep and a red light will flash.

764
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:36,500
Speak the truth.

765
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:39,080
What are you doing with a toy?

766
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:41,220
Yeah, the child is precious to you,
isn't he?

767
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:42,710
Look at your Ding Dong while you speak.

768
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:48,720
If you lie, Ding Dong will grow up
with the same physique.

769
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:52,730
What?

770
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:56,310
If you want your Ding Dong
to possess a physique like mine,

771
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,570
don't lie and just speak the truth.

772
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:01,090
You're disappointed, aren't you?

773
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:11,630
You're disappointed because I said
I won't catch hold of you, right?

774
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,260
I am not.

775
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:15,200
You're lying huh?

776
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:18,190
- You shouldn't lie.
- It was a lie, wasn't it?

777
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,450
Take it away.

778
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:22,550
- It was a lie, right?
- Take it away!

779
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:25,160
Are you okay?

780
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:29,630
I got hit by *Pororo's head. (*Korean
cartoon character on the lie detector)

781
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:33,230
It's really painful.

782
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,900
It's swelling.

783
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:37,330
Are you okay?

784
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:41,320
I'm not okay.
My eyeball is swelling up.

785
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,410
Dok Go Jin was hit by Pororo.

786
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:49,080
That's better than saying
you got hit by Gu Ae Jeong.

787
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:52,020
At least Pororo is a top star.

788
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,860
But it's really a little red.

789
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:59,330
Did the small blood capillaries burst?

790
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:02,400
I need to attend some promotional events
in Japan tomorrow.

791
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,020
Let me take a look.

792
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,730
Look straight at me, look straight.

793
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:26,180
It looks okay.

794
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:27,940
Look at this side.

795
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,660
That side.

796
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:36,930
I think that side is fine too.

797
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:39,690
This side...
This side is red.

798
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:44,320
I think it seems okay on closer examination.
What a relief.

799
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:56,710
Gu Ae Jeong...

800
00:44:56,970 --> 00:45:00,050
It's my turn to say something.

801
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:03,620
You be the lie detector.

802
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:09,880
I find... Gu Ae Jeong difficult.

803
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:14,160
She's not at all easy.

804
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,330
She's really difficult.

805
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:33,190
If I were to find that
Oriental Medicine doctor's pen...

806
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:38,390
Will you take back your comment
about never liking me?

807
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:42,040
If you find it, I'll forgive you.

808
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:44,240
Only forgive?

809
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:45,920
That's right.

810
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:47,750
You hate being seen as easy.

811
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,710
It will be shameful for you to take back
those words so easily.

812
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:54,200
I'll have to make it such that

813
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:56,880
you can take them back
without being embarrassed.

814
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:02,490
I'll be in Japan for Fighter's
movie promotion from tomorrow onwards.

815
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:05,320
There is something I hope you can do for me.

816
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:10,040
Come and feed them.

817
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:14,480
Why are you asking me to do that?

818
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:18,430
I'll activate the security system
before I leave.

819
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:23,210
You're the only person
who knows the code for disarming it.

820
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:25,540
You didn't change that 6090 code?

821
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:27,890
Yes, only you can come in.

822
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,640
I've never told anyone the security code.

823
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:33,090
If you don't come,
they'll all starve to death.

824
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:36,350
Don't hold me responsible
even if they starved to death.

825
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:40,500
Why should I go in and out
of Dok Go Jin's world?

826
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:51,120
Use the lie detector against your heart.

827
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:56,170
Then, you will come into my world.

828
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:11,780
Use the lie detector against your heart.

829
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:16,250
I will never, never like Dok Go Jin.

830
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:17,640
You're lying huh?

831
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:19,620
You shouldn't lie.

832
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:22,980
You shouldn't lie.

833
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:50,750
She will find this
after feeding them a few times.

834
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,610
When she finds it,

835
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:57,740
she'll be able to forgive me and take back
her words without embarrassment.

836
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:05,690
Where should I say I found this
so that she won't see through my lie?

837
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:11,060
This is difficult.

838
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:16,730
She will only feel at ease
if we manage to recover it.

839
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:21,260
Hey. Hey, Hyung Gyu.

840
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:23,640
Did you really go to Dok Go Jin's house?

841
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:25,560
Yeah, we're really close!

842
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:27,220
I'm not asking you that.

843
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:30,620
Er... What did your aunt
and Dok Go Jin talk about?

844
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:32,470
I didn't hear their conversation.

845
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,850
You ought to listen!

846
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:41,090
Dok Go Jin is really popular in Japan.

847
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:44,890
If Dok Go Jin appears in your music video
for your new album,

848
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:48,160
maybe you can also ride on the Hallyu wave.

849
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:51,540
Manager Gu, don't count your chicken
before they are hatched.

850
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:54,730
Ae Jeong, don't think that I'm unaware.

851
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:57,880
The phone number stored under
"Camellia Flower" belongs to Dok Go Jin.

852
00:48:57,890 --> 00:48:59,980
When will the flower bloom?

853
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:02,880
Thinking too far ahead
will make you lose grip on reality.

854
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:04,300
Unni.

855
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:08,680
Let's take a photo here for today's post on
Me2Day*.(*microblogging similar to Twitter)

856
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,880
Wait, wait a moment.

857
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:14,760
- Give me the eye drops from France.
- Okay.

858
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:19,720
Are you really going to announce
your breakup with Dok Go Jin soon?

859
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:24,220
Yeah... I need to make myself
look distressed before that

860
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:26,900
so that I can get more sympathy
and receive less censure.

861
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:30,370
Then what about
the one billion won commercial?

862
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:34,350
I don't know either.
Thinking about it makes me feel like crying.

863
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:37,860
It's upsetting.
Take the photo.

864
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,120
That will do, right?

865
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:45,230
It's upsetting.

866
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:56,670
The security system is disarmed.

867
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,930
Hello...

868
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,400
I just came to feed you all.

869
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:26,810
Your owner
lost a one billion won commercial.

870
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:30,450
He'll be so upset
if he sees you starved, won't he?

871
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:34,930
I feel really guilty
because it seems to be my fault, so I came.

872
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:37,410
Eat more.

873
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:44,560
Please help by looking after Ae Jeong.
She's going to release an album soon.

874
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:48,190
Please broadcast our music video
after your show.

875
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,380
Gu Ae Jeong is going to release an album?

876
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:54,670
As for her music video,
we're thinking of getting a top star...

877
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:59,100
someone on the level of Dok Go Jin
to appear in it.

878
00:50:59,110 --> 00:51:01,830
Isn't their relationship very bad?

879
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,810
That's not true.

880
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:06,030
Did Manager Gu say that?

881
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,790
Representative Moon...

882
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:11,450
As someone who has been watching
Gu Ae Jeong since her debut,

883
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:13,520
I'll give you a piece of advice.

884
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:15,310
Please don't invest too much effort
into Gu Ae Jeong.

885
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:18,770
If you're referring to scandals around
Gu Ae Jeong, I'm well aware of them.

886
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:20,240
No.

887
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:23,670
Do you know the real reason
National Treasure Girls broke up?

888
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:28,540
When National Treasure Girls broke up,
other than the disharmony with Kang Se Ri,

889
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:30,790
were there other problems?

890
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,030
Things that happened between
me and Ae Jeong unni in the past?

891
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,820
Dok Go oppa also asked me that before.

892
00:51:34,830 --> 00:51:37,920
Dok Go asked you about Gu Ae Jeong?

893
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:41,440
Are you trying to look into my past scandals
in order to settle the relationship for us?

894
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:42,250
Settle what?

895
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:45,160
Dok Go oppa said
he wants to settle things between us.

896
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:46,290
Haven't you heard about it from him?

897
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,860
When did he say that?

898
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:52,400
He said that when we hit the tabloids
because of Ae Jeong unni.

899
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:57,780
What exactly did Gu Ae Jeong
say to Dok Go at the studio?

900
00:51:57,790 --> 00:52:00,240
She barged in and started yelling at him.

901
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:04,380
I heard her saying
that she will never, never like him.

902
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:06,250
Did she?

903
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:16,490
Was Dok Go referring to Gu Ae Jeong
when he said it was difficult?

904
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:21,450
How can that be?
That can't be...

905
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:26,600
[Gu Ae Jeong]

906
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:30,120
Children, your food is coming.

907
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:52,430
I'll fill this up before I go.

908
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,380
Thankfully, we came back
earlier than planned

909
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:06,520
So we didn't get delayed at the airport.

910
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:09,430
Are you feeling unwell?

911
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:12,040
I always feel unwell
after riding an airplane.

912
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:12,940
Do you want to go to the hospital?

913
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:15,630
It's okay, take me home.

914
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:22,970
The fish feed
should have decreased by a lot.

915
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:32,700
It didn't decrease at all.

916
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:34,120
What does this mean?

917
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:36,560
She didn't come at all?

918
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:40,710
And you all starved the entire time?

919
00:53:52,410 --> 00:53:54,560
The sender is MBS's Prop Storage Room.

920
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:55,570
[Gu Ae Jeong]

921
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:58,020
And the receiver is Gu Ae Jeong, right?

922
00:53:58,030 --> 00:53:58,870
Yes.

923
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,110
Courier delivery.

924
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:03,110
You feel it, don't you?

925
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:03,680
- Thanks for your hard work.
- Goodbye.

926
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,930
You're trembling, aren't you?

927
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:05,140
Yeah.

928
00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:10,520
How much longer
must I try to read your mind?

929
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:13,100
Tell me how you feel.

930
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:16,390
Don't pretend to be indifferent.

931
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:20,210
Do what your heart wants you to.

932
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:20,510
This is Yoon Pil Joo's pen!

933
00:54:20,210 --> 00:54:22,780
Catch hold of my hand right now.

934
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,620
They found it!

935
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,360
See, I was right.

936
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:27,820
Quickly catch hold of my hand.

937
00:54:26,370 --> 00:54:30,840
Someone from the Prop Storage Room found it
and sent it to my house.

938
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:33,500
This is yours, right?

939
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:37,540
Every time I happen to turn my head around,

940
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:37,170
Wow, this is my pen.

941
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:38,610
Thank to you, I got it back.

942
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:41,490
Our eyes will meet.

943
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:42,680
It was because of me that you lost it.
I'm really sorry.

944
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:46,520
Since we've recovered it already,
you don't have to feel sorry anymore.

945
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,570
That scene keeps appearing in my dreams,

946
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:47,540
Does your heart feel more at ease now?

947
00:54:46,570 --> 00:54:51,640
Bothering me all night.

948
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:49,590
I was really worried.

949
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,060
Isn't this very expensive?

950
00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:54,640
Since I recovered it thanks to you,
I'll treat you to a meal.

951
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:54,310
You feel it, don't you?

952
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:56,240
You're trembling, aren't you?

953
00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:58,230
I'll buy you the most delicious dish at the
restaurant you said your best friend runs.

954
00:54:56,240 --> 00:55:01,710
How much longer
must I try to read your mind?

955
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,800
Can I accept the treat?

956
00:54:59,810 --> 00:55:01,380
Isn't this a very expensive pen?

957
00:55:01,390 --> 00:55:03,200
That's true.

958
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:04,250
Tell me how you feel.

959
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:07,650
Don't pretend to be indifferent.

960
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:07,070
[To our son]

961
00:55:08,270 --> 00:55:12,380
Do I have to give this to her personally?

962
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,880
Dok Go Jin!
What are you doing here?

963
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:35,570
What are you doing here, Manager Gu?

964
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:36,770
What?

965
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:39,880
Aren't we in front of my house?

966
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,320
Are you here to see Ae Jeong?

967
00:55:43,330 --> 00:55:47,110
I came to give her something.

968
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:50,290
Ae Jeong is at Jenny's restaurant right now.

969
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:51,860
Is that so?

970
00:55:51,870 --> 00:55:53,320
Are you going over?

971
00:55:53,330 --> 00:55:55,190
Yes, because
I have something to give to her.

972
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:59,950
Hey, hey, don't go.
Just go up and wait for her.

973
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:03,390
Ae Jeong is waiting for the
Oriental Medicine doctor right now.

974
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,100
Who?

975
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:07,640
The one who's participating
in the same TV show with her...

976
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:12,870
They aren't really close but Ae Jeong found
something of his which she previously lost.

977
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:16,170
So he's treating her to dinner.

978
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:19,070
Well, please go up.

979
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:22,850
I have something
to discuss with you too.

980
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:23,720
What discussion?

981
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:29,150
After a short while,
Ae Jeong will be releasing an album.

982
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,970
So, regarding the music video
and promotion events,

983
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:34,190
there are some things
I want to discuss with you.

984
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:37,170
Discuss that with Representative Moon.

985
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:43,600
Yoon Pil Joo is coming
so please serve a delicious pizza.

986
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:45,140
Add more toppings.

987
00:56:45,150 --> 00:56:49,780
Don't worry.
I'm a "Pil-follower."

988
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:53,370
Pil-follower?

989
00:56:56,810 --> 00:56:57,980
[Camellia Flower]

990
00:56:57,990 --> 00:56:59,170
Oh.

991
00:57:02,370 --> 00:57:04,160
Are you in Japan?

992
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:05,430
What are you doing?

993
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,340
I'm having dinner out.

994
00:57:07,350 --> 00:57:09,000
With whom?

995
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:13,640
Yoon Pil Joo is treating me to dinner.

996
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:15,940
That Oriental Medicine doctor?

997
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:21,550
You lost that person's precious pen
yet he's treating you to dinner?

998
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:24,620
Because I recovered his pen.

999
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:28,020
- Did you really recover it?
- Yeah.

1000
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:31,360
So, you asked him to treat you to dinner
because you recovered his pen?

1001
00:57:31,370 --> 00:57:33,650
Well, I found it.
It's very expensive.

1002
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:37,830
You must have impressed him a lot
by helping him recover that expensive pen.

1003
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:40,180
I have to impress him,
we're on the same show.

1004
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:43,740
You really put in a lot of effort
just to impress him.

1005
00:57:44,430 --> 00:57:46,850
Keep it up.

1006
00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:52,520
He hung up?

1007
00:57:57,380 --> 00:58:01,080
In order to impress that man...

1008
00:58:01,890 --> 00:58:03,760
she lied?

1009
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:19,260
Ae Jeong?

1010
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:20,030
Yes, Oppa.

1011
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:21,230
Did you meet Dok Go Jin?

1012
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:23,160
Nope, isn't he in Japan?

1013
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:26,120
What do you mean?
I met him in front of our house.

1014
00:58:26,130 --> 00:58:28,700
He said that he has something for you so
I told him you're there. Didn't he go there?

1015
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:31,850
- He didn't come.
- Is that so?

1016
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:34,430
Anyway, since he's going to meet you,

1017
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:38,460
when you see him, bring up the issue
of the album and music video.

1018
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:40,390
- You must, okay?
- Oppa, please stop it.

1019
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,930
Goodbye.

1020
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:44,510
Aigoo, seriously...

1021
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:47,540
Did he come?

1022
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:55,780
He knows that I am here.
Why did he just hang up like that?

1023
00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:01,370
He must have gotten angry upon hearing
that I was dining with Yoon Pil Joo.

1024
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:15,250
I'm leaving right now.

1025
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:18,840
- I'll get there in about 10 minutes.
- It's a relief that you're not out yet.

1026
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:22,180
Can we eat together another time instead?

1027
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:23,970
Oh, okay...

1028
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:26,700
I'll treat you next time.

1029
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:28,030
I'm sorry.

1030
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:29,670
It's okay.

1031
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:32,460
Okay.

1032
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:46,080
Since I said I'll forgive you if I recover
the pen, I guess I'll have to forgive you.

1033
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:54,690
Potatoes...

1034
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:14,040
Since I fed the fish,
shall I also feed their owner?

1035
01:00:16,830 --> 01:00:20,740
She's being so difficult towards me,

1036
01:00:21,370 --> 01:00:26,130
but she can lie so easily
for that Oriental Medicine doctor.

1037
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:37,410
I was too easily disarmed.

1038
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,340
[Manager Gu]

1039
01:00:48,530 --> 01:00:49,470
What's the matter?

1040
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:50,380
Dok Go Jin...

1041
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:54,010
If you meet Ae Jeong later,

1042
01:00:54,020 --> 01:00:55,570
please give her a clear answer

1043
01:00:55,580 --> 01:01:00,370
regarding the music video and album
I mentioned to you earlier.

1044
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:01,080
What?

1045
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:06,990
Well... Ae Jeong seems to find it difficult
to broach the subject to you directly.

1046
01:01:10,510 --> 01:01:12,700
He hung up so quickly.

1047
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:21,170
Dok Go Jin.

1048
01:01:25,230 --> 01:01:27,640
The security system is disarmed.

1049
01:01:29,830 --> 01:01:32,570
Hi, I'm here, Dok Go Jin.

1050
01:01:33,830 --> 01:01:36,450
You came? What about
the Oriental Medicine doctor?

1051
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:38,640
The appointment was cancelled.

1052
01:01:38,650 --> 01:01:41,070
I heard that you came to our house?
My brother told me.

1053
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,730
So?

1054
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:46,120
Since you went all the way to the house,

1055
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:49,050
I thought that it was something important,
so I came over.

1056
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:54,890
I have nothing to see you about. Is there
anything you want to see me about?

1057
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:58,710
You brother wanted to discuss
the music video and album with me.

1058
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,980
Are you here to discuss it with me
personally?

1059
01:02:00,990 --> 01:02:04,930
Gu Ae Jeong, do I look that easy to you?

1060
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:07,650
It's not about that.

1061
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,620
I came to forgive you
and take back my words.

1062
01:02:12,050 --> 01:02:13,570
Because I recovered that pen.

1063
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:16,470
Stop lying and...

1064
01:02:16,770 --> 01:02:19,760
cut to the chase about your requests.

1065
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:23,830
- What's with you?
- Shall I put it in simpler terms?

1066
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:25,240
Gu Ae Jeong...

1067
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:29,970
I'll help you put out your album
and shoot the music video.

1068
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:34,590
- So sleep here tonight.
- What?

1069
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:37,490
I've come to find you easy too
so I'm asking you to sleep here tonight.

1070
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:41,300
Let's just end it here, easily and quickly,
okay?

1071
01:02:48,670 --> 01:02:51,360
I guess I shouldn't have come here.

1072
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:26,730
I had a great meal.

1073
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:27,880
Was it delicious?

1074
01:03:27,890 --> 01:03:29,400
It was really delicious.

1075
01:03:29,410 --> 01:03:33,020
Please come again with Ae Jeong next time.

1076
01:03:33,030 --> 01:03:34,840
Okay.
I'll be going then.

1077
01:03:34,850 --> 01:03:37,560
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1078
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:52,920
Gu Ae Jeong.

1079
01:04:01,180 --> 01:04:04,450
Please just pretend that you didn't see me.

1080
01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:10,360
This is embarrassing.

1081
01:04:12,330 --> 01:04:19,090
I seem to have something in my eyes

1082
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,210
What's wrong?

1083
01:04:15,220 --> 01:04:18,340
I'm just feeling a little unwell.

1084
01:04:18,990 --> 01:04:22,410
I'm feeling unwell so my tears just...

1085
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:26,520
That's why my tears keep flowing

1086
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:27,870
Pressing here doesn't work.

1087
01:04:26,990 --> 01:04:33,310
I have been hiding a part of my heart

1088
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:31,220
Pressing here doesn't work either.

1089
01:04:32,730 --> 01:04:36,630
What would work when tears
just keep overflowing?

1090
01:04:34,290 --> 01:04:41,770
A certain person can't even sense it
thus bringing me to tears

1091
01:04:41,770 --> 01:04:45,310
Even if you cannot hear me

1092
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:44,530
During times like this...

1093
01:04:45,310 --> 01:04:48,300
Even if you cannot hear my heart

1094
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:52,090
The love my tears convey

1095
01:04:52,090 --> 01:04:55,800
Will you finally hear it someday?

1096
01:04:52,470 --> 01:04:55,280
Doing this should work.

1097
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:59,210
Because you are my man

1098
01:04:59,310 --> 01:05:02,950
Because you are my love

1099
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:10,550
After sending you away and letting go,
you still remain and make me cry

1100
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:10,960
I feel so embarrassed.

1101
01:05:10,550 --> 01:05:13,960
Because you are my man

1102
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:18,240
It's because you are still my man

1103
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:25,510
I can't hold back these foolish tears

1104
01:05:25,830 --> 01:05:32,900
You seem unable to hear my heart

1105
01:05:33,190 --> 01:05:36,060
Why can't you hear?

1106
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:39,910
Why can't you see me?

1107
01:05:39,910 --> 01:05:43,120
Turn around I'm here

1108
01:05:43,220 --> 01:05:47,000
What I'm saying is that I love you,
you fool

1109
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:52,250
Don't watch.

1110
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:55,360
You are Dok Go Jin.

1111
01:05:56,820 --> 01:06:00,180
Because you are my man

1112
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:03,950
Because you are my love

1113
01:06:02,730 --> 01:06:04,890
Don't watch.

1114
01:06:04,230 --> 01:06:11,580
Don't cry anymore, I am sorry
that I can't let you go (I love you)
