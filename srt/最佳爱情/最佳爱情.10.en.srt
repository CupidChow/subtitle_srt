3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:10,109
Yes, Yoon Pil Joo is ready.

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,019
Miss Gu Ae Jeong...

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,870
It's time to make up your mind.

6
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,600
Gu Ae Jeong...

7
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,749
Gu Ae Jeong, I feel so hurt.

8
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,860
I feel like I'm going to die.

9
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,669
Isn't that beautiful?

10
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,649
- That's really beautiful.
- The mood is great.

11
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,889
I'm so jealous.

12
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,719
Yet, compared to this beautiful scene,

13
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,989
Kang Se Ri's expression is a bit off.

14
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,710
Is she too tired?

15
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,959
Yes, a new couple is born.

16
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,049
Miss Gu Ae Jeong and Mr. Yoon Pil Joo.

17
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:42,239
Let's all celebrate
the birth of a new couple.

18
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,300
Yoon Pil Joo's face
is finally filled with smile.

19
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,243
Congratulations on becoming the third season

20
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,719
- Couple Making's
- To fill the broadcasting time,

21
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,783
- new couple.
- we'll have to keep holding hands.

22
00:01:56,004 --> 00:01:58,312
- Did you feel their love radiating?
- It's really awkward, isn't it?

23
00:01:58,313 --> 00:02:01,379
I hope that all our viewers
will love fervently too.

24
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:05,342
- Just think that there is no camera
- With this, we end today's Couple Making.

25
00:02:05,377 --> 00:02:06,581
and no one watching.

26
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:10,229
I was thinking that already.

27
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:13,770
That's what I decided to do
from the beginning.

28
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,330
I told you I'm in earnest.

29
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,479
What I'm holding right now

30
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,510
is your heart that came for me.

31
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:36,830
I'm sorry... for making you
jump into such a fuss.

32
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,130
Now that I jumped into it
and finally got to hold it,

33
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,090
I won't let it go easily.

34
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,749
- Good job.
- Thank you.

35
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,459
- Good job.
- Please be careful.

36
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,089
Everything was good today.

37
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:34,089
Except that Yoon Pil Joo's reaction
was a bit weird when Ae Jeong appeared.

38
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,939
Yoon Pil Joo and Se Ri
were talking before, right?

39
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,769
We couldn't hear because
the audio was blocked.

40
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,280
What did you talk about?

41
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:46,430
Because I like you, Yoon Pil Joo.

42
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,489
What was Yoon Pil Joo's reaction
after speaking with me?

43
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:57,209
He seemed surprised but once he saw
Gu Ae Jeong walk in, he got better.

44
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,620
- Yes.
- Indeed.

45
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,540
I see.

46
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,600
The shoot is over.

47
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,539
Since I believe that this is for real
and not just a show,

48
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,540
I'm not letting you go.

49
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,340
Shall we?

50
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,859
<i>I asked Pil Joo to give you a ride.</i>

51
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,599
<i>Are you with him?</i>

52
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,129
- Yeah.
- I'm so grateful.

53
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:41,569
Well anyway,
I suddenly had to go to a funeral.

54
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:44,419
Dad is here with me too.

55
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,989
- Who passed away?
- What?

56
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,159
Well, it is...
Father's mother-in-law's cousin,

57
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,949
his once removed first cousin.

58
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:57,046
<i>Anyway, I'm going to spend a night with dad.</i>

59
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:00,400
And Hyung Gyu is...

60
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,779
He's with Jenny, so don't worry about him.

61
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:10,829
Have a good time with Doctor Yoo
celebrating the first shoot, okay?

62
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,470
<i>Bye.</i>

63
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:19,339
Oh... Why would he choose
funeral out of all things?

64
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,159
I feel really assured
that all your friends are on the Pil line.

65
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,160
It's so obvious that it's a set up.

66
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:29,059
Did my brother tell you stuff like Pil line?

67
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,089
No, Jenny did.

68
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:34,409
Ah...
Everybody has got such a big mouth.

69
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:37,229
I think it would be wise for you
to join the Pil line as well.

70
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:40,029
What are the advantages
of joining the Pil line?

71
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,579
The advantages of joining the Pil line are:

72
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:46,019
It's safe, it's comfortable, and consistent.

73
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:51,080
It's woven really strongly
so it will never break.

74
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:06,029
Hyung Gyu, Grandfather and Father
are not at home, so let's go to my place.

75
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:10,669
I will also make you kimbap
for your picnic tomorrow.

76
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,449
What about my aunt?

77
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:18,450
Your aunt has a very important meeting,
so she's going to be late.

78
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,900
Don't ever intrude.

79
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,770
Good evening.

80
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,270
I'll go home first to get changed.

81
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,669
What should I tell her?

82
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:03,530
I am too scared to call her.

83
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,719
I knew it was somewhat weird
from the beginning.

84
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,870
Because of that damn cardio meter...

85
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:22,400
Ding Dong,
I thought you were a ghost.

86
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,699
Ahjussi, are you hurt?

87
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,100
Yes.

88
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,699
I'm very hurt, Ding Dong.

89
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,260
I'm in trouble.

90
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:41,029
Hey, Ding Dong...
Your aunt comes back around what time?

91
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,350
11... 12?

92
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:46,870
Why is she coming back so late?

93
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:49,349
- Oh, Auntie is here.
- Hyung Gyu...

94
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:52,150
- Welcome home, Auntie.
- Yes.

95
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,440
Oh, my...

96
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:00,020
I'm Dok Go Jin.

97
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:05,899
You...
Why are you here?

98
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,809
Ahjussi is hurt
so I told him to come inside and rest.

99
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:13,860
How can you just let anybody into the house?

100
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:17,929
That's right, the anybody Dok Go Jin
had cardiac pain in front of the house.

101
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,049
It hurt so much like an attack.

102
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:24,780
So my courteous Ding Dong invited me
and kindly took care of me.

103
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,860
Heart?

104
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:30,770
- Does it hurt again?
- Yes, Gu Ae Jeong.

105
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:34,030
It really hurts a lot.

106
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,110
Ding Dong...

107
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,320
I appreciate your warm tea.

108
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,370
If you are done with the tea,
go home.

109
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,429
You can stay longer, Ahjussi.

110
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,439
Gu Hyung Gyu...

111
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,219
I went to Ahjussi's place
to play every day.

112
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:00,059
And Ahjussi came to my place
for the first time.

113
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,760
Stop telling him to go, Auntie!

114
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:05,759
This kid...

115
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,849
This ahjussi is your friend?

116
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:10,049
I guess your aunt doesn't know.

117
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,389
Tell your aunt how close we are, Ding Dong.

118
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:18,299
How popular you got in your class
after giving out 100 sheets of my autograph.

119
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,329
There.

120
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:25,330
Thanks to Ahjussi, my friends voted me
as the field trip recreation leader.

121
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,739
- Very nice, Ding Dong.
- Very well then...

122
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,340
Tell your friend to have a good time.

123
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:37,179
But you know you have to sleep
before 10, right?

124
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,569
You don't have much time.

125
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:43,430
Once your friend goes to sleep,
please leave.

126
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,709
Good job, Ding Dong.

127
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:53,520
Next time, I will give you
100 movie DVDs, okay?

128
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,310
Good job.

129
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,770
What should I say?

130
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:06,790
Ahjussi...

131
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:11,900
Ahjussi, why are you always scolded
by my aunt?

132
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,329
I did something very wrong.

133
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:16,249
Then beg for forgiveness.

134
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,179
Ding Dong...

135
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:23,249
When a man's age is 7, that's easy to say
but at 37, it's never an easy thing to do.

136
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,836
Even though my father is 38 years old,

137
00:10:27,322 --> 00:10:30,137
he always begs for forgiveness.

138
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,039
Hey, Ding Dong...

139
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,019
I'm Dok Go Jin, I'm a special man.

140
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,769
You know, Dok Go Jin.

141
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:40,590
Then you are not going to say you are sorry?

142
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,839
I should say it at some point.

143
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,810
I should say it, no matter what.

144
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,270
What?

145
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:01,600
Today's wrongdoing?

146
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,489
Are you telling me,
to write an apology on a kids' dairy?

147
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:09,139
Ding Dong, you are a genius.

148
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:12,770
You are a genius.
Genius.

149
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,190
Is he really hurt?

150
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,529
Why is it so silent?

151
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:41,570
Is he really playing with Hyung Gyu?

152
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,890
Gu Ae Jeong...

153
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:52,050
Today's wrong doing...

154
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:57,580
It's my faul...

155
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:11,310
Gu Ae Jeong...

156
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:14,020
I am...

157
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,399
Hyung Gyu...

158
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,620
You should get ready to sleep, let's wash.
Come out.

159
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:40,290
Aunt, I haven't packed for the field trip.

160
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:45,810
Then pack everything
until I finish making kimbap. Okay?

161
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,779
Wasn't I good?

162
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,790
Nice.

163
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,479
Don't be mean with food.

164
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,630
I am sick and I didn't even eat.

165
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,169
Why are you giving me the ends
when the rest is all piled up there.

166
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:30,140
- Then don't eat.
- The ends taste the best.

167
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,529
Did you put cucumber in the kimbap?

168
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:38,979
I don't like cucumber.

169
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,850
Can you put burdock instead of cucumber?

170
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:52,839
It will be too bitter
if you put three cucumbers.

171
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,599
Hyung Gyu, did you prepare
the clothes for tomorrow?

172
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,369
Yes, I'm going to wear
the clothes you bought me.

173
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,990
Tada!

174
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,199
Wow, it's Spiderman.

175
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,580
What is that Ding Dong?
Aigoo...

176
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:10,359
You think everyone who has a spider web
is Spiderman?

177
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,320
You look like a ladybug
caught on a spider web.

178
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,119
He looks cool.
Why are you like that to a kid?

179
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,009
You don't understand fashion.

180
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:24,049
I'm Dok Go Jin,
the best fashionista in Korea.

181
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:26,129
The fashion terminator...
Haven't you heard?

182
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:30,349
Shut your mouth,
before I roll it up with kimbap.

183
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,539
Hyung Gyu, you look really cool.

184
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,809
Never mind, I won't wear it.

185
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:39,300
Ding Dong, come here.

186
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,009
Fashion is all about confidence.

187
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:46,550
Pull your shoulders back.

188
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,059
Suck in your stomach
to accentuate the spider web.

189
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,229
Whether you will look like a ladybug
caught on spider web,

190
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:57,219
or Spiderman holding spider web
depends on how confident you are.

191
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,690
Now do it.

192
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:03,119
- Spiderman!
- Good job. Good job.

193
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,229
Nice to meet you.
I'm Iron Man.

194
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:08,179
Let us, superheroes,
have a seat and eat some kimbap.

195
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,717
There.

196
00:15:09,718 --> 00:15:13,169
Ahjussi, did you like Iron Man
when you were young?

197
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:17,799
Hey. When I was young,
I wanted to be Iron Man.

198
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,359
I thought what Iron Man had here
was an artificial heart.

199
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,470
I wanted to have that and become
the most powerful superhero on earth.

200
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:31,819
I didn't say this to gain sympathy.
It's true.

201
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,579
I didn't say anything.

202
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:37,680
Spiderman and Iron Man
should eat some kimbap.

203
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:43,660
How do I eat kimbap with three cucumbers?

204
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:54,339
Spiderman!

205
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,531
Spiderman!

206
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,440
Spiderman...

207
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:06,400
<i>Life is complicated and living is not easy.</i>

208
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:10,909
Ahjussi, I'm sleepy.

209
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:13,339
Ding Dong, you shouldn't sleep yet.

210
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:17,009
I haven't caught the right moment yet.

211
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:21,159
Spiderman, you must not succumb to sleep,
you must save Dok Go Jin.

212
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,339
Here, get up.
Drink this juice and wake up.

213
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:26,970
Here, Ding Dong.
Here.

214
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:35,069
Hyung Gyu, I made bed for you.
Let's go to sleep.

215
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:40,209
Ding Dong said he's not sleepy. You know
how kids can't sleep before a picnic day.

216
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:42,209
Perhaps Dok Go Jin kid was like that.

217
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,929
But our Hyung Gyu needs to be asleep
by 10 every night.

218
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:47,639
On the eve of the picnic
you are too excited to sleep

219
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,009
and that's what's most fun about picnics.

220
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,747
Don't you know the kid who didn't sleep
because he was too excited the night before

221
00:16:52,748 --> 00:16:54,748
is the one who doesn't have a good time
on the day of the picnic?

222
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:58,529
I don't know. Because I was never
actually present on the day of the picnic.

223
00:16:58,530 --> 00:16:59,659
Why?

224
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,659
Did you skip the picnic
because you were the pale sickly boy?

225
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,429
Yes. I couldn't go on a picnic
because I skipped it to go to hospital.

226
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:06,020
Why?

227
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,709
That's your story when you were a kid.

228
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:13,569
Our Hyung Gyu needs to sleep
because he needs to go on a picnic tomorrow.

229
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:18,060
So stop bugging me and go home.

230
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,049
Gu Ae Jeong...

231
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:26,619
I've never gone on a picnic.

232
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,379
Go on a picnic with me tomorrow.

233
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,669
What? Picnic?

234
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:34,240
Let me grant you the chance
to go with me on my first picnic.

235
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,779
Do you think I will go on a picnic with you?

236
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:42,469
When I was a pale sickly kid, there was
no possibility of going on a picnic.

237
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,689
But I earnestly wanted it.

238
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:47,459
Maybe a miracle will happen
and I will be able to go.

239
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,219
Perhaps God will permit me to go.

240
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:55,150
May the Gu Ae Jeong god
permit me to go... please.

241
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,759
No way... Wake up.

242
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,979
Why are you so mean?

243
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:06,879
Imagine a pale sickly kid praying in earnest
at the window pane of a hospital.

244
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,679
Then you will never be able to refuse
so harshly.

245
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:13,649
Did people cave in
whenever you threw a tantrum like that?

246
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:16,379
I guess no one scolded you
to tell you that you shouldn't do that.

247
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,349
A good thing about being sick

248
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:23,026
is that no matter what I do
no one scolded me and I was forgiven.

249
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,699
Gu Ae Jeong...

250
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,350
I'm really...

251
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,159
Can you please forgive me
just one more time?

252
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,090
Please?

253
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:43,589
A picnic with you will never happen.

254
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:46,709
Between you and I,
there are only going to be rainy days.

255
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:50,110
So don't get your hopes up.

256
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,749
Aunt, is it raining outside?

257
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,809
No, it's not raining.

258
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,589
Will I be able to go on a picnic tomorrow?

259
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:01,490
Of course, it's not going to rain tomorrow.
Let's go to sleep now.

260
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,150
Let's go.

261
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,199
Gu Ae Jeong...

262
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,729
I will wait until the rain between us stops.

263
00:19:09,504 --> 00:19:12,129
When the rain stops,
there's going to be a rainbow.

264
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,930
This big...

265
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,740
Let's go.

266
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,200
It's raining.
It's going to be pouring.

267
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:44,670
He won't bring up picnic again
since it's raining?

268
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:47,500
Spiderman!

269
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,580
Rain...

270
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,749
Picnic is all ruined.

271
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:58,749
What do I do?
It's all ruined.

272
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,300
Aigoo...

273
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:04,370
My Spiderman must be so disappointed.

274
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,240
Hyung Gyu, do you want to watch
cartoon DVDs with me?

275
00:20:11,592 --> 00:20:12,756
Poor thing.

276
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,950
Ah seriously, that idiot...

277
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:23,690
It rains then clears up.
It was a thunder and now it's a lightening.

278
00:20:23,691 --> 00:20:26,492
Who is he to do whatever he wants?

279
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,500
What, what?
What is it, this time?

280
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,949
I'm sorry.
I came too suddenly, without calling.

281
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:41,249
You got hurt, I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

282
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:44,530
No, a little bit.
I'm okay.

283
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:49,510
- I'm so sorry. What do I do?
- No, I'm really fine.

284
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,119
But what brings you here all of a sudden?

285
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,640
Right.

286
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:56,649
Here.
This is a gift.

287
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,789
- A gift?
- Yes.

288
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,659
To celebrate your coming to me.

289
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,240
Wow!

290
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,710
- What is it?
- It's a camera.

291
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:08,310
Had Hyung Gyu gone on that picnic,

292
00:21:08,311 --> 00:21:11,222
it would have been nice
to take pictures with this camera.

293
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:14,310
Thank you so much.

294
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,489
I will go get some tea.

295
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:18,990
Okay.

296
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:24,339
Hyung Gyu must be really disappointed
that you couldn't go on a picnic.

297
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,799
You even dressed up as Spiderman.

298
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,939
Ahjussi...

299
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:31,219
Did you like superheroes
when you were a kid?

300
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,139
I liked detective stories
more than superheroes.

301
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:37,259
- Like Holmes or Lupin.
- You mean, Detective Conan.

302
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:40,679
Oh! Your glass is the same as Conan's.

303
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,000
Really?

304
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:47,048
Then If I, whose glass is the only thing
in common with Conan,

305
00:21:47,049 --> 00:21:49,849
were to make some deductions...

306
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:54,580
Your aunt made this pretty looking kimbap.

307
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:59,090
Do you want to hand it over to me?

308
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:04,790
I think it's going to help me
solve a difficult case.

309
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:12,759
Then, I will buy you something
that you like more than kimbap.

310
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,230
What do you like?

311
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:25,520
You can fill this up
with whatever you want to eat.

312
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:43,800
Iron Man, I'm sorry.

313
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,660
You didn't have to go this far.

314
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:58,489
If I recruit Spiderman into the Pil line,
won't Pil line get even more powerful?

315
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:00,750
I wanted to score some points.

316
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:03,749
- Spiderman...
- Yes?

317
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,229
- Do you like the tent?
- Yes...

318
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:07,019
Come on in.

319
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,608
Shall I?

320
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,420
[Clear Cut Dok Go Jin]

321
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:21,560
He was totally clear cut about things before
so why is he doing this now?

322
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,869
- Why?
- Let's go on a picnic.

323
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:32,209
In order to comfort Ding Dong
who didn't get to go, I prepared something.

324
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,760
Come out.

325
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:39,299
<i>I'm already on a picnic.</i>

326
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,469
What?

327
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:41,589
You left without me?

328
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:43,829
When did I ever tell you
that we will count you in?

329
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:46,929
I'm on a picnic and I'm so happy.

330
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:49,149
Where did you go?

331
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:51,479
You are throwing a tantrum again?

332
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,509
<i>I'm not throwing a tantrum.</i>

333
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:57,189
Can you please count me in?
I'm in front of your house.

334
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:59,360
In front of my house?

335
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,339
You are inside right?
I'll come up.

336
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,660
Don't.

337
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:06,159
We have a guest.

338
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,640
A guest?

339
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,020
It's that "anybody doctor," isn't it?

340
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:21,899
You said you were forgiven for everything
because you were sick.

341
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:26,760
As for me, I don't care
even if you are sick and dying.

342
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,170
I'm sorry. Bye.

343
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,360
It's done.

344
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:45,919
Oh...
Let's eat ramen.

345
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,649
Ramen, ramen...

346
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:51,120
It looks yummy.

347
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:18,909
<i>Will Gu Ae Jeong come out
to accept Yoon Pil Joo's proposal?</i>

348
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:22,210
<i>On a sweet spring night, a battle of love.</i>

349
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:31,519
<i>At long last, the woman whom he
has been waiting for has arrived.</i>

350
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,239
<i>Is the finalist of Couple Making season 3,
Gu Ae Jeong,</i>

351
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:39,389
<i>walking up here
to accept Yoon Pil Joo's proposal?</i>

352
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:40,539
<i>Or...</i>

353
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,979
<i>Is she walking up here
to make a difficult refusal?</i>

354
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,319
You looked really tense.

355
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,201
- You were really nervous, weren't you?
- Gu Ae Jeong has a very uneasy face on.

356
00:25:48,232 --> 00:25:50,266
Yoon Pil Joo is also looking very nervous.

357
00:25:50,267 --> 00:25:52,839
- You still looked cool.
- It did come out nice.

358
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:56,760
<i>Viewers, just wait a little more.</i>

359
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,820
<i>Soon, the ending to this love story
will be revealed.</i>

360
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:09,500
<i>Gu Ae Jeong is walking up to him again.</i>

361
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:14,650
<i>What will be her final decision?</i>

362
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:21,479
<i>Yes, Yoon Pil Joo is ready.</i>

363
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,459
<i>Miss Gu Ae Jeong...</i>

364
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,570
<i>It's time to make up your mind.</i>

365
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:29,340
You look really pretty there.

366
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,381
This is the best part, the best part!

367
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,110
[Proposal Succeeds]

368
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,615
You two really look good together.

369
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,000
Of course,

370
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:47,710
Yoon Pil Joo is better than Dok Go Jin.

371
00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:03,550
<i>Congratulations on being the new couple
on Couple Making Season 3.</i>

372
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,779
<i>It's a beautiful night filled with love.</i>

373
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:12,630
<i>Thank you for watching.</i>

374
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:15,670
<i>Couple Making Season 3...</i>

375
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:31,130
It's more impactive with the added
commentaries, CG and background music.

376
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:36,700
It feels like my heart has nice long cracks.

377
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:44,429
Se Ri, we placed the highest rating again.

378
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:47,699
It's just a passing curiosity
over an unexpected combination.

379
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,113
I went on the homepage
and the viewers were saying

380
00:27:49,114 --> 00:27:51,799
that they don't want to see the two together
and that they don't suit each other.

381
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,739
Still the interest is high.

382
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,321
Until the new season start,

383
00:27:55,322 --> 00:27:57,622
we can lead the show with this couple
while preparing for the new season.

384
00:27:57,623 --> 00:28:01,930
Then, what about me?
The host is not playing any role.

385
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:04,061
You can do the opening and closing

386
00:28:04,096 --> 00:28:07,499
and in between you can
make commentaries about their feelings.

387
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,549
Am I a voice actor,
doing only the commentaries?

388
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:12,569
We may do that temporarily.

389
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:15,779
What we are saying is we can invest
more time in finding a new perfect guy.

390
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:18,770
- That's what we meant.
- Yes.

391
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,519
I shouldn't have let Ae Jeong
come on my show.

392
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,980
This is so annoying...

393
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:32,799
Still, the program is a hit.

394
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,329
What's that for?

395
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:40,290
The main role and attention all went to
Ae Jeong and I'm not having any presence.

396
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,169
It's like the time when we were
National Treasure Girls 10 years ago.

397
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:47,749
I lost everything to Ae Jeong again.

398
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,080
Oh...

399
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,790
Yoon Pil Joo is coming.

400
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:03,390
I really don't want to lose him to her.

401
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:10,880
Miss Kang Se Ri, can we talk for a while?

402
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,539
Were you bothered
by what I said at the shoot?

403
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:19,359
Are you here to find out
if what I said was sincere or not?

404
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,819
It didn't seem sincere.

405
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,000
If it had been sincere,

406
00:29:23,001 --> 00:29:26,801
you wouldn't have said it at such timing
like you are throwing a joke.

407
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:29,830
Are you saying it sounded like a joke?

408
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:33,009
Then just keep thinking that way
and ignore it.

409
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:35,709
I can't just ignore and go on.

410
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:40,809
Why did you surprise me by saying
such thing at such a moment?

411
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:44,242
Are you here to pick a fight with me
for ruining the moment

412
00:29:44,243 --> 00:29:45,519
when you were proposing to Ae Jeong?

413
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,449
I'm not trying to pick a fight.

414
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:50,380
I just want to know why.

415
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:57,379
I did it because I don't like Ae Jeong,
I wanted to ruin the mood.

416
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,849
Kang Se Ri,
you really are such a bad person.

417
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:01,989
- What?
- You have such a pretty face,

418
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:03,869
but why is your heart so bad?

419
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,609
Are you scolding me now?

420
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:08,410
When you did something bad,
you need to be scolded.

421
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:13,900
From now on, don't throw in such a joke.

422
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:26,070
I'm "the Kang Se Ri."

423
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,600
How can he be so oblivious to me?

424
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,799
What is he
to come here and scold me?

425
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,220
<i>Ah...</i>

426
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:39,519
<i>I opened the new phone you bought me
without telling the company.</i>

427
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:44,179
Right, did you see me making
a heart sign to you on the Music Core?

428
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,619
That's my heart for you, Oppa.

429
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,940
<i>Yeah.</i>

430
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:51,390
<i>I really want to see you too.</i>

431
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:58,100
Girl groups these days
are still dating in secret like we used to.

432
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,969
What to do?

433
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,680
Look at him!

434
00:31:10,019 --> 00:31:11,519
He winked at you?

435
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,220
Did he?

436
00:31:13,221 --> 00:31:15,470
[Kangmin oppa...
Meet me at our secret place.]

437
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:33,600
Will Oppa see it?

438
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,608
What the he** is this?

439
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:53,280
Wait a minute.

440
00:31:53,281 --> 00:31:55,371
What is she doing?

441
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,220
Hey! Hey!

442
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,619
What is that?

443
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,409
- It's gum.
- Gum?

444
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:05,729
Why is there gum here?
No, it's not gum. Spit it out.

445
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:07,859
Spit it out. Hey! Hey!

446
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,409
Are you all right?

447
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:10,899
Oh, what do I do?

448
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,399
You can't be okay.

449
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,540
I'm sorry, Unni.
Are you all right?

450
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,530
I'm okay.

451
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:26,149
It looks ridiculous.
What do I do?

452
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:29,010
It won't come off.

453
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:36,990
There were times like that.

454
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:44,060
Had I helped her secretly date Dok Go Jin,

455
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:48,330
would she not have appeared
on the show with Yoon Pil Joo?

456
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,999
How many times did I tell you, huh?

457
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,540
Didn't I tell you all that you can't
have a personal cell phone?

458
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:03,589
I'm taking this.

459
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:06,570
She got caught.

460
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,209
Manager Jang.

461
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:10,809
- Hello.
- Oh, hi.

462
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:12,630
Hello.

463
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,830
Go, get ready for the program.

464
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:25,219
The most difficult thing with idol girl
groups is supervising dating.

465
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,389
Kids are like that at that age.

466
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:29,249
- I was like that too.
- Ah...

467
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:31,389
You were on the good side.

468
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:33,219
I just didn't get caught.

469
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:37,159
Han Mi Na was the loose one.

470
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,799
- Mi Na?
- Back then, Mi Na secretly dated

471
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,189
the leader of the best boy band.

472
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:47,609
Because of that, the fanatic fans of the boy
band sent us threat mails and razor blades.

473
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:49,609
- Don't you remember?
- Ah...

474
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:52,329
- I do remember crying because of that.
- Even then,

475
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:56,189
Gu Ae Jeong was butting in like crazy.

476
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:59,308
She was saying things like,
the company needs to provide protection

477
00:33:59,309 --> 00:34:01,739
and that we need to make a complaint
to the other company.

478
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:06,090
Ah...
I got in so much trouble because of her.

479
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:08,169
Ah... anyway,

480
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:13,020
when you find Han Mi Na
make sure to tell me.

481
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:22,910
Ae Jeong also helped Mi Na to date?

482
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:27,090
No wonder...
She butts in on anything.

483
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:42,019
Their dating was even aired on TV.
I can't just let it to go on like this.

484
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:47,750
First, I need to find out
about her background.

485
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:54,299
Oh, no...
Why did you come here again?

486
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:58,400
Let's have a talk inside.

487
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:02,419
Before we talk,

488
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:06,529
let me ask you something,
so that I don't get my hopes up.

489
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:11,079
This house is not owned
by Gu Ae Jeong, right?

490
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,449
It's a monthly rent.

491
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:15,210
Ah...

492
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,909
I expected it to be at least a lease.

493
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:22,899
We were going to turn it into a lease,
the price these days are going up like...

494
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:26,110
Fine, let's go in.

495
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:34,960
Hello.
I'm Ae Jeong's brother, Gu Ae Hwan.

496
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:39,529
And this kid is...

497
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:43,479
He's my son, so Ae Jeong's...
Say hello.

498
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,049
Hello.
My name is Gu Hyung Gyu.

499
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:51,029
By the way,

500
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:55,852
why are you at home at these hours?

501
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:58,749
- Are you out of work?
- What are you talking about?

502
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:00,290
I work.

503
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,585
I work as Ae Jeong's manager.

504
00:36:01,586 --> 00:36:06,150
In that case,
you are getting paid by Ae Jeong then.

505
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:08,660
But...

506
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:13,689
Why are you not living at your own place
and stay with your sister?

507
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:15,189
Well, actually...

508
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:17,990
We all live together with Ae Jeong.

509
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,479
Together then...

510
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,097
The father, brother and even the nephew

511
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:26,898
are all living off Gu Ae Jeong?

512
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,869
We live together
because we are family.

513
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:32,479
What do you mean
by living off her?

514
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,119
Of course,
we are not living off her.

515
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:39,610
I take really good care of Ae Jeong
as her manager.

516
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:41,979
Gu Ae Jeong and these dregs...

517
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:45,630
Aigoo... How can this be?

518
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:05,290
For the Korean Movie Award,
Director Jerry Heimer is visiting Korea.

519
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:10,049
I heard that his next movie
is the one with a bunch of superheroes.

520
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:13,819
He wants to cast an Asian actor
for one of the characters

521
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:16,629
and I think he watched your movie
with great interest.

522
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:20,040
He contacted us
to arrange a meeting with you.

523
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:26,959
<i>Dok Go might go to Hollywood.</i>

524
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,699
He was offered a role
in Director Jerry Heimer's movie.

525
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,570
Really? When is he leaving?

526
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,659
He's going to meet
the director tomorrow and,

527
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:36,279
if he says yes, he's going to the US
with the director.

528
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,799
It's not decided yet, right?

529
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,349
You can almost say that it's a done deal.

530
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:43,799
His dream was to play a superhero and,

531
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,859
the role he was offered to play
is the superhero saving earth.

532
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:51,259
Superheroes are the ones like
Batman and Spiderman, right?

533
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:55,219
He might not be the main star,
but like X-man,

534
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,789
he's going to be
one of the many superheroes.

535
00:37:57,790 --> 00:38:02,479
Then, Dok Go Jin is going to be
like Hugh Jackman in X-man?

536
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,979
If it becomes a hit, he will be.

537
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:09,560
He's really going to be like an Iron Man.

538
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:18,489
I tried not to eat the doughnuts
out of respect for you but...

539
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:20,480
I'm sorry.

540
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,719
Ding Dong...

541
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,599
For you, whose entire life is 7 years long,

542
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:29,979
it's too early to project your emotions
on inanimate objects.

543
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:34,709
What you ate are just doughnuts,
no more than that.

544
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:38,269
You don't have to feel guilty about having
betrayed me over the sweet seduction. Okay?

545
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:39,830
Okay.

546
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:45,310
Ahjussi, I brought this for you.

547
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:49,779
These are also the ones
the doctor bought you?

548
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,610
Yes.

549
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,804
I, whose entire life is 37 years long,

550
00:38:53,805 --> 00:38:56,610
cannot eat them because my emotions
are projected on them.

551
00:38:56,645 --> 00:39:00,599
For me these are the evil baits
thrown by the enemy.

552
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,609
Then, I will eat them.

553
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:05,249
Go ahead.
Eat a lot and exercise a lot.

554
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:11,210
To achieve such excellent body quality
like me, you must foremost be tall.

555
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,689
Our Ding Dong...

556
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:19,530
The next time we meet,
would you have grown taller by this much?

557
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,549
Ahjussi, are you going somewhere?

558
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:22,676
Yes.

559
00:39:22,776 --> 00:39:28,060
Ahjussi... is going to become a superhero.

560
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,829
Hyung Gyu...

561
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:36,280
Aigoo...
He left without cleaning the room.

562
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:54,200
<i>I was mistaken that</i>

563
00:39:54,201 --> 00:39:58,066
<i>I had mistaken the thumping
of my heart for love.</i>

564
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:01,810
<i>Gu Ae Jeong, I'm sorry.</i>

565
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:13,460
Just leave me alone and
go to Hollywood to save the earth, please.

566
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:39,460
If I leave you alone here,

567
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:46,330
you will wilt... and die on your own.

568
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:06,339
- Whoa...
- Wow!

569
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:09,449
- Wow...
- Whoa!

570
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:12,939
Wow, it's so pretty.

571
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:16,049
We just need to set up cameras in here
without changing anything.

572
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:16,873
Great.

573
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:22,128
We can film at Jenny's restaurant
instead of showing Gu Ae Jeong's house.

574
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:28,310
And we will film the housewarming date
at Pil Joo's place.

575
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:30,470
Awesome.

576
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:37,769
About Director Jerry Heimer
that we are going to meet today,

577
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:40,089
I guess he really wanted to cast you
for his movie.

578
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:43,579
Even the top actors in China
were going for the role as well.

579
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:47,404
But he flatly refused them
saying that you are his first choice.

580
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,210
They are going on a picnic.

581
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:57,899
Hyungnim, because of the rush hour, we need
to hurry to make it to the meeting on time.

582
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,630
Let's go, Hyungnim.

583
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:07,929
Hyungnim, what's wrong?!

584
00:42:08,244 --> 00:42:09,999
Are you sick?

585
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,279
Hey, Jae Seok...

586
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,850
We are going to the hospital.

587
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,400
Can you please please go a bit faster?

588
00:42:27,454 --> 00:42:29,370
Hyungnim!

589
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:35,029
Can you please go a bit faster?
Hurry!

590
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:37,010
Hyungnim!

591
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,950
Hyungnim, I will inform
Representative Moon first.

592
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,009
Don't make a fuss.

593
00:42:56,010 --> 00:43:01,666
Tell her to postpone the meeting with
the director because a thing came up.

594
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,859
Dok Go, are you in a lot of pain?

595
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:16,009
It feels as though...
my heart is being split apart, Doctor.

596
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,829
Please do something.

597
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:20,869
First, let's do some specific tests.

598
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:22,780
Get ready.

599
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,044
- Did you wash those?
- Yes.

600
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:31,980
Your house is lovely.

601
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:36,279
Come by for fun not just for the shoot.

602
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:40,279
If you feel uneasy about coming alone,
bring Spiderman along.

603
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,030
Yes.

604
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:45,360
Spiderman.

605
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:51,999
You are broken.

606
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,949
Your artificial heart is failing.
We have to open it again.

607
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:57,670
Then...

608
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:01,349
Have things gone back
to where they were 10 years ago?

609
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:07,350
Yes. You could have suddenly collapsed
without knowing that it's failing,

610
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:12,429
but thanks to that heart beat song,
you closely monitored your heart rate

611
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:15,349
and we were able
to detect the problem early.

612
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:19,820
I'll arrange things so that you can
get the surgery as soon as possible.

613
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:23,339
What is my chance of survival?

614
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:25,380
50/50

615
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:28,189
To live or die.
It's either one of the two.

616
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:29,809
You also said that last time.

617
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:35,309
When I survived, you said the actual
chance of survival was only 5 percent,

618
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:38,309
and you bragged about
how you were the one who made it happen.

619
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:41,380
Did I do that?

620
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:47,480
Anyway, for now, I can only say
that it's a question of life or death.

621
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:23,050
My heart was actually...

622
00:45:23,317 --> 00:45:26,203
being broken.

623
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:50,119
Oh, isn't that Dok Go Jin?

624
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,601
- Isn't that Dok Go Jin?
- Dok Go Jin...

625
00:45:51,602 --> 00:45:52,059
Isn't it?

626
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:53,829
- Is he Dok Go Jin?
- I think you're right.

627
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:54,830
- Isn't that Dok Go Jin?
- It's really him.

628
00:45:54,831 --> 00:45:55,655
- He's really good looking.
- Why is he here?

629
00:45:55,656 --> 00:45:56,988
- Isn't it?
- He is, right?

630
00:45:56,989 --> 00:45:57,839
- What is he doing here?
- He looks totally cool.

631
00:45:57,874 --> 00:46:00,180
That's right...

632
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:02,189
I am "the Dok Go Jin."

633
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:03,839
Oh! He's looks better than I thought.

634
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,360
I'm Dok Go Jin.

635
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,370
Wow! Dok Go Jin is really handsome.

636
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,319
Mr. Dok Go Jin!

637
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,609
You're Dok Go Jin, right?

638
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:32,199
That's correct, I'm Dok Go Jin.

639
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,699
Oppa, I'm a big fan.

640
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,909
Will you sign your autograph?

641
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:38,510
Yes, please...

642
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:57,160
We're sorry. Please excuse us.
We're leaving now, please excuse us.

643
00:46:57,530 --> 00:47:00,910
Let them be...
Please...

644
00:47:05,459 --> 00:47:06,459
Hey...

645
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:09,771
Excuse me,
since there are too many requests,

646
00:47:09,772 --> 00:47:11,313
I can't give autographs to all of you,
please write it down.

647
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,079
- Dok...
- Dok...

648
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,329
- Go...
- Go...

649
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:15,599
- Jin...
- Jin...

650
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,580
And a heart.

651
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,509
You are really good.

652
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:27,660
I practiced.

653
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:40,649
We are going to make potato salad.
Do you like it?

654
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:42,809
No, I really hate potatoes.

655
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:44,240
You do?

656
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:47,240
Then, let's leave it out.

657
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:49,000
Let us.

658
00:47:56,030 --> 00:47:58,989
I'm the most important
director in the world.

659
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:03,259
And this movie has the potential
to make us so much money.

660
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:05,829
And even though
there are a lot of characters...

661
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:11,139
You... you, Dok Go Jin, are my far and away
the most important one.

662
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:15,169
Together, you and me,
we can bring this movie to the world.

663
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:18,379
And make you an international star.

664
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:20,399
You're the man!

665
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,799
So... what do you say?

666
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,290
Are you in?

667
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:29,310
Thank you.

668
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:30,967
- Thank you, Sir.
- Let's do it.

669
00:48:30,968 --> 00:48:33,100
- Thank you very much.
- It's great.

670
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:38,619
I can take care of the things
you started in Korea.

671
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:41,289
You should leave with the director.

672
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:44,899
It's certain that I will get the best actor
award for the Korean Movie Award, right?

673
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:47,810
Once I receive it, I will leave.

674
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:49,720
Right...

675
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:55,440
I'm going to be remembered...
by my best image.

676
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:57,936
Our MBS production team did our best

677
00:48:57,937 --> 00:49:01,629
to make Ae Jeong one of the presenters
at the Korean Movie Award.

678
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:04,631
Right, for the sake of our program,

679
00:49:04,632 --> 00:49:07,489
it was necessary to improve
Gu Ae Jeong's image a little.

680
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:11,559
I had to pester the director incessantly
to make it happen.

681
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:13,652
There are many female celebrities
who transformed their image

682
00:49:13,657 --> 00:49:15,406
just with the dresses they wear
to the Award.

683
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,979
This time, we will pay extra special care.

684
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:21,729
It must be elegant and luxurious,
like you, okay?

685
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:23,609
- Got it.
- Another thing...

686
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:27,799
Please help us
with the product placement in the program.

687
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,919
This is the couple phone
for Gu Ae Jeong and Pil Joo.

688
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,916
It needs to be shown to the public.

689
00:49:32,917 --> 00:49:34,519
So it would be appreciated
if you can ask her to carry this phone.

690
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:38,309
Oh, my... It's the one
that Dok Go did the commercial for.

691
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:41,999
Oh, my!
It became brighter and slimmer.

692
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,187
Didn't it?

693
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:15,540
Gu Ae Jeong...

694
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,649
Are you happy to be peeping?

695
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:28,660
What are you talking about?

696
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:31,749
You are also dressed up nicely.

697
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:35,199
I heard that you will be presenting
an award. Could it be...?

698
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,399
It isn't for the Best Male Actor category,
is it?

699
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,759
Best child actor award.

700
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:45,669
You are not going to receive
the best child actor award, are you?

701
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:49,669
Don't be clumsy and trip on the red carpet.

702
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:53,850
I am worried about tripping
because the heels are too high.

703
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:07,899
The red carpet is...
what you walk on with pride.

704
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:12,019
Believe that you are
the best person in the world,

705
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:14,549
and walk arrogantly.

706
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:20,539
Today, I do look a bit good,
so I won't feel small and will be arrogant.

707
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:23,959
Now that I'm dressed up like this,
I don't look cheap, right?

708
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:27,820
You didn't look cheap
even when you were wearing the frog costume.

709
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:33,730
That was the most luxurious frog
I have ever seen.

710
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,420
Thank you.

711
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:39,870
Keep jumping hard.

712
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,510
Ah...

713
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:45,580
Gu Ae Jeong...

714
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:51,459
Do I look cool today?
I need to look the coolest today.

715
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:56,999
What is the answer of the only person
in Korea who thinks Dok Go Jin isn't cool?

716
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,670
See.

717
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:03,370
You look cool.

718
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:08,829
You did look cool
even when you were the lame Asshole Jin.

719
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:11,450
Absolutely.

720
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:16,660
Keep remembering me... that way.

721
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:19,930
Gu Ae Jeong...

722
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,860
No matter how cool he is,
I must forget.

723
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:41,171
[Korean Movie Award]

724
00:52:45,935 --> 00:52:49,318
Please look at the camera.

725
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:35,009
Unni, here is the script.

726
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:37,089
Your performance is
at the end of the second part, right?

727
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:38,499
Right.

728
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:41,191
By the way,
why did you bring all of these dresses,

729
00:53:41,192 --> 00:53:42,429
when you are only going to wear one?

730
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:46,750
I need to scrape all the pretty dresses
so that other girls can't wear them.

731
00:53:49,070 --> 00:53:51,840
It's Dok Go Jin.

732
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:57,760
I would like you
to leave us alone for a second.

733
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:06,009
- What's up?
- I'm going to shoot...

734
00:54:06,010 --> 00:54:08,119
my next film in Hollywood.

735
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,219
I'm going to mention it
during my acceptance speech.

736
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:11,169
I'm giving you a heads up

737
00:54:11,170 --> 00:54:16,173
so that you don't show
a surprised reaction and be embarrassed.

738
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:23,089
It must look great to be making such
speech after receiving such a big award.

739
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:24,919
I must, today.

740
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:30,619
Today especially, I need to look
the coolest in my entire lifetime.

741
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:33,789
You look really pretty.

742
00:54:33,790 --> 00:54:36,409
- Don't I look too plain?
- No, no.

743
00:54:36,410 --> 00:54:38,809
You are glowing.

744
00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:41,309
- You look really pretty.
- Really?

745
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:43,010
Thank you.

746
00:54:43,730 --> 00:54:48,499
I'm not even receiving the award
and I'm so nervous. What should I do?

747
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:51,789
- What award are you going to present?
- The best child actor award.

748
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:53,799
If I keep shaking like this,

749
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:57,273
I'll even be outshined
by the kid who will receive the award.

750
00:54:58,210 --> 00:55:01,459
If you are nervous, do this.
It's going to help.

751
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:04,360
You mean the relaxation meridian?

752
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:08,379
You will be awarding in the beginning
of part one so please wait backstage.

753
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:09,899
Okay.

754
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:12,269
I will be watching in the audience.

755
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:15,770
- Our Ae Jeong looks so pretty.
- Really?

756
00:55:16,210 --> 00:55:18,390
Hello, Girls.

757
00:55:19,090 --> 00:55:21,726
- Manager Jang, hello.
- Hey, Gu Ae Jeong...

758
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:26,349
You're on a roll these days,
giving an award on such a big stage.

759
00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:29,199
Did the Couple Making team
stick you in this also?

760
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,900
Yes, Sir.

761
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,559
Girls, break a leg today.

762
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:33,937
You want to give encouragement

763
00:55:33,938 --> 00:55:39,482
to the girl who got kicked out
of Couple Making because of you?

764
00:55:40,990 --> 00:55:44,249
You can't say that it was my fault...

765
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:48,109
Manager Jang...
Why do you think everything is my fault?

766
00:55:48,110 --> 00:55:50,610
Gu Ae Jeong...

767
00:55:51,170 --> 00:55:54,219
Now that you are dressed fancy,
you think you can speak out at me?

768
00:55:54,220 --> 00:56:00,169
You are not yet on the level to be forgiven
for whatever you do, don't you know?

769
00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:04,652
You seem to be mistaken
about the level you're in

770
00:56:04,653 --> 00:56:06,170
since you're wearing a fancy dress, huh?

771
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:08,559
Huh?

772
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:12,920
Today, I'm not going to bow my head
for no reason.

773
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,390
Let's go, Unni.

774
00:56:27,530 --> 00:56:29,119
Gu Ae Jeong...

775
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:32,049
Forgive me.
What do I do?

776
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:36,229
The clean dress...
got dirty again.

777
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:41,029
So don't walk around in a dress like that.

778
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:44,330
It doesn't suit you.

779
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:48,319
Hello, I'm one of the staff here.

780
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:51,285
Miss Kang Se Ri,
there is a problem with a presenter,

781
00:56:51,286 --> 00:56:52,986
could you please give the award
on her behalf?

782
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:55,699
I came here to perform,
what are you talking about?

783
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:56,933
Do me a favor.

784
00:56:56,934 --> 00:56:59,792
I'm entreating you because the child actor
award is in the very beginning of the show.

785
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:01,239
Child Actor Award?

786
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:04,169
I need to check the dress and everything.

787
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:06,889
Give me a second.
Where did my stylist go?

788
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:10,590
- Miss Kang Se Ri, just went out.
- Hold on.

789
00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:14,489
If it's the child actor award, isn't
Gu Ae Jeong supposed to give the award?

790
00:57:14,490 --> 00:57:18,180
Yeah, she was.
Yes, Sir. I'm on my way.

791
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:28,859
Manager Jang...

792
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:32,179
- You purposely did that to Ae Jeong, right?
- It just slipped, I'm telling you.

793
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:34,209
Why are you doing this to Ae Jeong?

794
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:38,909
What? What did I do to Ae Jeong?
Why? Why do you think that way?

795
00:57:38,910 --> 00:57:43,590
- Isn't that too much?
- I was holding it and it just slipped.

796
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:49,100
Spilling such a thing
on such a dress on such a day...

797
00:58:49,110 --> 00:58:52,290
You are so clumsy.

798
00:59:05,290 --> 00:59:08,119
- You were burnt.
- Yeah, it's nothing serious.

799
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:12,650
It's going to be okay
once I pour some cold water on it.

800
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:21,660
I think I'm not the person to be wearing
such a dress and act cool.

801
00:59:21,790 --> 00:59:23,611
I think it suits me better
to wear a frog costume

802
00:59:23,612 --> 00:59:26,557
that will be fine
even when I fall down and roll around.

803
00:59:33,550 --> 00:59:38,020
Put some ointment on before you get a scar.

804
00:59:49,830 --> 00:59:55,610
The Korean Movie Award host,
Seong Yoon Ah.

805
01:00:11,090 --> 01:00:15,119
I'm telling you.
It was so laughable.

806
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:18,570
I almost died laughing.

807
01:00:19,970 --> 01:00:23,449
Hey, hey, hey, hey...
I will tell you once I get there.

808
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:28,069
Okay, okay.
I'll tell you in person.

809
01:00:28,070 --> 01:00:30,310
Got it?

810
01:00:46,390 --> 01:00:47,719
Manager Jang.

811
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:50,450
Oh, Dok Go Jin...
Ah!

812
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:16,383
It's not so bad
that you are going to get a scar

813
01:01:16,384 --> 01:01:20,483
but you will still get a blister
and it will hurt.

814
01:01:21,230 --> 01:01:24,610
You called him for no reason.

815
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:27,129
You didn't get to watch the show
because of me.

816
01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:30,580
I came to the show to see you.

817
01:01:31,950 --> 01:01:36,999
Why is Manager Jang
still dying to put you down?

818
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,149
It's not your fault
that National Treasure Girls broke up.

819
01:01:40,150 --> 01:01:44,909
Se Ri has a lot to do with it
and Mi Na also did something...

820
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:46,580
Stop it.

821
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:50,949
Hey!
The awards ceremony must be over by now.

822
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:52,530
Right...

823
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:55,530
<i>This is news about the
MBS Korean Movie Award, Best Actor category.</i>

824
01:01:55,540 --> 01:01:58,299
- Dad, we'll get going...
- Okay... Ae Jeong...

825
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:00,379
Look, Dok Go Jin is on TV.

826
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:02,734
<i>Some people are suggesting
that he refused to receive the award.</i>

827
01:02:02,735 --> 01:02:05,459
<i>And the rumor about the clash
with the director is being brought up again.</i>

828
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:08,929
<i>He was to receive the Best Actor Award
for his performance in the movie, Fighter.</i>

829
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:13,160
<i>Dok Go Jin was rained with camera flashes
on the red carpet...</i>

830
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:18,320
Hold on.

831
01:02:18,330 --> 01:02:23,019
Mr. Dok Go Jin is not here and there's no
use staying here like this. So please leave.

832
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:24,898
What is the reason
behind his sudden disappearance?

833
01:02:24,899 --> 01:02:26,399
Is it because of his discontent
with the award?

834
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,069
There was a rumor about the clash
with the director of Fighter.

835
01:02:29,104 --> 01:02:31,201
- Is it because of that?
- Sorry, I can't tell you right now.

836
01:02:31,202 --> 01:02:32,502
I'm sorry.

837
01:02:40,350 --> 01:02:41,375
Yes, Representative Moon.

838
01:02:41,409 --> 01:02:44,209
Please respond if you feel pain
when I press down.

839
01:02:44,210 --> 01:02:45,800
Right, right.

840
01:02:45,801 --> 01:02:46,501
Do you feel any pain here?

841
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:48,829
There must be a lot of journalists
in front of the company.

842
01:02:48,830 --> 01:02:50,288
It's crazy, you have no idea.

843
01:02:50,289 --> 01:02:54,979
For now, just tell them there are
personal reasons that can't be revealed.

844
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:57,229
I will take care of the situation here.
What about Dok Go?

845
01:02:57,230 --> 01:02:58,899
I think he's at home
but he's not picking up.

846
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:02,029
Try to contact him at any rate
and tell him to hide somewhere quiet

847
01:03:02,030 --> 01:03:04,729
until things calm down
and before the journalists swarm his house.

848
01:03:04,730 --> 01:03:08,680
Now, I'm going to press here.
Tell me if it hurts.

849
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:11,499
Oppa...

850
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:15,289
What happened?

851
01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:18,409
Jae Seok asked me
to go to Dok Go Jin's house right away.

852
01:03:18,410 --> 01:03:21,859
Dok Go Jin hit somebody at the award.

853
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:23,319
What?
He hit someone?

854
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:25,983
Right.
Jae Seok asked me to take him out

855
01:03:25,984 --> 01:03:28,689
before the journalists swarm his house
and he can't move an inch from his house.

856
01:03:28,690 --> 01:03:31,629
I'm not sure if he's going to listen to me
even if I go there.

857
01:03:31,630 --> 01:03:32,940
Oppa...

858
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:35,170
I will go.

859
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:37,620
Why would you?

860
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:40,459
There's something that I want to check.

861
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:42,330
I will go.

862
01:04:01,350 --> 01:04:04,080
<i>The security system has been disarmed.</i>

863
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:08,130
It's still 6090.

864
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:10,349
Mr. Dok Go Jin...

865
01:04:10,350 --> 01:04:11,910
Dok...

866
01:04:14,111 --> 01:04:15,111
Dok...

867
01:04:32,230 --> 01:04:35,809
What happened to the person you hit?

868
01:04:35,810 --> 01:04:39,369
I don't want to do
a press conference with you.

869
01:04:39,370 --> 01:04:43,039
- I'm tired.
- You shouldn't have caused trouble.

870
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,213
You need to go to Hollywood

871
01:04:44,214 --> 01:04:48,114
and realize your dream of being
the superhero saving the earth and all.

872
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:50,660
I'm not going.

873
01:04:52,310 --> 01:04:57,229
Instead of the earth
that does fine without my help,

874
01:04:57,230 --> 01:05:02,130
someone that I must protect as a man...

875
01:05:03,130 --> 01:05:05,990
is right here.

876
01:05:12,490 --> 01:05:18,440
Today I did too much of the manly stuff...
so I'm too tired.

877
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:38,920
- What are you doing?
- Stay still...

878
01:05:39,130 --> 01:05:42,439
So that I can keep looking cool.

879
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:45,490
So that I can keep up my strength.

880
01:05:47,330 --> 01:05:51,020
Recharge...

<i>Don't forget me</i>

890
00:02:50,134 --> 00:02:54,197
<i>Even if I lived for a thousand years</i>

891
00:02:54,199 --> 00:03:00,682
<i>I'll be a fool who only loves you</i>

<i>I am really envious of your cell phone</i>

893
00:03:07,414 --> 00:03:18,172
<i>Because it's with you by your side right now</i>

<i>Because you are my man</i>

897
00:24:56,366 --> 00:25:00,439
<i>It's because you are still my man</i>

898
00:25:00,441 --> 00:25:07,714
<i>I can't hold back these foolish tears</i>

899
00:31:16,459 --> 00:31:20,807
<i>Because I still long for you even now</i>

900
00:31:20,809 --> 00:31:22,902
<i>Here are the words so difficult to hold back</i>

901
00:31:22,904 --> 00:31:26,302
<i>So much so that my tears are falling</i>

902
00:31:26,304 --> 00:31:30,372
<i>I love you</i>

903
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:38,447
<i>I turn around thinking it might be you</i>

904
00:31:40,221 --> 00:31:43,491
<i>I find myself staring at your image</i>

905
00:31:43,493 --> 00:31:48,329
<i>In the seat you once occupied</i>
