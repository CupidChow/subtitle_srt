1
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:37,402
Right!

2
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,710
-Ten seconds left.
-It's the last one.

3
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:42,881
Come on, hurry.

4
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:44,612
That thing, your bribe.

5
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:46,278
What? "Bribe"?

6
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:47,546
-What?
-A bribe?

7
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:48,784
The bribe you gave him.

8
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:51,893
-The bribe you gave to Peter Jason!
-Peter?

9
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:55,056
-Oh, the wine.
-What's it made from?

10
00:00:55,688 --> 00:00:56,958
Grapes!

11
00:00:57,323 --> 00:00:58,893
Yes!

12
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:02,096
Yes! I got it!

13
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,630
-Good job.
-That was amazing.

14
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:09,697
That was Gu Ae-jeong and Dokgo Jin's...

15
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:14,266
Mr. Dokgo, congratulations.

16
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,580
It's the first time anyone guessed
all ten words.

17
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:18,713
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

18
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:20,048
Am I really the first one?

19
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:25,851
But Jin, what was that about your bribe?

20
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:30,019
You gave wine as a bribe
to Director Peter Jason?

21
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:46,839
You must bribe directors
with wine and whatnot.

22
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:49,076
-That must be the case.
-No, it wasn't a bribe.

23
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,679
It was just a small gift.

24
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:55,078
He must've really wanted to do the movie
to bribe the director.

25
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:57,148
We congratulate you again
for getting a part

26
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:58,687
in the film you wanted so much.

27
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,919
Thank you.

28
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:05,259
Finally, why don't you give Dokgo Jin

29
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:08,625
some words of encouragement
before he leaves for Hollywood, Ae-jeong?

30
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:09,928
-Words of encouragement?
-Yes.

31
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:17,536
Dokgo Jin, good luck filming at Hollywood!

32
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:20,714
Korea's national star actor
Dokgo Jin, good luck!

33
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:22,144
You can do it!

34
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:23,875
I can do it!

35
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,620
Wasn't that Quiz to Change the World?

36
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,023
A TV program?

37
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:34,117
Wait, but how did Peter come up?

38
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,557
Ae-jeong...

39
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:38,293
asked me about it.

40
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,360
Why did I take this call?

41
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:47,896
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

42
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:49,037
-Goodbye.
-Thank you.

43
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:52,273
You hit the jackpot, Ae-jeong!

44
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,809
You’re part of Dokgo Jin’s circle now.

45
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,135
I should be okay, right?

46
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,884
-What if he's upset?
-Why would he be upset?

47
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,547
He kept bragging about going to Hollywood.

48
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:04,582
You spread the word for him.

49
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:07,121
He's not going anymore.
Peter told him not to come.

50
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,217
Really?

51
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:09,785
He was rejected?

52
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:15,326
That's so humiliating.

53
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:17,755
It's not like I stopped him from going.

54
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,600
I should be okay, right?

55
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,040
That's not your fault.

56
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,313
MR. ASSHOLE

57
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:59,536
What brings you here all of a sudden?

58
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:02,376
The shooting! How was it?

59
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:05,346
Yes, thanks so much to you.

60
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:08,483
You were really entertaining.

61
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:10,378
I see. You had fun.

62
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,520
You'll have fun watching it when it airs.

63
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,592
I don't know if I'll be able to watch it.

64
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:18,489
I guess you might be too busy.

65
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:20,058
Make sure to catch a re-run.

66
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:21,886
I won't be able to watch a re-run either.

67
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,032
-Why not?
-The quiz we did today

68
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,068
won't be aired.

69
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:29,667
-Why not?
-You, Gu Ae-jeong,

70
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:31,836
will tell them to edit that part out.

71
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,938
-Why would I do that?
-That's three "whys."

72
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,978
You still don't understand the situation?

73
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:41,981
Listen carefully.

74
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:45,985
I was going to announce
that I rejected Peter's offer.

75
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:49,515
You babbled that I bribed him.

76
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:53,329
Rejecting his offer
after bribing him with a gift

77
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:56,956
does not match up.

78
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:02,302
So that part can't be aired,

79
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:04,368
so it needs to be--

80
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:06,368
That's right.

81
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:09,213
Can't it be left in?

82
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:11,535
You're not even going to Hollywood.

83
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:14,811
Please let it go and help me out.

84
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:16,147
Where are you grabbing?

85
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:18,745
-Then you should just hit me, like this.
-Ouch.

86
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:20,545
I made a mistake.

87
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,220
I got really into the game
and just lost it for a moment.

88
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,260
-What are you doing?
-I’m really sorry!

89
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,356
Are you hitting your head with my fist?

90
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:31,058
Let go of me! I'm Dokgo Jin.

91
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:35,935
Since you’re Dokgo Jin
and loved by everyone,

92
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,342
you'll be forgiven
for anything you do, right?

93
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:42,311
So, please help me out.

94
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:45,512
If I ask them to edit it,

95
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:47,378
it'll be completely over for me.

96
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:50,447
Good. Stop presenting

97
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,716
your unlikeable, unforgivable self

98
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,846
and "clear and out."

99
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,430
It would be too obvious if I asked them,

100
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:02,432
so tell them you weren’t pleased
with the outcome,

101
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,455
and demand that they edit it.

102
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:08,470
And I don’t want anything to do
with someone like you,

103
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,074
so edit me out from your head.

104
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:20,345
Why are you still standing there?

105
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:23,483
Hey! “Clear and out”?

106
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,920
Is it that easy for you to tell someone

107
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:28,285
to end her career
just because you're embarrassed?

108
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:29,624
Have you lost it?

109
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:32,189
No wonder Peter rejected you.
You're so rude!

110
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:33,688
You have lost it.

111
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,300
Oh right, he rejected you
because your English stinks.

112
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:39,173
What? "Clear and out"? Nice try.

113
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,302
No wonder you got rejected
because of your English skills.

114
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:44,769
What did you say?

115
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,138
You, king of jerks. Okay?

116
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:49,681
Very much super dirty.

117
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,642
This much you can understand, right?

118
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,917
-Hello.
-Hello.

119
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:00,615
-Yes, hello.
-Nice to meet you.

120
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:02,016
Hello.

121
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:04,358
Nice to meet you, Dokgo Jin.

122
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,164
-You're really handsome.
-We're looking forward to the film.

123
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:09,931
Do you want his autograph?

124
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:12,734
Bye.

125
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:18,035
You said you don't want anything
to do with me, right?

126
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:20,708
Then, don’t call me

127
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:23,407
and don’t you dare follow me.

128
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,106
Where are you going?

129
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,881
Stop right there. Where are you going?

130
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,787
Get his autograph!

131
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:00,745
Oh, no.

132
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:03,151
Goodness, he’s following me.

133
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,747
He must be crazy.

134
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,619
Where do you think...

135
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,020
Hey!

136
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,795
Stop right there!

137
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:31,742
There's a car!

138
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:37,315
Stop!

139
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:43,391
Goodness.

140
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,197
Did he just hit my car?

141
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,604
Are you crazy?

142
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:59,305
How could you just run into my car?

143
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:02,784
Look here!

144
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:05,707
Hey, open your window!

145
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:08,945
-Hey!
-Gu Ae-jeong...

146
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,393
It's over for you now.

147
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:17,519
You're bleeding!

148
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,260
DOKGO JIN HOSPITALIZED
AFTER A CAR ACCIDENT!

149
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:32,613
Dokgo Jin!

150
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:35,042
-Dokgo Jin, how serious are your injuries?
-Dokgo Jin!

151
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:36,841
He hurt his leg.

152
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,639
We’ll provide you with the details later.

153
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,251
I heard it happened at the studio.

154
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:41,313
Who's the other person?

155
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,950
Well, it was another celebrity,

156
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:46,316
so we’re not at liberty
to disclose the name.

157
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:47,545
-One more question.
-Who was it?

158
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,860
DOKGO JIN SEVERLY HURT?
WHICH CELEBRITY IS RESPONSIBLE?

159
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,563
The car in front suddenly braked hard

160
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,085
and hit Dokgo Jin’s car.

161
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:58,795
I see. Then, who was in that car?

162
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,129
It looked like a celebrity’s car.

163
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:05,235
Why, thank you.
She’s a singer from a former girl group.

164
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:06,771
What was it...

165
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:09,883
National Treasure Girls, was it?
Gu Ae-jeong from there.

166
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:13,183
NATIONAL TREASURE GIRLS GU AE-JEONG
CAUSED DOKGO JIN'S ACCIDENT

167
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:14,712
She's here!

168
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:17,421
-How did the accident happen?
-Is Dokgo Jin okay?

169
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:20,493
Did you get into
an accident with Dokgo Jin?

170
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,893
Yes, I did.

171
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:26,659
We were both driving slowly in the garage,

172
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,626
so it was a light fender-bender.

173
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:29,964
Are you okay?

174
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:31,902
Yes, I'm fine.

175
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:34,128
And Dokgo Jin should be fine, too.

176
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,437
DOKGO JIN IS HOSPITALIZED,
GU AE-JEONG IS FINE

177
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,270
-Dokgo Jin!
-Dokgo Jin!

178
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:41,608
-What's going to happen with your film?
-Excuse me.

179
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:46,411
Due to his injury,
Dokgo Jin won't be starring in the film.

180
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:49,719
Unfortunately,
our plans for him to enter Hollywood...

181
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:52,253
have been canceled.

182
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,988
-Dokgo Jin!
-Are you really not going to Hollywood?

183
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:57,464
DOKGO JIN'S HOLLYWOOD PLANS
FALL THROUGH WITH INJURY

184
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:01,461
The interview can't be held in this state.

185
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,001
We'll take one question at a time.

186
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,603
Yes, Reporter Park.

187
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,431
Do you feel responsible
for Dokgo Jin's failed plans?

188
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,271
If you look into the matter,

189
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,996
you'll see that this isn't my fault.

190
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:14,241
Please comment on
the increase of your haters.

191
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:15,536
It's not my fault.

192
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,135
GU AE-JEONG CLAIMS "IT WASN'T HER FAULT"

193
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,250
What’s this?

194
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,275
They're calling her
the national Ankle Girl.

195
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,777
What's "Ankle Girl"?

196
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,849
A nationally acclaimed actor
prepares to enter Hollywood.

197
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:29,463
But Ae-jeong held him by the ankle
and now he can't go.

198
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,789
That's why she is the Ankle Girl.

199
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,327
How could he break his leg
in a parking lot accident?

200
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,734
And Dokgo Jin hit her from the rear.

201
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,399
The insurance company says
it's Dokgo Jin's fault.

202
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:41,195
Why does everyone blame Ae-jeong?

203
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:43,397
ANKLE GIRL GU AE-JEONG

204
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:46,807
For the past few days,

205
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:49,482
the top keyword has been
Ankle Girl Gu Ae-jeong.

206
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:53,307
Park Tae-hwan swims
in the 400 meter final,

207
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,409
in the Asian Games today.

208
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:57,151
but you’re the top search.

209
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,550
I didn’t know he was that hurt.

210
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,490
I should’ve held my anger back.

211
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,393
If it wasn't so negative,

212
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:08,191
this amount of attention is incredible.

213
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:14,166
People must recognize you
and curse you out on the streets!

214
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,937
I guess it's all over for me now.

215
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:28,384
But it's unfair that I'm responsible
for his not going to Hollywood.

216
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,248
Korea’s top actor, Dokgo Jin.
You can do it!

217
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,717
Play that again!

218
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:40,359
Good luck with Hollywood.

219
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,896
Korea’s top actor, Dokgo Jin!
You can do it!

220
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:47,574
-This is awesome.
-This shot is really awesome.

221
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:49,803
She said all this
and then caused the accident.

222
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,939
Gu Ae-jeong’s bad reputation
is going to last.

223
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,272
Seriously.

224
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,038
What do you think about someone like her

225
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,354
for this season of Couple Making?

226
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:03,216
She'll be hated from the onset,

227
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,582
and eliminated early on.

228
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,050
Isn't that an important role?

229
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,418
It would grab attention from the start.

230
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:10,188
Should we cast her?

231
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,387
What if I’m against casting Ae-jeong?

232
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,429
What?

233
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,757
I guess we’ll have to reconsider then.

234
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,969
Since I’m a professional,
I’ll put aside personal feelings

235
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:25,639
and consider if it'll help the show.

236
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,043
GWANGHYE MEDICAL CENTER

237
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,223
As long as he hasn't fainted
from the injury,

238
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:42,116
I should go talk to him, right?

239
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:43,888
But he didn't let you visit before.

240
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,319
And he won't take your calls.

241
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,761
He’s probably doing all that
because he’s upset.

242
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:51,057
So, as demeaning as it may be,
I need to get down on my knees

243
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,530
and beg.

244
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:54,969
-Let’s go.
-Let's go.

245
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,039
Let's go.

246
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:00,443
Just let us do a quick interview.

247
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,580
Dokgo Jin’s room is over there.

248
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:12,418
It’s surrounded by reporters,
nurses and even guards.

249
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:14,515
What time is it?

250
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:16,764
-Three o'clock.
-Let's wait a bit.

251
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:17,722
In a bit...

252
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,185
opportunity will come.

253
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,830
Hey, it's three o'clock!

254
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:25,056
Park Tae-hwan!

255
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,070
-Let's go.
-Over there!

256
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:28,672
-Is he on?
-Hurry!

257
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:31,404
Let's look at the athletes records
in the Olympics.

258
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,314
In the Asian Games of 2006...

259
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:48,253
You’ve been watching English shows nonstop
since you got here.

260
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:51,394
Be quiet. I'm studying English.

261
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,601
"Clear and out"? Nice try.

262
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:59,773
No wonder you got rejected
because of your English skills.

263
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,373
You, king of jerks. Okay?

264
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:05,373
Very much super dirty.

265
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:07,237
This much you can understand, right?

266
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:14,582
Jin.

267
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:16,677
Can we switch channels for a second?

268
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:18,082
Why?

269
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,390
Park Tae-hwan is swimming.
We should support him!

270
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,362
The competition is today?

271
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,231
-Isn't it an important race?
-Yes.

272
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,463
It's for the gold medal.

273
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:31,658
No, I mean my commercial depends on it.

274
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,400
If he wins the gold medal,

275
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:35,965
didn't you say he gets
my air conditional commercial?

276
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,265
There's talk about it--

277
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,366
Then he can't win the gold.

278
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:43,236
Come on, let’s see how it turns out.

279
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:47,879
You can watch it.

280
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,317
What about you?

281
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:52,181
You’ll be rooting for your commercial.

282
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:55,154
I’m going to root for him.

283
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,290
Good luck!

284
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,390
Whose side are you on?

285
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,928
Introducing the swimmers...

286
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:03,963
Sarit Tiewong from Thailand
in the first lane.

287
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:06,029
Korea's Park Tae-hwan is
in the second lane.

288
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:08,468
-Goodness.
-It's Park Tae-hwan!

289
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,001
Did it start?

290
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:12,236
-Really?
-Hurry up!

291
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:16,279
Get ready, okay?

292
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:18,112
Okay.

293
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,650
You have one shot, all right?

294
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,450
The competition will only last
a couple minutes.

295
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,318
I'll get past them then.

296
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:32,493
Good luck!

297
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:28,754
VIP SECTION KEEP NOISE TO MINIMUM

298
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:32,379
Park Tae-hwan! Swim faster!

299
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:50,541
Park Tae-hwan! Faster!

300
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,574
Park Tae-hwan! Faster!

301
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:55,069
That's right.

302
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:56,741
-Hurry.
-Hurry.

303
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:58,679
He's almost there.

304
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:00,681
Keep going.

305
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,546
You can do it!

306
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:05,084
-Just a bit more.
-You can do it Tae-hwan!

307
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:09,016
Park Tae-hwan! Faster!

308
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:11,661
VIP ROOM

309
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:15,663
DOKGO JIN

310
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,098
No!

311
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:21,733
Please, don’t get the first place!

312
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,940
Please don’t get first place!
My commercial!

313
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:27,813
My commercial!

314
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:29,783
Park Tae-hwan, please! My commercial!

315
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:32,882
Three, two... Park gets the gold medal!

316
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:38,876
-Yes!
-Yes!

317
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:40,418
He got the gold medal.

318
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:44,315
Damn it!

319
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:51,696
You’re fine.

320
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,043
You were jumping up and down.

321
00:18:57,436 --> 00:19:00,406
-What’s this?
-Try jumping up and down again.

322
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,842
Weren’t you just using your leg?

323
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,270
Was it all a lie? It was a big, fat lie.

324
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:31,097
You used it as an excuse
for the Hollywood film.

325
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:34,167
Be quiet. Who are you to talk?

326
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:37,507
And here I was,
thinking you got hurt because of me.

327
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,210
People are cursing me

328
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:41,048
for being the reason
you couldn't go to Hollywood.

329
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,846
I knew for the longest time
that Peter rejected you,

330
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:47,116
but I didn’t say one word!

331
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,222
This is really unfair! Shame on you!

332
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,118
Quiet down! Someone might hear you!

333
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,420
I hope someone does!

334
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:56,204
There are a bunch of people
and reporters outside.

335
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,701
-Be quiet!
-Hey! He’s not hurt at all!

336
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:00,074
His leg is fine, too!

337
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:02,165
You jumped around hoping Park Tae-hwan

338
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:04,104
-wouldn’t win the gold, right?
-Be quiet!

339
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:05,469
I’m going to round everyone up.

340
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:06,967
And I’ll tell them everything!

341
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,809
Stop! Wait!

342
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:10,984
-Where are you going?
-Oh, my.

343
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,010
-My goodness. What are you doing?
-Stop right there!

344
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:16,079
-Stop--
-What are you doing!

345
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:17,248
Come here, you.

346
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:22,923
Park Tae-hwan won the gold!

347
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:29,431
Go to CEO Moon right now
and bring her here.

348
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:30,604
Okay.

349
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:38,899
You tried to kill me!

350
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:43,744
My heart rate hit 110...

351
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:46,613
because of you.

352
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:48,382
Just hold on.

353
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:52,324
I'll offer you a chance to negotiate.

354
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:56,693
ENDORSEMENT AGREEMENT

355
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,255
Wow.

356
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:00,693
Dokgo Jin must be really desperate
to offer all this

357
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:03,303
to someone like you.

358
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:05,856
Do you think I can trust him?

359
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,229
You have the upper hand in all of this.

360
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:10,671
Don’t let him get to you.

361
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:12,572
I guess his reputation really is huge,

362
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:14,838
considering how much he's paying
to preserve it.

363
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:16,436
He said he would hook you up.

364
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:18,142
I wonder what it is.

365
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,214
Isn’t your new show Couple Making

366
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,450
a program about matchmaking?

367
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,854
How bad would it look
if the host goes through a break-up?

368
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,820
-That--
-And if his US plans are canceled,

369
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,030
we don't need to announce the break-up.

370
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:37,133
So, that would work out for you as well.

371
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:41,474
Let's say I accept Ae-jeong.

372
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:43,103
Will the producers accept her?

373
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:44,868
I've already talked to them.

374
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,670
According to them,
they would audition her right now,

375
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:51,109
as long as you're okay with it.

376
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,880
-Welcome.
-Hello.

377
00:21:57,249 --> 00:22:00,289
I’m here to see Ms. Moon in the VIP room.

378
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,952
Of course. A VIP guest has arrived.

379
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,434
I will show you to your room.

380
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:13,229
I don’t know very many people.

381
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:15,498
Finding a doctor to run the clinic
has been hard.

382
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:17,904
Who knew things could be hard for you?

383
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:21,767
I'm introducing to you
the most skilled doctor I know.

384
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,177
She was top of the class
at Kyung-in University.

385
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,847
I picked this place
so we could meet casually.

386
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,620
-Thanks.
-Don't mention it.

387
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:36,891
But since she’s competent and successful,
she'll want a lot of money.

388
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:39,559
If you like her, start high.

389
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:42,894
I’ve never done that before.
I don't know how I'll bring it up.

390
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:46,397
I’ll be right back.

391
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:51,438
You came!

392
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,000
Yes.

393
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:56,412
The others are here, so go on ahead.

394
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:57,935
I'll be back after a quick call.

395
00:22:58,677 --> 00:22:59,637
The others?

396
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,051
I told you that I’d hook you up.

397
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,251
It’s a good opportunity, so impress him.

398
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,549
Okay.

399
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:11,922
I'm glad you found your way.

400
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:13,594
Yes, just continue walking.

401
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:15,292
Yes, you're right.

402
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:17,027
You're almost here.

403
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,329
I’ll be at the entrance,
so come down the stairs.

404
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:21,926
All right.

405
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:42,219
Excuse me...

406
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:45,915
Oh, you’re here.

407
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:48,928
We met outside,
but I was told to go in first.

408
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:51,658
I see. Have a seat.

409
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,030
Okay.

410
00:23:58,336 --> 00:23:59,596
I’ve heard a lot about you.

411
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:01,971
You're known to be quite competent
and successful.

412
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:04,081
Me?

413
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:07,354
I wouldn't say successful.

414
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:16,994
You know where I stand right now, right?

415
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:18,859
Yes...

416
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:26,966
I don't know where to start.

417
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:29,329
Should we wait for my friend?

418
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:30,771
Yes, of course.

419
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:41,884
I want to tell you before we begin.

420
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:45,017
Please let me know how much money
you are looking for.

421
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:46,991
Money?

422
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:49,292
I heard you came here
because you need the money.

423
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,758
Rather than having me state a price,

424
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,933
you can state an offer
based on your value.

425
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,900
I need money?

426
00:24:57,762 --> 00:25:00,302
-What do you mean--
-How much would you like?

427
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:06,239
The others are here, so go on ahead.

428
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:10,412
Remember I told you that I’d hook you up?

429
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:13,576
It’s a good opportunity, so impress him.

430
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:25,988
Is this one of those situations
that I’ve only heard about?

431
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,225
Are you

432
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:36,703
saying that you’re going to give me money?

433
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:41,540
Right. Because I’m going to employ you.

434
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:43,807
You want to buy me?

435
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:46,984
How much will you pay?

436
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:49,876
So, how much am I?

437
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:52,622
I'm sure you've been told this,

438
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:55,551
but I'm willing to match your price.

439
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:59,021
You're saying
that we're negotiating my price?

440
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:03,162
Can you give me a billion won?

441
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,758
-What?
-That must have shocked you.

442
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:09,195
As you should know,
I’m basically a national treasure.

443
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:11,767
-A billion--
-On second thought, a billion is too low.

444
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:16,741
I have lots of needs.

445
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:21,006
I have to buy a car, as well as a house.

446
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:24,879
I also need to open a golf
simulator facility for my dad and brother.

447
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:28,190
I'll probably need ten billion won
to do all that, right?

448
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:31,424
I'm worth ten billion won,
can you afford that?

449
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:34,057
Why? Do I seem crazy

450
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:35,685
for asking you for ten billion?

451
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:38,155
You told me to state my price!

452
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:39,856
You can’t give me ten billion?

453
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:41,632
You said to state any price!

454
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,170
Is ten billion too much?

455
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:46,774
Goodness.

456
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:53,105
How could you say such...

457
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:55,682
I think there was a misunderstanding!

458
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:59,122
Please have some water.

459
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:02,354
Excuse me, please drink this and calm--

460
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:07,864
You can't buy me at any price.

461
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:10,333
I’m a National Treasure Girl.

462
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:12,959
Don’t live like that!

463
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:16,028
You can’t buy or sell a national treasure.
Understood?

464
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,290
What should we do?

465
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:36,246
I feel sorry for her.

466
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,361
-Poor girl.
-What do we do?

467
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:41,794
Something really bad must've happened.

468
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:44,127
Why is she crying here?

469
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:45,656
Poor girl.

470
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:47,474
She's crying so hard.

471
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,469
Why is she crying in the bathroom though?

472
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:51,601
She's crying so much.

473
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:54,411
It's this room. Come in.

474
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:57,975
What happened to you?

475
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,480
What happened?

476
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:05,215
Did you stand under a storm?

477
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:09,050
Some woman claiming
that she's a national treasure

478
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:11,358
asked for ten billion won

479
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:12,663
then did this to me.

480
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,367
Being a national treasure
was my last pride.

481
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:26,166
How dare he think of me that way!

482
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:30,509
I can’t let this go.

483
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:48,692
Ae-jeong!

484
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,370
Why are you here? We've been waiting.

485
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:57,003
Did you confuse the rooms?

486
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,102
It’s this room.

487
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:00,771
Okay.

488
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,711
Please tell me how much you want.

489
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,480
I’ll try my best to match it.

490
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:15,821
I'd just want the same amount
from the hospital I used to work at.

491
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:18,315
Are there any other conditions?

492
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:20,563
No. That’ll be all.

493
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:23,703
You’re very straightforward.

494
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,170
Excuse me for a second.

495
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:56,957
Hi, Ae-jeong.

496
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:58,629
Long time no see.

497
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:02,071
Hi, Se-ri.

498
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:05,995
What brings you here?

499
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:07,437
Say hello.

500
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,966
The main producer of MBS' Couple Making.

501
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:11,041
Hello.

502
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:12,982
-The writer.
-Nice to meet you.

503
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:15,545
And the MC, Kang Se-ri.

504
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:18,981
Ae-jeong starring in a show
that Se-ri hosts

505
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:21,194
is going to be a big issue!

506
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:23,149
Of course.

507
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:27,191
They both became famous through me.

508
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,499
No, it’s because of their past history.

509
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,502
They were both National Treasure Girls.

510
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,098
Those National Treasure Sisters.

511
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:37,143
I can't stand them.

512
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:39,572
It’s National Treasure Girls.

513
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:43,038
Ae-jeong was way more popular back then.

514
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:44,607
And Se-ri was a nobody.

515
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:47,747
It should hurt Ae-jeong's pride.

516
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,247
Se-ri will probably enjoy being cocky

517
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:52,746
and mess around with her.

518
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:55,217
-No way.
-I know her too well.

519
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,760
Her personality is trash.

520
00:30:58,656 --> 00:31:00,386
I guess you know since you’re alike.

521
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:01,758
What did you say?

522
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:08,174
-Jae-seok.
-Yes?

523
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:09,773
Don't just sit there.

524
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:12,144
Go check if the reporters are still here.

525
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,103
There aren’t any!

526
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:15,871
I sent them all away.
And I’ve been keeping watch.

527
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,380
So continue keeping watch outside.

528
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:19,907
Okay.

529
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:22,575
-Leave that here.
-Okay.

530
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:46,271
Are you unhappy or something?

531
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:50,036
Does it hurt your pride

532
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:51,338
to star in a show that I'm hosting?

533
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:55,277
If that's the case, don't do the show.

534
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:57,646
Honestly, I don't feel completely fine.

535
00:31:57,882 --> 00:31:59,722
But I can’t refuse the show.

536
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:01,794
When we were in a group,

537
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,490
you would use your popularity

538
00:32:03,888 --> 00:32:06,118
to stick me in shows.

539
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,430
Since we’ve switched places now,

540
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:13,002
just think of it
as me returning the favor.

541
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,272
Remember what you used to say to me?

542
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:20,038
“Don’t let your pride get hurt,
and do your best.”

543
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,809
Do your best, Ae-jeong.

544
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:37,386
Do you have any idea what you just did?

545
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:40,056
I told you that I was just joking around.

546
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,934
What did I do so wrong?

547
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:48,728
Se-ri, I'm...

548
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,196
What’s going on?

549
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:55,969
What happened?

550
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:06,253
Se-ri!

551
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:26,773
These all say

552
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,538
that Gu Ae-jeong is a bully.

553
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:36,551
GU AE-JEONG BECOMES ANKLE GIRL
AFTER CAUSING DOKGO JIN’S ACCIDENT

554
00:33:36,714 --> 00:33:38,354
BANISH GU AE-JEONG FROM THE COUNTRY

555
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:40,016
IT'S WORSE THAT SHE'S UNSCRATCHED

556
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:41,624
KNEEL DOWN AND APOLOGIZE!

557
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,056
HOW CAN YOU EVEN EAT
AFTER WHAT YOU’VE DONE?

558
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:49,293
She’s getting a lot of hate for this.

559
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:53,698
JUST DIE

560
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:58,173
GU AE-JEONG BECOMES ANKLE GIRL
AFTER CAUSING DOKGO JIN’S ACCIDENT

561
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:07,305
All these hate comments
should be reported.

562
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:10,619
Who wrote this?

563
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:12,945
Username "Dokgo Enthusiast."

564
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:15,519
It's my fan.

565
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:26,629
Why did you want to see me?

566
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,525
Upload this.

567
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:31,196
I’ll publish an article confirming it.

568
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:38,444
"I just visited Dokgo Jin at the hospital.

569
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:41,879
I felt so bad seeing his leg
that broke because of me.

570
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:44,976
But he happily forgave me
and reassured me.

571
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:46,849
Thank you so much, Dokgo Jin.

572
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:49,291
Please pray for his speedy recovery."

573
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:53,185
I can't let people post terrible comments

574
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:56,757
about you because of me.
It's bad for my image.

575
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:59,601
That's the only reason why
I'm going to do this.

576
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:03,228
Are you really forgiving me?

577
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:06,001
What? Do you think I will?

578
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:10,513
Fine.

579
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,005
You don’t need to forgive me
on the inside.

580
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:16,077
At least on the outside, I'll be forgiven

581
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:17,947
and this situation should settle.

582
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:20,817
Then...

583
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:23,989
Can I make one more request?

584
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:25,115
What?

585
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:26,059
I need proof.

586
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,694
Could you take a photo with me?

587
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:29,988
A photo? With you?

588
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:32,032
Forget it.

589
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:36,470
I’m going to take it! One, two, three!

590
00:35:41,405 --> 00:35:42,435
It came out well.

591
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:44,414
Let me see it.

592
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:50,784
Okay, post this one.

593
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:55,922
Go outside and do it.

594
00:35:56,754 --> 00:35:57,924
Okay.

595
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:04,898
Dokgo Jin.

596
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:08,495
Thank you.

597
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:21,481
Tangerine?

598
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:24,324
Grapes!

599
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:33,756
If I post this,

600
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,625
maybe they’ll stop calling me cheeky
for not visiting him.

601
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,396
Am I smiling too hard?

602
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:43,733
Dokgo Jin.

603
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:48,465
I’m just visiting Dokgo Jin
at the hospital.

604
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:01,551
What's the news?

605
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:04,789
I got a call from Peter Jason.

606
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:07,163
He was shocked to hear about the injury.

607
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,185
So, what?

608
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:10,459
He wants to bring you back on board!

609
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:12,461
Wang Ryun must've been disappointing!

610
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:13,600
What?

611
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:17,835
I'm going to do Peter's film?

612
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:21,212
That’s right.
But you have to start next week.

613
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:23,172
No problem! Tell him I'll be there!

614
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,141
All right.

615
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:26,678
Since the press doesn’t know
about your cast yet,

616
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,405
take it off at once.

617
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:30,446
Okay!

618
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:37,821
Gu Ae-jeong.

619
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:41,032
I JUST VISITED DOKGO JIN AT THE HOSPITAL.

620
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,734
"But he happily forgave me

621
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,370
and reassured..."

622
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,397
"Reassured"? Huh.

623
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:53,271
No, Ae-jeong! The photo...

624
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:57,483
Your leg...

625
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:15,492
Goodness...

626
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:19,764
Not the photo...

627
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:25,300
VIP SECTION KEEP NOISE TO MINIMUM

628
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:29,844
HOSPITAL ELEVATOR

629
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:43,089
Gu Ae-jeong, please!

630
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:47,934
"Please pray for his speedy recovery."

631
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,702
Where are you, Gu Ae-jeong?

632
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:53,900
Upload.

633
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,398

I JUST VISITED DOKGO JIN AT THE HOSPITAL.

637
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:07,453
Hey, Gu Ae-jeong!

638
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:18,517
It’s been uploaded!

639
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:20,829
Delete it! Hurry up and delete it!
Delete it!

640
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:23,692
I said, delete it!

641
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:31,143
People are already responding.

642
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:34,936
It’s been posted? You posted the photo?

643
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:37,775
Yes! Look at all the comments.

644
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:40,039
It's blowing up.

645
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:42,411
There's already an article about it!

646
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:46,677
DOKGO JIN FORGIVES GENEROUSLY

647
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:59,427
It didn’t work out.

648
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:09,367
He couldn’t delay the shoot.

649
00:40:10,307 --> 00:40:12,977
He said he would have to go
with Wang Ryun,

650
00:40:13,043 --> 00:40:14,453
and seemed so disappointed.

651
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:21,022
But it’s not like we can announce
that your injury was all a lie.

652
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:25,363
Let’s just assume you and Peter

653
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,963
weren’t meant to be this time around.

654
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:30,896
But honestly,
it’s not like I directly meddled

655
00:40:30,961 --> 00:40:32,801
in his relationship with Peter.

656
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:35,673
But I feel like it’s my fault
for breaking them up.

657
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:38,573
Peter may not have come
to Dokgo Jin’s rescue,

658
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:40,736
but Dokgo Jin sure came to yours.

659
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:43,371
Your schedule is fully booked
for the entire week!

660
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,641
-Really?
-Ms. Gu!

661
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:46,479
-Hello!
-Hello!

662
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:50,378
Can you return next week
for another round of I Can Do It?

663
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,648
Of course! Thank you.

664
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,890
When is the recording?

665
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,152
COUPLE MAKING
WITH KANG SE-RI

666
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,660
Hello.

667
00:40:57,721 --> 00:40:58,921
-Hello.
-Hello.

668
00:40:59,323 --> 00:41:01,933
We have a meeting next week
with the entire cast.

669
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:03,932
-Okay.
-Let's do it well.

670
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:05,304
I'll do my best.

671
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:10,628
Did you sign the contract with Ae-jeong?

672
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:12,195
Yes.

673
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:16,613
And did she decide to do Se-ri’s show?

674
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:18,077
Yes.

675
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,576
She must be happy.

676
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:24,946
And he...

677
00:41:27,351 --> 00:41:28,391
Here...

678
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:33,224
Peter sent the wine back from LA

679
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:36,127
through Mr. Gong.

680
00:41:41,532 --> 00:41:44,202
In the end, you’re the only one
who got really lucky.

681
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:46,939
Dokgo Jin is your knight in shining armor.

682
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:50,238
Peter Jason’s fickleness
is the biggest problem here!

683
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:55,348
Also, the fact that Se-ri
let you in her show

684
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:58,153
is a little fishy.

685
00:41:58,315 --> 00:41:59,915
I know. Why did she do it?

686
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:02,491
Ae-jeong will grab some attention

687
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:05,063
and leave on the first round
of selections, right?

688
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:07,562
That decision will be up to the guy.

689
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:10,325
If our guy has peculiar taste,

690
00:42:10,394 --> 00:42:12,004
she may stay on.

691
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:13,796
YUN PIL-JOO

692
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,701
Among all the male candidates...

693
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:17,543
YUN PIL-JOO

694
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:19,841
...I like him the most. Who is he?

695
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:22,414
His name is Yun Pil-joo.
I knew him from high school.

696
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,737
He has an IQ of 160. He's brilliant.

697
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:28,550
Just look at him. He looks like a model!

698
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:31,976
A doctor of oriental medicine,
and comes from a good family.

699
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:34,517
He’s got it all.

700
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:38,092
But starring in a TV show

701
00:42:38,155 --> 00:42:40,315
and going on dates
with female celebrities?

702
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:41,788
He won't want to do that.

703
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,496
If you can't persuade him,

704
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:46,602
I'll help you out.

705
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:48,704
If you meet him,

706
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:50,026
he might hurt your pride.

707
00:42:50,467 --> 00:42:51,837
CHUNYEONG CLINIC

708
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,972
-Isn’t that Kang Se-ri?
-It is!

709
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:56,108
-It’s Kang Se-ri, right?
-It is!

710
00:42:56,173 --> 00:42:57,473
My goodness.

711
00:42:58,208 --> 00:43:00,508
She has such a small face.

712
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,848
-She's so pretty.
-Aren’t you Kang Se-ri?

713
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,923
I’m here to see Dr. Yun Pil-joo.

714
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:06,022
Dr. Yun?

715
00:43:06,817 --> 00:43:08,747
Of course. Please have a seat.

716
00:43:11,288 --> 00:43:12,558
ORIENTAL MEDICINE TREATMENT

717
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,255
Kang Se-ri is here. Kang Se-ri!

718
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:20,633
Where is she?

719
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:23,896
Over there.

720
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:34,039
Eun-ho told me a lot about you.
I’m Yun Pil-joo.

721
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:35,811
I’m Kang Se-ri. I called you earlier.

722
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:37,476
It’s lunchtime, right?

723
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:39,978
Let’s talk over lunch.

724
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:42,518
I have 15 minutes left until lunchtime.

725
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:45,093
-Please have a seat and wait a bit.
-What?

726
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:54,967
-I’ll have carbonara.
-Okay.

727
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:58,997
-Just coffee for me.
-Okay.

728
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:03,509
You're not eating?

729
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:04,984
If you wanted me to eat,

730
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:06,942
you should've taken me to a private room.

731
00:44:07,845 --> 00:44:08,945
People like me

732
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:12,083
can’t eat in open places like this.

733
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:18,663
Kang Se-ri, you’re so pretty!

734
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:21,132
You look like a doll.
Please give me your autograph!

735
00:44:26,697 --> 00:44:29,327
Got it! Thank you.

736
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:31,173
Please give me your autograph.

737
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:33,095
I'm a fan. Please give me your autograph.

738
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:38,013
-Give me a second.
-Please sign here.

739
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:40,279
YUN PIL-JOO

740
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:45,715
Hello?

741
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:48,953
It's a method I use
to avoid annoying people.

742
00:44:49,586 --> 00:44:51,856
If you stay on the phone,
they won't talk to you.

743
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:59,634
I see. Yes, I can talk.

744
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,267
Okay. Yes, it's fine.

745
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:02,901
I’m sorry. I have a call.

746
00:45:03,233 --> 00:45:04,703
It's okay. You were saying?

747
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:06,172
Yes.

748
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:08,941
Right.

749
00:45:11,975 --> 00:45:12,935
Yes.

750
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:15,284
See? They just leave.

751
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:18,254
I guess it works.

752
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:21,589
I’m sorry.
I had no idea you'd be uncomfortable.

753
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:25,493
I’ve never eaten with a celebrity.

754
00:45:26,423 --> 00:45:27,623
Why don’t you order now?

755
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:29,888
I'll find a better place for tea.

756
00:45:31,161 --> 00:45:32,901
What’s good here?

757
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:35,197
Everything is pretty good.

758
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:38,297
But don't order the steak.

759
00:45:39,636 --> 00:45:41,566
You can’t eat it while you're
on the phone.

760
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:51,219
Kang Se-ri was here?

761
00:45:51,281 --> 00:45:52,951
She didn’t come for treatment.

762
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:56,047
I think she came
to cast Dr. Yun for a show.

763
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:58,563
Television? Which show?

764
00:45:58,822 --> 00:46:01,192
For her show, Couple Making.

765
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:05,159
It’s a show where a successful bachelor
dates female celebrities.

766
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:06,695
A reality show?

767
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,728
That doesn’t suit my Pil-joo.

768
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,270
A medical documentary might.

769
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:12,835
Do you know Sungdam Skin Clinic?

770
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,210
The doctor there starred in a reality show

771
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:16,812
and his business hit the jackpot.

772
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:18,981
So many celebrities go there.

773
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:22,453
And he’s engaged to the anchor
he met on the show.

774
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:25,919
-Really?
-This show that recruited Dr. Yun

775
00:46:25,983 --> 00:46:28,423
is even more popular than the other one!

776
00:46:32,856 --> 00:46:35,126
As you can see,
I’m not suited for television.

777
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:38,856
Eun-ho forced me to at least meet you.

778
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:41,103
I have no wish to appear on the show.

779
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:45,666
At least take a look at our proposal.

780
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:48,143
Our previous bachelors

781
00:46:48,205 --> 00:46:50,665
were also hesitant at first
and declined to do it.

782
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:52,675
But afterward,

783
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:55,953
they said that it was
a fun and exciting experience.

784
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:57,824
Wait.

785
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,487
Your nail color doesn’t look good.

786
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:04,487
And your palms are red.

787
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:06,659
-You drink a lot, right?
-What?

788
00:47:07,057 --> 00:47:08,687
No, I mean...

789
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:11,163
Stick out your tongue.

790
00:47:13,397 --> 00:47:14,397
What?

791
00:47:19,436 --> 00:47:20,496
More than that, more.

792
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:24,169
You have coating, too.

793
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:26,942
You have bad breath in the morning, right?

794
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:29,712
Wait.

795
00:47:33,283 --> 00:47:34,653
Am I sick?

796
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:39,124
You should stop by the hospital.

797
00:47:39,923 --> 00:47:41,093
And cut back on drinking.

798
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:43,732
My lunch hour is nearly up.

799
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:46,255
I need to get going.

800
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:49,767
Since you came all the way here
to give me this,

801
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:51,203
I’ll take a look at it.

802
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:53,196
Goodbye.

803
00:48:04,414 --> 00:48:06,524
I really didn’t think
he was going to pick up.

804
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:08,617
You look so pretty.

805
00:48:10,454 --> 00:48:12,394
Look at my expression. I was so nervous.

806
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:14,860
He's not going to answer right away.

807
00:48:14,992 --> 00:48:17,432
-I was so nervous right then.
-Hello?

808
00:48:19,863 --> 00:48:22,033
-Isn’t it dramatic?
-It’s awesome.

809
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:23,329
AE-JEONG AND JIN CONNECTED

810
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:26,997
It's yellowish, and you peel it
and eat it. It's sour and sweet.

811
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,170
-A tangerine?
-Tangerine!

812
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:30,409
Didn't I describe it well?

813
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:32,544
-Yeah.
-The best. The perfect combo.

814
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:34,139
Move over, Dad!

815
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:36,411
-Just wait until you get old.
-I can't see.

816
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,320
You called Dokgo Jin with your phone

817
00:48:39,383 --> 00:48:42,053
-and he took the quiz?
-Yeah, isn't that nice of him?

818
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,320
He's really good!

819
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:47,555
-Correct.
-There isn't much time left.

820
00:48:47,624 --> 00:48:49,034
-Hurry up.
-It's red, and...

821
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:50,462
There's a seed in it.

822
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:51,800
-A plum?
-No, it's not that.

823
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:54,132
I wonder if he’s watching the show too.

824
00:48:54,197 --> 00:48:55,927
It seems like she's stuck.
Time is ticking.

825
00:48:55,999 --> 00:48:57,529
You say "lips like" this!

826
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:00,871
MR. ASSHOLE

827
00:49:01,071 --> 00:49:02,341
Next.

828
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:04,036
It’s an erotic film. "Wild" something.

829
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:05,477
Strawberries?

830
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:07,342
-He got it.
-Correct!

831
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:09,211
-Hurry up.
-Yes.

832
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:11,679
-What you eat a lot in the summer.
-Melons.

833
00:49:11,882 --> 00:49:12,822
No, not that.

834
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:14,423
-Peaches?
-No.

835
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:16,794
--It's red, and there are black seeds.
-Watermelon!

836
00:49:17,187 --> 00:49:19,157
-The bribe you gave Peter Jason!
-Peter?

837
00:49:20,424 --> 00:49:21,464
Oh, the wine.

838
00:49:21,658 --> 00:49:23,928
-What's it made from?
-Grapes!

839
00:49:24,895 --> 00:49:26,995
-Wow!
-He got it all right.

840
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:29,028
Yes!

841
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:32,569
Why did you do that?

842
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:37,869
Mr. Dokgo, congratulations.

843
00:49:45,515 --> 00:49:48,845
You must bribe directors
with wine and whatnot.

844
00:49:50,587 --> 00:49:51,887
No, it wasn't a bribe.

845
00:49:52,456 --> 00:49:54,686
It was just a small gift.

846
00:49:56,927 --> 00:49:58,457
COUPLE MAKING

847
00:49:58,528 --> 00:50:00,198
He must've really wanted

848
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:02,033
to do the film to bribe the director.

849
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:03,999
We congratulate you for getting a part

850
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:05,937
in the film you wanted so much.

851
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:08,407
Wait.

852
00:50:08,472 --> 00:50:11,172
This woman is the national treasure girl.

853
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:13,478
You know the National Treasure Girls.

854
00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:17,605
-Pardon?
-It's her on television right now.

855
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:20,151
She's Gu Ae-jeong
from National Treasure Girls.

856
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,050
Ankle Girl, the hated celebrity.

857
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:23,349
Dokgo Jin, good luck!

858
00:50:24,821 --> 00:50:25,961
It really is her.

859
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:29,460
GU AE-JEONG

860
00:50:31,995 --> 00:50:33,455
Then why did she act like that?

861
00:50:37,634 --> 00:50:40,074
I won't sit around like an idiot anymore.

862
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:43,442
Where are my car keys?

863
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,110
GU AE-JEONG

864
00:50:54,484 --> 00:50:55,724
What do you want?

865
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:58,292
It’s yellow
and electricity comes out of its head.

866
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,087
What?

867
00:51:01,425 --> 00:51:03,785
It starts with a “P” and ends with “chu.”

868
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:06,961
-Pikachu?
-Ding dong!

869
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:09,125
Who are you?

870
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:11,399
It’s a penguin with glasses.

871
00:51:11,468 --> 00:51:14,068
It starts with “Po” and ends in “ro.”

872
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:16,338
It’s really cute.

873
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:17,906
-Pororo.
-Ding dong!

874
00:51:17,974 --> 00:51:19,244
Hey, who are you?

875
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:20,439
Where's Ae-jeong?

876
00:51:21,778 --> 00:51:23,678
It’s a train that huffs and puffs.

877
00:51:24,147 --> 00:51:25,417
It starts with “Tho.”

878
00:51:25,949 --> 00:51:27,919
Stop it! Who are you?

879
00:51:28,452 --> 00:51:31,052
I said it starts with “Tho"!

880
00:51:31,121 --> 00:51:32,621
Thomas! Satisfied?

881
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:34,863
-Get Ae-jeong on the phone!
-Ding dong!

882
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,130
Who are you talking to?

883
00:51:38,195 --> 00:51:39,895
Hey! Did Ae-jeong make you call me?

884
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:42,267
Is she next to you?
Give her the phone now!

885
00:51:42,566 --> 00:51:44,566
-What are you doing?
-The speed quiz.

886
00:51:47,637 --> 00:51:48,607
Hey, Ding Dong!

887
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:51,012
Did Gu Ae-jeong tell you to mock me?

888
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:52,741
Answer me, Ding Dong!

889
00:51:54,044 --> 00:51:55,484
Oh no, what do I do!

890
00:51:55,912 --> 00:51:56,952
What do I do!

891
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,460
He must have copied
what he saw on television.

892
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:08,130
I’m really sorry.

893
00:52:11,528 --> 00:52:12,828
You must've been surprised.

894
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:16,531
You should have just hung up sooner.

895
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,970
He kept going because you kept responding.

896
00:52:19,336 --> 00:52:20,866
You answered three questions!

897
00:52:20,937 --> 00:52:23,137
He gave me questions. I answered them.

898
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:25,276
Like how the phone rang and I answered it.

899
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:26,542
Why did you do that?

900
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:28,380
Yes. Why did I do that?

901
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:34,583
Forget it. Just go.

902
00:52:35,685 --> 00:52:39,485
But I was wondering about something.

903
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:42,560
Why did you answer my call that time?

904
00:52:43,193 --> 00:52:44,863
I didn’t think you would.

905
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:52,541
That's because I empathized with
your desperation just for a second.

906
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:55,937
Even though you getting rejected
from a quiz show

907
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:58,406
is completely different from me
getting rejected

908
00:52:58,475 --> 00:52:59,775
from Peter Jason’s film.

909
00:53:02,746 --> 00:53:03,846
Dokgo Jin.

910
00:53:06,216 --> 00:53:07,516
Thank you so much.

911
00:53:10,987 --> 00:53:12,687
I thought you did it out of annoyance

912
00:53:12,756 --> 00:53:14,486
because I kept pestering you.

913
00:53:15,225 --> 00:53:18,195
I'm so grateful
that you empathized with me.

914
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:23,269
You should be honored, not grateful.

915
00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:33,237
By the way, why are you packing?

916
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:34,310
Are you going away?

917
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:37,407
I will no longer stay here like an idiot.

918
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:42,887
People are still outside.

919
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:47,694
Can you carry all your stuff on crutches?

920
00:53:51,194 --> 00:53:52,804
DISABLED PARKING AREA

921
00:53:59,302 --> 00:54:01,502
-I’ve loaded everything.
-All right. Go.

922
00:54:03,873 --> 00:54:04,983
But...

923
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:07,639
Even if it's a fake cast,

924
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:10,681
don't you think it’s a little dangerous
to drive with it?

925
00:54:20,123 --> 00:54:21,693
So you live in this neighborhood.

926
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:23,332
I live around here, too.

927
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:25,797
If we make a left, that would be my house.

928
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:28,702
I don’t want to know. Keep going straight.

929
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:31,373
Okay.

930
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:33,274
Drive slowly, safely and quickly.

931
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:44,675
-Oh, no.
-Seriously!

932
00:54:44,748 --> 00:54:45,718
I'm sorry.

933
00:54:46,016 --> 00:54:47,416
Goodness.

934
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:51,319
Sorry, I didn’t know
you were standing here.

935
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:54,820
Where should I put all this?

936
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:56,561
-Just leave it here.
-Okay.

937
00:55:00,096 --> 00:55:03,296
Now I feel like I’ve been
some help to you.

938
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:06,166
This is not a big deal at all.

939
00:55:06,236 --> 00:55:09,636
Ever since I met you,
good things keep happening to me.

940
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:13,640
My friend calls you
my knight in shining armor.

941
00:55:13,743 --> 00:55:14,943
-"Knight"?
-Yes.

942
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:21,920
Gu Ae-jeong.

943
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:25,219
From now on, don’t act like you know me.

944
00:55:25,288 --> 00:55:27,018
don’t talk about me to others,

945
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:28,590
and don't act like we're close.

946
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:31,998
That would be helping me out.

947
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:33,102
Understood?

948
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,197
Yes, I understand.

949
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,636
If that kid calls me again,
I’ll report you.

950
00:55:38,702 --> 00:55:40,072
I didn’t make him--

951
00:55:40,136 --> 00:55:42,136
Then erase my number from your phone.

952
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:44,339
All right.

953
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:47,639
Did you call me your knight?

954
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:56,250
You’re a demon to me,

955
00:55:56,486 --> 00:55:57,546
so back off!

956
00:55:58,455 --> 00:55:59,815
All right. I’ll back off.

957
00:56:01,825 --> 00:56:03,055
I’ll get going now.

958
00:56:04,294 --> 00:56:05,304
Good night.

959
00:56:26,649 --> 00:56:27,719
Hey, Ae-hwan.

960
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,450
I’ll be right there.

961
00:56:31,921 --> 00:56:33,291
Okay. See you.

962
00:56:51,107 --> 00:56:52,307
It’s that song.

963
00:56:55,478 --> 00:56:57,908
It bothers me in an odd way.

964
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:09,390
FIGHTER

965
00:57:09,459 --> 00:57:10,789
Next customer please.

966
00:57:11,528 --> 00:57:13,358
Goodness, hurry up.

967
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:21,742
DOKGO JIN’S MOVIE FIGHTER
A BOX OFFICE HIT!

968
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:23,335
FIGHTER SURPASSES THREE MILLION

969
00:57:23,406 --> 00:57:25,006
NEARLY FOUR MILLION IN THE THIRD WEEK!

970
00:57:25,074 --> 00:57:26,614
WE'RE TOGETHER UNTIL THE END!

971
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:29,083
Ms. Moon,
I think Jin not going to Hollywood

972
00:57:29,412 --> 00:57:31,312
helped his film succeed.

973
00:57:31,381 --> 00:57:33,321
I thought the movie would get bad reviews,

974
00:57:33,416 --> 00:57:35,246
but it didn't because
people felt bad for him.

975
00:57:35,318 --> 00:57:37,488
Anyway, it’s a relief
that he didn't get discouraged.

976
00:57:37,554 --> 00:57:39,194
He’s got a schedule today, right?

977
00:57:39,255 --> 00:57:40,415
He’s in such a good mood

978
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:42,530
that he decided to do all the interviews.

979
00:57:43,026 --> 00:57:45,626
Today, he said he would drive himself
to the studio.

980
00:57:46,429 --> 00:57:49,399
If he was always like this,
it wouldn't be so hard being his manager.

981
00:57:51,034 --> 00:57:53,104
Who's the most handsome actor
in this country?

982
00:57:53,169 --> 00:57:55,969
Jang Dong-geon? No, the one with style.
Cha Seung-won?

983
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:58,339
No, the actor who made it big
with his movie, Fighter!

984
00:57:58,408 --> 00:58:00,438
Dokgo Jin! Ding dong.

985
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:07,050
This is Dokgo Jin’s world

986
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:11,319
Thank you for today.

987
00:58:11,387 --> 00:58:13,557
You did a good job today.

988
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:15,387
Please call me again.

989
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:17,659
I heard you got a fixed show.

990
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:19,257
Yes, Couple Making.

991
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,629
We'll start recording soon.

992
00:58:20,697 --> 00:58:22,527
That’s a big show.

993
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:23,999
After all you’ve gone through.

994
00:58:24,234 --> 00:58:25,874
I’m worried. I have to do well.

995
00:58:25,935 --> 00:58:26,835
I’m sure you will.

996
00:58:26,903 --> 00:58:28,613
Thank you!

997
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:29,741
Goodbye.

998
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:34,640
Hi.

999
00:58:37,247 --> 00:58:38,917
They greet you based on ratings.

1000
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:42,290
I’ll get going.

1001
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:44,589
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

1002
00:58:49,959 --> 00:58:50,959
Hey, girls!

1003
00:58:53,463 --> 00:58:56,203
You should greet people when you leave.

1004
00:58:57,767 --> 00:58:58,737
We did.

1005
00:58:58,801 --> 00:59:02,071
To everyone, not just me.

1006
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:03,572
What’s up with her?

1007
00:59:03,907 --> 00:59:06,337
And you all came late today, right?

1008
00:59:06,843 --> 00:59:10,253
Did you or did you not apologize
for being late?

1009
00:59:12,181 --> 00:59:15,251
If you do well now,
you’ll reap the benefits later.

1010
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:18,349
I’m telling you this out of affection

1011
00:59:18,421 --> 00:59:20,061
from my experience. Okay?

1012
00:59:20,924 --> 00:59:22,034
Bye.

1013
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:25,803
-Hello.
-Hi.

1014
00:59:26,796 --> 00:59:28,796
She must be crazy! What’s up with her?

1015
00:59:28,865 --> 00:59:30,965
-She did that last time.
-What’s wrong?

1016
00:59:31,034 --> 00:59:33,004
-She keeps bothering us.
-It's annoying!

1017
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:34,299
Ignore her!

1018
00:59:35,171 --> 00:59:38,311
You used to be her road manager, right?

1019
00:59:38,775 --> 00:59:41,035
I think that's why she looks down on us.

1020
00:59:41,878 --> 00:59:42,908
It's so annoying.

1021
01:00:06,469 --> 01:00:08,709
-Pil-joo!
-Hello.

1022
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:11,609
Thanks for coming all the way here.
Let’s go.

1023
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:18,783
You’re already at the studio?

1024
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:20,375
I'm on my way.

1025
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:23,547
Jae-seok,
I’ve been too nice to you lately, right?

1026
01:00:24,687 --> 01:00:25,757
Hurry up.

1027
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:32,531
Darn it.

1028
01:00:35,898 --> 01:00:36,868
Dokgo Jin!

1029
01:00:41,871 --> 01:00:43,871
Right, he told me not to act
like I know him.

1030
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,270
Okay!

1031
01:00:48,444 --> 01:00:50,984
She's acting like she knows me again.

1032
01:01:01,557 --> 01:01:02,757
Why are you calling?

1033
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:04,285
I knew you would do this!

1034
01:01:04,927 --> 01:01:06,357
I told you to delete my number!

1035
01:01:06,429 --> 01:01:07,959
Why didn’t you erase it?
Erase it right now!

1036
01:01:11,901 --> 01:01:12,971
Seriously.

1037
01:01:13,436 --> 01:01:15,906
He doesn’t delete mine.
Why should I delete his?

1038
01:01:16,906 --> 01:01:17,906
Done.

1039
01:01:27,483 --> 01:01:28,523
Sir?

1040
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:32,190
Who do you think you are?

1041
01:01:35,758 --> 01:01:38,258
Who are you to order my girls
to greet people

1042
01:01:38,327 --> 01:01:39,757
and make them apologize?

1043
01:01:40,229 --> 01:01:42,629
A nasty bum like you.

1044
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,073
What could they possibly learn

1045
01:01:45,134 --> 01:01:47,644
from you and your advice?

1046
01:01:48,738 --> 01:01:49,938
From now on,

1047
01:01:50,673 --> 01:01:53,383
don't overstep your boundaries.

1048
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:56,311
It looks pathetic.

1049
01:01:59,015 --> 01:02:00,115
Wait.

1050
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:07,889
Girls,

1051
01:02:09,158 --> 01:02:10,788
you can't act like this.

1052
01:02:12,962 --> 01:02:14,162
You'll end up like me.

1053
01:02:15,531 --> 01:02:16,831
Do you want that?

1054
01:02:17,633 --> 01:02:18,903
Isn't it frightening?

1055
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:22,436
From now on, when you see me,

1056
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:24,472
don't be proud. Be scared.

1057
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:28,405
Like this gaze right now.

1058
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:30,806
Let's go.

1059
01:02:31,547 --> 01:02:32,617
Come one, let's go.

1060
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:10,620
AE-HWAN

1061
01:04:21,724 --> 01:04:23,464
I want to meet this person.

1062
01:04:23,726 --> 01:04:24,726
Gu Ae-jeong?

1063
01:04:24,794 --> 01:04:26,164
Why do you let them slap you?

1064
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:28,799
Wait, I don't think you should leave
right now.

1065
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:29,795
What are you doing?

1066
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:32,266
Thank you, Mom.

1067
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:34,435
Eliminated in five minutes.

1068
01:04:34,503 --> 01:04:36,713
It'll create tension from the start.
Doesn't that sound good?

1069
01:04:36,906 --> 01:04:39,036
He might not recognize me
if I'm in full makeup.

1070
01:04:39,508 --> 01:04:41,508
Ms. Gu? Are you really Ms. Gu?

1071
01:04:41,978 --> 01:04:43,378
I’d rather leave the show.

01:04:43,446 --> 01:04:46,046
So you're saying I can't be on the show?

1073
01:04:46,582 --> 01:04:48,622
I don't see my name in here.

1074
01:04:49,685 --> 01:04:51,015
Asshole?

1075
01:04:51,821 --> 01:04:54,321
They're all for you,

1076
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:55,760
so choose anything you want.
