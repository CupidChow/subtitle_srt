00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,060
You mean bastard...

4
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,270
Recharge.

5
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,899
I thought we could catch a midnight movie.

6
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,309
But it's so late already,
there's nothing we can watch.

7
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,799
Of course there isn't.

8
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,260
Wouldn't everyone have gone home
by this hour?

9
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,750
Shall we go eat something then?

10
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:02,599
But it's so late already, I'm not sure
if there are any shops still open.

11
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,789
Of course there aren't.

12
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,250
Wouldn't everyone have gone home to eat
by this hour?

13
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:10,459
It will be too late to go on a picnic,
right?

14
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,750
I guess I'll just go back home.

15
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,909
How about going to my home?

16
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:19,599
If you go to my home,
there will be a lot of food for you.

17
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,399
You can also watch movies
and play with the computer game system.

18
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,730
Oh, there's something
I want to show you as well.

19
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,080
The actual thing.
I'll show it to you properly.

20
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,889
What actual thing
are you going to show me properly?

21
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,119
Potato.

22
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,540
The potato that I'm growing.
I'll show you the actual thing properly.

23
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,129
Why?

24
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:40,189
Did you think
I wanted to show myself to you properly?

25
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,779
Well, I can show you if you want...

26
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,650
Forget it!

27
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,669
Let's just go for a drive.

28
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,660
Looking at the view at night
is also a kind of picnic, right?

29
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,840
What an awfully boring picnic.

30
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,410
You said it was awfully boring?

31
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,720
Nope.

32
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,690
It became awfully fun.

33
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,060
Oh?

34
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,219
We're almost out of fuel.

35
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,480
The car will stop
if we don't go home right away.

36
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,449
There's a gas station
just past the building.

37
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,829
Let's get some fuel before we go.

38
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,130
Nope, when did you see it?

39
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,760
There's a blanket here.

40
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,620
What are you doing?

41
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:01,509
If we get seen together, it will
cause problems for the two of us. Right?

42
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,250
I'll just do this.

43
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:07,949
Ah... Just lower your head
so that your face can't be seen.

44
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:11,189
I'll feel more at ease
if I can't be seen at all.

45
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,700
I'll feel more at ease.

46
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,000
Let's go!

47
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,470
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

48
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,970
Hello!

49
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,930
How much gas do you need?

50
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,230
Fifty thousand won worth.

51
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,680
Are you Dok Go Jin?

52
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,379
Yes, yes.

53
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,379
I'm a big fan of yours.

54
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,769
Thank you. Yes.

55
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,129
I'll fill up fifty thousand won
worth of gas.

56
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,020
- Fifty thousand won!
- Okay.

57
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,190
Is that a person sitting in there?

58
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,709
It looks like a woman.
Could it be Kang Se Ri?

59
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,620
- Kang Se Ri?
- Yeah.

60
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,880
It seems so.

61
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,140
- I'm really curious.
- Who is it?

62
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,130
It looks like it is Kang Se Ri indeed.

63
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,539
- It's all done.
- Okay.

64
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,640
Is that your friend?

65
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,200
It's so warm but
she's covering herself with a blanket.

66
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,120
Thank you.

67
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,280
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

68
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:48,180
Hey, hey, hey.
Is that a woman?

69
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,450
It would have been troublesome
if not for the blanket.

70
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:08,040
Being in our line of work
is really difficult.

71
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,240
We can't even go for a drive properly
in peace.

72
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,460
I think we need to prepare a bigger blanket
for emergency situations.

73
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:26,100
I'm upset so just sit there quietly.

74
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:37,670
Dok Go Jin, please pull over there.

75
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,240
Are you going to get off and leave?

76
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,869
I want to get something
from that convenience store.

77
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,310
I don't think
there's much food in your refrigerator.

78
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:52,520
Let's buy some good food
and have a picnic at your house.

79
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,460
Is that so?

80
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,870
Okay.

81
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,939
Is this really the one
which I brought over the other time?

82
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,970
It is.
But it's grown by the special Dok Go Jin

83
00:07:14,005 --> 00:07:16,470
so its quality is different
from other potatoes. Take a look at this.

84
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,520
Attached to this amazingly straight stem
are such vibrantly green leaves.

85
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:26,790
Everything that comes out of your mouth
serves to praise yourself.

86
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,200
But I brought a few of them the other time.
Why did you only grow one?

87
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,890
The rest were executed.

88
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:43,679
Seeing how well it has grown,
maybe a flower will bloom.

89
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,259
Yeah, I'll grow it well
and give you potato-flower viewing.

90
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:51,439
In that case, there will also be
potato flowers blooming in your background.

91
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,710
Like this?

92
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,520
Ding Dong.

93
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,290
Ding Dong.

94
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,250
Wait a moment.
Are those biscuits?

95
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,090
Green tea flavor.

96
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,810
What?

97
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,940
What Ding Dong is this now?

98
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,130
Wait a moment.

99
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,380
Who can it be at such an hour?

100
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,580
Why is he here?

101
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,620
<i>The security system has been disarmed.</i>

102
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:00,769
- Hey.
- Hyungnim.

103
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,000
What?

104
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:07,739
It got really painful as I thought about you
so I drank a little.

105
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,399
Then you should go back to your house.
Why come here?

106
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,109
Seriously...

107
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,289
- Hyungnim.
- Hey! What is with you?

108
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:16,549
I wish I could tell everyone about it.

109
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:20,119
The feelings
that I can't tell anyone about...

110
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,149
- Feelings?
- So what if it's painful?

111
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,929
Just bear with it.

112
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,779
Jae Seok, wait a moment.
I'll get some water.

113
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,489
Wait a moment.
Here.

114
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:30,200
Hyung!

115
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:34,049
Please stay by my side forever.
I'm begging you!

116
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,830
Hyung.

117
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,860
Lad... You can't...

118
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,080
Jae Seok has...

119
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,040
For you...

120
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,320
What should we do?

121
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,570
It's not what you think, okay?

122
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,010
It's not what you think.

123
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,610
Hey, it's not...

124
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:56,769
What are you doing?

125
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,259
- Hey! Let go! Let go!
- Hyung...

126
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,336
Let go! Let go! Let go! Let go! Let go!

127
00:10:00,571 --> 00:10:02,000
Let go! Let go! Let go! Let go! Let go!

128
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:02,701
Let go!

129
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:04,549
What's wrong with you?
Let go! Let go! Let go! Let go!

130
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,339
Quickly let go!

131
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,549
Let go! Let go! Let go! Let go!

132
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,279
No, let go!

133
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,049
What's wrong with you?
Are you out of your mind?

134
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,479
Let go! Let go! Let go!

135
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,259
- You'll hurt him! What are you doing?
- Let go!

136
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,149
Jae Seok.

137
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,440
- Jae Seok, come back to your senses.
- Let go.

138
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,339
Ae Jeong unni.

139
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,330
- Seriously.
- What are you doing here?

140
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:25,580
I can't let you see me like this.

141
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,360
It's okay, Jae Seok.

142
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:32,119
If your heart takes you in that direction,
it's possible for you to fall for him.

143
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,339
It's not what you think, okay?

144
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,399
Hey.

145
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,439
Quickly come back to your senses
and go back to your house. Go, go.

146
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,830
- Go quickly.
- Don't do this.

147
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:44,710
It must have been very difficult for him
to come here and confess to you.

148
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,649
It's not the kind of confession
you're thinking of.

149
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,910
You're wrong.
Wrong, wrong, wrong!

150
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,530
Then why does he look so pained?

151
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:55,430
Hyungnim...

152
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:00,870
He has pain that others don't know about.

153
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,509
He'll have to get some sleep
before he can come back to his senses.

154
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:06,679
Hey, get up.
Hey, get up quickly. Get up.

155
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,829
- Hyungnim.
- Get up, get up. I got it.

156
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:11,249
- Hyungnim...
- Okay, I got it.

157
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,839
Geez... Walk straight.
No, here.

158
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,049
Seriously!
Hey, watch out.

159
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,190
- I love you.
- Yes, I love you too. Get up.

160
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,969
Be careful, be careful, be careful.

161
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,730
- Hyungnim, do you know?
- Hey.

162
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,019
I love you, Hyungnim.

163
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,650
Okay, I got it.
Lie down.

164
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,900
Lie down here.

165
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,180
Here.

166
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,990
<i>Please don't die.</i>

167
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,810
You cannot die.

168
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:44,510
Please don't die, Hyungnim.

169
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,860
You cannot die.

170
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,040
I'll do my work well.

171
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,470
Hyungnim.

172
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,930
Don't be hard on Jae Seok.
Take good care of him.

173
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:29,930
I've finished the potato-viewing,
so I'm leaving now.

174
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,920
Gu Ae Jeong...

175
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:40,780
I'm sorry.

176
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,250
About what?

177
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:48,030
I only showed you the potato

178
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:51,410
and couldn't show you
what you secretly wanted to see.

179
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:58,000
The contract for my commercial prohibits me
from exposing skin freely.

180
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,750
What a pity.

181
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:03,249
I thought I'd be able to admire
the quality of the body,

182
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,674
that is so pretty from head to toe,

183
00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:08,470
that it earns billions
from shooting commercials.

184
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,170
Shall I show you a little just for sample?

185
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,710
Never mind.
I'll get going.

186
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,510
Be careful on the way back.

187
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:50,198
I am the world's meanest,

188
00:13:51,453 --> 00:13:53,736
most selfish bastard.

189
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,929
It seems Jae Seok left by himself.

190
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,940
He looked quite drunk.

191
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,989
He left without a word.

192
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:40,449
He looked really pained.

193
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:43,510
That's right.
He drank a lot.

194
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:46,090
Is he troubled by something?

195
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:50,320
It must be because of me.

196
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,980
He must like me more than I thought.

197
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:56,990
By treating him as a young fan,
I must have hurt his self-esteem.

198
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,959
I'll see him as a man from now on.

199
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,170
You can't do that.

200
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,409
What about me then?

201
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:06,630
What does this have to do with you?

202
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,540
What?

203
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:17,039
Have you forgotten about that night,
three years ago?

204
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,090
What?

205
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,900
What?!

206
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,390
What?

207
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,760
You really don't remember?

208
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,479
It was raining that night.

209
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,959
We lit aromatic candles

210
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,539
When the electricity was suddenly cut.

211
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,049
In the darkness, the two of us...

212
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,360
Stop it!

213
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,559
So what about that?

214
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,920
Didn't we treat that night
like it never happened?

215
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,340
I've been waiting for you.

216
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:43,660
After that night,
I saw myself as your man.

217
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,349
Who?

218
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,440
Are you my man
just because you say so?

219
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:52,989
Then why do you always call for me whenever
something crops up at the restaurant?

220
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:55,369
Why call me whenever
you do a spring cleaning?

221
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,629
If it snows,
you call me to clear snow.

222
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,939
If leaves clutter up the place,
you call me to clear them.

223
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,899
If the pipes get blocked,
you also call for me.

224
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,770
I even painted these walls!

225
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:05,889
Was it because you were ordering me around
as a servant?

226
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:09,800
I asked you to do all those because
I thought you had a lot of free time.

227
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:16,250
In that case, Madam Jenny...

228
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:21,090
Why did you bestow wine
upon your servant that night?

229
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:25,400
You bad woman...

230
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:29,060
Hey, no.
Let me say one last thing.

231
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,120
Jenny,

232
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:35,680
Don't drink wine with Jae Seok.

233
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,690
Was I too much
in ordering him around?

234
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:47,800
Should I try to make things up to him?

235
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:55,320
I drank too much yesterday.

236
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,270
I don't even remember
how I ended up coming here.

237
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:02,110
Hyung, did I do anything wrong?

238
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,559
You came at the right time

239
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,200
and prevented me
from messing up my schedule,

240
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,039
as expected from my manager.

241
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,810
That's great.

242
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,569
But I thought I saw Ae Jeong noona
in my drunken state.

243
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:16,490
That's right.
It was Gu Ae Jeong.

244
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,890
Okay.

245
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:26,319
She doesn't know about my condition yet
so I'll tell her at the right time.

246
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,720
Watch your words.

247
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,820
Okay.

248
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,279
What about Representative Moon?

249
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,050
As for Representative Moon,
it's now time to tell her

250
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,610
since there are many things
we need to put in order.

251
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:48,570
What are the chances of success
for the surgery?

252
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:52,970
Low...
It's better not to know.

253
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,870
I think this is the time for you to cry.

254
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,690
Shall I go out for a while?

255
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,700
I can bear with it.

256
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:08,090
Being in a pathetically depressed state
doesn't suit both of us.

257
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,610
Okay.

258
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,729
Yes.

259
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,510
Then keep listening.

260
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,699
I've properly reviewed the contracts
for my commercials again.

261
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:20,379
They have different clauses regarding the
return of endorsement fee upon my death.

262
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:24,319
I think we'll have to get some advice
from lawyers but

263
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,060
- there are various...
- Stop it.

264
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:30,529
- I'll take care of those matters.
- Okay.

265
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:33,190
Just believe that you will live.

266
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,370
Even under such circumstances,
you're not crushed at all.

267
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,440
Dok Go, you're really the coolest.

268
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,189
That's right.
I am Dok Go Jin.

269
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:49,560
Then, what plans did you have
when you started things with Gu Ae Jeong?

270
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,379
If the two of you go public
with your relationship,

271
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,279
Both of you will fall from grace.

272
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,789
I know we will.

273
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,429
It will become the worst scandal ever.

274
00:18:56,430 --> 00:19:00,589
But if the end comes for me,

275
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:03,259
it might not be the worst, but the greatest.

276
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,489
If I die,
people won't criticize us

277
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:08,360
and everything
will be beautified nicely, won't it?

278
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:12,310
If I live, I'll fall from grace
if I say that I like Gu Ae Jeong

279
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:16,750
But if I die, my feelings will be beautified
if I say that I like Gu Ae Jeong.

280
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,359
That's how one's image works.

281
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,369
That's why I'm going to protect
the best image.

282
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,150
And if something bad happens,

283
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:31,040
I will give it all to Gu Ae Jeong and leave.

284
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,579
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

285
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:36,169
You're just about to start afresh.

286
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:38,189
Does it make sense for you to get together
with Dok Go Jin like this?

287
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:41,309
It doesn't make sense to me either,
that's why I tried to resist.

288
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,110
But you like him still?

289
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,079
If we just consider
the one month limit he gave,

290
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,079
It shows that he doesn't intend
to stay with you for a long time

291
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,759
And that he doesn't intend to go public.

292
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,960
He's telling you that so frankly,
yet you still like him?

293
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,510
What about Yoon Pil Joo?

294
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,650
What about the show?

295
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:10,040
I have to talk to Yoon Pil Joo
about what we ought to do now.

296
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,610
I feel so sorry towards him,
I don't know what or how to talk to him.

297
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,089
I went to the Oriental Medicine Hospital

298
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:02,370
but they said that you're sick
and weren't there today.

299
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,139
It may be too shameless for me
to come all the way here,

300
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:09,870
but I can't pretend not to know...

301
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:13,320
Please come in.

302
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:22,990
Please take a seat.

303
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:37,340
Have you been eating ramen?

304
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:41,480
I brought some fruits.
Please eat them.

305
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,340
I found it.

306
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:59,390
You seem really angry.

307
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:03,969
I must have made you even angrier
by coming here. I'm sorry.

308
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,419
No, that's not it.

309
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,149
You have the right to be this angry.

310
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:10,510
I wronged you too much.

311
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:12,750
No, it's not...

312
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:21,140
I'll take my leave.
I'm sorry.

313
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,330
No, that's not it...
Gu Ae Jeong.

314
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:29,330
I'm really going to leave.

315
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,330
Gu Ae Jeong.

316
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,680
Gu Ae Jeong.

317
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,439
I wasn't venting my anger

318
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,360
by overturning the basket
or stepping on the banana on purpose.

319
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:43,140
This... I was trying to find this
when I made those mistakes.

320
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,840
I was putting my feelings in order.

321
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:53,109
I couldn't find the final puzzle piece
but you came and I found it.

322
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,900
Really?

323
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,320
Look.
Only this spot is empty.

324
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,190
All right.

325
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,130
It ends with this.

326
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,450
I've gotten sick of eating ramen.

327
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:11,889
Thanks for the fruits.

328
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:15,160
Hearing you thank me
makes me feel more apologetic.

329
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,219
It would be better
if you just vent out your anger.

330
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,860
Shall I vent my anger properly then?

331
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:24,030
If I say I'll do it, I will do it.

332
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,939
Gu Ae Jeong...

333
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,640
Do you think that by bringing such things,
you can sooth my anger?

334
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:31,130
I don't need such things!

335
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,760
Doing that feels good.

336
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,269
I saw that once on the drama
my mother was watching.

337
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:51,310
Now I think I know why they do it.

338
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:55,360
I'm sorry.

339
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:00,790
I have vented out my anger so there's
nothing you need to feel sorry about.

340
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:06,280
Also, don't give up on a program
that has already started.

341
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:12,110
Let's take it one step at a time calmly.

342
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,620
And end it
in a way that looks good for us.

343
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:19,040
Are you really sick?

344
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,630
I'm not sick.
I was just playing hooky from work.

345
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,560
Please don't worry about me.

346
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,840
Thanks for the fruits.

347
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:36,120
Well then, enjoy playing hooky.

348
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:45,150
Yoon Pil Joo, please take care.

349
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,120
Thank you.

350
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:54,090
That's right.

351
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,810
I'll be able to put the last piece in place.

352
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:10,559
[Section TV]
[Entertainment Report]

353
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,409
Are you saying that you want
Ae Jeong to be the reporter

354
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:13,829
for Section TV's Entertainment Report?

355
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:16,009
Because the regular host
is on maternity leave...

356
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:18,009
It's just for this short period.

357
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,649
Although this is just a temporary position,
if the response is good,

358
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:21,629
she might become a regular host.

359
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,259
Am I right, Producer Seo?

360
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:26,389
Miss Ae Jeong was a reporter
for one of the morning programs, right?

361
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:28,669
She caught crickets or something,
I remember watching that.

362
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,259
That's right.

363
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,749
When she was working as a reporter
for the morning program,

364
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,469
she even caught clams by the riverside
and wild boars in the mountains.

365
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,309
She did all of that!

366
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,009
Great, that's great.

367
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:39,089
She's going to catch news
about stars this time round.

368
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:40,579
Yes, got it.

369
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:43,020
We'll work hard at it.
Thank you.

370
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,359
<i>Reporter?</i>

371
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,449
Gu Ae Jeong as the reporter
for Section TV's Entertainment Report?

372
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:51,129
You were chased around
after getting into trouble

373
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:53,079
and now you're going
to chase after other people?

374
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,329
Do you think you can do
such an embarrassing thing?

375
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:57,100
I fully understand the feelings
of being chased after so...

376
00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:00,159
Don't you think I'll be able
to chase after them in an empathetic way?

377
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,369
Can that kind of thing
be done empathetically?

378
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,899
Asking someone who has
just fallen out of love the day before

379
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,449
when they broke up,
why they broke up,

380
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:06,219
and whether there was a third party...

381
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,829
You have to ask such questions harshly.

382
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,499
Wouldn't that be as difficult
as being chased after?

383
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,059
Of course it will.

384
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,359
But I have to work hard at it

385
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,030
since I'm going to drop out
of Couple Making.

386
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,760
Really?

387
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,409
I have to.

388
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:24,859
If I continue with it,
it will be really unfair to Yoon Pil Joo.

389
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:28,270
He's not even doing all these for the show.

390
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,869
That Oriental Medicine doctor
didn't lose out either.

391
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:35,390
He managed to promote his hospital
and become famous because of this.

392
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:39,459
Although you're all right with
faking a relationship to win commercials,

393
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:42,019
Yoon Pil Joo isn't that kind of person.

394
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,640
Is that so?

395
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,299
Dok Go Jin is a lump of fakeness

396
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,619
while that anyone Oriental Medicine doctor
is a lump of sweetness.

397
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:50,060
But you still came to me.

398
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,330
Does that mean you like me a lot?

399
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:54,950
Yes...
I like you.

400
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,700
Things will get difficult
if you like me too much.

401
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,829
Please don't worry about it.

402
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:05,329
I won't ask you to prolong this
or to say that this is for real.

403
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:07,730
I'll just enjoy this the way I want.

404
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:14,010
If you're going to enjoy it,
why did you bring Ding Dong along?

405
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:17,809
Didn't you say
that you two were best friends?

406
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:19,550
Go play with your friend.

407
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:21,640
I'll go take a look at the potato.

408
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,740
I wanted to make things enjoyable...

409
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,770
But there's no other place to go to
other than my house.

410
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,690
Isn't Ding Dong watching too much of that?

411
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,500
Ding Dong!

412
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,879
Aren't you neglecting
your fellow 7 year-old friends too much?

413
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,099
Shouldn't you be going to meet them
already?

414
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,659
I like this place too much.

415
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:01,780
There is a computer game system
and a really great TV set.

416
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,589
Are you going to watch all of this
until it ends?

417
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,139
This is the first episode.

418
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,330
There are thirty episodes.

419
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,900
Thirty?

420
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,160
It's switched off.

421
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:23,929
Hey, what's wrong with the television?

422
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,139
Is it spoilt?

423
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,370
Where did the remote control go?

424
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,140
Ding Dong...

425
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,910
Shall I show you something interesting?

426
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,879
Aigoo, my butt...
What is this?

427
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,690
Oh, it's here!

428
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,000
Watch it.

429
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,910
You've got to watch it if you want to.

430
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:20,809
At seven years old,
it's okay to be self-indulgent.

431
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:22,329
I'm okay with not watching it.

432
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:24,399
I've watched the first episode today

433
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,050
so I'll watch another episode
the next time I come.

434
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:29,069
Didn't you say
there are thirty episodes?

435
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:31,939
You might not be able to watch all of it
if you just watch one episode per day.

436
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,549
So just watch.

437
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,409
Why?

438
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:35,640
Ding Dong...

439
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:41,440
Not everyone is given enough time
to watch thirty episodes, one a day.

440
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,080
That's why you should watch while you can.

441
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,980
I'm being self-indulgent too.

442
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:07,449
We will announce the breakup first
through an interview.

443
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:10,659
I'll put up a post
regarding my feelings towards the breakup.

444
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,179
Don't make it sound like
it wasn't a peaceful breakup.

445
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:16,929
Both of us are not to give
individual interviews regarding this.

446
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:18,429
We'll just appear to be upset
for the time being.

447
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:19,179
That's right.

448
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:23,660
We will avoid making comments by saying
that Dok Go is on an overseas photo shoot.

449
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:25,979
Don't do a photo shoot for real.

450
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:29,839
If you get your photos taken
under the melancholic atmosphere overseas,

451
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,050
right after we announce the breakup,
it might seem as if I've caused you pain.

452
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:36,559
Don't upload photos of yourself looking
at the sky with eye drops in your eyes.

453
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,849
Don't use sad ballads
as the webpage's background music.

454
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:41,329
Please.

455
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:45,369
We'll say you two have already ended it a
long time ago in a painless and cool manner.

456
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,829
Does that violate anything?

457
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:50,990
As for the contracts for their commercials,
we'll take responsibility and handle them.

458
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,800
All right.

459
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:56,200
That's all.
That's all we need to discuss, right?

460
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:12,710
My image benefited a lot
from being your girlfriend.

461
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:15,259
Your popularity didn't fall
because of me either.

462
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:19,030
We made good use of each other
and watched over each other properly.

463
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,189
You're the Dok Go Jin
who's always bragging about himself

464
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:24,880
and who only suits being at the top.

465
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:29,940
I don't think I'll like seeing you
falling from grace for liking someone.

466
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:33,490
Are you afraid that I'll fall from grace
while hugging Gu Ae Jeong?

467
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:35,549
Are you worried?

468
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,619
I don't have to worry, right?

469
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,149
You'll let go of her
if you think you're about to fall, right?

470
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:43,189
There's also a possibility that I won't fall
but will instead rise up to the sky.

471
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:47,190
See, you're looking cool
bragging about yourself again...

472
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:50,869
Shall we hug for the last time?

473
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:52,390
I can't.

474
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:54,989
I have an exclusive charger.

475
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:57,250
If you touch me,
I'll short circuit.

476
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:07,949
It seems you're holding on
to some shameful feelings.

477
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,850
Try growing potatoes.

478
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,680
It will help.

479
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:18,229
We'll be going to Gu Ae Jeong's
recording studio for the next date.

480
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,899
You'll play the piano there.

481
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,179
Playing the piano is always the coolest act.

482
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:28,159
Hyung, I'd like to pull out from this show
if possible.

483
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,520
What?

484
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,749
Why, why...?
But why?

485
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:36,210
My family is really against me
appearing on the show.

486
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:40,409
If you've managed to gather the participants
for the next season, I want to pull out.

487
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:42,699
But aren't the two of you progressing well?

488
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:45,650
We're hoping
the show can continue this way.

489
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,199
I'm sorry, Hyung.

490
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,220
My circumstance won't allow me to.
Please understand.

The segment you're in-charge
of is "Star Date."

I watch Star Date quite often.

496
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,299
It's the segment where we walk around town

497
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,849
and have the guest answer questions
in a natural way, right?

You can read the program description.

499

It's a simple segment.

Take a look first.

00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,499

Yeah, what are you doing?

I'm at the TV station.

Didn't I tell you I'm filming
as the reporter for Section TV today?

508
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,409
What are you filming then?

509
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:34,539
A segment called "Star Date"

510
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,699

522
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,500
We've been trying to invite him on the show!

523
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,600
Yes, of course we can!

524
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:15,780
The Star Date segment?

525
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:18,220
Immediately?

526
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:19,750
Yes, yes.

527
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,489
Yes, let's do that.
Yes, yes.

528
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:23,219
Hey, Joong Seok, get the camera.

529
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,499
And get the van ready in ten minutes.

530
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,300
We'll leave in ten minutes.

531
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:29,210
What are you doing, Gu Ae Jeong?
I said let's go.

532
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:32,779
Are we going to interview Dok Go Jin
right away?

533
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:35,289
His schedule is all packed
except for this afternoon.

534
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:37,409
It's Dok Go Jin, we've got to go.

535
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:38,219
Get yourself ready quickly.

536
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,709
We'll leave in ten minutes.

537
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,220
Move quickly.

538
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,960
This is crazy.

539
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:46,319
- Hello.
- Hello.

540
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,370
Yes.

541
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:49,550
- The script.
- Yes.

542
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,539
This is the first time I'm doing something
like this. I don't know what I should do.

543
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:55,049
You're really lucky to be doing this
with Dok Go Jin for your first try.

544
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:57,079
- I will work hard.
- Yes.

545
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,740
Do your best.

546
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,790
Oh, Dok Go Jin is here.

547
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,339
Gu Ae Jeong, we're starting.

548
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,099
- Yes.
- Stand by. Ready.

549
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:05,979
Start!

550
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,350
Ddeokbokki*?
(*spicy rice cake)

551
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:23,879
Introduce yourself.

552
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,069
Hello, I am Gu Ae Jeong,
from Section TV's Star Date.

553
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,789
Yes, hello, Gu Ae Jeong.

554
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:34,249
The date route for today is...

555
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:35,479
Game arcade?

556
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,063
- Ddeokbokki, ddeokbokki...
- Ddeokbokki?

557
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:39,790
Okay, err...

558
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:43,349
Oh, you've prepared a lot for this date.

559
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:44,259
Yes.

560
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,109
Ddeokbokki.
This one looks good.

561
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,259
Ddeokbokki. Okay.

562
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,419
You like ddeokbokki?

563
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,369
Yes.

564
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:52,089
Shall we head for the ddeokbokki shop
for our Star Date then?

565
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:53,269
- Yes.
- Shall we go, Dok Go Jin?

566
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:54,680
- Got it.
- Yes.

567
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,219
Having a date
in a flour-based food store like this

568
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,499
matches my image quite well.

569
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,640
Ordinary, simple and down to earth.

570
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:13,600
Dok Go Jin, do you like ddeokbokki?

571
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:17,060
I like kimbap more than ddeokbokki.

572
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:20,779
Kimbap without cucumbers
and with a lot of burdock vegetable.

573
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,170
Burdock...

574
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,420
Oh, is that so?

575
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,330
Well, shall we eat the ddeokbokki?

576
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,949
It's really as delicious as rumored!

577
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:40,420
Gu Ae Jeong...

578
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:42,739
Are you doing to eat the ddeokbokki
by yourself?

579
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,700
Usually, under such circumstances,

580
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:48,559
the host will feed the guest a piece
while carrying out the interview.

581
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,878
Of course, if that makes things
difficult for you, it's okay.

582
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,829
I'll feed the Hallyu star Dok Go Jin
personally then.

583
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:04,030
The female viewers won't mind, right?

584
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,700
- Ddeokbokki?
- Yes.

585
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:11,020
- Yes.
- Here. Yes.

586
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,560
It's delicious.

587
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,649
I'll feed Gu Ae Jeong a piece too.

588
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:20,990
Is that okay?

589
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,210
Here.

590
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:30,180
It was a prank.

591
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:31,000
Here, Gu Ae Jeong.

592
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,619
- Yes?
- Do you want to give it a try too?

593
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,410
- Me?
- Yes, yes.

594
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:52,139
Just give it a try.

595
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,470
Yes, yes.

596
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:56,840
Position your left arm like this.

597
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:59,110
One, two, three.

598
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:01,360
Nice shot!

599
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:10,329
I'm choosing very carefully
my next movie after Fighter.

600
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:12,840
Yes, please decide carefully.

601
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:18,609
This store sells accessories.

602
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:20,390
Yes, it does.

603
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:21,809
Gu Ae Jeong...

604
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:24,279
This is the first interview you're hosting
for Section TV.

605
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,889
Can I buy you something
to commemorate this?

606
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:30,250
That would be an honor, Dok Go Jin.

607
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:38,000
Hello. Yes, hello.
Yes.

608
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,810
Gu Ae Jeong, please choose something.

609
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:47,439
I...
Which one should I choose?

610
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,420
Shall I choose it for you then?

611
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:51,570
Yes!

612
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:03,480
This suits you well.

613
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:13,830
It does suit you very well.

614
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,109
Heart.

615
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:16,560
- Is that so?
- Yes.

616
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:19,060
Can I put it on for you?

617
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,720
Here.

618
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:28,099
Yeah!
It suits you well...

619
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:28,909
Yes.

620
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:31,970
Gu Ae Jeong, heart.

621
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:34,579
Yes.

622
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,999
Dok Go Jin
is really the gentleman everyone says he is.

623
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,460
Thank you.

624
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,040
Heart.

625
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:45,019
All right, shall we wrap this up?

626
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:48,399
The Star Date with Dok Go Jin
has been really enjoyable.

627
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,129
I had a really enjoyable time too.

628
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:56,500
Please say some final words
to the viewers then.

629
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:05,529
I'll take the opportunity to convey
something I wish to announce.

630
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:07,690
It's an extremely personal thing

631
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:10,499
so I thought that announcing it
through such a relaxed manner

632
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,260
would be good.

633
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:16,170
Gu Ae Jeong...

634
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:22,250
Can you ask me
about my relationship with Kang Se Ri?

635
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,309
Follow up, follow.

636
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:27,370
Yes.

637
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:33,610
Are things progressing well
between you and your girlfriend Kang Se Ri?

638
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:40,110
Kang Se Ri and I...

639
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,730
are no longer a couple.

640
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:52,060
We've became comfortable colleagues
since a long time ago.

641
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:00,100
You must be shocked.

642
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,980
<i>Dok Go Jin gave an interview?</i>

643
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:09,370
Yes, I'm making preparations too.

644
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:10,740
Okay.

645
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,160
<i>Hi, this is Kang Se Ri.</i>

646
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:21,280
<i>You must be really shocked.</i>

647
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:25,629
<i>Dok Go Jin and I have decided
to remain as good colleagues.</i>

648
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:28,759
<i>Sorry for not informing all of you
beforehand.</i>

649
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:32,239
Dok Go Jin put his relationship
with Kang Se Ri in order?

650
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,979
<i>- Please be strong.
- What a pity.</i>

651
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:36,089
<i>I knew this would happen.
Dok Go Jin is wasted on her.</i>

652
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:39,410
<i>- Se Ri unni is much better than him!
- Congrats for becoming single again!</i>

653
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,910
The situation has changed.

654
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:47,959
Yes, my eyes need to look watery.

655
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,089
Even though I'm not allowed to cry,

656
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:52,810
If I look unaffected,
I'll be the only one being scolded.

657
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,390
I hope this eye drop from France
will work well.

658
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,429
- She's out.
- She's out, she's out!

659
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:10,940
Kang Se Ri!

660
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:15,699
Kang Se Ri,
how do you feel about the breakup?

661
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,679
Did you delay announcing the breakup
because of your commercials?

662
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,009
- How do you feel?
- What is the reason behind the breakup?

663
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:23,410
- Please say something!
- Kang Se Ri!

664
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:25,760
Please say something!

665
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:28,089
[Her feelings towards
the Dok Go Jin-Kang Se Ri breakup]

666
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:31,279
Yes. My friend's cousin is a reporter.

667
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,969
He said Dok Go Jin broke up with Kang Se Ri
a long time ago.

668
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:37,059
They pretended to be dating
although they had broken up.

669
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:39,019
The relationships between artistes
cannot be trusted.

670
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:41,929
I knew about that!
I knew of it a long time ago.

671
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:43,559
Does that mean that he's single now?

672
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,427
That's right.

673
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:49,420
- So they have been pretending.
- I really dislike this kind of thing.

674
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:55,339
Yes, yes, yes.

675
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:58,989
Gu Ae Jeong, your first interview was a hit.

676
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:00,859
I've yet to gather my thoughts.

677
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:05,249
Dok Go Jin's sudden announcement
of the breakup was really shocking.

678
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:07,859
Gu Ae Jeong, since you are under
the same management company...

679
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:09,429
Did you know about his intentions
beforehand?

680
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:13,330
No, I didn't expect him
to say something like that today.

681
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:15,290
You've worked hard.

682
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:18,159
Oh, the morning program
wants the interview recording too.

683
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,219
- Okay, it's with the editing team.
- Get it ready.

684
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:21,189
<i>Okay.</i>

685
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:22,559
I heard that Kang Se Ri cried.

686
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,120
[Recharge]

687
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:27,620
Did she get ditched by Dok Go Jin?

688
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,630
Who knows?
We've got to ask around.

689
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:32,449
<i>You must have been shocked.</i>

690
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:35,019
Why did you announce that
without any notice?

691
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:37,440
It was time to announce it.

692
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:39,409
Don't come to my house for the time being.

693
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:41,610
Reporters are crowding around the place.

694
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,050
Got it?

695
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:50,970
Did you do the interview with
Ae Jeong unni on purpose to announce it?

696
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:57,190
Yeah, I wanted to leave behind evidence

697
00:44:57,930 --> 00:44:59,860
that I've always kept Gu Ae Jeong
by my side.

698
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,649
A 3 days and 2 nights schedule
is too rushed.

699
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:10,350
That's right.

700
00:45:10,351 --> 00:45:12,989
We've worked so hard learning Japanese.
Can't we just stay a day longer?

701
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:15,210
Your schedule is back-to-back
so it's not possible.

702
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,099
All right, the plane is about to depart

703
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:19,919
so don't hang around the duty-free shops.

704
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,769
Head for the gate straight away
once you go in.

705
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:23,949
Okay...

706
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:24,960
Go.

707
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:37,839
I'm sorry.

708
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,870
Be careful where you're going.

709
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:41,930
Okay, I'm sorry.

710
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:45,450
<i>Honey.</i>

711
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:50,749
Call me once you get back.

712
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:51,759
Yes.

713
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,509
There's some time left.
Let's have lunch together.

714
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:57,390
The driver is waiting for me.
Just go in already.

715
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,730
Han Mi Na?

716
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:05,810
It's really you.

717
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:07,560
It's you, Mi Na.

718
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,940
It's me.

719
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:12,870
Manager Jang.

720
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:19,800
Mi Na?

721
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:21,459
Do you know him?

722
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:23,620
So you're her husband.

723
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:25,509
Hello.

724
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:30,429
I was her manager
when she was still an artiste.

725
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:34,820
Oh, you told me that you were once a singer.

726
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:37,420
He was in the same line?

727
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:38,359
Nice to meet you.

728
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:39,440
Yes.

729
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:43,800
Shouldn't you be going in already?

730
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:47,140
This is my name card.

731
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:49,860
Yes. And mine.

732
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:58,020
You're an international lawyer?

733
00:46:58,130 --> 00:46:59,870
Mr. Alex.

734
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,239
Are you an overseas Korean?

735
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,860
Yes, I grew up in America.

736
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:07,330
Nice to meet you.

737
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:15,429
I'm catching a plane too
so I've got to go in already.

738
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:18,710
What a pity.
Let's stay in contact.

739
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:22,970
Or shall I contact you through your husband?

740
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:26,330
No, I'll contact you.

741
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:28,850
Okay.

742
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:31,700
I'll take my leave now.

743
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:02,050
I've put everything in order.

744
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:05,230
I can't mess it up again.

745
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,610
[Kang Se Ri]

746
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:28,729
What's the matter?

747
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:30,430
Yoon Pil Joo...

748
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,989
Do you know
that we announced the breakup today?

749
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:35,090
<i>Yes.</i>

750
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:38,870
I'm holding a singles' party.

751
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:41,829
Will you come and drink with me?

752
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:44,879
Please look for someone else.
I'm bad at drinking.

753
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,420
I'll do the drinking.

754
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:50,239
Shall I look for you at the hospital?

755
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,289
<i>I'm about to leave now.</i>

756
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:54,899
There's something I need to do.

757
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,719
I don't think I can meet you today.

758
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:00,720
Then I'll feel upset because of you
and drink a lot.

759
00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:04,400
<i>Are you going to pretend
you don't know about it and leave me alone?</i>

760
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:08,000
I'll send you a message of my location.

761
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,459
It's up to you whether to come.

762
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:12,890
I'm going to get wrecked by myself.

763
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:55,350
So what if I get wrecked?
No one is going to look after me.

764
00:49:57,230 --> 00:49:59,160
It will only make my face bloat.

765
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:02,350
Welcome.

766
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,389
Is Kang Se Ri around?

767
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:08,030
Kang Se Ri?
She is inside there.

768
00:50:42,350 --> 00:50:43,820
Kang Se Ri.

769
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:49,530
Yoon Pil Joo?

770
00:50:49,870 --> 00:50:51,860
You came?

771
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:55,410
I saw you nimbly running in here just now.

772
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:06,360
In any case, since you're here,

773
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:09,050
you'll look after me
if I get wrecked, right?

774
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:14,560
Kang Se Ri,
there's nothing I can do for you.

775
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:17,429
I hope you can put everything in good order.

776
00:51:17,430 --> 00:51:18,890
Put in order?

777
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,580
Is it that easy for you to do?

778
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:26,129
I think I've managed it well.

779
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:27,670
You're lying.

780
00:51:28,830 --> 00:51:30,920
Didn't you say
you feel the same way as I do?

781
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:34,220
Didn't you say
your insides were also flipped over?

782
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:39,290
You just want to think
that you're managing it well.

783
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:40,790
Just like me...

784
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:43,920
You don't want to show others
that you're wrecked like an idiot.

785
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:48,350
Never mind...

786
00:51:49,810 --> 00:51:52,659
This is embarrassing.
Please leave.

787
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:54,990
Please leave quickly.
Please leave.

788
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:00,650
I'm asking you to leave quickly.

789
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:20,940
I've put everything in place.

790
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:29,240
I thought I've put everything in place,
piece by piece.

791
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:12,205
But I didn't put anything away at all...

792
00:54:42,970 --> 00:54:45,430
<i>Are the reporters still crowding
in front of your house?</i>

793
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,949
<i>It must be boring being stuck at home.</i>

794
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:49,629
I feel like I'm dying.

795
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:53,010
I feel like I've became a princess,
trapped in a tower.

796
00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:57,760
Don't you think your body is too beastly
to become a princess?

797
00:54:57,890 --> 00:54:59,579
The beast...
You're the beast.

798
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:01,369
The beast who lives inside a tower,
growing potatoes...

799
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:04,299
Be it a princess or a beast,
just save me please.

800
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:08,040
I think things will become worse
if I go save you.

801
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:10,669
You've led a proud and conceited life

802
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:12,969
while looking down at the world
from the tall tower.

803
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:14,679
It will cause you
to come down to the ground.

804
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:18,729
Sing the heartbeat song
to help me recharge then.

805
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:20,579
Download it!
Each song costs 500 won.

806
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:22,239
You're so cold-hearted.

807
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:23,919
Just sing it once.

808
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,659
So that my heart will not stop
and will beat hard instead...

809
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:28,990
Didn't you say
you've been freed from the song's hypnosis?

810
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:32,310
If you find it a shame
that the hypnosis is broken

811
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,389
cast a spell or something then.

812
00:55:34,390 --> 00:55:37,640
What? Are you going to say
it's some supernatural force or something?

813
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:42,260
Spells...
I'm talking about spells.

814
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:44,629
A spell that can create miracles...

815
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:46,959
All right, I'll cast a spell for you.

816
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,839
The mean bastard who grows potatoes,
Dok Go Jin the beast,

817
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:52,110
transform into a warm-hearted princess!

818
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:59,539
I'll go see how warm-hearted
the spell has made you become.

819
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:00,840
I'm hanging up.

820
00:56:16,930 --> 00:56:21,010
I'm begging you, okay?

821
00:56:29,270 --> 00:56:31,969
This is the most expensive dish
in this restaurant.

822
00:56:31,970 --> 00:56:35,970
You need to build up your stamina
in order to perform a long surgery.

823
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:38,600
Please eat all you want.
Savor it well.

824
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:42,279
I've aged and don't have enough stamina.

825
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:44,269
That's why I'm saying this.

826
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:47,099
Please tell me calmly and truthfully.

827
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:52,029
Doctor, are you confident
of fixing my heart?

828
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:54,749
Are you going to look for another doctor
if I said no?

829
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:59,289
Of course. Even if the chance of survival
is just 0.1 percent higher,

830
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:02,699
I'll end it with you
and look for another doctor.

831
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:05,219
There's no such thing...
because I'm the best.

832
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:08,199
Didn't you say that you were the best,
ten years ago?

833
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:12,039
Wouldn't another ace have appeared already?

834
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:14,169
I'm the best right now.

835
00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:16,790
And I won't move from that position
in the future either.

836
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:20,100
And I have
an extremely good piece of news for you.

837
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:24,800
The success rate for your surgery
has doubled since ten years ago.

838
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:27,360
Doubled?

839
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:29,300
That makes it 10 percent.

840
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:32,970
I'll just take it
that the odds are 50-50.

841
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:35,380
Wait!

842
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:43,059
You're not young anymore.

843
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:45,069
What if your hand trembles?

844
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:47,749
Please refrain from drinking alcohol
before my surgery.

845
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:50,280
Dok Go Jin, don't worry.

846
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:52,420
I'll fix it.

847
00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:56,910
Yes.

848
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:00,050
Please fix it.
I really...

849
00:58:01,850 --> 00:58:05,920
I awfully want to live on, Doctor.

850
00:58:10,590 --> 00:58:14,130
All the elders in the family are worried

851
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,519
about you showing your face
on that kind of TV program.

852
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:20,259
Quit the program and
put your feelings for that lady in order.

853
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:22,580
Continue with your study
of oriental medicine.

854
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:25,709
Do you hear your uncle?

855
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:26,989
Director Yoon suggested...

856
00:58:26,990 --> 00:58:30,089
that you study at the Oriental Medicine
Research Institute in China.

857
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:31,639
He said he'll write you
a letter of recommendation.

858
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:34,339
You previously objected so fiercely
to me studying abroad.

859
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:35,339
Are you okay with this?

860
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:39,040
As long as you quit the TV program,
do whatever you want.

861
00:58:39,730 --> 00:58:42,999
Even if you didn't ask me to,
I will quit.

862
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,910
Oh, is that so?

863
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,159
Aigoo.

864
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:51,299
I wouldn't have asked you to step in
if I knew that.

865
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:52,649
Aigoo, it's okay.

866
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:54,000
<i>Director Yoon.</i>

867
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:56,579
Oh, Professor Jeong.

868
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:58,140
Please wait a moment.

869
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:03,850
- It's been a while.
- That's right.

870
00:59:04,090 --> 00:59:06,069
Will you be attending next week's gathering?

871
00:59:06,070 --> 00:59:07,439
It's been a while since we had one.

872
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:10,029
No, I can't go.

873
00:59:10,030 --> 00:59:12,780
There's a major surgery coming up
so I need to abstain from alcohol.

874
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:15,560
- What a pity.
- That's right.

875
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:20,449
Do you have Park Min Gyu's contact number?

876
00:59:20,450 --> 00:59:23,359
Yes, I think I got his name card before.

877
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:26,949
If he's a professor,
does that mean he's a doctor too?

878
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:28,009
I think so.

879
00:59:28,010 --> 00:59:32,179
Look at that, Pil Joo.
Doctors should befriend doctors.

880
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:34,959
You should do the same and befriend doctors
or befriend the daughter of doctors.

881
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,489
You should mix
with people of the same profession.

882
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:39,419
What you're saying
seem to make sense at first,

883
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:41,589
but it sounds ridiculous
if we think about it.

884
00:59:41,590 --> 00:59:44,909
It doesn't matter.

885
00:59:44,910 --> 00:59:47,359
Aigoo, Sister-in-law, I'm sorry.

886
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:50,149
I met an old friend from many years back.

887
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:53,189
Is that friend of yours a doctor too?

888
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:56,270
He specializes in western medicine,
not oriental medicine.

889
00:59:56,380 --> 00:59:58,209
He's one of the best in the cardiac field.

890
00:59:58,210 --> 01:00:00,539
If you have such a famous friend,

891
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:04,740
you ought to have introduced him
to Pil Joo, right?

892
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:06,910
He's attending to some matters.

893
01:00:07,090 --> 01:00:09,749
He's with that actor called Dok Go Jin.

894
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:11,859
Dok Go Jin?
That top star, Dok Go Jin?

895
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:13,050
Yes.

896
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:15,639
Oh, that's right.

897
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:20,180
Wasn't it reported in the news
that Dok Go Jin had a heart surgery?

898
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:21,539
This...

899
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:25,200
Did that doctor perform that surgery?

900
01:00:30,290 --> 01:00:34,849
Ae Jeong is behaving like this
because she has temporarily lost her mind.

901
01:00:34,850 --> 01:00:38,120
Dok Go Jin doesn't like Ae Jeong for real.

902
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:42,459
He told her to date for just a month.

903
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:44,759
And that's not because he likes her,

904
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:46,890
but because something went wrong with him,

905
01:00:46,930 --> 01:00:49,530
causing him to be temporarily attracted
to Ae Jeong.

906
01:00:49,790 --> 01:00:52,500
They started with him declaring that

907
01:00:52,530 --> 01:00:54,569
once he gets fixed,
he'll swish past and leave her behind.

908
01:00:54,570 --> 01:00:56,169
He will remain broken down for a month?

909
01:00:56,170 --> 01:00:58,899
Yoon Pil Joo, if you like Ae Jeong,

910
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:00,549
please don't let go of her now.

911
01:01:00,550 --> 01:01:02,360
Please catch hold of her.

912
01:01:02,590 --> 01:01:04,950
Dok Go Jin is a bad person.

913
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:08,589
Ahjussi is not a bad person!

914
01:01:08,590 --> 01:01:11,019
Ahjussi is Iron Man.

915
01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:11,989
Iron Man?

916
01:01:11,990 --> 01:01:14,219
Just like Iron Man,

917
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:17,289
Ahjussi is a superhero
with a pacemaker.

918
01:01:17,290 --> 01:01:18,820
Pacemaker?

919
01:01:23,490 --> 01:01:26,590
[Shock!
Dok Go Jin underwent a heart surgery!]

920
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:32,560
<i>He specializes in western medicine,
not oriental medicine.</i>

921
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,789
<i>He's one of the best in the cardiac field.</i>

922
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:35,879
Oh, that's right.

923
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:40,410
Wasn't it reported in the news
that Dok Go Jin had a heart surgery?

924
01:01:40,910 --> 01:01:41,779
<i>This...</i>

925
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:45,450
<i>Did that doctor perform that surgery?</i>

926
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:50,479
You're an oriental medicine doctor.

927
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,259
Why are you interested about the
western medicine's field of heart surgery?

928
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:56,319
I heard that you're going to perform
a major heart surgery.

929
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:58,699
Does that involve the use of a pacemaker?

930
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:00,699
Why are you curious about that?

931
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:04,050
I'm wondering if someone I know
is going to undergo that surgery.

932
01:02:05,310 --> 01:02:08,870
What are the chances of survival
for that kind of surgery?

933
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:12,159
The theses I read
mentioned that it's quite low.

934
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,170
There's no such thing
as chances of survival.

935
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:17,740
To die or to live...
It's either of the two.

936
01:02:22,870 --> 01:02:24,080
Hey.

937
01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:28,219
That...
Director Yoon's mother.

938
01:02:28,220 --> 01:02:30,220
She used to come every other day.

939
01:02:30,230 --> 01:02:32,830
Why did she suddenly stop coming?

940
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:36,079
I don't think she'll come again.

941
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:37,189
Why?

942
01:02:37,190 --> 01:02:39,449
Has she approved of you
and Director Yoon's relationship?

943
01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:41,530
What approval?

944
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:44,480
We don't have that kind of relationship.

945
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:53,250
They were saying that Dok Go Jin

946
01:02:53,890 --> 01:02:56,390
has put his relationship
with Kang Se Ri in order.

947
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:59,359
And here Ae Jeong
switched to the Dok line?

948
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:01,030
Ding Dong!

949
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:09,320
Jae Seok said
the reporters at his house have left.

950
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:12,170
Should I go and sing him
the heartbeat song?

951
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:25,560
I've got to make an escape quickly
and go recharge.

952
01:03:44,110 --> 01:03:45,380
What?

953
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:48,170
It's that "anyone" oriental medicine doctor.

954
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:55,390
I came because I have something to ask you.

955
01:03:58,110 --> 01:03:59,430
What?

956
01:04:05,740 --> 01:04:08,759
- Father, I'll go out for a while.
- Okay, go, go.

957
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:10,050
Please eat this.

958
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,560
You're curious about...

959
01:04:17,850 --> 01:04:20,080
something related to my heart?

960
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:22,670
Yes.

961
01:04:26,210 --> 01:04:30,740
Gu Ae Jeong knows nothing
regarding your heart, right?

962
01:04:32,490 --> 01:04:34,640
Please tell me with certainty.

963
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:37,160
Is there...

964
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:40,290
a possibility that you'll die?

965
01:04:42,850 --> 01:04:46,739
I'll tell you with certainty.
I may also live on.

966
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:49,140
Shall I tell you another thing
with certainty?

967
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:52,339
If you tell Gu Ae Jeong about this,

968
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:54,330
"Anyone" oriental medicine doctor...

969
01:04:57,270 --> 01:04:58,980
You're dead.
