3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:13,030
Today I did too much of the manly stuff,
so I'm tired.

4
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,240
What are you doing?

5
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,760
Stay still,

6
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,700
so that I can keep looking cool.

7
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,240
So that I can keep it up.

8
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,930
Recharge..

9
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,600
We should get out.

10
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,790
Be quiet.
I'm charging.

11
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,370
The paparazzi are going to swarm in.

12
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,050
Shush.

13
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,820
Haven't you charged your cell phone?

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,570
At least one third should be filled before it can function.

15
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,390
Let me fill up just one third, okay?

16
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,290
Power's off.

17
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,130
Go out and charge somewhere else.

18
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,820
I'm not your charger.

19
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:40,880
Where are you going?

20
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,930
You turned off the charger.

21
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,720
I need to at least fill up my stomach.

22
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,420
Gu Ae Jeong, make me curry.

23
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,920
You want to eat now?

24
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,470
I must eat curry.

25
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,530
Do as you like.
I'm going.

26
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:08,750
What if there are paparazzi?
You can't just leave.

27
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,550
They are already here.

28
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,950
See the white car over there?

29
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,920
Was it there when you came in?

30
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,550
No.

31
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,630
Then it's a paparazzi.

32
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,870
How do you know?

33
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,670
Only I drive a white car in this neighborhood.

34
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,770
How unfortunate.

35
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:56,280
If paparazzi swarm in, they won't leave until they see me.

36
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,340
Then we may have to be locked up here for about three days.

37
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,430
Three days?

38
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,000
Right, three days.
That would put you in a difficult situation.

39
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:10,100
As you can see, my bathroom is see through.

40
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,890
You can use it if you like.

41
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,080
I'll be sleeping on the first floor.

42
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:19,540
I'm going to drill my way out, if necessary.

43
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,960
Since you seemed to be worried so much,
I will reveal the secret of this house.

44
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,980
This house has an emergency escape route.

45
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:31,740
Escape route?

46
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,920
You've seen Batman, right?

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,480
You know how Batman has an emergency escape
in his house and escapes in his car?

48
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,750
It's the same system.

49
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,530
In an emergency, we can drive this car to escape.

50
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,910
You are lying.

51
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,170
This car is not even real.

52
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,840
How is this not a real car?

53
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:51,730
Look, you have no idea how it swishes by.

54
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,110
But it can't go through the front door.

55
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,560
Of course it can't go through that door. So,

56
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:03,010
once the emergency system is activated,
the escape route opens up like this, "zing."

57
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,850
How is that possible?

58
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:10,290
Since it will take a lot of
energy to escape, let's eat first.

59
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,500
You are lying, aren't you?

60
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:19,580
Gu Ae Jeong, make me curry,
then I will tell you everything. Okay?

61
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,200
- Gu Ae Jeong?
- Why did you...

62
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,150
let Ae Jeong go to Dok Go Jin's place?

63
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,770
Ae Jeong told me she needed to check something.

64
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:30,520
If he did that because of Manager Jang,

65
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:34,250
Ae Jeong will waver again.

66
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:45,260
Yoon Pil Joo, you haven't left yet?

67
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,090
I came to ask you something.

68
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,190
What are you doing?

69
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,590
(*done with affection to children who are hurt to calm them)

70
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,590
I'm doing "ho"* to it.
It's hurt.

71
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,480
You did that because of this?

72
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:06,840
You'd be better off doing that to
Manager Jang than doing it to me.

73
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,450
Go find some potatoes.

74
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:15,100
No way. In this house, no potato will be killed.

75
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:20,570
Would you eat the fish in the fish tank
because you felt like eating fish?

76
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,160
You wouldn't. It's the same thing.

77
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,080
Potatoes are raised.

78
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,810
Look, it can do without potatoes.

79
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:54,210
By the way, do you really have a plan to get us out?

80
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:00,480
Now that we have eaten, shall we start?

81
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,250
Now, which exit should we take to get out?

82
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,090
Shall we get out of Kangnam station exit number 4

83
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,300
or through the back road of Yuksam Department
store and take the Kangnam Boulevard?

84
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,920
Just tell me.

85
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,890
Stop joking around. Where is the escape route?

86
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,760
Is there like a basement connected under this?

87
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,980
You told me you made it like the Batman movie.

88
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:23,830
Gu Ae Jeong, you really don't have
any place you want to go with me?

89
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:25,720
I do.

90
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,410
I have a lot.

91
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:31,970
In fact, no matter where I go,

92
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,480
if I go with you, that will become
the place that I want to go.

93
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,730
You must be crazy.

94
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,080
No, I'm the crazy one.

95
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:42,190
I'm the crazy one who believed
your words and got in the car.

96
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm not crazy.

97
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,330
I'm just broken.

98
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:53,540
I'm broken, right here.

99
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,040
Is it really bad?

100
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,540
It's broken.

101
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,370
This car is also here because it's broken.

102
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,030
Right now, I cannot be controlled because I'm broken.

103
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:08,700
It keeps beating because it's gone
out of the 60-90 safety range.

104
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:12,850
So, I'm going to follow you like a broken car.

105
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,750
So, you should keep running away.

106
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,570
Stay alert like you are doing right now.

107
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:19,040
Can it be fixed?

108
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,030
Of course, it will be back to normal once it's fixed.

109
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,640
I will brush past you once I'm fixed.

110
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:31,190
For now, don't hurt yourself being struck by the broken car.

111
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,460
Skillfully dodge and run away.

112
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,490
Last time, you told me to wake up since it's a spell.

113
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:40,600
Now you are telling me to run away since it's broken?

114
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:44,980
Are you happy to be swerving the
steering wheel at your whim?

115
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:49,150
Track me down if you want,
I will skillfully dodge every time.

116
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,730
Since it's a broken car, it's going
to stop at one point, right?

117
00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:04,660
So, dodge well until I come to a stop.

118
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,850
Dok Go Jin's out!

119
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,980
Please wait.

120
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:36,680
I'll explain everything later on.

121
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,350
Right.

122
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:55,670
Why would such a mind-numbingly
beautiful car take me if not broken?

123
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:03,050
Get fixed and go on your own way.

124
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:14,780
Why does that Manager Jang do such things to Ae Jeong?

125
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,730
He suffered some loss after
the National Treasure Girls broke up.

126
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:24,720
It's all because she's taking
all the blame for the break up.

127
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:28,340
It's true that she came forward with the idea.

128
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:32,330
By the by, I really don't know why she did it.

129
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,810
It seemed like something happened with Mi Na.

130
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:39,400
Mi Na was another member of the group, right?

131
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:42,250
Right, Han Mi Na.

132
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,990
My old name is Han Mi Na.

133
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:49,600
I worked with her as National Treasure Girls.

134
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,710
I think it would be better for her not to see.

135
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,210
Help me hide.

136
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:57,270
Never mind, take care.

137
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,530
Ae Jeong is my savior.

138
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,580
I begged her for 10 years, but she's not opening her mouth.

139
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,380
How can I know what happened?

140
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,140
Anyway, because of this kind of misunderstanding,

141
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,690
he's got some beef to settle with Ae Jeong.

142
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:16,300
Even so, today he went overboard.

143
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,850
I should've beaten him up before Dok Go Jin did.

144
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:28,900
This is what actually happened behind
that Dok Go Jin incident on TV.

145
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,560
Does Ae Jeong know this too?

146
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:35,010
Yes, she must have by now

147
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,240
since she went to see him.

148
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:09,180
Using violence to a human being is something
that's inexcusable at any rate.

149
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,010
I apologize for losing my calm and throwing a punch.

150
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,750
I'm cutting you slack this time since you
came here in person to apologize,

151
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:24,550
but if this happens again, I will not tolerate it.

152
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:31,040
I also came to tell you that I won't
tolerate this if it happens again.

153
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:42,970
To tell you that if you hurt Gu Ae Jeong
one more time, I will break you.

154
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,110
You did this because of Gu Ae Jeong?

155
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:50,930
Even if the public image you've
built is as grand as a mountain,

156
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,240
you will crumble if you conduct yourself like this.

157
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,020
Do you want me to give it a tilt?

158
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,960
Push me.

159
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:04,460
If you tilt a mountain, you will be
crushed to death by the avalanche.

160
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:09,220
You will turn the one who's beaten into the
one who's deserved to be beaten, is that right?

161
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:17,320
That's the power of my image that you have threatened.

162
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,490
Turn over like this.

163
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,560
Is this where you got hurt?

164
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:31,670
"Ho"

165
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,620
I did this because she told me to.

166
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,820
Consider it as an honor.

167
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,230
Just who is Gu Ae Jeong to make Dok Go Jin do this?

168
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,720
A powerless colleague belonging to the same company.

169
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:45,490
I'm the hero, Dok Go Jin.

170
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,100
You are the [son of a bitch] who hits women.

171
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,260
That's the run down.

172
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:53,210
If you cook up a story, I will sue you.

173
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,800
Jae Seok!

174
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:02,460
Dok Go Jin couldn't receive the award because of a chronic heart problem.

175
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:04,480
That's what the news is going to be.

176
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:08,630
- I didn't have any other way to explain.
- Since it IS broken,

177
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,660
- at least it's not a lie.
- In my opinion,

178
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,890
you really do have a problem.

179
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,050
You ruined what could have been

180
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:19,550
the most honorable and glorious moment in your life.

181

[Best Male Actor: Dok Go Jin]

182
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,470
It could've been very cool.

183
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,620
It was a shame to have missed it.

184
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:39,910
The only way to cure your problem is to go away.

185
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,440
If you go to Hollywood as planned, you will be fine.

186
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,540
I won't be going.

187
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,960
What?

188
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,320
What about playing a super hero?

189
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm going to shove aside Hollywood super hero business

190
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:57,150
and play the hero protecting his colleague at work.

191
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,900
Why are you doing this?

192
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,350
Ae Jeong's saying no.

193
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,780
Why is Dok Go Jin doing this when she's saying no.

194
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,070
How fortunate is it that Ae Jeong's saying no?

195
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:06,350
It cannot turn into a problem.

196
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,750
Don't worry.

197
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:26,110
Potato. You are worth missing the award for, right?

198
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:29,670
You have grown quite a lot.

199
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:32,980
At this rate, you might even blossom into a flower?

200
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,870
Wait.

201
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,310
If a flower blossoms,

202
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:43,170

[Dok Go Jin's heart problem makes his fans' hearts sink]

206
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:01,450
The scar on your chest was from a heart surgery?

207
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,240
Why didn't you tell me?

208
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,970
Did we have the time to talk about such thing?

209
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:10,440
When we were on good terms, there wasn't a lot of talking.

210
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,080
There was only "body language."

211
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:16,010
Anyway, I was taken aback when
people were asking me about it.

212
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:20,600
I was in shock when I heard about
Manager Jang from Representative Moon.

213
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,160
You like Gu Ae Jeong that much?

214
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:27,000
What is that expression about?

215
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,310
Why are you so happy?

216
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:34,360
If you are going to hook up
with Gu Ae Jeong, I will let you go.

217
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:35,810
Are you going to?

218
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,440
What is your intention?

219
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,890
You and I are both not the type
to wish others well for no reason.

220
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:42,880
Okay, fine.

221
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:46,370
I will tell you everything since you already know who I am.

222
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:50,050
I like Yoon Pil Joo.

What?

224
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,400
If you hook up with Ae Jeong,
Ae Jeong will let Yoon Pil Joo go.

225
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,310
Then I can also get my chance.

226
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,540
Gu Ae Jeong and I cannot be together.

227
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:04,270
So don't touch that Anybody Doctor
who's treating Ae Jeong well.

228
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:07,250
What?  You lost to that doctor?

229
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,710
I didn't lose.

230
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,990
I just can't get rid of him.

231
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,950
This is not true.

232
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:23,300
Dok Go Jin didn't receive the award because of Ae Jeong.

233
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,950
I know.

234
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:25,690
What?

235
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,060
You didn't come because you were sick but
because you wanted to tell me this?

236
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,890
I am sick.

237
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,100
I came because Ae Jeong having Dok Go Jin on one side

238
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:36,860
and Yoon Pil Joo on the other makes me sick and tired.

239
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:39,580
You are just twisted.

240
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:44,180
When you are sick because of a
twisted heart, a hospital can't cure you.

241
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:50,390
The sincerity you talked about last time was also
just jealousy of your twisted heart, wasn't it?

242
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,630
Why do people get jealous?

243
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,640
They get jealous because what they like got stolen.

244
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:00,950
So grown up Yoon Pil Joo is not
jealous at all after reading this?

245
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,910
I am jealous.

246
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,540
I am also very jealous.

247
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,240
I'm sorry.

248
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,550
You provoked my twisted heart in bringing this up.

249
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,280
So I lashed out on you.

250
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,980
You must now know how I feel, right?

251
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:29,080
Then, don't scold me again.

252
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,950
It's already too hard for me.

253
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:58,710
You are signing your autographs?

254
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,050
What is that?

255
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:03,200
These are for the promotion
of the product Dok Go advertises.

256
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,090
He's doing a ton of advertising.

257
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:05,950
Isn't he?

258
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,660
- Bye.
- Bye.

259
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,740
Don't look at me.

260
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:26,090
What are you looking at with those broken eyes?

261
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,910
He keeps smiling.

262
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:39,280
I need to turn it backward.

263
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:57,120
I need to look at it with my head.

264
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:04,310
Wicked, evil, spoiled, and defective Asshole Jin.

265
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:09,290
What are you to be bothering me like this?

266
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,530
Why? Why?

267
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,130
Why?

268
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:17,380
It's got a mark.

269
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,650
What if it comes back to haunt me for revenge?

270
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,650
Gosh.

271
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:11,470
Finally.

272
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,450
Would you be satisfied with that?

273
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,130
You are seriously on fire.

274
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,090
What are you talking about?

275
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:25,500
It had a mark here so I was erasing it.

276
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,100
Look, there's still a stain here, look.

277
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,640
What you did not get from real Dok Go,

278
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:31,460
you were satisfying with the paper Dok Go?

279
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,260
Here, help yourself with the real thing.

280
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,730
Don't touch, just look.

281
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:39,170
What are you talking about?

282
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:42,000
I was erasing the mark on here. Look yourself.

283
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:44,220
Okay, I'll let you touch once.

284
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,680
So greedy.
Here.

285
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,570
You are not going to touch?

286
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,190
You are good at ignoring.

287
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:10,220
I got used to your jokes.

288
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:15,680
Then no matter what I say, you
have to keep ignoring it as a joke.

289
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:23,100
Even if I ask you to publicize
a scandal with me, it's a joke.

290
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,740
Ding dong.

291
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:30,980
Even if I beg you to marry me, it's a joke.

292
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,680
Ding dong.

293
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:35,200
Even if I disappear

294
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:42,950
because I'm dying, it's a joke.

295
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,750
Ding dong?

296
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,660
You say such things as a joke?

297
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:55,450
Because I'm the Asshole Jin who
has an asshole instead of mouth.

298
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:02,280
How many autographs are you signing?

299
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:07,560
Here. Take this first.

300
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,200
It's free.
Isn't it an honor?

301
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,280
Aren't you so grateful?

302
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,580
Answer me.

303
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,660
Okay, just take it.

00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,590
He gives disease and then offers remedy.*

305
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,590
(*it's an old saying)

306
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,850
He's playing with me.

307
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,690
Just who did this to you?

308
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,700
I don't know.

309
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:40,040
I cannot tell you.

310
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:43,400
Can your temper take this and stay silent?

311
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:47,220
It would be mortifying to stay silent.

312
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,070
Speaking of which,

313
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,380
you know Han Mi Na who used
to be in National Treasure Girls,

314
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:57,600
the girl who dated the leader of the boy band KK, Hwi Jin?

315
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,970
He used to be in your company. What does he do these days?

316
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,930
He's been performing in China for a long time.

317
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:09,470
If I contact him, would I be able to find Han Mi Na?

318
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:15,020
Who knows. Are you looking for Hwi Jin or Han Mi Na?

319
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:16,640
Han Mi Na.

320
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:23,490
I'm going to find Han Mi Na so that
I can find somebody's Achilles' heel.

321
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,560
You are really not going to Hollywood because of Ae Jeong?

322
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:37,830
I can't, because of what I've provoked.

323
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:42,650
The mountain that's going to crumble should
stand in place so that he keeps his hands off.

324
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:47,040
Regarding Director Jerry Heimer,
we didn't burn the bridge yet.

325
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,010
By the way,

326
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:58,850
are you going to tell me the
result of your medical examination?

327
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:09,080
You may not be my manager for long.

328
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:15,490
What did I tell you what my manager should be like?

329
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:22,830
He may have no tact and he may have a big mouth,

330
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,860
but I shouldn't be like that.

331
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:31,290
Right. Just be that way.

332
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,080
10 years ago,

333
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,680
the patient suffered

334
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,300
from a significant loss of cardiac
function due to a viral infection.

335
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:52,290
Until now, he's been living with an artificial heart.

336
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:57,540
Recently, his cardiac output has been dropping
and thus the patient requires a second operation.

337
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:01,460
For a second operation involving an artificial heart,

338
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:04,740
as you know, the success rate is reduced
to half due to cardiac adhesion.

339
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:08,890
Therefore, I entreat special attention
from the doctors in charge of each part.

340
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:13,120
Dok Go Jin's artificial heart re-operation
will be conducted under absolute secrecy.

341
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:16,050
Knowing the celebrity status of the patient,

342
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,480
I also entreat from you strict security measures.

343
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:22,060
I'm making arrangements to perform
the operation within a month.

344
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:27,590
Once I go into surgery, this will stop, right?

345
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,060
Of course.

346
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,970
If it succeeds, it will beat again.

347
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:32,500
If not, it will stop forever.

348
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,690
Have positive thoughts.

349
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:39,760
That "pit-a-pat" who sung the cheer song
for you 10 years ago is now right by you.

350
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:44,150
I'm resisting the urge because keeping
her by me would be too selfish of me.

351
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:50,380
I miss Gu Ae Jeong.

352
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,090
Resist. Mind control.

353
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:59,430
Even if I miss her too much,
I need to resist at least three times.

354
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,170
I miss her.

355
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:04,520
I miss her, I miss her.

356
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,480
I resisted three times.

357
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:10,470
No.
Stop.

358
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:15,240
Resist just 30 more times.

359
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:25,410
Even so, I miss Gu Ae Jeong.

360
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:28,050
Gu Ae Jeong.

361
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:34,240
I resisted 300 times.

362
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,930
I need to charge.

363
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,680
I'm just going to see her for a second and leave.

364
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,190
Hello, Ahjussi.

365
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:40,960
Hello, Ding dong.
Your Aunt?

366
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:42,500
She's away.

367
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,620
What are you doing with this?

368
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:50,520
Since you are tall, please help me.

369
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,600
Where is it?

370
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,520
Over there.

371
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:01,780
- Here.
- Thank you.

372
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:06,630
She confiscated it and put it up there.

373
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:10,030
Don't tell your aunt that I took it down for you.

374
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,610
You got it by your own efforts.

375
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,630
Give me the chair.

376
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:21,560
Evidence on the scene.

377
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,700
Ahjussi, did you sneak in to see my aunt?

378
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:28,570
No. Ding dong.
Sneaking is what a pervert stalker does.

379
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,480
I came to properly meet her.

380
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:36,500
I will go replace the game card
for this.

381
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,660
Wait for me!

382
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,270
Okay.

383
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:56,990
My drink.

384
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:15,350
That Anybody Doctor even paid tribute to Her Majesty.

385
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:20,260
This is why her face looks so fatigued these days.

386
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:40,820
Is this Gu Ae Jeong's room?

387
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,580
What is this?

388
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:49,440
Are you a pervert stalker?

389
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,010
What are you trying to peep at?

390
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,800
Must knock before going in.

391
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,660
I did.

392
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:24,580
She left it open. How sloppy of her.

393
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:38,330
It's the smell of Gu Ae Jeong.

394
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:44,590
I'm just going to take a tiny bit.

395
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,870
Gu Ae Jeong's smell. Gu Ae Jeong's smell.

396
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:55,800
Hyung Gyu!

397
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:02,070
Hyung Gyu!

398
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:09,650
Damn it.

399
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:27,290
Where did he go leaving the door unlocked?

400
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:34,140
Gosh, so hot.

401
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,860
It's so hot.

402
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,440
What is it?

403
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,640
Ae Jeong, I bought watermelons.

404
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,240
Oppa.

405
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,690
- Looks delicious.
- Doesn't it?

406
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,710
I'll go bring out the tray and stuff.

407
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:12,500
It's so fresh. Come out to the outdoor table.

408
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,490
- Let's eat it outside.
- Yes.

409
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:16,940
Hurry.

410
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:19,870
I will go as soon as I change.

411
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,750
So hot.

412
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,230
Where did my pants go?

413
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,720
Who is that?

414
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:59,060
A foot?

415
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,970
It's me, Gu Ae Jeong.

416
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,930
Don't go.
Don't go.

417
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,060
Oppa. Oppa.
Oppa.

418
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,710
- No.
- Don't.

419
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:16,760
It's me.
Dok Go Jin.

420
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:23,610
I happened to have entered and somehow hid myself.

421
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:26,660
It's going to be weird if your
family sees this, so be quiet.

422
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,930
Got it?

423
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,350
Ae Jeong!

424
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:36,850
Gosh.

425
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,370
Hurry, let's eat.
What are you doing?

426
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:43,940
Right.

427
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,710
I'm gonna eat ramen.

428
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:49,510
What is it?

429
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,940
Are you going to sleep?

430
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,180
Yes.

431
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,600
You are not eating the watermelon?

432
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,520
No, I will eat after a nap.

433
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,910
Aren't you hot?

434
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,610
No, I'm fine.

435
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:07,640
Your feet!

436
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,680
What?

437
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,350
Wash your feet before you sleep. So dirty.

438
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:29,370
He's gone? Is he?

439
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:34,770
What the hell are you doing in my room?

440
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,180
I'll explain to you.

441
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,680
What are you doing like a pervert?

442
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,430
This is the smell of my cream.

443
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,050
You put my cream on your face?

444
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,950
Listen to me, I can explain.

445
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,460
So, I...

446
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:03,410
My pants.

447
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:19,540
Are you thinking that I'm a pervert stalker?

448
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,180
I'm Dok Go Jin.

449
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,340
I even knocked and entered properly.

450
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:28,160
My family is here. How are you going to get out?

451
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:33,550
Gu Ae Jeong, what do you think?

452
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,650
How do you want me to get out?

453
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,610
Gosh, really.

454
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,720
There is an exit on the rooftop.

455
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,430
Follow me.

456
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,020
That is ingenious.

457
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:02,410
I sprained my ankle.

458
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:06,390
If I call the police for what you've
done, you will go straight to jail.

459
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:10,090
I'm letting you go this time because I can't let you

460
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,370
be on the front page of tomorrow's newspaper
for sneaking into Gu Ae Jeong's house,

461
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,870
putting her cream on and getting
caught trying to steal her pants.

462
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,660
Go now.

463
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:22,010
Let me just sit here for a second, my ankle really hurts.

464
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,800
Do you know anything if you see it?

465
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:32,490
You must have learned something from that Anybody Doctor?

466
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:35,590
I may not know how to perform blood cupping or acupuncture

467
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:38,250
but I know how to make a hot towel.

468
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:56,640
Why did you come here again?

469
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:58,700
To charge.

470
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,170
What are you doing again?

471
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:20,110
Stay still. Let me fill just one third.

472
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:25,720
Charging...

473
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,680
Is your breakage serious?

474
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:39,700
I'm preparing for a repair.

475
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:43,670
For now, I need charging.

476
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,270
I'm going crazy.

477
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,470
Why?

478
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:15,190
I want to put you in my house and use as my charger.

479
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:20,790
Gu Ae Jeong, I told you I'm broken.

480
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:24,690
I need to wait for about a month until I get fixed,

481
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,190
will you be by my side until then?

482
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:30,850
How can you say such a thing to me?

483
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,320
For just one month?

484
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:35,240
It's a defect, not love, and you
are asking me, "just one month?"

485
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,910
Right.

486
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,470
Just stay with me for just that much.

487
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,970
You told me you are going to
brush past me once you are fixed.

488
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,530
Why are you doing this to me?

489
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,610
Consider me as a broken car.

490
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:49,400
And since I might crash somewhere, you take
control of the steering wheel and protect me.

491
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:53,710
I might run out of battery and stop before that one month.

492
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:57,380
Then you can also recharge me and keep me company.

493
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,670
Then I will be really nice to you.

494
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,670
Then,

495
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:08,550
ask me properly,

496
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:12,340
"I like you, so stay by my side."

497
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,710
I can't say that. I told you I'm broken.

498
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:20,920
Just leave if you don't want to be scrapped right here.

499
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:35,960
I'm really going crazy.

500
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:55,410
Bastard.

501
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:06,850
I persuaded my Pil Joo to be on TV because
I trusted you as his high school sunbae.

502
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,970
- Just look what happened.
- I apologize.

503
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:13,190
I didn't know Pil Joo's choice would bring about all this.

504
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,750
His marriage prospects just got ruined.

505
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:24,050
Didn't the PD and the writer encourage
him to do this to score a high rating?

506
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,770
As you might have noticed if you have seen the show,

507
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:32,220
the situation right now is that Pil Joo really likes
Gu Ae Jeong and that's how it came to this.

508
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:37,360
Then did you make Gu Ae Jeong seduce and come on to Pil Joo?

509
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:45,550
We are obliged to ask the cast to act according
to the storyline to make the show interesting.

510
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:48,620
Are you saying that Gu Ae Jeong
is not even interested in Pil Joo

511
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:51,530
and doing the show against her will
while only Pil Joo is obsessed with her?

512
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,110
It is a bit ironic.

513
00:40:57,170 --> 00:41:04,280
Is Gu Ae Jeong really not interested in Pil Joo
and doing this only for the sake of the show?

514
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:08,880
We understand that Pil Joo is a good guy.

515
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:14,690
All the marriage brokers in Kangnam knows that full well.

516
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:20,470
So he's a good guy but he's not the one that Ae Jeong likes?

517
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:22,490
Ding dong.

518
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:34,510
So, that means Gu Ae Jeong can also ditch my Pil Joo on TV?

519
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:40,630
Ae Jeong won't do that to Director Yoon on TV, she can't.

520
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:42,130
If she can't,

521
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:44,700
is she going to keep dating
Pil Joo on TV for the sake of the show

522
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:46,890
even when her heart is not in it?

523
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,740
She shouldn't do that either. Never!

524
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,140
What has become of my Pil Joo?

525
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:57,500
What has become of my Pil Joo.?

526
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:03,020
Your mother seems to be very worried.

527
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,590
It must have been uncomfortable for you.

528
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,350
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

529
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:10,930
I think she's worried for no reason that, at this rate,

530
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:13,530
I will take it to the end of it.

531
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:15,410
I'm so sorry.

532
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:17,570
She has a reason to worry.

533
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,490
In starting this, I had an end in mind.

534
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:30,260
There's something that I've learned from somebody.

535
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:37,020
That, when one's heart is occupied
by someone else, I can't get it.

536
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:44,290
Ae Jeong, if you are thinking of me even a little bit,

537
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:50,010
please drive him out of your heart.

538
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:57,910
The demo of your song is out.

539
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,540
Listen to it.

540
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,960
This is my song?

541
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:05,250
I listened to it first and I have a good feeling about it.

542
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,640
I think it's going to hit the jackpot.

543
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:07,840
One more thing.

544
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,710
Even though it's for a small paper, you have also
been offered to do a commercial.

545
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:12,640
I was offered a commercial?

546
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,930
Right.

547
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:17,580
I told you you are soon going
to get out of the "unlikable" image.

548
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:21,980
At this rate, you will be able to enjoy your golden days again.

549
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:25,620
Also, I need to ask you a favor.

550
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:30,780
I'm asking you because I trust your sense of reality.

551
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:36,250
Please persuade Dok Go to go to Hollywood.

552
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:40,240
How can I persuade him?

553
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:46,390
Dok Go has the strongest sense of pride. Try using that.

554
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,720
And please put an end to this once and for all.

555
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:19,000
The person who bought Ae Jeong's
running shoes was me, Dok Go Jin.

556
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:36,950
Then, ask me properly.
Say, "I like you, so stay by my side."

557
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:41,730
I can't, I told you I'm broken.

558
00:45:56,950 --> 00:45:59,470
I asked around about Han Mi Na.

559
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:01,820
She changed her name to Hye Jin.

560
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:04,560
Hye. Jin. Hye Jin.

561
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:06,860
Rumor has it that she went to the US after getting married.

562
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:10,140
It's not clear whether or not she is back in Korea now.

563
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:13,660
She's in Korea. I've seen her.

564
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:16,260
Let me try finding her.

565
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,380
Hello.

566
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:25,240
Is there a patient called Han Hye Jin?

567
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:28,260
- I've seen her here.
- Han Hye Jin?

568
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:30,790
One second, please.

569
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:37,200
Yes. She's Director Yoon's patient.

570
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:40,110
That's just great.

571
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:42,350
She's my old friend.

572
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:44,770
Can I have her number by any chance?

573
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:48,080
I cannot give you personal information...

574
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:52,750
She made an appointment.

575
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:56,920
At her next appointment, I'll tell
her that you want to meet her.

576
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:58,720
There's no need.

577
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,140
At her next appointment,
I'll come here in person to meet her.

578
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:06,490
Don't tell her this, I want it to be a surprise.

579
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,550
What did Se Ri just check here?

580
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:25,730
She saw her old friend here by chance.
She was looking for her.

581
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:27,580
A friend?

582
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:29,180
Who was she looking for?

583
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,110
Han Hye Jin.

584
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:40,100
Please don't tell Ae Jeong or Se Ri that you saw me.

585
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:45,080
Why is she looking for her?

586
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:47,810
Mi Na and Se Ri were not close.

587
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:52,150
Se Ri would never want to see Mi Na.

588
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:55,350
By the way, how do you know Mi Na?

589
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:59,180
I just heard about her from Se Ri.

590
00:48:07,370 --> 00:48:08,790
Spider man.

591
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,370
Hello.
Conan Ahjussi.

592
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:13,020
What are you doing here?

593
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:17,870
I have something I need to find.

594
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:22,310
Ahjussi, please help me.

595
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:29,310
What my aunt threw it away in here. I need to get it back.

596
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,310
Is that what you were trying to find?

597
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,550
Yes.

598
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:45,550
Didn't your aunt throw that away?

599
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:46,930
Yes.

600
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:50,850
If you get her back what she threw away, she won't like it.

601
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:52,910
She didn't throw it away because she didn't like it.

602
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:57,830
She was crying as she threw this away.

603
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:37,360
Dok Go. Stop shaking me up.

604
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:41,750
I really want to do well with Pil Joo.

605
00:49:42,050 --> 00:49:44,600
It'd all work if only you were out of my life.

606
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:47,960
So, get lost.

607
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:54,290
I'll practice with the paper Dok Go and
I'll do the same with the real Dok Go.

608
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:56,190
Should I try one more time?

609
00:49:56,350 --> 00:49:59,550
Dok Go, stop shaking me up.

610
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:01,050
Gu Ae Jeong.

611
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:12,870
You're being shaken by me, aren't you?

612
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:17,390
You are too confident and stuck up.

613
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:19,800
You are really stuck up.

614
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,860
I have something to show you. Come to my place.

615
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:28,310
You are not gonna ask me what it is?

616
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:34,970
Dok Go, come to think about it,

617
00:50:35,290 --> 00:50:39,170
I've been too obedient, giving into your every demand.

618
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,490
Haven't I?

619
00:50:41,590 --> 00:50:43,800
So please give into my demand this time also.

620
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:47,090
- This time, you give into my demand.
- What demand?

621
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:50,170
The one you just practiced, "get out of my life?"

622
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:51,940
I won't do that.

623
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:57,370
Dok Go, go on a picnic with me.

624
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:01,620
What?

625
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:03,780
You want to?

626
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:09,470
If you want to, can you wait for me once?

627
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:10,640
If I wait, will you come?

628
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:13,790
Can't you just wait for me no matter what?

629
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:19,270
If you plan on waiting and going on a picnic with me,

630
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,370
wait for me in front of my house tonight.

631
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:29,330
I have a shoot. I'll get going.

632
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:31,220
Gu Ae Jeong.

633
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:40,000
I'll wait.

634
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:42,210
Please come.

635
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,630
Put it over here.

636
00:51:56,770 --> 00:51:59,240
You, did you check the backside?

637
00:51:59,370 --> 00:52:03,120
Today's theme is Pil Joo's hobby.

638
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:06,760
You guys can move on to solving a puzzle over there.

639
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:09,250
Last time, when we told you to cook,

640
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:12,360
you guys really cooked hard without talking.

641
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:15,350
Don't do that today and make some conversation.

642
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:17,570
- Talk, talk please.
- Got it.

643
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:24,470
I need to concentrate to solve a puzzle,
it must be hard to talk at the same time.

644
00:52:24,570 --> 00:52:26,340
I'll do the talking.

645
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:28,380
When you are talking,

646
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,920
how can I concentrate on something so trivial as a puzzle?

647
00:52:35,810 --> 00:52:37,670
What I told you last time

648
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:40,040
must have given you too much pressure.

649
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:46,190
But, it was a good thing that you told me.

650
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,340
I needed to feel that pressure.

651
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:54,910
So I set a date today to drive him away.

652
00:52:55,410 --> 00:53:00,320
So you need to help me.

653
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:08,950
Please bind me down all day today
so that I don't go running back to him.

654
00:53:09,510 --> 00:53:12,300
Thank you for making up your mind that way.

655
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:16,810
I'm so sorry for having to ask you such thing.

656
00:53:43,870 --> 00:53:45,450
Potato.

657
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:53,220
Today, I stake the rest of my life waiting for Gu Ae Jeong.

658
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:34,950
What's up?

659
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:40,500
Your cell phone is the same as mine, so I got confused.

660
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:45,510
I happened to have read a new message. It's from him.

661
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:50,240
I don't want to see it.
Just delete it.

662
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,630
They are really not saying a word.

663
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:23,030
Is this a puzzle solving championship?

664
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:30,310
By the way, don't you feel some kind of a tension?

665
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:32,360
If you like it so much, join them.

666
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:35,300
No, there's something going on.

667
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,360
I'll help you.

668
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:26,690
When it's hard, follow me.

669
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,370
The movie was fun, wasn't it?

670
00:57:28,450 --> 00:57:29,650
Yes.

671
00:57:38,890 --> 00:57:40,970
Today's almost over.

672
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:28,940
I'll help you. When it's hard, follow me.

673
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:05,470
I did a good job brushing past him, didn't I?

674
01:00:06,990 --> 01:00:13,260
He must have well noticed how I ignored him and just passed him by, right?

675
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:19,920
If he's got even a modicum of pride, he's going to get off of me, right?

676
01:00:23,930 --> 01:00:26,330
Then, it's all over.

677
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:33,940
I'm sorry.

678
01:00:35,030 --> 01:00:37,160
It must be hard on you too.

679
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:42,160
I'm sorry.

680
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:47,350
I didn't delete the message you had.

681
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:29,140
Gu Ae Jeong,

682
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:37,540
the potato you brought to me, I raised it this much.

683
01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:42,210
Although they say the sprout of a potato is poisonous...

684
01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:44,300
as I kept taking care of it,

685
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:46,740
I keep thinking it's going to soon blossom into a flower.

686
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:52,960
I can't catch you properly because I'm broken.

687
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:57,750
So you come to me this time.

688
01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:07,250
Come and charge me, so that
I can keep moving without halting.

689
01:04:27,770 --> 01:04:30,540
You wicked bastard.

690
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:33,450
Recharge.
