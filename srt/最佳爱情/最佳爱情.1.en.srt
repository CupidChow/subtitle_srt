00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:48,717
NATIONAL TREASURE GIRLS RULE!

OPERATION ROOM

6
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:19,176
NATIONAL TREASURE GIRLS
"HEARTBEAT"

7
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:24,847
Doctor, isn't this song too distracting?

8
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:27,846
No, it's nice.

9
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:31,386
They're saying their hearts
are beating fast.

10
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:34,185
It's the perfect song

11
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:36,998
for a patient getting heart surgery.

12
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:50,905
-National Treasure Girls!
-National Treasure Girls!

13
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:03,621
This week's number one song is...

14
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,264
"Heartbeat" by National Treasure Girls!

15
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:11,825
Their song has ranked number one

16
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:13,825
Please tell us how you're feeling.

17

-Don't cry!

18
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:20,335

00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:34,815
You're going to keep loving us, right?

24
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:36,621
-Yes!
-Yes!

25
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:37,789
Thank you.

00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:59,454

00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,852
Sunday morning’s variety show!

32
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:04,815
-Challenge, I can do it!
-I can do it!

33
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,558
Up next, we have a former teen idol.

34
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:19,567
-She was one of the first idols.
-Right.

35
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:22,642
Gu Ae-jeong of National Treasure Girls!

36
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,372
Give her a round of applause!

37
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:29,106
It's been quite a while.

38
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:30,705
Thank you for joining us.

39
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:34,578
SINGING HIGH NOTES

40
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:36,851
She wins!

41
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,076
CHALLENGE FAILED

42
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,021
LIMBO, TUMBLING

43
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:40,916
All right!

44
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:41,887
CHALLENGE FAILED

45
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,015
Ta-da!

46
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:49,562
The last place for this week
is Ms. Gu Ae-jeong.

47
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:50,899
That's right.

48
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:56,643
I have to eat all this
before the ride ends, right?

49
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:57,603
Yes.

50
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,970
Then if I finish this,

51
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:00,368
do I get to come again next week?

52
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,080
Yes, you should.

53
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,135
Then I should succeed.

54
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:05,514
Challenge...

55
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:07,445
-I can do it!
-I can do it!

56
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,850
All right!

57
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:13,486
-Ready, go!
-Ready, go!

58
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,322
-I have to mix this quickly!
-Mix it, hurry!

59
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,585
Oh, no. I don't like this.

60
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:24,261
I have to eat this, but I can't reach it!

61
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:38,443
We're at the top.

62
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:40,245
We're going down now.

63
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:43,384
Don't be afraid, Ae-jeong.

64
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:47,285
We're going down.

65
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,460
We're going.

66
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:14,376
It's gone!

67
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:28,803
MOVIE PREMIER FOR FIGHTER

68
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:39,313
You're getting really good reactions.

69
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:45,306
Director.

70
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,782
It's awesome.

71
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:09,097
All they're doing is fighting.

72
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:12,944
This is so boring.

73
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:41,566
-This is so long.
-It is boring.

74
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,050
It's finally over.

75
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:58,522
-Thanks to all the fans and reporters
-Is it over?

76
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,088
-for coming here
-Wipe off your drool.

77
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:02,864
to watch Fighter.

78
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:05,562
We've just finished the screening.

79
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,585
Did you enjoy it?

80
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:11,096
Thank you.

81
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:15,871
Now, the director and the actors
who worked so hard

82
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:19,465
to make this film will come on stage

83
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,769
to greet all of you.

84
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:29,119
He looks so happy
when he's messed up the whole movie.

85
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:34,323
Dokgo Jin, please come up to the stage.

86
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,457
I think you better go.

87
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,063
Please come to the stage.

88
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,994
-Dokgo Jin!
-Dokgo Jin!

89
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:40,989
Dokgo Jin.

90
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,800
Please give him a welcoming applause.

91
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,759
I think that will make him come here.

92
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:47,028
Dokgo Jin!

93
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:48,699
-What?
-What?

94
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:02,252
Since the film's title is Fighter,

95
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,945
Dokgo Jin showed us
a surprise performance.

96
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,445
Hello. I'm the star of Fighter,

97
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:09,824
Dokgo Jin.

98
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,120
Hello.

99
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:13,831
Thank you.

100
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,000
-Hello.
-Dokgo Jin!

101
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:17,158
-I love you guys.
-Dokgo Jin!

102
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:18,663
-Dokgo Jin!
-Dokgo Jin!

103
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:28,766
GU AE-JEONG OF NATIONAL TREASURE GIRLS
AT DISCO NIGHTCLUB

104
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,236
Are you feeling okay?

105
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,180
Maybe it's because
of the jajangmyeon I ate earlier.

106
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:34,706
It feels like my stomach

107
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,780
is on a roller coaster.

108
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,921
Ae-jeong, should we just cancel
your schedule for today?

109
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:42,387
No!

110
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,558
It's just jajangmyeon,
it'll get digested soon.

111
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:47,588
I should go buy some coke.

112
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,097
Stay here.

113
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,902
You keep forgetting Ae-jeong,
but you're a celebrity, too.

114
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:56,703
I'm your brother,
but I'm your manager as well.

115
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:57,999
Right, I forgot.

116
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:01,311
Alright then, manager. No, Mr. Gu.

117
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:04,007
Please get me a coke.
Something to help my stomach.

118
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:05,777
Okay, my artist.

119
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:14,092
Until the day

120
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:16,855
I die...

121
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:18,964
Hey, Jae-seok.

122
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,359
This is the drama

123
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:24,704
I rejected to film Fighter, right?

124
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,870
Yes, Kim Jun-seong took the role
instead of you.

125
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,040
What's the viewer rating for this show?

126
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,270
It totally failed.
It's not even five percent.

127
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:34,806
"Five percent"?

128
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:36,384
And the reviews were terrible,

129
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:37,812
so Jun-seong is done for.

130
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,250
Really?

131
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:42,449
He's done for, I see.

132
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:46,119
I ruined his career because I rejected it.

133
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:48,122
I feel really sorry.

134
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:50,787
Ms. Moon is looking for your next drama.

135
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,057
Choose carefully.

136
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:54,131
You should avoid stuff
that will ruin your career.

137
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:55,433
Why would I shoot a drama?

138
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:58,298
I have to go to Hollywood
and shoot a film with Peter Jason.

139
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:02,068
Well, it's not confirmed yet.

140
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:04,104
What are you talking about?

141
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,870
I went all the way to the States myself
to audition.

142
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:08,243
So it's confirmed for sure.

143
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,508
It's even in the news, isn't that right?

144
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,310
Why are you so negative?

145
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,409
Wait...

146
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:19,288
Peter didn't turn me down, did he?

147
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:20,892
We'll wait and see.

148
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:24,661
You even sent
a 15 thousand dollar wine as a gift.

149
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,264
I'm sure he'll favor you.

150
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,486
I should call Ms. Moon.

151
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:30,258
Hey, turn that off.

152
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:39,374
Should I get some water for you?

153
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:45,143
What's taking him so long?

154
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:49,984
I need some fresh air.

155
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:53,718
Oh, my back.

156
00:10:57,923 --> 00:10:59,033
It's a van.

157
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:01,362
It must be a new model.

158
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:03,561
I wonder if a celebrity is inside?

159
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:07,703
Why isn't she answering her phone?

160
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,408
The person you are trying
to reach is unavailable.

161
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,011
Hey, it's a celebrity!

162
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:21,883
Where?

163
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,421
That's the kind of van celebrities use.

164
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,415
Wow, she's so pretty.

165
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:30,718
But where did I see her?

166
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,800
Right. I may not be popular,
but I'm still well-known.

167
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:43,938
I'm so jealous.

168
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:47,765
Where's my manager?

169
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,010
I'm so busy, I should be on my way.

170
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,680
How ridiculous.

171
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,622
My goodness.

172
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:02,493
How dare you lean on this.

173
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:04,692
Stop hanging around and go away.

174
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:07,857
Sorry, I didn't know someone was here.

175
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:10,764
I was just admiring the car. Sorry.

176
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:17,101
You must be a celebrity.

177
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:19,273
Are you a singer? An actor?

178
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,705
Hello. Let's say hello.

179
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,842
Aren't you a celebrity?
Why don't you say hello...

180
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,278
Go throw this away.

181
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:30,277
I don't work here...

182
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:33,751
I'll throw that away for you.

183
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,934
It spilled all over me!

184
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:45,897
Thank you.

185
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,272
Oh, gosh.

186
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:49,871
-Damn it.
-My coat...

187
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:52,243
What do I do? This is so annoying.

188
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,817
Here. Wipe the car.

189
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:04,853
What?

190
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:08,947
You gave me this to wipe the car?
Not for me?

191
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:10,921
You're the one who spilled it
all over the car.

192
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:11,960
What?

193
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,862
What did you just say to me?

194
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:16,397
Whatever. Never mind.

195
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:18,199
Forget it, just go.

196
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,496
I can't believe it! You're so rude!

197
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:26,414
What?

198
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,780
You're a celebrity, right?

199
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:31,609
I'm a celebrity, too.

200
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:33,177
You can see me from in there, right?

201
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:36,445
Let me see your face.
Don't just stick your arm out.

202
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,779
Come out. Come on. Who are you?

203
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:40,951
-Let me see your face.
-Go away!

204
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:45,292
Did you just poke me with that?

205
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,686
Come on. Who are you?

206
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,431
Come out. Where are you?

207
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:52,997
What do you think you're doing?

208
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:55,169
-Go away!
-Gosh.

209
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:56,537
Hey!

210
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:59,366
I got you. Let me see who is this rude.

211
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:03,476
Hey. Did you just grab my hand?

212
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:04,682
Let go of me!

213
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:07,183
I'm not leaving until I see your face.
Let go of me.

214
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,180
You're twisting my arm!

215
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,450
You're hurting me.

216
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:14,692
What are you doing? Let me go.

217
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,920
What are you writing?

218
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:17,058
Excuse me!

219
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,123
Let go.

220
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:21,662
What are you doing? Let go of me.

221
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:25,663
That hurt.

222
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:28,202
What a crazy man!

223
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:32,003
What is this?

224
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:34,405
That's my autograph.

225
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:36,477
You want to know who I am?

226
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:38,983
Try and guess.

227
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,650
Hey.

228
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,775
Come out.

229
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,260
Excuse me.
You're not fooling around, right?

230
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,223
Open the door. Let me talk to you.

231
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,128
Open the door.

232
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:58,199
Hey!

233
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,671
What a weird person.

234
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,300
You stay right there.
I'm not letting you leave.

235
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:04,369
Hey!

236
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:07,837
Hey! What are you doing in there?

237
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,837
-Come on out!
-Jin!

238
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,779
Are you seriously going to
stay in there like this?

239
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,205
-Get in, hurry.
-What?

240
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,550
-Hey!
-Lock the door.

241
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:17,245
-Come on!
-Lock the door, hurry.

242
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:18,276
Okay.

243
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:21,486
Excuse me.

244
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,793
Who is that woman?

245
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:28,028
I don't know. She says
she's a celebrity, too. Just go.

246
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:31,227
Are you running away? Hey! Are you mad?

247
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:32,357
Oh, my gosh.

248
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:35,268
Hey! Stop right there!

249
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:36,938
Where are you going?

250
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:40,368
Ae-jeong, what's wrong?

251
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,480
I should've seen who that jerk was.

252
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,349
Hey, do you know whose autograph this is?

253
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,282
Is that English or Korean?

254
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:51,821
Signing an autograph like this means
he's really a celebrity, right?

255
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:56,158
Who in the world could this jerk be?

256
00:15:58,257 --> 00:15:59,387
You're so pretty.

257
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:03,931
Kang Se-ri’s airport outfit is out.

258
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:05,763
Change the displayed product right away.

259
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:10,267
It's finally out.

260
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:13,043
It's so pretty.

261
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,820
Make a thousand products with this design.

262
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,530
KANG SE-RI'S AIRPORT OUTFIT

263
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:40,868
Your airport outfit

264
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,803
is listed at the top most searched
on the internet.

265
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:47,013
There's another article saying
you and Dokgo Jin

266
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:48,443
broke up.

267
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,241
That's because I didn't go
to his movie premiere.

268
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:54,107
His agency is going to make
a complaint about this.

269
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,509
I didn't miss it because I wanted to.

270
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:57,081
It was because my flight was delayed.

271
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:00,651
WHY WASN'T KANG SE-RI AT
DOKGO JIN'S PREMIERE?

272
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:18,970
Jae-seok!

273
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:22,172
Sorry, please let them have
their meal in peace.

274
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,541
I'm sorry.

275
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:31,253
I think they took enough pictures.
You can stop now.

276
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,750
I missed your premiere,

277
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:39,861
so we should at least get photos taken
of us having a meal together

278
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:41,885
to show we're still a couple.

279
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,860
Thanks for all your hard work.

280
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:45,803
We don't have to do this much longer.

281
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:47,934
I wouldn't mind leaving our relationship

282
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,370
the way it is while you're in Hollywood.

283
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:57,344
The steak is bad, isn't it?

284
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:01,353
The cook missed the right timing
and kept it on the fire,

285
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:03,017
ruining the meat.

286
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,793
So as we agreed beforehand,

287
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,219
we're going to break up naturally,
after I leave for the States.

288
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:11,759
Get the facts straight.

289
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:13,694
We broke up a year ago,

290
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,189
and we're just revealing that now.

291
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,896
Hey, it's Kang Se-ri.

292
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,643
The celebrity Kang Se-ri.
Don't you know her?

293
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,209
I don't know much about celebrities.

294
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,178
Where are you?

295
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,084
I told you not to go to the bathroom
since I won't take long!

296
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,223
She's really pretty.

297
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:41,251
What are you looking at?

298
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,388
Her pelvis.

299
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,430
Her butt?

300
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:48,828
Women who wear high heels like that

301
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:51,597
have a high risk of having
an uneven figure

302
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:54,303
due to unstable the center of balance
and distortion of the feet.

303
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,000
That's what happened to her pelvis.

304
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:01,210
So you're saying she has an uneven butt?

305
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:02,773
You should be careful, too.

306
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:04,938
High heels are dangerous.

307
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,410
I saw you coming in,

308
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:09,405
and it seemed like you have
a more imbalanced pelvis than her.

309
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,448
We're on a blind date,

310
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,820
and you're criticizing me for having
an uneven butt right now?

311
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:18,187
No. If your symptoms get worse,

312
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:19,957
it could lead to lordosis,

313
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:22,625
-and your back would ache--
-Mr. Yun Pil-joo!

314
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,655
You're an oriental medicine doctor, right?

315
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:29,267
Stop giving medical treatment
and let's continue our date.

316
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:38,478
Thank you, my artist.

317
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:48,445
It's Dokgo Jin.

318
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:52,362
Grandpa, it's Dokgo Jin.

319
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:55,564
-Tasty milk, GT.
-This tastes delicious.

320
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:57,927
He's doing that commercial again.

321
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:01,433
His father must be really proud.

322
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:05,301
Grandpa, my aunt is a celebrity, too.

323
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,940
Why doesn't she do commercials like that?

324
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:08,635
It's not because she doesn't want to.

325
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:12,014
She just can't because
she has a bad reputation.

326
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:13,177
What does that mean?

327
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:15,945
It means she's not favored
among the public.

328
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:17,254
What does "favored" mean, then?

329
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,650
Looking nice like that,

330
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:23,992
and doing lots of commercials
to earn lots of money.

331
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:25,219
I see.

332
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:26,894
-We're here.
-We're here.

333
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,389
-You're back.
-Hello.

334
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:31,625
Did you have fun today?

335
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,566
Auntie, why can't you do commercials
like that

336
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:38,495
because of your bad reputation?

337
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,368
Hey!

338
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,342
Gosh.

339
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,310
Hyeong-gyu, I told you not to sit
so close to the TV.

340
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:49,879
Go sit over there.
I told you to watch from far away.

341
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:53,292
Your eyes are going to get bad.
Sit back here.

342
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,950
Sit over there.

343
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,328
Our huge TV doesn't suit our small house.

344
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:04,064
You're right.

345
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:05,803
Right.

346
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:09,774
Why is there such a huge TV
in this small house?

347
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:12,165
That's right.
You started a DVD room business but failed

348
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:13,737
and this is all that was left.

349
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:20,481
You should've brought a smaller TV
instead of this one.

350
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:23,482
It makes our house look even smaller.

351
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:28,319
The treadmill and the exercise bike
take up the most room.

352
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:30,264
You shouldn't have brought them here

353
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:33,232
after your gym went out of business.

354
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:37,132
Before that, I shouldn't have
helped you open them in the first place.

355
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,447
DAILY MEAL

356
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:32,124
FIGHTER RECEIVES A BAD REVIEW FROM CRITICS

357
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:35,754
DOKGO JIN'S MOVIE FIGHTER WAS OVERRATED

358
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:41,989
FIGHTER WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT

359
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,760
-It was really boring.
-It's a boring movie.

360
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,199
-It was so boring.
-So lame.

361
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:46,603
When will Dokgo Jin do real acting?

362
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:48,325
It was fun watching his face,

363
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,070
-but it made me yawn.
-It's a waste of money.

364
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:51,595
Forget about going to Hollywood.

365
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,940
-Why did Dokgo Jin...
-It's so boring.

366
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:56,336
-Make some more effort.
-It was so boring.

367
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,598
DOKGO JIN

368
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:31,841
Okay, Peter Jason.

369
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:35,182
I'm relying on you now.

370
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:41,017
Eating jajangmyeon on a roller coaster!

371
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,694
FAIL

372
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:47,426
I could've eaten all that
if it hadn't gotten all mushy.

373
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:50,302
Right, that was way too much
for one person.

374
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:54,069
Hello, Candies are here.

375
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:55,232
You know Candies, right?

376
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:02,406
Hi, girls.

377
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:06,181
Why don't you say hi? We're acquaintances.

378
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:08,548
-Do you know her?
-Who is she?

379
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,020
Greeting your seniors
will get them to like you,

380
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:13,592
and it will help your career, too.

381
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,919
We met several times, didn't we?

382
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:19,756
Come on, say hi to her.

383
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,655
-Hello.
-Hello.

384
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:23,327
-Hi.
-Okay, let's go.

385
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:24,855
Come on.

386
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,899
Are you trying to discipline them
since you're their senior?

387
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:35,208
You were the same at that age.

388
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:47,846
Mr. Jang still looks at you with hatred.

389
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:49,486
It's because he thinks

390
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:51,594
I'm the reason our group broke apart.

391
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:53,587
Well then,

392
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,956
let me tell you your schedule
for today, my artist.

393
00:24:58,463 --> 00:25:02,003
You have a radio show this afternoon.

394
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,540
That's it.

395
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:08,339
That's simple.

396
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:13,881
Then let's go do my one and only schedule
with perfection.

397
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,780
Hey, this is the scarf you got
with Jenny's help, right?

398
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,394
Wow, a designer brand item

399
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:23,893
really makes you look more elegant.

400
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:25,755
Radio shows these days also record you
on camera,

401
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:27,564
so you have to wear designer items.

402
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:30,796
I have return this later
so I have to be careful

403
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,102
not to get it dirty.

404
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:36,429
-How much does it cost?
-It's really expensive.

405
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:38,641
Wow, the texture is so amazing.

406
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:40,814
Are you okay?

407
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,642
-Gosh.
-It's Dokgo Jin!

408
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:45,179
I enjoyed your movie, Fighter.

409
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,511
I mean, I saw the trailer.

410
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,420
-I'll make sure to watch it.
-All right.

411
00:25:58,256 --> 00:25:59,286
Can I shake your hand?

412
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:03,898
His scarf!

413
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:05,832
Hey, Ae-jeong.

414
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:08,768
He's wearing the same scarf as yours.

415
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:09,937
What?

416
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:14,071
Awesome.

417
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:17,107
-He's so cool.
-He's so cool.

418
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:20,981
Put that over there.

419
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,415
Hey.

420
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,924
Is this something anyone can wear?

421
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:29,186
It's a limited edition.

422
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:30,664
"Limited edition"?

423
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:32,319
It seems like anyone can wear it.

424
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:43,001
My makeup is nice, and I brushed my teeth.

425
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:48,742
Something is missing...

426
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:50,577
My scarf!

427
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:00,988
This is terrible.

428
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:03,146
What do I do? I'm in huge trouble.

429
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:05,362
What do I do?

430
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:08,559
Gosh.

431
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:10,603
What should I do?

432
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:13,572
You should have been careful
while in the bathroom.

433
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:14,932
What if they tell me to buy this?

434
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,800
A celebrity was wearing it
to promote it on a show.

435
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:20,843
They'll let it slide,
it's not that serious.

436
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:22,335
I'm not some top celebrity!

437
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:24,577
They'll only let something like this slide

438
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:25,883
if it's a popular celebrity.

439
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:32,883
Ae-jeong.

440
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,018
If it's a top celebrity
who made the mistake,

441
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:37,656
they'll let it slide, right?

442
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,461
A top celebrity like Dokgo Jin?

443
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:47,128
VIP DRESSING ROOM

444
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:04,651
No, again.

445
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:13,633
Go, I'll keep watch.

446
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:20,898
It's really the same scarf.

447
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:23,297
Hide this...

448
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:36,778
You're a top celebrity, so you'll be
forgiven for everything, right?

449
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:39,575
You're the top celebrity, Dokgo Jin.

450
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:41,822
Good luck.

451
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,390
Mr. Dokgo! Wait a minute!

452
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,630
Mr. Dokgo!

453
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:51,964
Mr. Dokgo!

454
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:53,533
Wait, I...

455
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:55,966
I'm a fan of yours.

456
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:57,768
Can I get an autograph?

457
00:28:57,836 --> 00:28:59,296
He needs to get ready, maybe next time.

458
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,810
No, wait. Just one autograph, please?

459
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:03,243
-Jae-seok.
-Yes?

460
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:14,994
-You said you wanted an autograph.
-Oh, yes.

461
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:17,017
Where should I sign?

462
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:18,615
Well, it's...

463
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,060
I...

464
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:22,389
Here.

465
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:24,731
-What do I do?
-Where?

466
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:34,214
Happy?

467
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:36,706
-Can I take a photo, too?
-Sorry.

468
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,205
-Sorry.
-Mr. Dokgo!

469
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,606
Please, just one photo. Mr. Dokgo!

470
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:43,845
Mr. Dokgo, just one photo...

471
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:47,453
You can get one if you come back later.

472
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,764
All right, why don't you go now?

473
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:54,363
-Bye. You can get another autograph later.
-Okay.

474
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:55,585
Sorry. Bye.

475
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,503
There are so many weird people.

476
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:04,169
Why don't you talk about the time

477
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:07,466
you ruptured your eardrum while practicing
for the action scene in the movie?

478
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:09,639
I told you I don't want to mention that.

479
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:11,707
Getting hurt during a shoot
isn't something to brag about.

480
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:12,706
Why?

481
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:16,047
People will think you really did your best
and like you more.

482
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:19,224
I can act nice,
but I don't want to act like I'm hurt.

483
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:21,724
That's not acting, you really got injured.

484
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:22,786
Never mind.

485
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:26,457
Why aren't there any questions about
that film with Peter Jason?

486
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:27,994
It used to be in the list of questions.

487
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,534
Well...

488
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:34,934
Rumors already spread
about me going to Hollywood.

489
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,569
Isn't that what people would be
the most curious about?

490
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:40,465
It's not something you necessarily need
to talk about.

491
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:41,668
What?

492
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:44,477
Did you tell them to take out
that question?

493
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:46,682
-Can't we talk about that after--
-Why?

494
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,820
I don't think you're going to film
that movie with Peter Jason.

495
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:04,228
Do you think that
or do you know it for sure?

496
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,830
-Kim Jae-seok.
-Yes, sir.

497
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:09,502
Did I really get rejected?

498
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:12,538
Did I get rejected by Peter Jason?

499
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:16,065
I thought it was almost confirmed.
What happened?

500
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:18,611
I even sent him that expensive wine.

501
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,750
He drank all that and just rejected me?

502
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,217
-Why did he do that?
-Wine?

503
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:26,923
So he even sent a bribe.

504
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:30,221
I guess he thought the language barrier
would be a problem.

505
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:33,185
-So a different Asian actor was chosen.
-Who?

506
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:35,631
The actor Wang Ryun, from China.

507
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:37,661
His native tongue is English.

508
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:39,833
So it's because he's bad at English.

509
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,628
So you mean I was pushed aside
by Wang Ryun

510
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,940
and rejected by Peter

511
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:46,436
because I'm not good at English?

512
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:57,219
Ms. Moon and I decided we would delay
mentioning this

513
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:59,252
-to the press for a while.
-Get out.

514
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:01,847
-Are you okay?
-I'm not okay, so get out.

515
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:04,324
Do you want me to ditch the recording?

516
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:05,919
All right, I'm leaving.

517
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:08,294
You should calm down before you begin.

518
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:13,527
Damn it.

519
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:35,587
Dokgo Jin showed off about
going to Hollywood. Look at him now!

520
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:44,901
He lost his role
because he's bad at English.

521
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,103
-He should've studied more.
-It was a delusion from the start.

522
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:49,325
He lost his role to Wang Ryun.
He's a disgrace to our country.

523
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,100
Why don't you study a bit?

524
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:17,259
There were so many articles
saying he was going to Hollywood.

525
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:19,326
But it seems he failed.

526
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:24,165
I guess he isn't forgiven for everything
just because he's a top celebrity.

527
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:27,935
Oh, my gosh.

528
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,205
Who are you?

529
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:37,723
Hello, Mr. Dokgo.

530
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,590
Who are you?

531
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:44,415
I was just passing by,
and I saw a sign on the door

532
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:47,759
saying it was your dressing room.

533
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,359
I'm a fan of yours.

534
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:51,827
I'm a fan, and my nephew is a fan, too.

535
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,570
So I wanted to get an autograph...

536
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:58,403
But you don't seem to be in a good mood,
so I'll just ask for one later.

537
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:00,606
-Sorry about this.
-Hold on.

538
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:05,711
Where should I sign? Here?

539
00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:18,922
That's...

540
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:21,061
Are you crazy?

541
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:22,485
Don't! Goodness!

542
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:24,934
My knee.

543
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:31,137
Do you know how expensive this is?

544
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:33,966
How could you do this on this scarf?

545
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:35,068
What's wrong with you?

546
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:37,613
You said you wanted an autograph.
What's with you?

547
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:40,335
When did I ask you to sign it here?

548
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:41,881
Do you know how much this costs?

549
00:34:41,946 --> 00:34:45,716
How could you do something like that
on such an expensive scarf?

550
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:48,617
What kind of autograph is this, anyway?

551
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:51,916
It's just a stupid triangle!

552
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:55,357
And this is a permanent pen!
I won't even be able to wash it off.

553
00:34:58,763 --> 00:34:59,833
Can I shake your hand?

554
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:06,035
You're the "anyone" that I saw earlier.

555
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:08,108
What did you say?

556
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:12,682
It's the same one, right?

557
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:14,384
Take this and leave.

558
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:18,646
I don't want to wear something
anyone can wear around anyway.

559
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:19,746
So just take that.

560
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:25,163
But if you just switch this with mine--

561
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:27,193
It's fine. Just go.

562
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:35,532
What?

563
00:35:35,766 --> 00:35:37,566
Stop hanging around and go away.

564
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:42,712
How dare you lean on this.

565
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,910
Stop hanging around and go away.

566
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:52,452
All right.

567
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:54,594
Go and throw this away, too.

568
00:35:58,222 --> 00:35:59,462
Go throw this away.

569
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,004
Kim Jae-seok!

570
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:06,499
Kim Jae-seok!

571
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:13,096
Kim Jae-seok!

572
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:14,971
Jae-seok!

573
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:18,978
What else do you want?

574
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:22,614
This is your autograph, right?

575
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,180
-So what?
-Then, this too?

576
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:37,957
That's my autograph.

577
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:39,902
You want to know who I am?

578
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:42,772
Try and guess.

579
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:45,644
I got you.

580
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:49,041
So it was you, Dokgo Jin.

581
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:54,046
I found you easily enough
since we're working in the same field.

582
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:57,152
What are you going to do? I've caught you.

583
00:36:57,615 --> 00:36:59,015
So what are you going to do about it?

584
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,153
Are you going to
post something online or what?

585
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,719
If you're scared of things like that,
you should apologize first.

586
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:08,357
So you like stuff like that.

587
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:15,026
Then listen to my apology.

588
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:18,297
I was rude to you that day.

589
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:19,743
I'm...

590
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:24,784
really sorry.

591
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,580
That was a really proper apology.

592
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:31,483
Is that enough for an apology?

593
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,559
Well, I have nothing to say
since you apologized like that.

594
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:39,793
Also,

595
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,828
that was a mistake I made,
misunderstanding your request.

596
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:45,828
You'll forgive me, right?

597
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:47,404
This?

598
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:49,732
Sure, I will.

599
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:53,474
Then I get that you're forgiving me.

600
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:56,713
Yes.

601
00:37:57,375 --> 00:38:00,175
So I'll take back my scarf.

602
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:08,894
You're taking this back?

603
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:12,724
It's mine. Let go.

604
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,930
Let go.

605
00:38:18,162 --> 00:38:19,862
-Let go of this.
-No.

606
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,039
Let go.

607
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:37,384
If you don't let go,
it's going to get risky.

608
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:46,116
Fine, don't let go then.

609
00:38:57,868 --> 00:39:01,138
This is actually something I really like.

610
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:04,309
Well, then. I have a recording to go to,

611
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:05,975
so bye.

612
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:08,611
Hey...

613
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:12,949
What? What happened?

614
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:15,785
What's up with him?

615
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,291
Jae-seok!

616
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:25,564
There are many text messages already.

617
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:27,829
Let's begin with a story from Park Mi-jin.

618
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:29,098
Alright, I'll read the story.

619
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,200
My husband prepared a present

620
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:33,538
for our first wedding anniversary.

621
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:36,144
It was a 55-inch TV for our living room.

622
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:38,537
Who is this present really for?

623
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:41,646
We had a huge fight
and I cut all the TV cords.

624
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:43,809
Men are always like this.

625
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:46,875
We'd be satisfied with something
small and shiny, right?

626
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:48,691
They really have no clue about women.

627
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:52,156
We'll be back after listening to a song.

628
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,263
It's a request from Jung Soo-kyung.

629
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:55,685
"Chococat" by Ibadi.

630
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:58,796
When the song ends, the DJ and guest
will have a talk session.

631
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:02,004
-You can rest during the song.
-Okay.

632
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,080
-Go.
-Gu Ae-jeong.

633
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,846
I watched you as the song was playing.

634
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:24,685
That autograph on your scarf,
isn't it Dokgo Jin's?

635
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:26,489
How did you know?

636
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:29,287
I'm a huge fan of Dokgo Jin.

637
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,330
-Are you a fan too?
-No, I don't really...

638
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:37,471
I mean, a friend of mine is a fan,

639
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:39,195
and she asked me for his autograph.

640
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,810
I was on my way to the studio

641
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:44,676
and I ran into him,
so I got his autograph.

642
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:48,153
Dokgo Jin, thank you so much.

643
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:52,447
I guess you two are pretty close, then.

644
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:57,815
We're just colleagues, you know.

645
00:40:57,888 --> 00:41:01,688
What did he seem like in person?

646
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:04,263
He's not really the same

647
00:41:04,328 --> 00:41:07,328
as what people know him to be like.

648
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:11,695
What you see of him in the media
isn't really what he's like.

649
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:13,969
Really? What is he really like, then?

650
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:17,908
Honestly, the Dokgo Jin I saw in person

651
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:22,880
is someone really rude,
who talks roughly to people.

652
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:26,277
He bosses everyone around,

653
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:29,954
and he has no manners at all.

654
00:41:30,187 --> 00:41:32,257
He just does anything he wants to.

655
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:34,560
So to put it simply,

656
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:36,959
he's a total asshole.

657
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:41,233
What? "Asshole"?

658
00:41:41,298 --> 00:41:43,898
-How dare she say that?
-How could she say that to a colleague?

659
00:41:44,134 --> 00:41:45,504
SHE IS SO ANNOYING
GO TO HELL

660
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:49,569
What is that?

661
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:51,911
What is this?

662
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:54,476
-How can she say that?
-Who is she to say that?

663
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:56,605
-What's wrong with her?
-How ridiculous.

664
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,120
-What's wrong with her?
-I can't believe it.

665
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,223
What's up with her?

666
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:02,194
-Who is she to say that?
-What's wrong with her?

667
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:03,953
-Unbelievable.
-What did you just say?

668
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:05,891
-That was so harsh.
-She's so annoying.

669
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:08,056
Just leave this planet.

670
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:09,985
Gosh.

671
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,700
-Get lost!
-Get lost.

672
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:14,872
What is Gu Ae-jeong
saying about Dokgo Jin?

673
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:20,441
So what is Dokgo Jin really like?

674
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:21,914
What did you mean, exactly?

675
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:27,648
The truth is, Dokgo Jin
ruptured his eardrum

676
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:30,178
while filming his recent work.

677
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:33,218
The movie Fighter, that's releasing soon.

678
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:34,554
He got injured

679
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:37,288
while learning martial arts for the film.

680
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:39,491
Despite that, he kept shooting.

681
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:43,557
But if news about his injury got out,

682
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:45,597
fans could get worried about him,

683
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:49,203
so he asked his manager not to tell anyone

684
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:51,496
about what happened.

685
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:55,539
So you see,
he's really not an honest person.

686
00:42:57,207 --> 00:42:58,637
DOKGO JIN EARDRUM RUPTURE

687
00:42:58,709 --> 00:42:59,909
DOKGO JIN SCARF AUTOGRAPH

688
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:01,247
GU AE-JEONG

689
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:02,282
This is amazing!

690
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:05,016
How long has it been
since you were one of the top searches?

691
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,352
The responses are that good?

692
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:09,947
Of course, Dokgo Jin's fans
are totally praising you.

693
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,020
Really?

694
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,559
Ae-jeong.

695
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:16,763
Guess who I listened to
that radio show with?

696
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:17,697
Who?

697
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,731
Producer Jang of Quiz to Change the World!

698
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:21,967
We were listening to it
while eating in the cafeteria.

699
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:22,929
So?

700
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,570
You're going to be on that show tomorrow!

701
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:29,408
-What? Really?
-Yes!

702
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,540
One of the guests couldn't come tomorrow,

703
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,279
so I mentioned you,

704
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:36,511
-and he asked for you right away!
-Are you serious?

705
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:40,318
I thought I was having a really bad day,
but I'm getting so lucky!

706
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:41,494
Right?

707
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:44,615
You know how guests call other celebrities
during the show?

708
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:46,118
I said you could call Dokgo Jin.

709
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:47,734
What?

710
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:50,231
You know, they call their friends
and do a quiz.

711
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:53,131
I said you could call Dokgo Jin,
so the producer said you could come.

712
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:54,831
Ae-hwan...

713
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,870
For season one, a sharp-looking lawyer

714
00:43:57,935 --> 00:44:00,695
who is 180cm tall
and earns 300 million won a year.

715
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:02,874
And for season two,
a handsome fund manager

716
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,310
who's 185cm
and earns 400 million won a year.

717
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:07,283
And the man for season three

718
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:10,511
can't seem any lacking
compared to the former guys.

719
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:13,981
I know, but where do we find
a guy like that?

720
00:44:14,051 --> 00:44:15,351
We have to find one no matter what.

721
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:17,686
Everything from looks, height, education,

722
00:44:17,755 --> 00:44:19,755
career, family background, and wealth.

723
00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:20,687
COUPLE MAKING

724
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:22,628
We have to find the perfect man

725
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:26,660
who is superior to the men
from the previous seasons in every aspect.

726
00:44:29,933 --> 00:44:31,203
-Hello.
-Hello.

727
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:32,598
Hello.

728
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:37,067
Dr. Yun, your mother is waiting for you.

729
00:44:42,413 --> 00:44:44,983
-Hi.
-Pil-joo.

730
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:47,522
Where were you?

731
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:48,948
What's this?

732
00:44:49,586 --> 00:44:51,116
You were at
the medicinal herb market again?

733
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:59,399
Mr. Kim got these ox bezoars.

734
00:45:00,264 --> 00:45:02,574
With this size, it would've cost
over 100 million won.

735
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:03,833
He specifically asked

736
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:06,301
for you to make them into pills.

737
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:09,340
But doesn't Mr. Kim go to
my uncle's hospital?

738
00:45:09,406 --> 00:45:10,766
I got him to give them to you.

739
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:14,079
You must be busy lobbying people

740
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:16,014
while playing golf
and attending gatherings.

741
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,880
If you know how hard I'm working,

742
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:20,619
stop hanging around the market

743
00:45:20,684 --> 00:45:23,894
and meeting ginseng diggers
at Jiri Mountain.

744
00:45:23,954 --> 00:45:27,124
You promised you won't meddle in my work
if I went to all those blind dates.

745
00:45:27,191 --> 00:45:28,331
But there are no results.

746
00:45:28,792 --> 00:45:32,062
I heard you told the last girl
that you're closing down the hospital

747
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:34,099
to go study in China.

748
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:37,301
I'll look for a great doctor
who can run the hospital

749
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:38,497
just as you want it.

750
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,739
And you're going to go to China?

751
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:44,112
You can't go. Never!

752
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:46,879
It's not that I can't go.

753
00:45:47,644 --> 00:45:48,854
I'm just not going.

754
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:51,379
I'm not letting anyone say
that I got rejected by Peter.

755
00:45:51,448 --> 00:45:54,948
We have to say that I rejected him
because I wanted to do another piece.

756
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:57,222
First, we have to have something confirmed

757
00:45:57,287 --> 00:45:59,187
to work on instead of Peter's movie.

758
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:00,256
Jae-seok.

759
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:04,264
Find a decent program to do
within this month.

760
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:06,228
Why don't you just say
it's because of your injury?

761
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:09,374
-Since people know about your eardrum.
-What?

762
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,340
-How do they know that?
-Weren't you the one who said it?

763
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:16,136
There were posts all over the internet
after Gu Ae-jeong mentioned it.

764
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:18,576
-Who's Gu Ae-jeong?
-It says here that

765
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:21,282
you two are close friends
who show your real selves.

766
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:22,705
I don't have friends like that.

767
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,620
Who's Gu Ae-jeong?

768
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:27,917
GU AE-JEONG

769
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:29,115
That's Gu Ae-jeong.

770
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:33,158
-This is Gu Ae-jeong?
-So you do know her.

771
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:36,793
Well, I do, but she has
absolutely nothing to do with me.

772
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,730
-Who is she?
-Don't you know National Treasure Girls?

773
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:40,196
It was a girl group.

774
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:43,301
Se-ri was a member, too.

775
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:45,841
She did something like that?

776
00:46:45,903 --> 00:46:47,273
You've been a couple for over a year,

777
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:49,107
but you hardly know anything about her.

778
00:46:49,606 --> 00:46:53,506
Anyway, what is this
"National Treasure Girls"?

779
00:46:54,044 --> 00:46:56,614
Everyone was crazy
about the World Cup in 2002.

780
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:00,180
But in 2001, everyone was crazy
about the National Treasure Girls.

781
00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:03,051
NATIONAL TREASURE GIRLS,
NATIONAL POPULARITY

782
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,760
Jenny, Ae-jeong, Se-ri, Mi-na.

783
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:06,959
All four members were popular,

784
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,934
but Gu Ae-jeong was the most popular.

785
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,304
And the youngest member was Kang Se-ri.

786
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:14,530
But...

787
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:16,528
NATIONAL TREASURE GIRLS' SUDDEN DISBANDING

788
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,000
After about a year and a half,

789
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:20,268
-Our disbanding...
-they suddenly disbanded at their peak.

790
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:22,207
-We're very sorry.
-There were all kinds of rumors

791
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:23,772
about them fighting or getting pregnant.

792
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:25,537
They were chaotic.

793
00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:30,375
After that, Gu Ae-jeong released
a solo album

794
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:31,577
but it was a total failure.

795
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:33,048
GU AE-JEONG'S LOVE TRIANGLE SCANDAL

796
00:47:33,116 --> 00:47:36,616
Then there was a huge scandal
about her and someone who had a fiancée.

797
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,420
And then a drunk assault scandal.

798
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:41,759
-Give us a comment.
-I have nothing to say.

799
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:43,132
-Gu Ae-jeong!
-Gu Ae-jeong!

800
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:45,463
There was lots of gossip saying
she was a mistress of a Yakuza,

801
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:48,329
or that she had a sponsor's baby,
all kinds of stuff like that.

802
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:51,496
Now she's just a celebrity
with a bad reputation.

803
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:54,169
She's a nobody in this field.

804
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:55,738
GU AE-JEONG'S GOSSIP RUINS HER REPUTATION

805
00:47:56,006 --> 00:47:57,666
A Yakuza sponsor?

806
00:47:58,642 --> 00:48:01,612
I don't even think she could have one.

807
00:48:01,678 --> 00:48:05,078
Anyway, I see she's hit rock bottom now.

808
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:08,286
What's going on between
you and her anyway?

809
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:09,922
There's nothing going on.

810
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:13,360
Then why did you tell her you ruptured
your eardrum during the shooting?

811
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:15,033
Why would I ever tell her that?

812
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:19,527
She really is strange.

813
00:48:20,297 --> 00:48:22,897
She was hanging around my van
and dressing room.

814
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,102
I thought

815
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:29,008
she seemed suspicious.

816
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:32,943
Then did she overhear our conversation
in front of the dressing room?

817
00:48:33,977 --> 00:48:35,247
Maybe.

818
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:39,248
What if

819
00:48:40,217 --> 00:48:42,317
she also heard about Peter Jason?

820
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:44,116
No way.

821
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:48,132
Jae-seok. Find out her phone number.

822
00:48:56,466 --> 00:48:57,866
PLUTO

823
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:09,475
Don't worry.

824
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,620
I'll sell this at an auction site
if I have to.

825
00:49:13,016 --> 00:49:14,716
Dokgo Jin has a lot of fans.

826
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,145
Someone will be willing to buy this.

827
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:17,319
Really?

828
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:20,015
I'd be really thankful.

829
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:22,630
But what are you going to do?

830
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:25,563
If you can't call Dokgo Jin on the show,

831
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:28,496
the producer will think you were lying
and dislike you.

832
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:31,095
I know. What do I do?

833
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:32,868
Don't you even have his number?

834
00:49:32,936 --> 00:49:35,306
If I do, I'd have called him already.

835
00:49:39,042 --> 00:49:40,042
Hello?

836
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:42,445
Who is this?

837
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,651
Who? Dokgo Jin?

838
00:49:46,249 --> 00:49:47,319
What?

839
00:49:49,753 --> 00:49:52,263
Are you really Dokgo Jin?

840
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,430
Why is there food here?

841
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:04,101
I'm buying, so help yourself.

842
00:50:05,102 --> 00:50:06,842
I have a favor to ask, so...

843
00:50:06,903 --> 00:50:08,373
-What?
-Well...

844
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,909
Why don't we talk when we brighten up
after eating...

845
00:50:10,974 --> 00:50:13,344
Eating that won't brighten up anything,
so just say it now.

846
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:17,914
It's a bit weird to be
asking you this, but...

847
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:22,453
Do you know the speed quiz
in the program Quiz to Change the World?

848
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:25,993
Do you mean that variety show?

849
00:50:26,056 --> 00:50:28,686
Yes. I'm going to be in that show.

850
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,399
And for that speed quiz,

851
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:34,902
we call celebrities we're close to

852
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:36,525
and get them to answer a quiz.

853
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:38,297
-Could you--
-No.

854
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:40,898
I know what you're asking for,
and I don't even want to hear it.

855
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:42,011
Can't you just do it?

856
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:43,772
-No.
-Just once, please.

857
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,810
It's just a phone call,
only your voice will be recorded.

858
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,436
I'm Dokgo Jin.

859
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:49,981
You're not at the level
to ask me stuff like that.

860
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,420
Are you an idiot?
Why are you so shameless?

861
00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:55,122
Try to understand that I'm so desperate
I have to be shameless.

862
00:50:56,787 --> 00:51:00,057
You sent Peter Jason that expensive wine
because you wanted to be in his movie,

863
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:02,033
so you'll know how I feel.

864
00:51:05,429 --> 00:51:06,829
How do you know that?

865
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:08,474
Gu Ae-jeong.

866
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:09,802
You heard what my manager and I

867
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:12,497
said in the dressing room, right?

868
00:51:13,804 --> 00:51:16,314
You heard it and talked about it
on the radio, right?

869
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:20,875
-How much did you hear?
-I heard everything.

870
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:23,411
But I really didn't mean to--

871
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,510
Never mind!

872
00:51:25,849 --> 00:51:26,849
Stop!

873
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:34,785
Listen to me carefully.

874
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:40,059
If you ever say anything about Peter Jason
to anyone else,

875
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:42,800
I'm going to sue you. Got that?

876
00:51:46,136 --> 00:51:47,536
I won't.

877
00:51:47,971 --> 00:51:50,011
How could I tell people
you got pushed aside by Wang Ryun

878
00:51:50,073 --> 00:51:53,643
and that you even gave Peter Jason
expensive wine as a bribe,

879
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:56,710
but you still got rejected anyway?

880
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,620
I would never say that.

881
00:51:59,883 --> 00:52:00,853
Okay.

882
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:05,357
But no matter how hard
you try to cover that up,

883
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:07,292
people will find out eventually,

884
00:52:07,357 --> 00:52:09,527
and it will just get exaggerated,

885
00:52:09,593 --> 00:52:11,903
making you a laughingstock.

886
00:52:12,195 --> 00:52:14,925
It's better to just reveal it right away
and get it over with.

887
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:21,608
Are you trying to give me advice

888
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:24,072
since you're working in the same field?

889
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:32,476
Then let me ask you one thing.

890
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:35,490
Gu Ae-jeong, are you really

891
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:39,061
a mistress of a Yakuza?

892
00:52:40,223 --> 00:52:41,633
Did you have a sponsor's baby?

893
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:44,229
Why aren't you saying anything?

894
00:52:44,594 --> 00:52:46,364
It's better to tell the truth right away.

895
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:48,630
Or else things will get exaggerated

896
00:52:48,698 --> 00:52:51,328
and you'll just become a laughingstock.

897
00:52:53,703 --> 00:52:56,543
I forgot you're already a laughingstock.

898
00:53:04,948 --> 00:53:06,018
You're right!

899
00:53:08,552 --> 00:53:10,352
I am a Yakuza's mistress.

900
00:53:11,621 --> 00:53:13,021
You know what the Yakuza is, right?

901
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:16,987
There's a huge dragon on my honey's back.

902
00:53:17,794 --> 00:53:20,304
So you better watch yourself
in front of me.

903
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:23,434
If you act like such a jerk again,

904
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,070
the next time...

905
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:27,439
Be careful.

906
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:29,872
Do you get what I'm saying?

907
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:31,810
Mr. Asshole?

908
00:53:32,275 --> 00:53:34,105
Pay the bill, Mr. Asshole.

909
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:44,652
NATIONAL TREASURE GIRLS

910
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:50,230
So that vulgar woman was really a singer.

911
00:53:53,763 --> 00:53:56,473
"HEARTBEAT"

912
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:12,323
FANS SAY THEY DON'T BELIEVE
GU AE-JEONG'S EXPLANATION

913
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:17,594
Gu Ae-jeong, are you really
a mistress of a Yakuza?

914
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:35,371
What's up with this?

915
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:43,011
What's wrong with me?

916
00:54:55,558 --> 00:54:57,688
QUIZ TO CHANGE THE WORLD

917
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:07,742
Fifteen minutes before recording.
Start the final check.

918
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:09,744
Number one, okay.

919
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:11,776
Number two has a bit of buzzing.

920
00:55:11,841 --> 00:55:13,141
Check it.

921
00:55:13,209 --> 00:55:14,639
Number three, okay.

922
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:17,910
Gu Ae-jeong.

923
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:20,648
Please give us Dokgo Jin's number
to call later.

924
00:55:22,118 --> 00:55:23,318
Dokgo Jin's number?

925
00:55:23,386 --> 00:55:26,216
You said you were doing the speed quiz
with Dokgo Jin, right?

926
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:28,090
Well...

927
00:55:29,025 --> 00:55:33,195
Is it okay if I call someone else
instead of Dokgo Jin?

928
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:37,270
I'll call Jenny, she was the leader
of National Treasure Girls.

929
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:38,674
She's really good at quizzes.

930
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:40,865
This isn't a quiz show,
it's a variety show.

931
00:55:41,805 --> 00:55:44,465
Why? Did Dokgo Jin say he won't do it?

932
00:55:44,908 --> 00:55:48,478
You know, his film is releasing soon.

933
00:55:48,545 --> 00:55:51,715
I think he's really busy going around
promoting the film.

934
00:55:53,483 --> 00:55:54,953
He wants to promote his film on the show?

935
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:56,548
All right. After the quiz,

936
00:55:56,619 --> 00:55:58,519
you can mention the film.

937
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:00,692
And give us the phone number.

938
00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:03,828
Well...

939
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:06,731
QUIZ TO CHANGE THE WORLD

940
00:56:14,738 --> 00:56:17,708
MR. ASSHOLE

941
00:56:19,576 --> 00:56:21,106
What should I do? I'm in huge trouble.

942
00:56:31,688 --> 00:56:33,988
None of them are appealing.

943
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,234
That one seems okay, try reading it.

944
00:56:38,795 --> 00:56:44,825
If I go meet Peter Jason again and beg...

945
00:56:48,972 --> 00:56:50,542
No.

946
00:56:51,975 --> 00:56:54,605
I would never do such a shameless thing.

947
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:57,875
I guess you really were desperate

948
00:56:58,214 --> 00:57:00,684
to film Peter's movie.

949
00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:04,552
Forget it, I wasn't that desperate.

950
00:57:13,196 --> 00:57:14,696
GU AE-JEONG

951
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:17,998
Goodness, she really is shameless.

952
00:57:23,673 --> 00:57:24,713
What is it?

953
00:57:25,308 --> 00:57:27,508
Dokgo Jin, I'm at
the broadcast station right now.

954
00:57:28,378 --> 00:57:31,478
We're going to begin the speed quiz soon,

955
00:57:31,881 --> 00:57:33,251
and you're going to get a call

956
00:57:33,316 --> 00:57:35,146
from the studio by a number
that starts with 789.

957
00:57:35,218 --> 00:57:37,548
So, if I don't answer that call,

958
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:40,090
you're going to tell everyone
about what you heard about Peter?

959
00:57:40,156 --> 00:57:41,416
Did you call to blackmail me?

960
00:57:41,491 --> 00:57:43,391
I'm not going to mention that.

961
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:47,400
I was just thinking
that you might empathize with me

962
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:51,074
and understand how I'm feeling right now.

963
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:53,801
I just called to beg you for this favor

964
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:55,510
one last time with desperation.

965
00:57:55,572 --> 00:57:58,142
Okay, fine. Since you called,

966
00:57:58,208 --> 00:58:00,808
I'll listen to how desperate you are.

967
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:02,608
Try begging me.

968
00:58:03,446 --> 00:58:04,476
Okay, begin.

969
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:10,315
If you reject my request about you
answering that phone call,

970
00:58:11,955 --> 00:58:16,125
I'd feel the same as when you got
rejected by Peter Jason for your role.

971
00:58:17,594 --> 00:58:20,964
I hope you understood
my feeling of desperation.

972
00:58:21,598 --> 00:58:22,628
Bye.

973
00:58:36,412 --> 00:58:37,552
Why? Who was it?

974
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:39,024
-It's nothing.
-Okay.

975
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,129
Gu Ae-jeong!

976
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:56,768
We're recording now, hurry up.

977
00:58:56,833 --> 00:58:58,103
All right, I'm going.

978
00:58:58,167 --> 00:59:01,067
Yes, I found her. Sorry.

979
00:59:01,237 --> 00:59:02,507
We're going inside. Sorry.

980
00:59:03,139 --> 00:59:04,139
Hurry up!

981
00:59:08,945 --> 00:59:11,915
The first guest to do the speed quiz

982
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:13,451
is one of the first teen idols,

983
00:59:13,516 --> 00:59:15,246
Gu Ae-jeong of National Treasure Girls.
Welcome.

984
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:17,418
Welcome.

985
00:59:18,121 --> 00:59:20,521
It's been a long time since we saw you.

986
00:59:20,857 --> 00:59:22,787
National Treasure Girls
was really popular.

987
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:24,189
-Of course.
-Right.

988
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:26,230
-Are you guys doing well?
-Yes, we are.

989
00:59:26,329 --> 00:59:27,829
I see.

990
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:30,101
Right.

991
00:59:30,266 --> 00:59:32,236
All right, get ready
for Ae-jeong's phone call.

992
00:59:32,835 --> 00:59:35,435
Yes, that's right. Like that.

993
00:59:35,505 --> 00:59:36,665
Okay, what do you think?

994
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:38,539
-No, that one's better.
-This is awesome.

995
00:59:38,608 --> 00:59:40,938
-Really?
-She's going to call Dokgo Jin today.

996
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:42,250
Dokgo Jin? Wow.

997
00:59:42,312 --> 00:59:43,352
Amazing.

998
00:59:44,013 --> 00:59:45,653
This is probably the best guest

999
00:59:45,715 --> 00:59:47,345
-we've had for the speed quiz.
-Right.

1000
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:48,817
This is great!

1001
00:59:48,885 --> 00:59:51,345
-Hey, that screen
-He's such a famous celebrity.

1002
00:59:52,155 --> 00:59:54,415
is showing what they're filming
in the studio right now, right?

1003
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:55,560
Yes, Se-ri.

1004
00:59:56,359 --> 00:59:59,399
Were Dokgo Jin
and Gu Ae-jeong acquaintances?

1005
00:59:59,462 --> 01:00:01,832
Are you really close to Dokgo Jin?

1006
01:00:01,898 --> 01:00:02,928
Are you close?

1007
01:00:04,667 --> 01:00:07,067
-A little?
-I see.

1008
01:00:07,136 --> 01:00:09,566
Please tell him I want to
get to know him, too.

1009
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:10,809
-I will.
-Okay.

1010
01:00:10,873 --> 01:00:11,943
Me too.

1011
01:00:12,308 --> 01:00:14,608
We'll begin the speed quiz between
Gu Ae-jeong

1012
01:00:14,677 --> 01:00:16,007
and the world star Dokgo Jin.

1013
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:18,109
-Look at the screen and pick a category.
-Right.

1014
01:00:29,392 --> 01:00:30,492
What...

1015
01:00:40,236 --> 01:00:42,206
Okay, we're connecting.
You have 90 seconds.

1016
01:00:42,271 --> 01:00:44,611
I hope you get many right.
All right, we're calling.

1017
01:01:00,123 --> 01:01:01,723
What? He's not answering?

1018
01:01:05,962 --> 01:01:06,962
All right...

1019
01:01:07,964 --> 01:01:10,374
-He's not going to answer right away.
-Time is running out.

1020
01:01:10,433 --> 01:01:12,303
-He's not answering.
-Answer, Dokgo Jin.

1021
01:01:12,368 --> 01:01:14,568
-This is too bad.
-Come on, Dokgo Jin.

1022
01:01:14,637 --> 01:01:16,537
-I guess he really is a world star.
-Pick up.

1023
01:01:16,606 --> 01:01:19,176
-Is this a fail, then?
-Are you sure you're close?

1024
01:01:19,242 --> 01:01:21,742
-I guess you're really not that close.
-Right.

1025
01:01:23,279 --> 01:01:24,309
CEO MOON JIN-YEONG

1026
01:01:53,576 --> 01:01:55,336
-There's no special ringback tone.
-You're right.

1027
01:01:56,512 --> 01:01:58,252
-There isn't much time left.
-A world star...

1028
01:01:58,314 --> 01:02:01,454
If he doesn't pick up soon,
Gu Ae-jeong will fail

1029
01:02:01,517 --> 01:02:03,647
-the speed quiz.
-Is she going to fail?

1030
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,260
I guess he's not going to pick up.

1031
01:02:07,457 --> 01:02:08,457
Hello?

1032
01:02:09,192 --> 01:02:10,192
He picked up!

1033
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:12,300
-He answered. Hurry, the quiz!
-Ask him.

1034
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:13,601
Explain the words.

1035
01:02:13,663 --> 01:02:15,533
Explain the word on the screen.

1036
01:02:15,965 --> 01:02:17,165
Hello?

1037
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:18,603
Hurry!

1038
01:02:18,668 --> 01:02:19,838
Ms. Gu, he picked up.

1039
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:21,402
Explain the word, time is ticking.

1040
01:02:22,805 --> 01:02:24,105
TANGERINE

1041
01:02:24,173 --> 01:02:27,083
It's yellowish, and you peel it
and eat it. It's sour and sweet.

1042
01:02:27,443 --> 01:02:29,313
-A tangerine?
-Good.

1043
01:02:29,612 --> 01:02:32,152
You know the song lyrics?
"Red is apple, apple is delicious,

1044
01:02:32,215 --> 01:02:34,415
-if it's delicious, it's a..."
-Banana.

1045
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:37,786
There are spikes on the top,

1046
01:02:37,854 --> 01:02:39,624
and the exterior is bumpy.

1047
01:02:39,689 --> 01:02:42,929
It's sweet, and it looks like a donut.

1048
01:02:43,459 --> 01:02:45,059
A pineapple?

1049
01:02:45,128 --> 01:02:47,028
We don't have much time. Hurry.

1050
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:48,656
It's red, and...

1051
01:02:49,398 --> 01:02:51,098
There's a seed in it.

1052
01:02:52,401 --> 01:02:54,771
-A plum?
-No, it's not that.

1053
01:02:54,837 --> 01:02:55,907
Not that...

1054
01:02:55,972 --> 01:02:57,972
-It's not the answer.
-Is she stuck?

1055
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:59,780
It seems like she's stuck.
Time is ticking.

1056
01:02:59,842 --> 01:03:01,312
You say "lips like" this!

1057
01:03:02,178 --> 01:03:03,678
-Cherry!
-Yes!

1058
01:03:03,746 --> 01:03:05,516
-They're good.
-It's the title of an erotic film.

1059
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:07,281
"Wild" something.

1060
01:03:08,251 --> 01:03:09,421

He got it.

1062
01:03:11,687 --> 01:03:13,557
What you eat a lot in the summer.

1063
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,293
-Melons.
-No, not that.

1064
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:16,428
Peaches?

1065
01:03:16,659 --> 01:03:18,759
It's red, and there are
black seeds inside.

1066
01:03:19,395 --> 01:03:20,655
-Watermelon!
-Okay!

1067
01:03:20,863 --> 01:03:21,963
He got it.

1068
01:03:22,165 --> 01:03:23,725
It also means "apology" in Korean.

1069
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,200
-Apple!
-Okay!

1070
01:03:26,002 --> 01:03:27,072
Yes!

1071
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:29,266
We use this to tenderize meat.

1072
01:03:29,338 --> 01:03:30,368
Come on.

1073
01:03:32,074 --> 01:03:33,744

1074
01:03:34,277 --> 01:03:36,007
-Pear!
-Yes! Pear.

1075
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:39,854
There's fur on the skin,

1076
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:42,386
and some are green, some are yellow.
"Gold" something.

1077
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:44,619
-Kiwi!
-Right!

1078
01:03:44,687 --> 01:03:46,117
-Ten seconds left.
-It's the last one.

1079
01:03:46,189 --> 01:03:49,089
-It's...
-Come on, hurry.

1080
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:50,928
That thing, your bribe.

1081
01:03:51,761 --> 01:03:53,361
-What? "Bribe"?
-A bribe?

1082
01:03:53,429 --> 01:03:54,959
The bribe you gave to Peter Jason!

1083
01:03:55,031 --> 01:03:56,101
Peter?

1084
01:03:56,933 --> 01:03:58,773
-Oh, the wine.
-What's it made from?

1085
01:03:59,435 --> 01:04:00,695
Grapes!

1086
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:02,670
Yes!

1087
01:04:03,439 --> 01:04:05,909
Yes! I got it!

1088
01:04:07,777 --> 01:04:10,807
-Good job.
-That was amazing.

1089
01:04:11,814 --> 01:04:13,754
That was Gu Ae-jeong and Dokgo Jin's...

1090
01:04:17,053 --> 01:04:18,193
Mr. Dokgo, congratulations.

1091
01:04:18,254 --> 01:04:20,494
It's the first time anyone guessed
all ten words.

1092
01:04:20,723 --> 01:04:22,763
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

1093
01:04:22,825 --> 01:04:24,055
Am I really the first one?

1094
01:04:26,162 --> 01:04:27,632
But Jin,

1095
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:30,027
what was that about your bribe?

1096
01:04:30,099 --> 01:04:34,199
You gave wine as a bribe
to Director Peter Jason?

1097
01:04:44,747 --> 01:04:47,847
Korea's national star actor
Dokgo Jin, good luck!

1098
01:04:48,184 --> 01:04:51,494
The quiz we did today won't be aired.

1099
01:04:51,854 --> 01:04:54,464
Please forgive me, just this once.

1100
01:04:55,424 --> 01:04:56,494
Stop right there!

1101
01:04:58,628 --> 01:05:01,458
People must recognize you
and curse you out on the streets!

1102
01:05:02,832 --> 01:05:04,732
Tell me how much you're worth first.

1103
01:05:05,334 --> 01:05:07,144
I'm worth ten billion won,
can you afford that?

1104
01:05:07,203 --> 01:05:08,503
I’m going to round everyone up.

1105
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:10,011
I'm going to tell them everything.

1106
01:05:10,973 --> 01:05:13,583
Doctor, do you have a girlfriend?

1107
01:05:13,643 --> 01:05:15,013
I guess it worked.

1108
01:05:15,544 --> 01:05:18,754
Don’t let it hurt your pride
and try your best.

1109
01:05:19,115 --> 01:05:20,515
You still look happy when you have

1110
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:23,923
a terrible reputation and are getting
cursed at by everyone.

1111
01:05:24,387 --> 01:05:26,187
I'm going to do Peter's film?

1112
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:28,855
You’re like a ghost haunting me.

1113
01:05:29,025 --> 01:05:30,125
Go away.

1114
01:05:30,192 --> 01:05:31,492
