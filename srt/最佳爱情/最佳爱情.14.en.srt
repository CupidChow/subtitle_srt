It's better to live even if it means
rolling in a pile of dog sh**.

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,320
Right now, I can relate to that saying.

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,810
But...

6
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:20,170
Even if I have to leave this place,

7
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:24,520
I cannot leave you behind in this pile
of dog sh**, struggling all by yourself.

8
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:25,670
Tell me you're joking.

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,870
You don't need to sell other people out.

10
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,370
Just sell me out.

11
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:33,160
This is the highly expensive Dok Go Jin,
who is enough to cover up all your problems.

12
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,090
I'm giving him to you.
Sell him out.

13
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,070
Tell me you're joking.

14
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,700
To achieve that...

15
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,540
let me be Gu Ae Jeong's man.

16
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,530
I said, tell me you're joking!

17
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,710
Given the current situation,

18
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,040
you won't be able to get out of it
by your strength alone.

19
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:08,030
By selling me out,
you'll be able to get out of it.

20
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,890
I can get out of it?

21
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,580
How great.

22
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:20,450
Now, if I say Dok Go Jin is my man,
I won't be badmouthed?

23
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,290
Because Dok Go Jin is going to die?

24
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:26,020
How great is that?

00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,560
Gu Ae Jeong.

26
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:31,170
Keep your cool and think about it.

27
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,450
How much cooler?

28
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,540
I'm so cool
that I'm about to freeze to death.

29
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:38,510
I said your death would be a great thing.

Gu Ae Jeong.

31
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,450
Isn't that what you're telling me right now?

32
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:45,800
That I should get out of trouble
by selling out your death?

33
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,030
Don't hold me.

34
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,400
I'm not your charger or anything anymore.

35
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:59,460
Because you think you're going to die,

36
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:02,490
you can relate to that dog sh** saying?

37
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,770
Don't even dream about it.

38
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,460
This is my pile of dog sh**.

39
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:08,420
I don't intend to let you in.

40
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,510
Don't even dream of dying either.

41
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,280
You better live well and arrogantly
at the highest summit.

42
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,820

Where is Dok Go?

00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,030
If you don't want to sell out other people,
don't.

46
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,310
Given the current situation,

47
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:56,160
you just have to make a suitable apology
and I'll take care of the rest.

48
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:11,850
Is it true you betrayed the rest to go solo
when the National Treasure Girls broke up?

49
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,490
Please respond to the scandals
revolving around you.

50
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,960
Will you tell us the whole truth today?

51
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:18,110
How do you feel right now?

52
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,850
Don't you feel sorry towards the other
National Treasure Girls members?

How will you be handling
your relationship with Yoon Pil Joo?

54
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:26,370
Don't you feel sorry towards Yoon Pil Joo?

55
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:30,750
I'm really sorry for causing this scandal.

56
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,090
I should have been more careful
about my actions.

57
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,070
I am in the wrong for not doing that.

58
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,470
For being such a disappointment
to everyone...

59
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,980
I will show more self-restraint
and reflect on my actions.

What are your thoughts on maintaining
your career as a celebrity

61
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:53,630
based on the scandals that you frequently
cause and your negative image?

62
00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:00,410
Gu Ae Jeong, you won't be able
to get out of it by your strength alone.

63
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,990
How do you think can you change your image?

64
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:12,400
I'll be able to protect you
through my death.

65
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,090
Will everything work out through death?

66
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:29,380
Will I really be able to escape
through death?

67
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,960
Through death...

68
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,670
no matter what I sell out,

00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,700
no matter whom I love,

70
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,100
I'll be forgiven and everything
will be beautified.

71
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,700
Will I be free from being further attacked

72
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:52,020
and from being hurled
malicious verbal abuse?

73
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:58,510
With that, will I be able to escape
the negative image that follows Gu Ae Jeong,

74
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,490
no matter what she does?

75
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:05,290
What good is that?

76
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,830
You're dying anyway,
what's there to escape for?

77
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,300
What's there to be protected?

78
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,880
Well... This is the end
of the press conference.

79
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:36,440
It seems Gu Ae Jeong's interview today
caused a big scandal.

80
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,260
Prepare a statement.

81
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:43,290

with something even bigger.

which will decide whether he lives or dies

83
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,380
will be able to cover up everything.

84
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:53,900
If we reveal that, you'll be giving up
all your remaining time before the surgery.

85
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:58,730
Are you saying you'll spend
your remaining time surrounded by reporters?

86
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,590
I need to give up something...

87
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:05,100
so that I can protect something else.

88
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,520

Unni...

90
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:23,790
If the person you love
says that he might die,

91
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,660
you would cry your heart out
and ask him not to die.

92
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,230
You would feel sad together
and comfort each other.

93
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,140
Shouldn't that be the case?

94
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:40,290
But he said that if he dies,
it will be a good thing for me.

95
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,370
How should I respond?

96
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,090
"You'll definitely die, right?"

97
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,170
"Thanks for dying. "

98
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,540
"You have to die. "

99
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,490
Should I say that?

100
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,050
Ae Jeong, what are you talking about?

101
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,890
Is there anything wrong with Dok Go Jin?

102
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,000
Who is going to die?

103
00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:02,420
He said he'll improve my image
through his death.

104
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,570
He said he'll do that then leave my side.

105
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,830
How can I stay by his side?

00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,440
Did Dok Go Jin release a statement
about a heart surgery?

183
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:20,250
That's right.
There are no reports on Gu Ae Jeong.

Gu Ae Jeong's press conference

00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:25,780

under Dok Go Jin's press release.

What are you doing?

190
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:10,290
Drink some water to relieve your hangover.

191
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,280
Why am I here?

192
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:15,120
I kidnapped you
so that we can stay together.

193
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,240
I said I don't want to.

194
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,540
You didn't say that while drunk.

00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:23,640
I'm leaving.

196
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,620
You won't be able to get out.

it's incomparable to the previous time.

in front of your house?

200
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,520
Did you tell them about us?

201
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:48,860
I didn't tell them about you.

202
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,490
I only told them about me.

203
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,400
I only told them about my surgery.

204
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:59,040
Everything you said during the press
conference, no one will be talking about it.

but in the end,
there's only one article on her.

in front of Hyungnim's house right now.

00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,820

there's no way I can die quietly.

258
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:12,860
Dok Go Jin said he was kidnapping Ae Jeong
then took her away.

259
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,230
I felt really bad for the two of them

260
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,750

In any case, it's great that

due to Dok Go Jin's news.

265

However, not everything has been resolved.

What can we do?

269

Ae Jeong said
she has something to protect.

270
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:52,370
In that case, by gathering the people
being protected by Ae Jeong,

271
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:55,110
we should be able to clear it up.

272

came and asked me about it.

00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,960

00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:02,790
That's right.

The success rate for the surgery is low.

276
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,910
Then when Ae Jeong unni
asked at the press conference

277
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,600
whether she'll be able to escape
through death...

278
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:16,800
Was she talking about Dok Go Jin?

279
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:18,940
That's right.

280
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,710
Dok Go said he'll pass on all of his image

281
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,510
to Gu Ae Jeong when he dies.

282
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,910
Because, if Dok Go Jin really dies,

283
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:31,030
the image as a woman he once loved
would be very powerful.

284
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,860
But why didn't Ae Jeong unni accept that?

285
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,090
Don't you think Gu Ae Jeong

286
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:40,200
is also protecting Dok Go Jin
in her own way?

287
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:41,930
That's right.

288
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,260
Ae Jeong unni has always been good
at protecting people since way back.

289
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:47,600
Thanks to Gu Ae Jeong,

290
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:48,670
when the National Treasure Girls broke up,

291
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,390
didn't you manage to protect
a lot of your things as well?

If you feel that way...

296
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:10,620
Shouldn't you at least explain the issues
about Ae Jeong to relevant people?

297

This is the person
you've been searching for.

303
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,850
I wanted to let you meet her.

304
00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:02,620
Ae Jeong unni asked if she'll be able
to escape through death.

305
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,800
Those were the words
I said to her ten years ago.

306

307
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:16,040

- Mi Na. Don't do it! Don't!

308
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:18,040
Let go!

309
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:21,690
Unni, I just want to end everything.

310
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,500
I want to forget all of it.

311
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,910
Please help me.

312
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,990
Don't do it, Mi Na.

313
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,030
All the malicious verbal abuse
Ae Jeong unni is bearing right now

314
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:37,540
should be directed towards me.

315
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:44,460
The days as a National Treasure Girl
were really painful for me.

316
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:47,720
I wanted to leave it all the time.

317
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,560
Also, I found someone I loved at that time.

318
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:56,700
Was it that idol group member you dated,
Hwi Jin?

319
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,860
Although it was difficult to date
and we were busy,

320
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:03,800
we really loved each other a lot.

321
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:08,920
I had intended to marry him
and run away together...

322
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:12,850
But because of the prank Se Ri pulled,

323
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,350
my hopes were killed...

324
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,400
My stomach is feeling strange,
I keep feeling nauseous.

325
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:43,390
Nauseous? Is it indigestion?
Drink this.

326
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,830
Mi Na?

327
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,970
What happened?

328
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:51,920
Mi Na?

329
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:52,920
Are you okay?

330
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:53,770
My stomach hurts.

331
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,280
My stomach hurts.

332
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:59,430
My stomach hurts a lot.

333
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,390
I...

334
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:06,230
I didn't know.

335
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,730
I was always...

336
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,040
I felt that I was the only one
left out from things

337
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:15,460
and ignored by everyone
so I got really angry.

338
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:21,830
I wanted to give the drink to Ae Jeong unni.

339
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,130
So, I really just...

340
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:30,540
I just wanted to make her
suffer some pain as a prank.

341
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:35,550
Ae Jeong unni knew about my condition

342
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,120
so when she found out
that something went wrong,

343
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:41,480
she got really mad at you.

344
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:42,910
So that's what happened.

345
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:48,510
If Ae Jeong had told others
about the prank you pulled,

346
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:52,410
you wouldn't have been able
to carry on till today, Se Ri.

347
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,810
I wanted to escape through death.

348
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:58,820
The person who saved me

349
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:02,290
and helped me to escape was Ae Jeong unni.

350
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:04,990
She didn't explain herself for hitting you.

351
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,620
Instead, she joined
another management company

352
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:10,670
and broke up the National Treasure Girls.

353
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,830

00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:31,740
Are you going to remain on the second floor?

356
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:44,070
What are you doing?

357
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,410
I'm changing my clothes.

358
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,770
All right.

359
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,090
What now?

360
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:05,610
I'm going to exercise first.

361
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,060
All right.

362
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,400
Why?

363
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,930
I'm going to shower first.

364
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,230
Gu Ae Jeong, say something.

365
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,520
If you want to get angry and curse at me,
you have to open your mouth.

366
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:26,060
If that doesn't appease you,
use your arms and your legs!

367
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:29,730
Kick me! Hit me!
I'm fine with that.

[The Heart Surgery That Will Determine
Dok Go Jin's Life or Death]

369
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,540
Dok Go Jin is currently staying
in his house.

370
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:35,380
He's not showing himself to the public.

371
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:38,910
We have contacted the surgeon in-charge
of his surgery for a phone patch.

372
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:43,050
What is Dok Go Jin's current state of health
and what is the success rate of his surgery?

00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,330
Why are you watching this kind of thing?

376
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,570
If you're curious, ask me directly.

377
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,800
I just want to watch it on TV.

378
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,040
Fine then.

379
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:05,050
I'll make it look like I'm on TV.

380
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:11,470
Reporter Gu Ae Jeong from Section TV,

381
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:16,020
please ask what you're curious about.

382
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:26,420
When is the surgery slated?

383
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,920
A week later.

384
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:30,400
160 hours later...

385
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:33,600
There's not much time left.

386
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,520
How difficult is the surgery?

387
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:44,800
The chance of survival is...

388
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:46,430
10 percent.

389
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,650
The success rate is...

390
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,910
not that high, right?

391
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:04,620
I wish you a speedy recovery.

392
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:10,010
How can you carry out a one-on-one
interview with Dok Go Jin like this?

393
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:13,240
You have to persist in asking him
tough questions.

394
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:22,470
There is someone precious to me.

395
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:27,160
But there is not much time left
and the success rate is not high

396
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:30,110
so I've been hiding her.

397
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:35,610
That woman will always ask "why"
three times under all circumstances.

398
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:38,500
Seeing how she's not asking anything at all,

399
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:41,960
it seems she's really angry.

400
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:46,190
This faraway thing called "love"

401
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,070
As for the question
that keeps appearing in her head,

402
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,480
"Why are you doing that?"

403
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:53,850
If it comes into sight,
it will bring heartache and tears, right?

404
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:51,040
There is only one answer to it.

405
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,710
Because I like her too much.

406
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:56,940
That's why I left you

407
00:25:56,950 --> 00:26:00,260
So that I can fall in love with my love

I don't have the time to justify myself
here and there to you.

I'll be the one and only heart who loves you

Do you find it a shame

420
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:54,640
that you can't broadcast the exclusive
scoop on Dok Go Jin's romance nationwide?

421
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,680
Please don't...

on Dok Go Jin.

Don't try to prepare me that way.

424
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,410
All right.

425
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:22,400
I'll do everything the way you want.

426
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,680
Ae Jeong unni was protecting me?

427
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,850
Kang Se Ri.

428
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,130
Didn't you tell me about the person

429
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,580
who was involved
with your breakup with Dok Go Jin?

430
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:45,440
Can you repeat what you said
to Reporter Kim?

431
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:49,180
I'm preparing a TV special on Dok Go Jin.

432
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:52,520
Is it true
that when you broke up with Dok Go Jin...

433
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:58,010
Gu Ae Jeong was involved in it too?

434
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,300
Yes, that's true.

435
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:04,500
Ae Jeong unni got herself involved.

436
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:08,370
Does that mean Gu Ae Jeong
was the reason for the breakup?

437
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,090
No.

438
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,190
When I felt upset during the breakup,

439
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,900
Ae Jeong unni got herself involved
by providing me comfort.

440
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:16,490
What?

441
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:20,960
Ae Jeong unni and I were both from the
National Treasure Girls so we're very close.

442
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:24,380
When scandals about our National Treasure
Girls days hit Ae Jeong unni earlier,

443
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:26,850
I was really upset.

444
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:29,330
I was going to call for an interview
to defend her.

445
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,410
It's great that you're here.

446
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,620
Shall we start now, Reporter Kim?

447
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:34,010
Shall we?

448
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,070
Kang Se Ri...

449
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:41,180
Are you going to talk about Han Mi Na too?

450
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:44,130
Mi Na...?
I met her just yesterday.

451
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,720
It's been a long while since we met

452
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:49,380
so we were both very happy
and had fun spending time together.

453
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:54,060
I think all of us
should meet together one day.

454
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,640
What's with you all of a sudden?

455
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:04,890
Manager Jang, just stop it and
forget about what happened 10 years ago.

456
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,420
Let Ae Jeong unni off.

457
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:07,560
I painstakingly groomed her

458
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:11,100
but she only thought of herself
and ran off to join another agency.

459
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:17,090
I'll tell the reporters the details of how
she betrayed and destroyed the group.

460
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,780
If you continue to work that way,

461
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:23,690
Candies will break up the way
National Treasure Girls did.

462
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:27,020
There are outcasts among them
and jealousy over popularity rankings.

463
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:30,340
They also date secretly.
Isn't this all the same as us back then?

464
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:33,010
Please protect them well.

465
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,330
No, what are you suddenly...?

466
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,190
You're doing Intimate Note* with Gu Ae Jeong?

467
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,190
(*a Korean show that brings together
celebrities who are not close)

468
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:44,770
Maybe. Although I don't really want
to do it, I'm considering giving it a shot.

469
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:47,750
Also, I know that Harumi
was dating secretly

470
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,970
and participating in Couple Making
at the same time.

471
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,080
I'll keep my mouth shut

472
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:56,210
so keep that mouth shut too.

473
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:01,300
With that, I managed to stop Manager Jang.

474
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:03,360
You've turned for the better.

475
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:07,520
Because I've been under treatment
by a capable oriental doctor...

476
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:11,550
Ae Jeong unni was taken
to Dok Go Jin's house.

477
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,310
Aren't you going to save her this time?

478
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,980
Is it because Paul doesn't intend
to save Nina from the evil king anymore?

479
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:23,200
Don't you know how the manhwa ended?

480
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:28,410
The evil king disappeared and Nina returned
to the world where Paul was.

481
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,710
Paul accepted her back?

482
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,310
That's right.

483
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,900
That is how Paul showed himself
as the strangest person.

484
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:41,160
Then what about...
What about the Mushroom Head and Paul?

485
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:43,850
What happened to them?

486
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,760
I wasn't too interested
in Mushroom Head so...

487
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:50,120
Although I don't really remember the story,

488
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:54,290
I do remember the Mushroom Head
was the most popular in the manhwa.

489
00:30:55,260 --> 00:31:00,810
And how much longer
is Paul going to cling to Nina like that?

490
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:07,140
Until Nina cries no more...

491
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,430
This is the last bit of food we have.

492
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,780
We've eaten all of them.

493
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:24,010
I thought you won't have an appetite
so the food would be enough.

494
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,560
Your appetite is better than I expected.

495
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:28,650
Only by finishing up the food fast
will you think of leaving this place.

496
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:31,990
I don't want to get out
and be treated as a patient.

497
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,480
I don't want to look pitiful.
I'll hold out till the end with grace.

498
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:36,480
For a person who wants to remain graceful
till the end,

499
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:39,210
how could you have considered
rolling in a pile of dog sh** with me?

500
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:41,610
Since it might be the end...

501
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:45,960
I felt that I could do anything for you.

502
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:49,520
Before you found out it could be the end,

503
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:52,480
did you think of revealing our relationship?

504
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:55,460
Just tell me honestly.

505
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:59,410
That's right, before it became
such an extreme situation...

506
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:03,720
I weighed other factors
before I decided on anything.

507
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:07,220
It's because you keep thinking
that you might die

508
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:09,610
that you feel that it's okay
for you to reveal our relationship.

509
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:13,010
Gu Ae Jeong,
don't make fun of my love.

510
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:16,490
How I wish we can return to the time
when Dok Go Jin

511
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:21,150
was worried about getting involved
with the slovenly Gu Ae Jeong in real life.

512
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:25,820
Because you were definitely worried
about your future back then...

513
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:28,720
Now, why are you worried
about my future?

514
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:31,910
I'm not happy at all that you're going
to protect me through your death!

515
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,990
Just live on.

516
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,860
"I'm lucky not to have thoughtlessly
revealed my relationship with Gu Ae Jeong. "

517
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:38,080
I wish you would live on thinking that way.

518
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:40,350
Yes, I will definitely live.

519
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,890
I'll prove you wrong.

520
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:47,320
I also don't like how we're sitting around
like this and staring at the time!

521
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:50,410
I don't like how we seem to be doing
some countdown to the end.

522
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,470
It's because you don't believe
that you'll live

523
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,490
that you told me you like me
and kidnapped me.

524
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:59,180
Yet you're careful
to not even lay a finger on me.

525
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:02,190
I've been thinking how strange it was

526
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,590
that you get Hyun Gyu to come along
when you ask me over.

527
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,320
That you're forbidden to expose yourself
due to ad restrictions... This and that...

528
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,630
Wait.

529
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:42,020
At first, we didn't get along

530
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:49,180
We only fought
and frustrated each other

531
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:53,100
It's so strange

532
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:56,910
Suddenly our hearts connected

533
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,210
Wait and see.

534
00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:05,470
When you're not around,
I miss you like crazy

535
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:01,880
I'll definitely survive the surgery

536
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:05,580
and show you more of the future.

537
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:09,350
My special someone

538
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:12,860
My exciting gift

539
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,520
Is that so?

540
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:19,730
What do I do
when you gradually draw near?

541
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:16,580
You have to do that.

542
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:20,930
I'll believe that and leave for now.

543
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,540
If I remain here,
when you leave for the operating theatre,

544
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:29,410
you'll be surrounded by reporters,
making it difficult for me to follow.

545
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:34,200
At such an important moment,
your charger needs to be by your side.

546
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:37,040
That's right.

547
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:40,260
When I go for the surgery,
you have to be by my side.

548
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:42,010
Be there...

549
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:46,420
and sing "Heartbeat" for me.

550
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:55,010
Recharge until your battery is full.

551
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,470
Recharge...

552
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,830
Who is that?

553
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,180
What's happening?

554
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,400
Who is inside?

555
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,680
Poor Dok Go Jin!

556
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,900
Is that Dok Go Jin?

557
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:48,700
How is he?

558
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:53,710
Dok Go hyungnim! What should I do
if something happens to you?

559
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,550
Quick!

560
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,730
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

561
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,130
Please release him.

562
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:13,600
Aigoo, I can finally breathe.

563
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:17,270
- How did it go?
- Perfect.

564
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,650
The reporters have all ran off after them.

565
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:29,250
Leave quickly now.

566
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:37,630
See you at the hospital.

567
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,940
I'll be there.

568
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:43,610
I'll let Reporter Gu Ae Jeong
run the interview session.

569
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:44,960
I'll call you.

570
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:46,580
Don't leave so cheerfully.

571
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:49,070
I'm going to be upset.

572
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,790
Shall I tell you how I feel
about being released?

573
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,670
What is it?

574
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:57,130
I'm not doing what you said
you wanted to do together.

575
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:00,790
I dislike staying here
to count the hours together.

576
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,150
I'll never believe in survival rates
so I'm going to ignore it and leave.

577
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:09,790
I won't make things complicated
by explaining or defending my decision.

578
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,490
There's only one correct answer
to everything.

579
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:16,430
Because you like me a lot?

580
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,890
Incorrect.

581
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:24,920
Because I love you a lot,
much, much more than you imagine.

582
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:32,070
My heart will,

583
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,750
with your love,

584
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,320
conquer this!

585
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:49,310
Don't forget me

586
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:51,400
I had one last objective for kidnapping you.

587
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:53,390
Even if I only lived for a second

588
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:53,580
For that...

589
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:59,680
I'll be the one and only heart who loves you

590
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:57,650
You'll just have to look forward
to the future.

591
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:08,680
For that one and only,
I've concealed sorrowful tears and left

592
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:14,950
So please remember me

593
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:20,240
Don't forget me

594
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:24,540
Even if I lived for a thousand years

595
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:30,960
I'll be a fool who only loves you

596
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:37,780
I am really envious of your cell phone

597
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:46,750
Because it's with you by your side right now

598
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:42,870
That future...

599
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,750
Will I be able to give it to you?

600
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:52,670
Don't forget me

601
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,010
Ae Jeong unni has returned home?

602
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,180
Yeah.

603
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:00,860
She went to sleep the moment she got home.

604
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:03,590
Is Dok Go Jin doing well at home?

605
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,590
Yes.

606
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,540
But he keeps on sleeping.

607
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:09,840
When they were together,
they treasured every single second

608
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:12,280
but when they're apart,
they just hope time will pass quickly.

609
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:16,760
You've been looking very troubled recently.

610
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:19,480
So it was because of Dok Go Jin and not me?

611
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:20,710
Yes.

612
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,440
Why would I be troubled over you?

613
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:27,860
That's right, of course!

614
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:31,890
Jae Seok, you don't have to be troubled
over Jenny at all.

615
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,870
Jenny noona...

616
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,790
The wine which I drank last time

617
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,890
was really good.

618
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,600
Can I have some again?

619
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,610
Hey, hey, Jae Seok!

620
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:49,660
When did you drink wine with Jenny?

621
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:51,720
Ask Noona.

622
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,580
Wait, hey!

623
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,320
Hey, Jenny!

624
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,850
That means...

625
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:03,140
You gave Jae Seok wine too?

626
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:05,970
Think of it whichever way you want.

627
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:06,930
Jenny!

628
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,170
Jen...

629
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:11,580
Bad woman.

630
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,420
What?
She doesn't just give wine to me?

631
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,320
What's the matter?

632
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:44,930
I did an interview regarding my days
in National Treasure Girls.

633
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:48,460
During the interview,
I pretended that we're very close.

634
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:51,220
I thought I should get a photo taken
just in case.

635
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:53,840
Since it's advantageous to Ae Jeong unni,
you'll agree to that, right?

636
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:56,260
Sure, why not.

637
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:58,950
Did you come all the way here
just to say this?

638
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,760
The busy Kang Se Ri came?

639
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:03,210
No, well...

640
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,580
Do you have something to tell me?

641
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:07,850
Huh?

642
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,860
I want to...

643
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:12,520
Never mind if you don't.

644
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:15,350
Ah, Yoon Pil Joo...

645
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:20,190
Does Yoon Pil Joo come by often?

646
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,730
Why are you asking about Yoon Pil Joo?

647
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:30,630
You...
Are interested in him?

648
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,050
Yes, I am.

649
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:37,390
You seem to be pushing
the two of them together.

650
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,800
Don't do that.

651
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:42,170
I want to continue doing that

652
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,850
but because Ae Jeong
has fallen for another man,

653
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,460
I can't do that anymore.

654
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:47,520
That's right.

655
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:51,440
Ae Jeong unni and Dok Go Jin
should stay together.

656
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:00,480
Yeah, who is that?

657
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:03,270
Kang Se Ri, it's Kang Se Ri.

658
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,360
Didn't they say that Dok Go Jin
is going to undergo heart surgery?

659
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:09,980
It seems she's here
to pray for her ex-boyfriend.

660
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:11,370
What a nice girl.

661
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:13,320
That's right.

662
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:14,240
And she looks so beautiful.

663
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:17,450
Beautiful.
She's beautiful, right?

664
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:27,360
Please let Dok Go Jin's heart surgery
be successful,

665
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:30,640
so that things will work out
between him and Ae Jeong unni.

666
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:33,150
In exchange,

667
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:37,260
please give me Yoon Pil Joo.

668
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,380
They looked ready to kill you

669
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:45,620
but everything has quieted down,

670
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:47,380
making what happened look like a lie.

671
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:49,460
That's right.

672
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:52,680
When I reappeared after disappearing
for a few days, it was so quiet.

673
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:54,910
I feel embarrassed about what I did
during the press conference.

674
00:42:54,920 --> 00:43:00,410
Se Ri stepped in and put in a good word for
you regarding the National Treasure Girls.

675
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:05,600
Yoon Pil Joo also did an interview
with Couple Making to clear things up.

676
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:07,360
Dok Go's news also buried yours.

677
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:09,930
With that, the scandal has died down.

678
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:13,600
It's all thanks to those people.

679
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:15,740
I'll go thank all of them.

680
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:20,170
Having gone through it so many times,
you do know this might happen again, right?

681
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:23,940
I've been through it many times
but it still hurts a lot every time.

682
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:27,330
Because I was faced with
a more extreme situation this time around,

683
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:32,330
I've come to disregard
the hurt I receive from unrelated people.

684
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:34,360
That's right.

685
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:37,230
When one is faced with an extreme situation,

686
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,660
it's possible to lose a sense of reality.

687
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,750
That is what's happening
with Dok Go right now.

688
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,940
Because he might die,

689
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:49,420
he thinks he can be your man.

690
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:53,000
But Dok Go Jin will live.

691
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:57,470
If he lives,
he'll recover his sense of reality.

692
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:02,310
So, the decision you made earlier,

693
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,760
was correct.

694
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:11,210
As long as he lives, even if he cuts into me
like a knife and swishes past me,

695
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:16,280
I'll be able to send him off with a dance,
saying, "Goodbye."

696
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:22,910
I heard that you gave an interview
to support me

697
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:27,720
and even persuaded the production team
to post up a clarification.

698
00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:29,770
I'm really thankful.

699
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:31,080
And regarding Mi Na's matter...

700
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:36,820
You managed to clear up the misunderstanding
without putting anyone on the spot.

701
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:38,160
I'm most thankful for that.

702
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:41,000
It's all worth it seeing that I was of help.

703
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:45,440
I wanted to bid you a proper farewell
during the last filming session...

704
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:49,350
but it ended this way.

705
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:56,400
I'm really thankful for everything you did.

706
00:44:56,410 --> 00:45:00,260
You're saying goodbye
like we're never going to meet again.

707
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:04,740
We don't have to meet for filming anymore.

708
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:09,460
And I heard you're going somewhere far
to study.

709
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:15,260
Before you leave, let me give you a treat
at Jenny unni's restaurant.

710
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:22,980
I'm leaving.

711
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,280
Gu Ae Jeong.

712
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:33,880
You look more cheerful than I expected.

713
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:39,330
Did you expect me to keep crying
because of Dok Go Jin's heart condition?

714
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:41,200
I was worried.

715
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:43,880
I was afraid you would be hurt.

716
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:47,610
I'll have to conquer it
while I stay by his side.

717
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:56,200
Wouldn't it be harder to conquer
if you stayed by his side?

718
00:45:57,030 --> 00:46:00,200
Isn't that why most people would go away?

719
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:02,140
Be it for study or for work,

720
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:04,680
they'll find an excuse.

721
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:16,240
You said you won't be able to protect it
if you escaped.

722
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:22,980
If the thing you're protecting disappears
and you want to escape...

723
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:29,650
I'll be your excuse.

724
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:53,810
My son insisted
that I pay you a visit to apologize

725
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:57,640
and give these Kong Jin Pills to you.

726
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:00,610
I came because I had no choice.

727
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:03,100
If you came only because you had no choice,

728
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:04,950
forget it.

729
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,350
No.

730
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,650
I have to apologize

731
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:11,410
and get evidence
that I've given you the Kong Jin Pills

732
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:15,130
before Pil Joo would stop eating ramen.

733
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:16,180
Evidence?

734
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:17,660
Yes.

735
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,500
Please wait a moment.

736
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:20,750
This.

737
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:22,450
The camera mode...

738
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:24,000
Activate that.

739
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:28,190
Child, take this and snap a photo of us.

740
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:32,180
This has a large screen.

741
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:35,830
Get your grandfather, me, and this box in it

742
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:38,400
and snap a good photo of us.

743
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:39,680
Okay.

744
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:42,520
Have you set the camera in place?

745
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:43,860
Yes.

746
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,550
I...

747
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:50,900
I caused trouble for your daughter.

748
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:52,810
I'm sorry for that.

749
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:57,600
These very expensive Kong Jin Pills
envelop my apologetic feelings.

750
00:47:57,610 --> 00:47:58,770
Please accept them.

751
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:00,200
Aigoo.

752
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:03,180
Why go to the expense?

753
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:11,420
It's missing some bottles.

754
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:15,660
Err, yes. I rushed over too hurriedly
so I didn't check the quantity.

755
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:18,210
Please just accept it and take a video.

756
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:19,220
In that case...

757
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:21,890
Do you intend your apology
to be incomplete as well?

758
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,030
Let's leave this topic for next time!

759
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,650
I'll top up the quantity for you.
All right?

760
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:26,820
Here.

761
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:28,960
Let's do it again.

762
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:30,350
I...

763
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:33,080
Please smile.

764
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:36,280
Please smile.

765
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:43,190
Hyungnim.

766
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:47,380
Hey, Ding Dong!
Take a seat.

767
00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:51,370
Just go.

768
00:48:55,470 --> 00:49:01,090
Ahjussi, I heard on TV that you're sick.
Where do you feel sick?

769
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:04,870
It's an illness that's too complicated
to be explained to a seven year old.

770
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,730
To put it simply,

771
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:09,510
my artificial heart broke down

772
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,550
so I need to fix it.

773
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:14,530
Iron Man became stronger after he got fixed

774
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:17,500
so you will become stronger too.

775
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:21,120
Of course, Ding Dong!

776
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:24,020
Ding Dong...

777
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:28,390
I have something important
to entrust you with.

778
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:33,900
Here.
Take this with you.

779
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:37,660
If I keep this with me without being able
to give it, it will be a shame.

780
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:39,490
So, I'm entrusting it to you.

781
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:43,300
If I become stronger* and don't come back,
(*didn't want to shock kid by saying die)

782
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:45,660
hide this next to something
which your aunt likes most.

783
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:50,140
Something she will never throw away
and will keep with her, her entire life...

784
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:52,660
Can I take a look at it?

785
00:49:54,270 --> 00:49:58,400
Ahjussi, are you going to marry my aunt
with this ring?

786
00:49:58,410 --> 00:50:02,150
Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong...!

787
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:07,320
Ding Dong, I am "the Dok Go Jin,"
a very special person.

788
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:09,770
Because of that...

789
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:14,130
I will surely do that.

790
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:27,280
What does Aunt like the most?

791
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:36,570
The one person my heart loves

792
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:41,350
The one person I miss every single day

793
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:45,900
Because I still long for you even now

794
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:48,000
Here are the words so difficult to hold back

795
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,400
So much so that my tears are falling

796
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:55,470
I love you

797
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:05,110
How many hours has it been? I should
have held on to you for another day.

798
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,390
I feel lonely.

799
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,480
Shall I ride the ambulance and go back in?

800
00:51:09,490 --> 00:51:11,710
Do you want to do that?

801
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:12,840
No.

802
00:51:12,850 --> 00:51:14,960
The same method won't work twice.

803
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:16,330
I'll bear with it but in exchange,

804
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:19,230
you have to go to the hospital
on the day of the surgery.

805
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,830
I will definitely go.

806
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:24,690
During the heart surgery,

807
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:27,640
they will stop my heart
to proceed with the surgery.

808
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:29,650
Ten years ago, your song

809
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:32,670
made my heart beat again
after it got stopped.

810
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:34,810
It was a song of encouragement.

811
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:35,690
Was it hypnosis at work?

812
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:38,490
It wasn't hypnosis, it was fate at work.

813
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:43,730
When my heart gets stopped again,
you will make it beat and thump once more.

814
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:44,880
That's why we met.

815
00:51:44,890 --> 00:51:47,500
You said it was because you were broken
and that you were hypnotized.

816
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:50,370
But it has become fate?

817
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:53,900
Woah, I became really incredible, huh?

818
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:56,120
I'm "the Dok Go Jin"
who wants to look cool to other people

819
00:51:56,130 --> 00:51:58,770
And can't let it show that he's afraid.

820
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:01,290
Since you know of the
cowardly Ddong* Go Jin, (*poop)

821
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:03,740
you have to come and stay by my side,

822
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:06,330
so that I won't be afraid, okay?

823
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:09,660
I'll definitely go.
Definitely.

824
00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:16,030
There are not many days remaining
till the surgery.

825
00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:18,900
All the reporters will gather
in front of the hospital that day.

826
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:22,720
Start to prepare for that now so that
there won't be any problem on that day.

827
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:30,520
This is from Dok Go hyungnim.

828
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:41,780
What is this?

829
00:52:41,790 --> 00:52:43,450
In case...

830
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:48,380
In case something bad happens
to Dok Go hyungnim,

831
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:54,020
and his relationship with Ae Jeong noona
gets revealed somehow...

832
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:56,310
He said to protect
Ae Jeong noona with these.

833
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:59,980
Is this evidence
that Dok Go Jin loved Gu Ae Jeong?

834
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:03,650
He's worried that if this gets revealed
when he's not around...

835
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:06,860
It might become the worst scenario
for Ae Jeong noona.

836
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:11,910
So he asked that you and I look after her.

837
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,450
He is asking that we use these

838
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:20,120
to make Gu Ae Jeong the greatest lover.

839
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:32,790
This episode of Star Date was good too.

840
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,260
We'll do our best,
seeing how you didn't fire us from the show.

841
00:53:35,270 --> 00:53:36,930
Thank you.

842
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:41,750
Didn't Dok Go Jin come on Star Date
last time?

843
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,920
He is going to undergo surgery soon.

844
00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:46,530
Do you think you can conduct
a one-to-one interview

845
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:49,450
with Dok Go Jin before his surgery?

846
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:55,780
I will conduct his first interview
regarding his recovery after the surgery.

847
00:53:55,790 --> 00:53:58,290
- I definitely will.
- Interview after the surgery?

848
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:01,400
- But it seems to be a difficult surgery...
- I definitely will!

849
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:04,830
I'll do the interview after the surgery.
I definitely will!

850
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:11,440
Potato.

851
00:54:11,970 --> 00:54:14,390
Are you going to flower?

852
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,200
You have to flower

853
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:20,030
so that I can boast to Gu Ae Jeong.

854
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:46,490
Please bear with it a bit more, a bit more.

855
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:49,690
Hyungnim, please bear with it.

856
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:50,670
Please bear with it, Hyungnim.

857
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:52,930
Just a bit further.

858
00:55:01,490 --> 00:55:03,080
We can't let it drag.

859
00:55:03,090 --> 00:55:04,330
Let's perform the surgery immediately.

860
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:06,550
Make preparations.

861
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:08,850
It was Dok Go Jin, right?

862
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:10,490
How is his condition right now?

863
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:11,890
Sorry, we have no comments.

864
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:12,900
Don't be like that.

865
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:14,530
Why are you acting like this?

866
00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:16,530
Please tell us a little.

867
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:17,850
What happened to him?

868
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:18,760
Dok Go Jin.

869
00:55:18,770 --> 00:55:21,410
Dok Go Jin, do you hear me?

870
00:55:22,670 --> 00:55:24,060
Yes, Doctor.

871
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:25,290
Okay, okay, okay.

872
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:27,100
I've injected some morphine.

873
00:55:27,110 --> 00:55:30,030
The pain will lessen soon.

874
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,640
Contact the anesthesiologist.

875
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:33,160
Prepare to send him
into the operating theatre quickly.

876
00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:35,060
Yes, Head Surgeon.

877
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:37,940
Hey, I'll go prepare for the surgery.

878
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:39,680
We'll send you into the operating theatre
soon.

879
00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:43,640
Don't worry.
Just believe in me, okay?

880
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:47,510
Hurry up and answer the phone, hurry!

881
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:50,270
Because of you my chest,

882
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:55,240
my heart goes "thump thump"

883
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:57,800
I love only you,

884
00:55:57,810 --> 00:55:59,950
I yell with...

885
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:02,470
Am I right?

886
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,200
The producer...

887
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,940
Hurry up, hurry up.

888
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:16,930
All right, it's one minute before the start.

889
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:19,380
Please get ready.

890
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,700
Are you all in position?

891
00:56:23,850 --> 00:56:24,560
Representative Moon.

892
00:56:24,570 --> 00:56:25,940
Where is Dok Go?

893
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:27,800
He's undergoing surgery soon.

894
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:29,400
Have you contacted Gu Ae Jeong?

895
00:56:29,410 --> 00:56:31,770
She has to enter before the reporters gather
so that she can see Dok Go.

896
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:33,510
She's filming for a live program
so I can't contact her.

897
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,340
Ae Hwan hyung isn't answering either.

898
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:37,960
- It's over there.
- Okay.

899
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:45,570
Hello, Everyone.

900
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:47,620
I am the host for Section TV live telecast,
Kim Yong Man.

901
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:49,140
Hello, I am Gu Eun Young.

902
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:51,490
We've prepared a lot of exciting
entertainment news for everyone today.

903
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:53,560
The first piece of news
was prepared by Park Se Ri.

904
00:56:53,570 --> 00:56:58,010
Yes, I am going to capture the viewers' eyes
with the Rising Star segment today.

905
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:00,540
I have news on the bearer
of the original killer smile, Kim Jae Won.

906
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:02,290
Let's take a look right now!

907
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:03,640
Okay.

908
00:57:04,050 --> 00:57:04,830
Hello.

909
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,420
I am the star on this installment
of Rising Star.

910
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:07,220
When he debuted in 2001,

911
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:09,860
he won the hearts of many women in Korea
with his brilliant smile.

912
00:57:09,870 --> 00:57:12,480
He is Kim Jae Won,
the bearer of the original killer smile.

913
00:57:12,490 --> 00:57:13,480
Recently, many people call him
"Dong Joo oppa."

914
00:57:13,490 --> 00:57:14,800
Studio standby.

915
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:16,050
The video is going to end soon.

916
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:18,850
Gu Ae Jeong,
next up is the Star Date segment.

917
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:20,440
- Producer...
- What?

918
00:57:20,450 --> 00:57:22,250
Representative Choi called.

919
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:24,920
He said that Dok Go Jin just collapsed
and will undergo surgery right away.

920
00:57:24,930 --> 00:57:26,860
Is that so?

921
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:28,250
If we send a team out right away,

922
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:30,790
we'll be able to air the situation
live at the hospital when the show ends.

923
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,160
Get a script ready for the hosts.

924
00:57:32,170 --> 00:57:33,370
Okay.

925
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:34,260
One cut.

926
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:35,680
How do you find today's interview?

927
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:38,190
Seeing how Section TV has me on the radar,

928
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:43,190
I think I've become popular again recently.

929
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,620
This is news about Dok Go Jin.

930
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:45,500
- It's a flash bulletin.
- Yes.

931
00:57:45,510 --> 00:57:47,220
After this segment ends,
please read this out.

932
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:48,000
What is this?
A flash bulletin?

933
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:51,300
[Urgent!!]

934
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:51,750
- Dok Go Jin collapsed?
- Really?

935
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,390
It seems he collapsed.

936
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:57,390
The interview ends here!

937
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:02,350
We got to see the kind and warm personality
of Kim Jae Won.

938
00:58:03,830 --> 00:58:06,390
Yes, we've just received
an urgent piece of news.

939
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,450
Actor Dok Go Jin collapsed
from a heart attack

940
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:13,760
and will be undergoing surgery
earlier than scheduled.

941
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:18,730
Yes, our crew has headed for the hospital.

942
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:21,750
If there is any news,
we will inform everyone immediately.

943
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,900
Yes, Dok Go Jin is loved by many people.

944
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:30,500
We hope the surgery will be successful
and that he will return in a healthy state.

945
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:33,500
All right, we will now continue
with other news.

946
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:34,850
Gu Ae Jeong will present the next segment
to everyone.

947
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:38,090
Yes, I heard that you met Shin Min Ah
on Star Date this time.

948
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:39,730
Yes.

949
00:58:41,970 --> 00:58:44,020
Gu Ae Jeong?

950
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:47,100
I heard you visited
the youth district of Hongdae.

951
00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:50,920
How did you feel meeting Shin Min Ah?

952
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,990
What's wrong with Gu Ae Jeong?

953
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,300
Gu Ae Jeong.

954
00:58:56,310 --> 00:58:57,950
What's with her?

955
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,940
What is she doing?

956
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:00,970
What's with her?

957
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:03,290
Seriously...

958
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:04,610
Gu Ae Jeong, Gu Ae Jeong.

959
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:06,940
The news, the news...

960
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:11,680
I'm sorry.

961
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:12,910
- What's with her?
- What is she doing?

962
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:13,970
Gu Ae Jeong?

963
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:16,590
What's happening?

964
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:18,890
Where is she going?

965
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:21,260
Ah, what...?

966
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:22,620
Where is she going?

967
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:25,220
Ah... Cut to the next segment!

968
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:27,460
Lee Seung Kyu, please get ready
for the next segment.

969
00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:28,780
- What is happening?
- Get the script writer!

970
00:59:28,790 --> 00:59:30,230
Well...

971
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:33,490
There was some error in the program lineup.

972
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:36,640
- Isn't this a problem with live telecasts?
- Yes, yes.

973
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:40,680
But it often happens,
giving the production team a headache.

974
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:42,000
Ae Jeong!

975
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:43,930
How can you leave like this
in the middle of a live telecast?

976
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:44,830
I have to go.

977
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:47,230
Oppa, I have to go to him.

978
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:48,510
Aigoo, Ae Jeong!

979
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:52,120
We are now at the entrance to the hospital
where Dok Go Jin is going to have surgery.

980
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:54,780
Since his debut, Dok Go Jin
has received a lot of love from the public

981
00:59:54,790 --> 00:59:57,540
through various dramas and movies.

982
00:59:57,550 --> 01:00:01,260
However, we learnt that he...

983
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:12,210
Just believe in me.

984
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:15,160
I will save you.

985
01:00:15,430 --> 01:00:22,190
I seem to have something in my eyes

986
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:20,800
But isn't the heartbeat girl coming?

987
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:29,620
That's why my tears keep flowing

988
01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:28,400
I think she can't get in
because of the reporters crowding outside.

989
01:00:28,410 --> 01:00:32,240
We're going to conduct the surgery soon.
We don't have the time to wait for her.

990
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:36,410
I have been hiding a part of my heart

991
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:37,340
Shall I play that song for you
during the surgery in her place?

992
01:00:37,390 --> 01:00:44,870
A certain person can't even sense it
thus bringing me to tears

993
01:00:39,050 --> 01:00:40,880
It's okay.

994
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:45,480
She'll be singing live for me

995
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:48,410
Even if you cannot hear me

996
01:00:46,290 --> 01:00:48,380
somewhere out there.

997
01:00:48,410 --> 01:00:51,400
Even if you cannot hear my heart

998
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:55,190
The love my tears convey

999
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:58,900
Will you finally hear it someday?

1000
01:00:57,390 --> 01:01:00,280
There are so many reporters around,
I don't think we can go in.

1001
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:04,620
I just called Jae Seok and
he said the surgery is going to start soon.

1002
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:07,310
Because you are my man

1003
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:06,540
I have to see him.

1004
01:01:06,550 --> 01:01:08,160
Oppa, aren't there other entrances?

1005
01:01:07,410 --> 01:01:11,050
Because you are my love

1006
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:09,750
Other entrances?

1007
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,960
All right, let's go look for one.

1008
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:18,650
After sending you away and letting go,
you still remain and make me cry

1009
01:01:11,970 --> 01:01:14,290
Let's go over there.

1010
01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:22,060
Because you are my man

1011
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:26,340
It's because you are still my man

1012
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:33,610
I can't hold back these foolish tears

1013
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:37,080
Because you are my man

1014
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:36,920
You cannot enter this room.
Please wait outside.

1015
01:01:37,180 --> 01:01:40,750
Because you are my love

1016
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:48,380
Don't cry anymore, I am sorry
that I can't let you go (I love you)

1017
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:51,970
Because you are my man (You are my love)

1018
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:52,400
Yeah, it's me.

1019
01:01:51,970 --> 01:01:55,900
I cannot give you up at all

1020
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:57,220
Oppa, I'll just dash in.
Help me hold them back.

1021
01:01:55,900 --> 01:02:03,080
I'm begging you to listen to my heart

1022
01:01:57,230 --> 01:01:59,010
Ae Jeong!

1023
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:03,160
Ae Jeong, there's no point in going in.
He's already in the operating theatre.

1024
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:10,730
I'm begging you not to go any further away

1025
01:02:10,790 --> 01:02:11,950
[Operation in Progress]

1026
01:02:42,670 --> 01:02:45,870
I didn't even get to see his face.

1027
01:02:48,870 --> 01:02:50,230
He said he was afraid.

1028
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,900
What should I do?

1029
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:59,950
The only thing that works on me
is your song.

1030
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:02,910
Sing the Heartbeat song.

1031
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:08,150
When my heart gets stopped again,
you will make it beat and thump once more.

1032
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,790
That's why we met.

1033
01:03:17,970 --> 01:03:27,560
At first, we didn't get along

1034
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:32,570
We only fought

1035
01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:37,330
and frustrated each other

1036
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:42,530
It's so strange

1037
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:47,880
Suddenly our hearts connected

1038
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:51,290
When you're not around,

1039
01:03:54,940 --> 01:04:00,940
I'm dreaming you'll see me
with trembling lips waiting

1040
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:09,210
and that you'll act first to give me a hug

1041
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:22,950
goes "thump thump"

1042
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:30,440
I love only you,

1043
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:38,830
I yell with my whole heart

1044
01:04:39,820 --> 01:04:45,050
Do you by any chance... like me?

1045
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:46,570
Ding Dong.

1046
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:51,310
I find Gu Ae Jeong difficult.

1047
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:54,180
She's not at all easy.

1048
01:04:54,620 --> 01:04:57,340
She's really difficult.

1049
01:04:58,950 --> 01:05:04,580
Actually, my heart was really thumping hard.

1050
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:09,990
I'm broken
so I can't catch hold of you tightly.

1051
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:15,090
So, this time round, you come to me.

1052
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:20,550
So that I won't stop moving,

1053
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:25,590
This faraway thing called "love"

1054
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:23,740
come and recharge me.

1055
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:27,750
I'm dreaming you'll see me with

1056
01:05:26,070 --> 01:05:33,250
If it comes into sight,
it will bring heartache and tears, right?

1057
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:31,900
trembling lips waiting and my eyes closed

1058
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:36,340
That's why I left you

1059
01:05:33,890 --> 01:05:36,860
Let's stop the heart functions now.

1060
01:05:36,350 --> 01:05:39,660
So that I can fall in love with my love

1061
01:05:36,870 --> 01:05:39,300
Yes, the heart functions has been stopped.

1062
01:05:39,970 --> 01:05:47,050
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

1063
01:05:53,410 --> 01:05:57,710
Don't forget me

1064
01:05:57,710 --> 01:06:01,790
Even if I only lived for a second

1065
01:06:01,790 --> 01:06:05,080
I'll be the one and only heart...

1066
01:06:05,490 --> 01:06:07,480
