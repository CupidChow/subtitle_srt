You rejected Kang Se Ri's invitation

3
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,450
You rejected Kang Se Ri's invitation

4
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,850
just to go location scouting with me?

5
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,850
I sent her flowers.

6
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,720
Since the broadcast, haven't you been getting more patients?

7
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,390
Why do you think I'm going with hyung to escape?
(Hyung - Older brother)

8
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:08,400
These days, I'm not sure whether I'm looking at an illness or a fan.

9
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:27,350
Looks like Gu Ae Jeong still performs in this small city's nightclub.

10
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,350
Is Gu Ae Jeong going to sing?

11
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:31,350
Of course!

12
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,290
It's been ten years since the National Treasure Girls' debut.

13
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:41,960
Some people sing at concerts. Some people sing in nightclubs.

14
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,700
That's really...

15
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,240
Hey, take some water over there.

16
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,970
Welcome! Are you here alone?

17
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,440
That is... Gu Ae Jeong is here tonight, right?

18
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,040
Ah, Gu Ae Jeong?

19
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,380
I know her. Can I please see her for a moment?

20
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,910
She was supposed to perform tonight,

21
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,580
but it was suddenly cancelled and she left.

22
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,320
Pardon?

23
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,720
She suddenly cancelled!

24
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,720
Hey, In Jeong! I told you to take down that poster of Gu Ae Jeong!

25
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,190
This kid, is he deaf?

26
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,900
Excuse me...

27
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,970
Mr. Dok Go Jin?

28
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:01,040
Where are we?

29
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,850
After being in such a pathetic reality,

30
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:07,320
then finding yourself here with me, don't you feel like you're dreaming?

31
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,790
Mr. Dok Go Jin, did you bring me here?

32
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:15,790
But I was at the nightclub waiting to sing, wasn't I?

33
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,060
That performance

34
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,130
on the tenth anniversary of your debut,

35
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:25,070
which you waited for while choking on kimbap...
(Kimbap - dried seaweed rolls with rice)

36
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,000
I paid for it.

37
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,010
Why?

38
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,940
I wanted to see your pitiful situation play out.

39
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,480
But as I watched, I became very angry.

40
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,080
Why?

41
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,080
Because I hate seeing you that way.

42
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,950
Why?

43
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:42,020
I can hardly believe it myself.

44
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,750
So of course you wouldn't understand the situation either.

45
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,960
There's only one answer to all of these questions.

46
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,430
What do you think it is?

47
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:05,370
Mr. Dok Go Jin, could it be...

48
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,050
that you like me?

49
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,530
Ding dong.

50
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,730
You really like me?

51
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,930
That's right.

52
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:40,140
Yes, that's why I feel so ashamed of myself.

53
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:54,960
I thought you said you were going to meet someone? Did you meet them?

54
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,090
No, I missed her, so we didn't meet.

55
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:59,490
So you didn't even see her face? Who was it?

56
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,440
<i> Has she already gone back to Seoul? </i>

57
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,060
I don't know who she is,

58
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,130
but you seem very disappointed that you didn't get to see her.

59
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:45,340
Sunbae, that person is Dok Go Jin, right?
(Sunbae - Senior, mentor)

60
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,880
Wow, even you recognize him. Looks like Dok Go Jin really is famous, huh?

61
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,350
He's dating our program's host, Kang Se Ri, you know.

62
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,280
Really?

63
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,890
But why did you suddenly ask about Dok Go Jin?

64
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,890
It's just that I saw him earlier.

65
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:04,960
Today is the tenth anniversary of Kang Se Ri's debut. Wouldn't they be together?

66
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,360
Why would he be hanging around this place?

67
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:38,260
Just now, you confessed that you like me, didn't you?

68
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:41,600
It wasn't a confession, it was an admission.

69
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,930
Because you always dangle in front of my face,

70
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,400
I kept thinking about you. You're always on my mind.

71
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,810
In that case, wouldn't anyone confess?

72
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:54,010
Whether it?s a confession or an admission, you're saying you like me.

73
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:54,740
How many times do you have to ask?

74
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,680
It's just that I can?t believe it.

75
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,350
You may not believe it.

76
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,220
But numbers don't lie.

77
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:09,020
It's over 110. Already 20 beyond the safety zone.

78
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,760
I feel a bit sick now.

79
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,960
Let me see.

80
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,500
Maybe this is defective?

81
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:24,110
If you don't believe what you see, check it yourself.

82
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:49,260
So, don't you have anything to say?

83
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:52,870
What's wrong? How about "I'm honored. I'm very grateful"?

84
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:56,270
You're so moved that you're speechless, right?

85
00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:00,540
Since I know you're not thick-skinned, just accept the facts.

86
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,280
Are you trembling so much that you can't speak?

87
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:10,490
I do feel honored and thankful, but I'm not trembling.

88
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:14,620
- What?
- After hearing Dok Go Jin's heart race,

89
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:18,560
This might sound really old-fashioned,

90
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,630
but my heart isn't racing.

91
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,300
Yes, you already have done what you should have done.

92
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:30,370
In these kinds of circumstances, people do tend to play hard to get.

93
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,840
It's not like that.

94
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,640
Then what is it?

95
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,180
There's only one answer. What do you think it is?

96
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:46,920
I... don't like Dok Go Jin. I'm sorry.

97
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:54,260
You, are you out of your mind?

98
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:57,600
Or are you not fully awake?

99
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,340
Well, this situation is kind of like a dream.

100
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,200
That's right.

101
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,410
This should have been like a dream for you.

102
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,340
Not just anyone can be in a place like this.

103
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:09,140
But here you are. Why?

104
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,480
Because I am Dok Go Jin.

105
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,880
That theme park, it's already past closing time.

106
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,690
Do you know why the lights are still on?

107
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,750
Because Korea's best actor is here,

108
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,690
Korea's number one amusement park turned the lights on.

109
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:27,100
If I don't want it to be dark, the light will always come on for me.

110
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,630
But, Gu Ae Jeong, how dare you?

111
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,300
You shattered this dreamlike scene?

112
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,900
If it's a dream, I should wake up.

113
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:38,040
Dok Go Jin, you see,

114
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,380
I don't like daydreaming.

115
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,980
I need to live with my eyes wide open.

116
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,980
So, let's just leave this place.

117
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,650
That too. Tell them to turn off the lights, all right?

118
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:55,990
Let?s just pretend we never had this dream.

119
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,530
That way you won't have to feel ashamed.

120
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,230
=What's wrong with Dok Go Jin?=

121
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,360
It's nothing.

122
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,830
Let's talk again when I arrive.

123
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,770
I'm going back home now.

124
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,650
Omo!
(Omo - Oh My)

125
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,660
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

126
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,790
You almost caused an accident!

127
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,130
Dok Go Jin?

128
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:07,060
Get in the car!

129
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:07,600
What?

130
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,460
Leave your car here and get into mine.

131
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,730
We already talked it over, didn't we?

132
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,000
I want to go back home.

133
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,540
You won't get in?

134
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,610
Then this time, I'll just say you rear-ended me,

135
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,870
and then I'll go to the hospital.

136
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:18,810
Are you crazy?

137
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,010
I already got rejected by Peter.

138
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:24,010
You think I can't be rejected by you?

139
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,350
Get in!

140
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:33,890
Just like I didn't spread rumors about you being rejected by Peter,

141
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:36,760
I won't spread rumors about this, either.

142
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,960
How thoughtful of you.

143
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,830
It's awkward and embarrassing. Why did you have to follow me?

144
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:45,370
I'll just forget everything.

145
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:50,040
Thanks to Dok Go Jin, I got to see pretty flowers today. That's how I'll remember it.

146
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,510
So thanks to me, you got to see pretty flowers?

147
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,780
Okay then. I'll tell you a story about a pretty flower, too.

148
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:02,050
But storytelling time means I need to concentrate, so I'll stop the car.

149
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:17,530
The story is called "Camellia."

150
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,200
Such a pretty title!

151
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,410
The story is also very pretty. Listen well.

152
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,470
The main character was a fine person.

153
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,140
His family was good, and he was good.

154
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,810
Lacking any shortcomings,

155
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,280
he was the perfect child.

156
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,280
So what was the matter with this child?

157
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:38,620
He liked the most annoying child in the neighborhood.

158
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:40,820
Annoying?

159
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:44,430
Yes, an extremely nasty and dirty person.

160
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,490
But for some reason,

161
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,760
he really liked that annoying girl,

162
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,500
and sent her delicious potatoes as a gift.

163
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,300
But she didn't appreciate how good the gift was,

164
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,970
and she rejected those potatoes.

165
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,970
How do you think the main character felt?

166
00:12:55,970 --> 00:13:00,980
It wouldn't be just awkward and embarrassed, right?

167
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,580
And?

168
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:07,920
That annoying girl had a chicken that she treasured.

169
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,650
A chicken?

170
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:11,450
Yeah, a chicken.

171
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:14,460
After the main character's delicious potatoes were rejected,

172
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,590
he began to torment that ungrateful girl's chicken.

173
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:21,730
Thoroughly, and without regret.

174
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,670
Then what happened?

175
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:29,470
That annoying girl began crying pitifully.

176
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:32,270
She apologized and begged for mercy

177
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:36,950
underneath the camellia blossoms.

178
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,950
I'm now working hard to find out,

179
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:43,550
Gu Ae Jeong.

180
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:47,490
What exactly is your chicken?

181
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:25,590
Ah! The cherry blossom of shame is fading.

182
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:36,340
It's time for the camellia of revenge to bloom!

183
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,160
Oh? Here he is again.

184
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,170
It's me, Kang Se Ri.

185
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:13,710
I received the flowers you sent me.

186
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,910
You were busy, right?

187
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,180
There was something on today, I went out of town.

188
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,980
What are you doing now?

189
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,050
=I just got back home.=

190
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,860
So do you want to come to my fanmeeting?

191
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,730
PD Kim said he would come as well.

192
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,660
I'll be busy tomorrow, so I'm afraid I have to rest.

193
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,860
I'm not saying that you must come.

194
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,330
I was just asking.

195
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,140
Can I ask something, too?

196
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,540
What is it?

197
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,940
This person called Dok Go Jin,

198
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:47,210
is he with you now?

199
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,950
Why are you curious about that?

200
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,550
You didn't have dinner together, either, did you?

201
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,220
We're not together now.

202
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,290
He went somewhere for another matter.

203
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,750
But you're not even an entertainment reporter,

204
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,890
so why are you curious?

205
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,490
It's my private life.

206
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:06,960
I'm sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable.

207
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,230
I hope it goes smoothly!

208
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,640
He hung up?

209
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,640
Is he embarrassed, asking stuff like that?

210
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,510
But whether or not I'm with Dok Go Jin,

211
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,650
why would he be curious?

212
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,650
Isn't this your house?

213
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:34,190
Why did you stop here?

214
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:37,860
I stopped my car in front of my house. What's wrong with that?

215
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,680
Why aren't you getting out?

216
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:07,560
Why are you being like this?

217
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,960
I can't go inside.

218
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,490
What?

219
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:11,490
Do I look easy to you?

220
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,830
It doesn't seem like you're the hard-to-get type, that's for sure.

221
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:15,360
Get out.

222
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,030
I'm not going into that house.

223
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,370
Who told you to go into my house?

224
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:22,170
You go to your own house.

225
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:28,040
Didn't you bring me here so I would go inside with you?

226
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,380
I didn't. Get out.

227
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,250
I mean, you should take me to my house.

228
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,990
Why would you bring me here, causing me to misunderstand?

229
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,590
If I delivered you to your door, wouldn't it be too easy?

230
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:43,590
From now on, I'm going to make you live a really hard life.

231
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:47,800
Have you already forgotten the camellia story? Didn't I tell you to listen carefully? And now you've forgotten.

232
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,870
Mr. Dok Go Jin, do you know that you're a very strange person?

233
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:55,000
Normally, if a man gets rejected

234
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,010
he just walks away, or

235
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,670
tries to land her by changing her mind.

236
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,740
It's only normal.

237
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,620
My ability to hold a grudge is like my height; I won't let it go.

238
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,420
With a bad temper, I never thought of being nice to you.

239
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,550
I'll use my expert methods

240
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,090
and make you, Gu Ae Jeong, tremble.

241
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:14,620
Eh?

242
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,090
Next time no matter what I do, how I do,

243
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,630
and the trembling nervousness,

244
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,960
whether I'm around or not,

245
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,500
when you think about me, your heart will start pounding.

246
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,440
What a weirdo.

247
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,640
Go ahead, then.

248
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,710
I'm pretty easygoing,

249
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:37,250
so I'll be able to handle all your childish tricks.

250
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,250
They're probably at Hyeong Kyu's level.

251
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,180
I'll just dote on you.

252
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,590
Dote on me?

253
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,790
Well then, you can try doting on me.

254
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,260
Miss Gu Ae Jeong.

255
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:54,460
Today, you're really beautiful.

256
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,200
Isn't that what the fake Dok Go Jin said to you?

257
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,870
If you talk like this to the real Dok Go Jin, he'll dote on you.

258
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:05,210
Come. Come and dote on me.

259
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:07,610
Why are you being childish like this?

260
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,540
I can only praise you if you actually have something worth praising.

261
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,410
How could I not have something worth praising?

262
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,480
Because everything's perfect from top to toe.

263
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,150
That's why I can get several billion won to shoot a commercial.

264
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:18,620
How can your mouth be so full of praises regardless whether it's open or shut?

265
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:21,620
You dared to casually touch the fake Dok Go Jin.

266
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,560
But you don't dare to touch the real Dok Go Jin, right?

267
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,090
I am that kind of Dok Go Jin!

268
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:29,430
Like you could really handle this!

269
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:32,970
Then let me, in all seriousness, praise you!

270
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,110
Our Dok Go, so cute! Our Dok Go!

271
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,250
Dok Go, Dok Go, Dok Go!

272
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,710
You think I'm your nephew Ding Dong?

273
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:48,580
The method of expressing affection towards a seven-year-old boy

274
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:51,390
and the method of expressing affection towards a 37-year-old man

275
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,120
are different.

276
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:58,730
You want to know how it's really done?

277
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,350
No matter how cool I am, how good my appetite is,

278
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,420
if you choose to throw yourself at me this way,

279
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,890
my heart will naturally pound.

280
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,620
Once you notice the palpitations,

281
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,690
you'll become fixated, and

282
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:35,230
one day, you'll see camellias in my background.

283
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,100
Gu Ae Jeong.

284
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,100
Watch me forever and always.

285
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,170
As well as my back.

286
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:49,380
The total of this will one day equal a camellia.

287
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,380
See? You're already starting to care about me.

288
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,050
You can't even go home.

289
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:01,720
Hurry up and go back!

290
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,730
What should I do?

291
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:26,680
I was so embarrassed, it felt like my eyes, ears, nose, and mouth had all disappeared.

292
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,480
Overcome!

293
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,220
I have overcome greatly.

294
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,960
I'm tired.

295
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,760
Too tired, too tired.

296
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:37,830
-=Camellia=-

297
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:40,300
-=Camellia=-

298
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:53,110
Just because I didn't accept his potatoes, he'll always torture my chicken!

299
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:57,250
I wonder how the story ends?

300
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:10,860
So, are you not going to be like that anymore?

301
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,990
I won't.

302
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:15,060
Try being like that again next time.

303
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,330
I will always torture you.

304
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:22,600
Sure, sure! It won't be like that again in the future.

305
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,010
The chicken's dead so don't you worry.

306
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,150
I won't complain.

307
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,230
Out of nowhere, there was a push.

308
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,830
Grabbing me by my shoulders, falling straight down...

309
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:57,640
I fell, together with him,

310
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,970
into oblivion...

311
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:03,310
Into the camellias that were in full bloom.

312
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:12,520
What on earth is Dok Go Jin intending to do?

313
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,190
He wants to "fall" with me?

314
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,670
Smelling that fresh fragrance...

315
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:25,730
it was heavenly...

316
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:30,870
and I also fell into an endless whirlpool of emotions.

317
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,810
During Kang Se Ri's debut anniversary,

318
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:38,880
Dok Go Jin surprised her with a midnight date at the theme park.

319
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:42,080
I wasn't even near the theme park, so I couldn't have gone.

320
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,020
What is this?

321
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:47,160
He didn't even go to the fanmeeting.

322
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,290
But this is much more interesting than the breakup rumors, isn't it?

323
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:51,490
Is Dok Go Jin dating someone?

324
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:53,760
What are you talking about?

325
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,030
Even if he was dating someone,

326
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:58,300
he wouldn't be doing this kind of thing to woo her.

327
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,170
That doesn't make sense.

328
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,170
Look at the news!

329
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:11,050
That's right. Now that you're on a show,

330
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,910
you should be interested in the entertainment industry.

331
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,180
Omo!

332
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:17,990
Yun Pil Ju's friend Kang Se Ri is in the headlines!

333
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,990
Apparently, they break up and make up every day.

334
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:24,390
I just don't know what's real anymore.

335
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:26,390
The person who was with him

336
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:28,800
wasn't her, though.

337
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,870
You're close to Kang Se Ri now.

338
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,730
Did she tell you anything about it?

339
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:33,200
I want to share it with my friends,

340
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,870
tell me.

341
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,470
Give me your ear.

342
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:42,480
Mother, Kang Se Ri and I aren't that close.

343
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:46,620
That punk, Dok Go Jin, was busy falling in love

344
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:49,750
while he was supposed to be watching our Ae Jeong's performance!

345
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,950
Selfish punk!

346
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,760
Father, something's fishy.

347
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,900
It was obviously Dok Go Jin who got me to cancel

348
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,100
all of Ae Jeong's performances before taking her away.

349
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,970
Is he intending to use her moonlighting against her

350
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:08,840
and to get us in trouble?

351
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:13,240
This guy isn't even the president. What's with him?

352
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,850
After ten years,

353
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:25,450
Se Ri's really become somebody, hasn't she?

354
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:28,590
Back then she was a nobody.

355
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:33,600
Even received a proposal from someone like Dok Go Jin!

356
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,200
Unni.
(Unni - Older sister)

357
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,470
Receiving a confession

358
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:39,870
from a guy like Dok Go Jin, is it good?

359
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:42,070
If the man is too famous, wouldn't it burdensome?

360
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:44,070
Although it's a bit annoying,

361
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,610
Se Ri is in the top level.

362
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,010
Their levels compliment each other.

363
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:49,610
But if it's like me at this type of level...

364
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:50,480
wouldn't there be a big difference?

365
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,680
Being together with Dok Go Jin, his worth

366
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,820
would plummet, and become akin to having been dumped into the trash.

367
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,820
I am sorry.

368
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,560
Nah, it's okay.

369
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,160
I will not become trash.

370
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,360
If I continue to mix with such people...

371
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,830
I will definitely be viewed very lowly and will be scolded by everyone, right?

372
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:14,700
Is Dok Go seeing anyone else recently?

373
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,170
Eh?

374
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:20,640
Is there really a woman?

375
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,180
Dok Go doesn't usually act like that because of a woman, though.

376
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,180
Miss Gu Ae Jeong.

377
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,650
- Hello.
- Hello.

378
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:28,980
I have something to discuss with you.

379
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:32,250
So before you go, please wait for me in the office.

380
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:43,870
<i> What should I do? </i>

381
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:46,670
<i> Being together is awkward. </i>

382
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:49,000
<i> Should I just leave? </i>

383
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,540
<i> No. If I just go like that, </i>

384
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:53,010
<i> it will seem like I care. </i>

385
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:55,610
<i> I'll just pretend to be unconcerned. </i>

386
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,880
Excuse me!

387
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,890
Gu Ae Jeong, did you sleep well?

388
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:11,490
Yes, I slept like a baby.

389
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:13,560
I couldn't sleep,

390
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,170
thinking of Gu Ae Jeong.

391
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:22,900
If I were to be more specific,

392
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,570
it's because I was thinking of Gu Ae Jeong's chicken.

393
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:26,640
You mean...

394
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,580
Didn't I say I'd find your chicken?

395
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,110
I've found one.

396
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,910
Should I show you?

397
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,790
What is that?

398
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:53,800
That's the flyer from the nightclub show.

399
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,600
Gu Ae Jeong.

400
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,470
Secretly doing shows without the agency's knowledge

401
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:58,670
is a breach of contract, isn't it?

402
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:00,280
If the representative saw this flyer,

403
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,540
things would become very difficult for you, wouldn't they?

404
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,410
Right now you're trying to anger me and complain,

405
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:06,010
is that why you're here with that thing?

406
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,150
Seeing your expression,

407
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:11,620
it appears I've caught the right chicken.

408
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:15,360
Dok Go Jin, are you really not going to get rid of it?

409
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,690
I'll give you money!

410
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:18,360
Give it to me.

411
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,760
Give it to me!

412
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,030
Where are you touching?

413
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,070
Dok Go, you're here!

414
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:06,070
Gu Ae Jeong, why are you still standing? Sit down.

415
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:22,020
I heard something interesting took place yesterday.

416
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,090
What happened?

417
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:27,630
I went to view some flowers.

418
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:32,370
You went to view flowers, and nothing else?

419
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,040
Yes, only to look at some beautiful flowers.

420
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,040
That's all.

421
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:44,180
You two can chat. I'm going.

422
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:52,120
Ah, Representative Moon.

423
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:09,470
What? Do you have something else to say?

424
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,080
This...

425
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,480
What is it? Tell me.

426
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,020
The cherry blossoms are in bloom.

427
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:31,230
Representative Moon, you should also go enjoy the flowers when you're free.

428
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,440
He just won't tell

429
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,580
with whom he enjoyed the flowers, will he?

430
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:51,510
Miss Gu Ae Jeong, you saw the news, didn't you?

431
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:52,910
To stop Dok Go Jin's scandal,

432
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,580
you've worked really hard, haven't you?

433
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,520
Isn't it the first time you've seen him act so melodramatic?

434
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,250
The first time.

435
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:59,320
Yep, the first time.

436
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:02,790
Before, it was just Kang Se Ri following him.

437
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:07,000
Photos of them together were released.

438
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,930
Since there were continuously strange rumors about him being gay,

439
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:10,270
the timing was perfect.

440
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:13,200
So I didn't stop them and allowed them to continue.

441
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:17,540
Anyway, it's not as if it's a formal break up.

442
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:20,610
But this time, it involves a huge CF contract,

443
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:23,480
and one bad scandal could break the whole deal.

444
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,410
Why did you want to see me?

445
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:30,220
Ae Jeong, I looked for your solo album and couldn't find it.

446
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,220
If you can manage it by yourself,

447
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,420
bring some samples to me and I'll take a look.

448
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,290
What for?

449
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:36,290
Don't you want to sing again?

450
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:37,960
Are you going to let me record an album?

451
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,430
Isn't it a good thing!?

452
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:41,760
She really said to give you an album, did she?

453
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,830
She said she would consider it.

454
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:44,500
Ae Jeong!

455
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,770
Your entertainment career has returned!

456
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:49,300
A regular variety show guest in addition to recording albums.

457
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:54,040
If I were to sincerely welcome the second season of spring...

458
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:58,310
I'll work diligently, oppa.
(Oppa - Older brother, boyfriend)

459
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:00,780
Becoming trash just won't do.

460
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,850
Have to cheer up, right?

461
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:09,990
Miss Ae Jeong, are you leaving?

462
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:10,790
Yes.

463
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:12,790
Are you going to perform at the nightclub today, too?

464
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,330
How did you know about that?

465
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:15,400
I saw the flyer.

466
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,670
It was posted nearby.

467
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,540
So you saw that.

468
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:26,680
That thing...

469
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,940
I hope you won't tell my company about it.

470
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,680
You did it in secret, then?

471
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,880
All right, all right.

472
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:36,420
But, I saw it with Pil Ju as well.

473
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,820
Please don't tell anyone about it.

474
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:43,360
Living as a celebrity is really difficult.

475
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,630
Please understand me.

476
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:47,900
Okay, I get it.

477
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,770
In any case, I didn't stay for very long at that place.

478
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:51,900
Anyway...

479
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,640
That day was the tenth anniversary of your debut, wasn't it?

480
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,510
Did it go well?

481
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:59,570
Most of the people came to see the fireworks.

482
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:01,840
The fireworks are very beautiful.

483
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,380
In the future, go to that nightclub to play and enjoy yourself.

484
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,850
If you tell them you know me,

485
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:08,380
they'll light up the place with even more beautiful fireworks for you.

486
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,520
Do nightclubs sell fireworks?

487
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,250
They use it for lighting!

488
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:14,460
I've never seen it because I've never gone to nightclubs.

489
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,590
You're saying that you've never been to a nightclub?

490
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:21,530
Going to play at nightclubs is fun, sometimes.

491
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:23,530
To me, learning is more interesting.

492
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:25,400
What?

493
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:29,000
Mr. Yun Pil Ju, your mother should be very happy, right?

494
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,010
Having a son who's most interested in learning.

495
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:35,410
I should also give birth to a son like that in the future.

496
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:36,950
To have a son like that,

497
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:39,950
you should marry a man who's like that.

498
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,620
Is that right?

499
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:45,420
But, those kinds of men,

500
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:47,020
they listen well to their mother.

501
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:50,760
So they won't marry a woman like me.

502
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,890
Even a guy like me

503
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:54,160
sometimes doesn't listen to his mother and rebels against her.

504
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,560
How so?

505
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,100
I deliberately do the things my mother dislikes.

506
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,300
Drinking alcohol, smoking, gambling...

507
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,370
No, it's not that.

508
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:05,110
It's a secret, though.

509
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,580
I eat ramen.

510
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,240
Ramen?

511
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,710
Yes.

512
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,450
My deceased father said,

513
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:13,380
we must listen to everything that our women say

514
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,580
and make them happy.

515
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:19,120
But sometimes, we get angry and don't understand, too.

516
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:22,660
Then, father and I would cook ramen to eat together.

517
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,460
We'd eat a ton of ramen,

518
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,800
and then eat my mom's food with no appetite

519
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,130
as our sole form of rebellion.

520
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,800
I really have to have a son like you.

521
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,140
Okay, let's start.

522
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,870
Back to back.

523
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:38,870
Okay!

524
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,080
Good.

525
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:45,680
One more.

526
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,820
Whom did you go to see the flowers with?

527
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,090
Shouldn't you tell me that?

528
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:54,490
No matter what, isn't our concept a couple?

529
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,630
It's just a concept.

530
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,900
If there's someone I want to date,

531
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,770
I'll definitely let you know.

532
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,500
When the time comes, don't be too cool.

533
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,970
Show me that you're jealous instead.

534
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:14,710
I'll do that, too.

535
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:16,980
You don't have to do that.

536
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:20,650
You already have someone, then?

537
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,320
She has got to be a fine woman.

538
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,720
Otherwise, I will never let you go.

539
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:32,660
Even if you meet someone who isn't great,

540
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:35,330
I will still let you go.

541
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:41,940
We're going to be meeting with a really popular songwriter,

542
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,340
so take eating together

543
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,410
as just another way of meeting each other.

544
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:47,010
Okay.

545
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:51,410
Yes?

546
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:52,810
Why?

547
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:54,620
Dok Go?

548
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:57,690
Got it. Bye.

549
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,360
We have to go to Dok Go's filming for just a little while.

550
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,020
Why would we go there?

551
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:05,760
Here's the conte.
(Conte - A short narrative tale)

552
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,770
Dok Go Jin.

553
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:15,440
Shave it, all right?

554
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,640
I absolutely won't shave my beard.

555
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,440
Dok Go Jin's best feature

556
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:22,780
is this.

557
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,910
If this is shaved, the quality will be as well.

558
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:27,850
The advertisers are adamant with this request.

559
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:31,390
I'm asking you to show a new visual image.

560
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,260
Yes, right.

561
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,860
I saw the clean-shaven version of you the the fans PS-ed, hyung.

562
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,790
You completely looked like a pretty boy, hyung! A pretty boy!

563
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:39,930
Wah, you're already handsome.

564
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:41,260
If you become a pretty boy,

565
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,530
girls will surely go crazy.

566
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:45,800
Yeah, it'll drive the girls crazy.

567
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,670
Crazy!

568
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,140
Look at your conte.

569
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,740
Yes.

570
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,540
Gu Ae Jeong, what do you think?

571
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,010
Eh?

572
00:36:57,010 --> 00:37:00,820
What do you think about me shaving my beard?

573
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:01,950
Well... I'm not sure.

574
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:06,420
What? Why would he ask her?

575
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,220
You're not sure?

576
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,090
Having a moustache is pretty handsome. Why? Can't I?

577
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:17,430
See, these reactions will probably surface. Reactions that are neither good or bad.

578
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:20,100
I absolutely will not shave it.

579
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,790
"I'm not sure," you say?

580
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:49,600
Dok Go Jin.

581
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,330
Why do you have to make things so hard?

582
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:53,870
Just shave the beard, all right?

583
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:56,740
"I'm not sure."

584
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:04,610
I think you will look really good if you shave.

585
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,080
Like a pretty boy, I'll bet.

586
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,550
Women will go crazy, I'm sure.

587
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:10,950
This will do, right?

588
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:13,290
"I'm not sure."

589
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:17,490
You're intentionally doing this to me, aren't you?

590
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:19,490
Just so that I'll be embarrassed, right?

591
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:20,430
Ding dong!

592
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:21,900
Is your mouth a cow bell?

593
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,230
Otherwise, why does it keep going "ding dong, ding dong"?

594
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,900
That way it can open the door and go inside.

595
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:29,970
The door to where?

596
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:31,310
Gu Ae Jeong's chicken farm.

597
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:33,640
Ding dong ding dong, ko ko da ko ko.

598
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,310
Have to catch the chicken!

599
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:40,050
I searched for the "Camellia" story and read it.

600
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:43,250
Regardless of how you catch the chicken, bullying it,

601
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:46,520
I absolutely will not be together with you. I'll hide in the camellia flower bushes.

602
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,390
What?

603
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:49,320
I said I do not care.

604
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,590
I told you already.

605
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:52,930
I am very easygoing.

606
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,060
If you say that,

607
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:58,400
then catching the chicken has no meaning.

608
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,000
Fine.

609
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,800
Very easygoing and adaptable,

610
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,210
untainted by flowers, completely indifferent Gu Ae Jeong.

611
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,080
What do you think,

612
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,810
if I shave this off?

613
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:11,150
When you're dealing with a 1 billion won CF, you have to get rid of it.

614
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:14,620
Beside those factors, what do you think?

615
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:20,360
I think it'll look good.

616
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:23,360
Really?

617
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:25,030
I'll shave it then.

618
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:26,560
Eh?

619
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,360
I'll shave it because of you.

620
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:30,570
What are you saying?

621
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:32,770
So if I said not to, would you not shave it?

622
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,240
Of course!

623
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,300
Should I not?

624
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:38,510
Of course you should.

625
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:40,640
With all the staff waiting for you down there...

626
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,780
Please hurry up and do it, Mr. Dok Go Jin.

627
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,110
But I'll shave only because of you.

628
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:47,580
So you must do something for me, too.

629
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,050
What is it?

630
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:53,390
Omo, it looks really great!

631
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:55,190
Dok Go Jin, you're the best.

632
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:58,260
See, it feels so much more powerful!

633
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,530
We should have done this before!

634
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:04,200
I knew you were the best. The best!

635
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,200
Who ever thought it would be like this, right?

636
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,600
After shaving it off, it's so much better.

637
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,340
It's improved your image.

638
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,670
Good, preparation complete.

639
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,740
With final makeup, that will be enough.

640
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,480
Miss Gu Ae Jeong.

641
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:22,550
The photographers say that your lips are just fine.

642
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:26,690
Dok Go also said that if you do it he will be willing to do it.

643
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,760
Since it's only make-up.

644
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,360
Don't feel awkward. Please help us, all right?

645
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,560
Don't think of Dok Go Jin like a fan.

646
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:37,030
This must be good fortune you accumulated in your past life, to get such a good opportunity.

647
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,630
Good. Kevin?

648
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:40,170
Ready?

649
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:41,170
Yeah, they're ready.

650
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:49,640
So, I want you to kiss him lightly on the cheek.

651
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:52,850
Beautiful lips right here.

652
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,850
Not too strongly.

653
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:57,720
Just lightly.

654
00:40:57,990 --> 00:40:58,920
Okay?

655
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:00,720
Okay.

656
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:07,660
Good. Now, just lean in,

657
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:11,200
and put those beautiful lips right...

658
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:20,610
- No, no, no, no. It's not the right place.
- No?

659
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:22,140
Can we clean?

660
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:27,020
A little bit closer to the lips.

661
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:29,220
Okay, let's try again.

662
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,950
Just where I showed you.

663
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:33,960
No, no, no!

664
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,290
It's still not right.

665
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:37,160
Please, clean it again.

666
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:41,300
No, no, no!

667
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,500
No.

668
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:44,630
No!

669
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,970
Please...

670
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,780
Are you nervous?

671
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:01,980
Then just close your eyes and stay still.

672
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,020
Okay?

673
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:37,750
Okay!

674
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:38,950
Perfect.

675
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:40,620
Okay, let's go.

676
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:06,980
It doesn't matter if you're seeing me or not,

677
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:11,520
I'll make your heart pound when you think of me.

678
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:17,260
I'm going crazy.

679
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:19,800
I'll wash up and clear my head.

680
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,130
All right.

681
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,410
Omo!

682
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:35,340
It doesn't matter if you're seeing me or not,

683
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:39,680
I'll make your heart pound when you think of me.

684
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,890
Why am I seeing him here?

685
00:43:57,170 --> 00:44:01,040
I should get some fresh air to clear my head.

686
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:26,930
Looks like I've gone mad.

687
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:39,670
-=Camellia=-

688
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:52,290
What's the matter?

689
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:53,960
=I have somewhere to go with you,=

690
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,560
=so come out.=

691
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:58,430
You think I'll follow you there?

692
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:01,160
=Isn't your heart thumping right now?=

693
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,100
=At a time like this, it would be best to figure out what's happening.=

694
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:07,170
=Because I was once that way.=

695
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:09,840
=I'll be more low-key today.=

696
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,310
=I'm already at your doorstep. It's all up to you.=

697
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:14,040
=Come downstairs.=

698
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:15,580
Omo!

699
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:34,800
What are you doing? Come down quickly!

700
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:38,330
Fine then.

701
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:40,670
Let's see where this goes.

702
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:42,470
After seeing the result, I can return to normal.

703
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:44,010
Right?

704
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:53,950
Dok Go Jin hyung has gone out alone again.

705
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:57,020
He's going out for a movie with someone this time.

706
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:57,890
Movie?

707
00:45:57,890 --> 00:45:59,750
Dok Go hyung said it was necessary to respect his own movie.

708
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:02,820
So he would always go to the cinema to watch the first and last screenings of his movies.

709
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:06,290
Ah! Today is the last day Dok Go Jin's movie "Fighter" is screening, right?

710
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:09,700
So he booked the entire VIP screening room.

711
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:12,900
Usually, even even if I pleaded, he would insist on dragging me along.

712
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,100
But today he told me not to go.

713
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:16,570
It's strange, right?

714
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:19,310
He must have found someone to take my place.

715
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,180
Gu Ae Jeong.

716
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:32,390
Why exactly do I like you?

717
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:33,660
Eh?

718
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:38,530
You, with your cheap clothes, and shabby background...

719
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:40,600
What's wrong with me?

720
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:41,600
How would I know what you, with your noble appearance

721
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,400
and rich background,

722
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,400
think?

723
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:47,140
Why would you ask me that?

724
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:50,140
Then, whom should I tell about me liking you?

725
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,410
Besides you, the other party, I don't have anyone else to discuss this with.

726
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:54,340
You're only doing this because you find telling others about it embarrassing.

727
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:57,080
And so you hunt me down and consult me about it, right?

728
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,480
Of course! So you must remember to keep it confidential.

729
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:03,080
If you go around boasting about this to others, I'll sue you, okay?

730
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:06,690
Having this out in the open, I actually feel more comfortable...

731
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:09,360
Though I can't help but feel a little suspicious.

732
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:13,360
So let me seriously consider for a moment...

733
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,700
Gu Ae Jeong.

734
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:18,430
You don't happen to possess some sort of mystical power, do you?

735
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:19,230
Mystical power?

736
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:22,770
I figured that everything could be explained if you had such a power.

737
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:25,510
You know, witches can write spells

738
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:27,310
to cause a change of heart in a cheating husband.

739
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:28,710
Don't people speak of such things?

740
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:31,380
That can apply here too. Because you have such a mystical power

741
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:33,120
to control my heart.

742
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,050
Could it be like that?

743
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:38,320
You're saying that I cast a spell on you

744
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:41,120
to make you like me, is that it?

745
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,390
Because things are simply too weird,

746
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:46,930
I couldn't help it that my suspicions veered down that path.

747
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:50,930
If it's not a mystical power, could it be...

748
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:53,000
A perverse power?

749
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,740
Isn't that kind of thing too heavy?

750
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:56,940
A perverse power...

751
00:47:58,010 --> 00:47:59,340
Sexual energy?!

752
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:01,740
Pronounce it properly.

753
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:02,880
No, I already said that kind of heavy atmosphere,

754
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,610
men are fascinated by it.

755
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:10,020
Of course you would try to blame this on me.

756
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,950
I don't have any mystical powers or any sexual energy,

757
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:15,090
but I do have some wacko energy in me.

758
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:18,830
Before I go crazy, please just do your part.

759
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:22,030
Yes, Gu Ae Jeong's craziness is famous.

760
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:24,100
Because during the period of craziness a decade ago, you hit Kang Se Ri.

761
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:25,370
Also destroying your popularity.

762
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:29,100
So after ten years, you have fallen to this!

763
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:44,120
How come every time you open your mouth, your words sound like dog poop?

764
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:45,990
What? Dog poop?

765
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:49,120
After all that trouble I decided to come out. Stop trying to destroy my mood.

766
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:51,530
Just don't say anything at all!

767
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:54,800
Ay, what you say is really annoying.

768
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:06,010
Really!

769
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:11,150
Sor...

770
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:15,150
So clumsy drinking a bit of water.

771
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:19,020
Before it becomes dirty, wipe it down.

772
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:24,160
Why is it my fault when you're the one who's wrong!

773
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:27,560
Don't wipe the car, but yourself.

774
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:29,230
Nevermind!

775
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:37,640
While we're recording at the studio,

776
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:40,710
we'll decide who will go on which date.

777
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:44,110
Then you just continue filming on location.

778
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:45,510
Fine.

779
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:49,850
The date on the boat will take the most effort to arrange.

780
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:52,320
We cannot let Gu Ae Jeong be selected.

781
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:54,520
Why can't Miss Gu Ae Jeong be chosen?

782
00:49:54,590 --> 00:50:01,000
We prepared the boat for this date from a luxurious and elegant line.

783
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:04,330
If Gu Ae Jeong was chosen... How do I put it? Wouldn't it look cheap?

784
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:06,470
And it is the date we spent the most money on.

785
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:09,470
That's right! There's an elegant atmosphere inside, too.

786
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:14,680
Though Gu Ae Jeong is guilty of making small mistakes, it could still be quite fun.

787
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:17,810
If Gu Ae Jeong is drawn, let's do a Titanic parody.

788
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:22,950
At least let her do something, even if it is embarrassing.

789
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,020
Mr. Yun Pil Ju, you don't have to make a fool of yourself.

790
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:27,560
Just having a reaction will do.

791
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:31,360
You know what a Titanic parody is, don't you?

792
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:32,890
I don't know.

793
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,030
The takeaway has arrived!

794
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:36,900
- Over here! Over here!
- It came!

795
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,830
- How much is it?
- It's 20 000 won.
(Approximately $18.50.)

796
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:42,770
- Everyone, dig in!
- Good.

797
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:47,980
Let's eat together, shall we?
The kimbap is delicious.

798
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:51,050
No, thanks. I don't want to eat.

799
00:50:56,990 --> 00:50:58,590
Does Mr. Yun Pil Ju hate kimbap?

800
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:00,920
No, he's not picky.

801
00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:02,660
Why won't he eat?

802
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:06,330
Just don't eat then!

803
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:29,950
I'll be in the meeting room for now. Go eat dinner, then come back.

804
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:32,620
Okay. But, unni!

805
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:34,760
You've been eating chicken breast all day.

806
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:36,690
Should I bring you a sandwich?

807
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:40,500
Don't you know that I'm about to record a show? I'm afraid that even just by drinking water I'll get bloated.

808
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,160
Think, why don't you!

809
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:45,230
I'll be back.

810
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:06,250
Oh?

811
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:11,190
Now you've recognized me.

812
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:14,460
What's that?

813
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:16,730
Ramen.

814
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,600
Ah... Ramen...

815
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:21,940
And kimchi.
(Kimchi - National dish of Korea)

816
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,470
Right, fried kimchi.

817
00:52:26,270 --> 00:52:27,480
Do you want to eat?

818
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:33,480
I have a shoot tomorrow. Eating ramen will make me bloat.

819
00:52:49,770 --> 00:52:52,430
I'll just have one bite.

820
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:53,700
Please go ahead.

821
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,930
Aren't you going to eat this?

822
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:28,140
Then, I'll just eat another bite with the fried kimchi.

823
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:28,860
I've... I've eaten it all.

824
00:54:29,870 --> 00:54:31,800
Why did you let me? How could you just watch me eat it all?

825
00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:34,470
You just kept eating, so I didn't want to stop you.

826
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,670
I'm going crazy! What am I going to do?

827
00:54:38,470 --> 00:54:40,410
It's just a bowl of ramen. How big a problem can it be?

828
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:44,150
Do you know what this will do? What just one bowl of ramen will do to me when I go on that program?

829
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:47,680
On the exact same day, pictures will be all over the Internet,

830
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:49,480
with people arguing over whether Kang Se Ri is just fat,

831
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:52,620
or if she just had an injection. Haven't you heard any of them?

832
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:56,560
Ah really. I'm crazy, crazy, crazy.

833
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:05,100
What should I do?

834
00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:08,900
Director Kim, I'm writing a prescription that I want you to send over.

835
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:10,840
Boil the medicine immediately, and then send it to...

836
00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:13,110
Where should it be delivered to?

837
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:14,510
To my house.

838
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:17,910
Nonhyeon-dong, 234-5.

839
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:20,180
Send the prescription to the address I'll give you.

840
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:22,520
Please send it tomorrow, early in the morning.

841
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:23,590
Yes.

842
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:28,990
After eating, this medicine will help with the bloating.

843
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:35,060
Just like that, you know my home address.

844
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:36,800
I can't be telling just anyone.

845
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:39,530
If you don't want other people to know, I can send it to another place instead.

846
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:40,940
It's okay.

847
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,940
But, my home address... Don't spread it around, all right?

848
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:45,940
Fine.

849
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:50,150
Then I will leave first.

850
00:55:50,550 --> 00:55:51,550
That...

851
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:56,020
Since I've eaten your ramen, next time,

852
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:57,820
I'll treat you to a meal.

853
00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:04,630
In that case...

854
00:56:04,690 --> 00:56:07,760
Instead of treating me, can I ask you for a favor?

855
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:08,560
What is it?

856
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:12,830
You know that Titanic parody segment in the fantasy date?

857
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:14,640
Can I not do it?

858
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,110
All right.

859
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:20,780
Thank you so much!

860
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,040
In that case, I'm off.

861
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,390
It really was delicious.

862
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:39,660
But I ate it too fast.

863
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,600
How do I get up, I'm so embarrassed?

864
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:45,200
I should've at least eaten a little slower so I could talk more.

865
00:56:45,270 --> 00:56:47,070
We never talk...

866
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:51,810
Mr. Yun Pil Ju!

867
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:02,350
Instead of buying you a meal, should I treat you to a movie?

868
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:49,330
Today is the last day they're showing Fighter,

869
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,800
but I still haven't seen it.

870
00:57:51,870 --> 00:57:54,070
Mr. Yun Pil Ju.

871
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:56,610
Which of my boyfriend's movies have you seen?

872
00:57:56,670 --> 00:57:59,670
I haven't seen any of his movies.

873
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:02,740
Two of his movies were major blockbusters.

874
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:05,010
I don't really have a lot of interest in movies.

875
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:09,750
Do you not like movies only because I'm pestering you?

876
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:12,020
You aren't watching because you were forced to, right?

877
00:58:12,090 --> 00:58:16,160
Knowing Pil Ju, he wouldn't tag along to a place he has no interest in.

878
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:21,300
Recently, it seems like he's is a fan of Dok Go Jin. He keeps asking me about stuff related to him.

879
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:24,500
Mr. Yun Pil Ju, do you really do that?

880
00:58:26,030 --> 00:58:29,440
Yes, I really want to know what kind of person he is.

881
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:35,910
You said it's the VIP screening lounge right? I'll go in first.

882
00:58:36,910 --> 00:58:39,380
Let me buy the food and beverages.

883
00:58:39,450 --> 00:58:42,120
Absolutely not.

884
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:43,590
I hate people munching and slurping next to me while watching a movie.

885
00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:45,390
I can at least buy a Coke, right?

886
00:58:45,450 --> 00:58:47,860
If I'm sitting down for two hours, I'll definitely be thirsty.

887
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:52,660
You can't. In this world, there's nothing more I hate than the sound of a straw being sucked.

888
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:57,000
Can't I at least buy some squid? I won't make any noise.

889
00:58:57,130 --> 00:58:58,930
Nothing will be okay.

890
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:03,670
Why do you always want to eat?

891
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:06,810
He simply will not compromise.

892
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,210
Representative Moon, I'm at the theater now.

893
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:13,350
Well, don't let Dok Go Jin discover you.

894
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:14,880
Just stay at a distance and see who she is.

895
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:17,150
I'll just wait in front of the VIP hall and confirm who it is.

896
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:20,690
Oh, and should I take pictures?

897
00:59:43,850 --> 00:59:46,450
Everybody's gone to buy food and drinks.

898
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:47,650
Ah, yes.

899
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:53,590
Mr. Yun Pil Ju, I have one thing to ask you.

900
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:56,190
Last time during my fanmeeting,

901
00:59:56,260 --> 01:00:00,130
didn't you ask me if I was with my boyfriend?

902
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:04,200
Why were you curious about that?

903
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,070
For a person who doesn't care about celebrities,

904
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:13,480
you seem quite interested in Dok Go Jin.

905
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:22,020
Are you curious about what kind of person my boyfriend is?

906
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:29,620
You guys should meet if there's an opportunity.

907
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:31,890
With Dok Go Jin?

908
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:42,240
Isn't that Ae Jeong noona?
(Noona - Older sister)

909
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:44,770
Why would she go in there?

910
01:00:58,850 --> 01:01:00,590
So, it's Ae Jeong noona?!

911
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:11,730
I can come this far.

912
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:15,070
This is good.

913
01:01:22,010 --> 01:01:23,010
Aigoo!
(Aigoo - Oh Dear, Oh My God)

914
01:01:36,890 --> 01:01:42,160
Look at that hat hair! Wearing a hat with this type of hair doesn't match at all.

915
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:49,170
What should I do? Should I tell Representative Moon about this?

916
01:01:51,110 --> 01:01:52,310
Jae Seok?

917
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:57,580
Are you here to catch a movie?

918
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:02,250
Today's the last showing of Fighter,

919
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:03,920
so you came to see that?

920
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:05,650
Good then, I'm here with my team.

921
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:07,390
Let's watch it together.

922
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:11,190
Yun Pil Ju. Today you will get to meet him, all right?

923
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:12,130
Are you okay with that?

924
01:02:12,190 --> 01:02:13,460
Yes.

925
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:17,730
Where's Dok Go oppa? Did he go in already?

926
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:18,930
It's the VIP theater, isn't it?

927
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,400
You can't!

928
01:02:22,070 --> 01:02:23,610
You can't be seen together.

929
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:25,210
Is he with someone?

930
01:02:25,270 --> 01:02:27,010
No!

931
01:02:28,940 --> 01:02:30,480
Wait a moment please.

932
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:40,890
It's the same woman from last time who's with him right now, isn't it?

933
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:42,360
I don't know.

934
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:44,160
Don't pretend that you don't.

935
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,830
Who exactly is this woman?

936
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:48,160
I don't know.

937
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:50,100
Who is it?

938
01:02:50,170 --> 01:02:51,370
I don't know.

939
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:53,970
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

940
01:02:54,970 --> 01:02:57,310
Should I just go in and confirm it myself?

941
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:02,780
You won't let anyone know?

942
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:07,380
Tell me, who is it exactly?

943
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:08,720
I don't know.

944
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:10,520
He's with a woman, isn't he?

945
01:03:10,850 --> 01:03:11,920
There's a woman, isn't there?

946
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:12,920
What?

947
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:15,460
No? There's no woman?

948
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:19,730
Who is it? Who?!

949
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:26,740
You intend to have supper here?

950
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:27,870
Aren't you treating?

951
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:28,740
Yes, my treat.

952
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:30,870
You haven't treated for a long time!

953
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:42,750
Your food is here!

954
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:45,150
This looks delicious.

955
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:55,360
Thank you!

956
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:57,770
How do you do?

957
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:03,570
I'm in a bit of a fix right now...

958
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:07,310
Just pretend you didn't see me. Sorry.

959
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:30,200
Gu Ae Jeong, what's up with you now?

960
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:02,230
Where are you?

961
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:04,300
Please watch the movie alone.

962
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:06,370
I won't go inside.

963
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:11,370
To me, this is already my limit.

964
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:13,910
Now it's time for me to muster my energy and return to reality.

965
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:17,510
I've already bought everything you wanted: Coke, popcorn, and potatoes.

966
01:05:19,510 --> 01:05:21,520
What's wrong with you?

967
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:24,050
I'm really scared of that potato.

968
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:28,060
Are you avoiding me because you're scared that I'll catch that chicken?

969
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:30,060
Yes, I'm scared...

970
01:05:31,190 --> 01:05:33,600
I'm scared of the fact that I actually don't mind being bullied by you,

971
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:35,260
and even think of letting you continue to bully me.

972
01:05:35,330 --> 01:05:37,130
I am scared of that aspect of myself.

973
01:05:37,330 --> 01:05:41,600
=I would really like to be more easy-going and open.=

974
01:05:41,670 --> 01:05:45,270
I've trained so hard over these past ten years to reach my current state. It was difficult to become so easy-going.

975
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:49,880
I'm very afraid that if I let my heart waver now, my past effort will be wasted.

976
01:05:50,410 --> 01:05:54,680
Dok Go Jin, you might currently be fearless because of your fixation with me...

977
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:58,150
But aren't you afraid that I'd decide to really hold on to you and not let you go?
