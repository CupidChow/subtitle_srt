00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,000
Ae Jeong! Ae Jeong!

5
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,090
Oh, is it my brother coming?

6
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,500
Blood! I need tissue!
What should I do?

7
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,220
Why is she not picking up the phone?

8
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,760
Ae Jeong! Where is the car?

9
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,180
Go Jin, do you have tissues by any chance?

10
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:43,880
- Blood!
- Is it obvious that I got slapped?

11
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,760
Yes, quite.

12
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,620
What do I do? My brother
mustn't see me like this.

13
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:57,610
- Could you give me a ride?
- Huh?

14
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:01,350
My brother will feel terrible
when he sees me looking like this.

15
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,040
I don't think I can face him like this.

16
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,560
Please give me a ride
just until we are out of here?

17
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,020
Ae Jeong! Ae Jeong!

18
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,630
What are you doing?

19
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:18,350
- Come in fast.
- Where did she go?

20
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,000
Where is she?

21
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,150
The car is here, but where did she go?

22
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,920
Come in fast. Hurry.

23
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,540
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

24
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,020
Oppa. I just met a friend
who wants to buy me dinner.

25
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,650
Go home first. All right.

26
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,680
Finally.

27
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,550
This car is really good.
How expensive are cars like this?

28
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,960
It's real leather, isn't it?
It's not fake.

29
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,250
It's really good.

30
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:18,640
Stop rambling and put this on your face.

31
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,220
That's less awkward.

32
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,430
This is the drink you're advertising.

33
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,270
So what?

34
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:36,510
You drink stuff with your
picture on it every day.

35
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,640
It must feel weird.

36
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,740
Stop doing that.

37
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,500
Stop rubbing your face
on the part that has my picture.

38
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,210
It feels weird looking at it.
Get that off, now.

39
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,830
Put your face on the part
that has words.

40
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,540
All right.

41
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,180
I have other plans.
I can't be on the show.

42
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:17,650
I've made my point.
I'll go now.

43
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:22,000
Hey, I heard you are
looking to marry these days.

44
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,960
Our contenders are really great.

45
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:26,540
You can't meet women
like these anywhere else.

46
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,240
Did you see all of them?
Have a look again.

47
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,140
There are really great people in this.

48
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,710
Kwak Hyun Hwa, Kang Su Nae...
I've met them in person.

49
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,420
They are really great,
with great personalities.

50
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:42,940
Park Si Yeon, Gu Ae Jeong,
Jung Hyun Ju, Ha Ru Mi, Sin Sun Gae.

51
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,610
Of all these great people,

52
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,720
you are telling me there's not
one person you want to meet?

53
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,910
You cannot buy me even if
you give me 10 billion.

54
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:53,600
I'm a National Treasure girl.
You shouldn't live like this.

55
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,360
I'm saved, thanks to you!

56
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,260
Since you started taking control,

57
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,290
the guy who seemed like
he was never going to back down

58
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,980
came all the way here to take the offer.

59
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,950
He told me he was never
going to do it...

60
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,000
and I guess he was just
playing hard-to-get.

61
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,050
Then, when he said he didn't recognize me,

62
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,260
do you think he was also
playing hard-to-get?

63
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,340
I was counting on you,
and I'm in trouble now.

64
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:19,460
I'll get going.

65
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,270
You must be Yoon Pil Ju.

66
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,520
I'm Han Myong Jin,
the writer of the show.

67
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,440
You look just as good as I imagined.

68
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:32,580
- Here is my business card.
- Thanks.

69
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,220
I'm sorry.

70
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,690
Why is he leaving?

71
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,640
He turned it down.

72
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,500
Yoon Pil Joo.

73
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,800
Let's talk for a minute.

74
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,370
Ah, Kang Se Ri.

75
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,470
You didn't recognize me again?

76
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,440
No, your hair and clothes
have changed from the last time.

77
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,740
- I heard you turned it down.
- Yes.

78
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,190
You should've told me first.

79
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,090
Didn't you consider how it'll make
me look bad in front of my staff?

80
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,810
I didn't think that such things
can make you look bad.

81
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,820
If it did, I'm sorry.

82
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:24,710
Also, you not recognizing me
is really rude.

83
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,340
Then, I should be careful next time.

84
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,350
If I see someone who's
outstandingly pretty,

85
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,500
I'll pay special attention
since it could be you.

86
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,540
You're leaving like this?

87
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:49,330
Yes. Do you have more to discuss?

88
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,760
No.

89
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,440
He left? He turned it down again?

90
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,900
We must have him on the show.

91
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:20,740
I hear people telling me
I'm pretty every day.

92
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,950
But my heart fluttered just now.

93
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:27,530
That man can be the "perfect man".

94
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,060
who will make every viewer's heart flutter.

95
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,350
I don't think I should make you
more awkward and uncomfortable.

96
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,780
I'll take a taxi back.
Let me get off here.

97
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,690
That's a good idea.

98
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,810
- Before you go, give me some money.
- Give me some money.

99
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,340
I didn't bring my wallet.
I can't even take a taxi.

100
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,330
I don't carry my wallet around
since I have a manager.

101
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,310
Then, please take me
to where you are going.

102
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:21,190
Why would I ask you to give me money?
The car ran out of gas.

103
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,740
It really ran out. Did it stop?

104
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:30,540
What is an expensive car for,
when you don't even check for gas?

105
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:34,960
The manager that I hired to check
is not here because of you.

106
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:39,060
Where do you think I can be?
I'm at the set.

107
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,070
You said you were at the set already.
Where are you now?

108
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,340
I was passing by Yeoyido,
and the car ran out of gas.

109
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:48,600
Call me when you are near
Yeoyido Park. Come quickly.

110
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,980
Is he coming here?

111
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:54,880
Then, it's going to take
more than 30 minutes.

112
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,450
Sure, do get going.

113
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,010
I wasn't going to go.

114
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,300
Since it's going to take a while,

115
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,260
I was going to the washroom
over there and come back.

116
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:12,410
Why don't you go to the washroom
over there and just go?

117
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,600
I don't even have the money for taxi
and where can I go, looking like this?

118
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,160
Sure, you can come back.

119
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,890
Why did I have to witness
a scene like that?

120
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:51,510
Oh no. It's redder than I thought.

121
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,540
I was looking like this
the whole time I was with him?

122
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,630
What a shame.

123
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,500
It will get bruised.

124
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:16,370
Excuse me. Could I borrow that
after you are done?

125
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,850
Sure.

126
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,590
Thank you so much.

127
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:25,040
Oh gosh. You were slapped real hard.

128
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,570
Why would you tolerate that?
Just leave him.

129
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,740
Right, I should.

130
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,810
[Washroom]

131
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:37,090
Look, she was slapped across the face.

132
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,520
Her face is so red.

133
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,910
Her face is like that
because she got slapped?

134
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,110
Is the washroom clean? It doesn't smell?

135
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,180
No.

136
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,050
I don't think you should
get out right now.

137
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:06,280
- What is this?
- People think I've been slapped.

138
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:15,400
- Are you crazy?
- They're looking to see who slapped me.

139
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:19,250
- And, that's me?
- That is such a big misunderstanding.

140
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,470
Let me go. I'm Dok Go Jin.

141
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,890
You should hide your face
so that they can't see you.

142
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,050
They'll keep looking. What do we do?

143
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,210
Your tummy must be very uncomfortable being
pressed when you want to go to the washroom.

144
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:34,190
I'll let you know as soon as they are gone.

145
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:40,060
Is your tummy too pressed?
Should I push the chair back?

146
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:46,980
Believing that your body is precious,

147
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:49,960
you shall not treat others without respect.

148
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:53,260
Believing that you are great...

149
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,980
Is there any chance that the friend
who's buying dinner is Dok Go Jin?

150
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:59,400
Did they grow close since
that "impromptu quiz" game?

151
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,370
Let me give you a reality check.

152
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,150
Even for scandals, you need to
consider the different levels of people

153
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,060
and the margin of error
that you can get away with.

154
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:09,050
Dok Go Jin's here and Ae Jeong's here.

155
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,680
How do you think that's possible?

156
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:13,430
If Dok Go Jin's here and Ae Jeong's here,

157
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,410
then when they are involved in
a scandal, it can go up like this.

158
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,680
Generally speaking, when two get
involved in a scandal like that,

159
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:23,980
it goes down from here to there.

160
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,280
Can it be somewhere
in the middle like this?

161
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,720
It's done! Let's eat.

162
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,290
Here are sandwiches.

163
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,110
Thank you.

164
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,910
Help yourself.

165
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,400
Thank you, Mom.

166
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,230
You need to call me Aunt Jenny.

167
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,120
Dad told me that
I should keep calling you Mom,

168
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:53,070
so that you can really be my mom.

169
00:12:54,590 --> 00:13:00,000
I told you. You need to consider "level".

170
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:08,070
The shooting is put off for two hours.

171
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,840
Should I wake her up
and get her to take a taxi?

172
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,390
Don't bother.

173
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,030
Why is Gu Ae Jeong's face like this?

174
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,730
Was she hit by someone?

175
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,050
Did you?

176
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,700
Are you crazy?

177
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:28,800
I was going nuts because I had to be
crumpled to hide from the people...

178
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,490
...who wanted to see who slapped her.

179
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,680
Then, what happened to her?

180
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,650
I don't know. I didn't ask in detail.

181
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,260
- Is she okay?
- I don't know. I didn't ask.

182
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:40,690
A girl is slapped. You need to ask
if she's okay and why she's hurt.

183
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,490
Even just for politeness' sake.

184
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,820
If I ask, I need to listen.

185
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,230
If I listen, I need to intervene,
and then I'll have to get involved.

186
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,260
You came all the way here
because you are already involved.

187
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:49,220
Look at you telling me
not to wake her up.

188
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,550
Let's go, Hyungnim.

189
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:03,790
Hey, Gu Ae Jeong. Gu Ae Jeong!

190
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,860
Get up. Get up now, quickly.

191
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,820
Get out.

192
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:23,210
Take a taxi with this.

193
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,270
Thank you.

194
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,310
I will pay it back. I'll call you.

195
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,390
Give me your phone.

196
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,340
Why...

197
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,920
You don't need to pay it back,
so don't call me.

198
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,470
What is this? My name is not here.

199
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,580
I'll find it and delete it.

200
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,770
You told me that you were going
to delete it, but you didn't.

201
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,800
What did you save me as?

202
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:45,300
It's under double D, not "D".

203
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,860
Double D?

204
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,280
*Ddong Go Jin?
(*Poop Go Jin)

205
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,340
Ddong Go Jin?

206
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:01,210
It's similar in pronunciation, isn't it?

207
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:05,020
I can't do whatever I want
with my cell phone?

208
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,020
Get going.

209
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,600
- Thank you.
- Just go.

210
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,220
Stop rambling and put this on your face.

211
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,740
That's less awkward.

212
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:51,190
I seem to have something in my eyes

213
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:53,420
Gu Ae Jeong is a celebrity too.
Can she walk around like that?

214
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:58,620
That's why my tears keep flowing

215
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:57,670
That's why my tears keep flowing

216
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,540
- I'll start, Hyungnim.
- Can't you see I'm drinking? Don't.

217
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:05,410
I have been hiding a part of my heart

218
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:13,870
A certain person can't even sense it
thus bringing me to tears

219
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:17,410
Even if you cannot hear me

220
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,400
Even if you cannot hear my heart

221
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,190
The love my tears convey

222
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:27,900
Will you finally hear it someday?

223
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,410
Because you are my man

224
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:35,050
Because you are my love

225
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,300
A taxi!

226
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:42,650
After sending you away and letting go,
you still remain and make me cry

227
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:46,060
Because you are my man

228
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:50,340
It's because you are still my man

229
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:49,850
Start.

230
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:50,960
Okay, Hyungnim.

231
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:57,610
I can't hold back these foolish tears

232
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,590
The door is open.

233
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,960
I'm back.

234
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:10,040
You're back? Go and take a bath
then come and sit with us.

235
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:13,710
Stop putting them on. Ae Jeong
needs to put them on too.

236
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,470
She has a photo shoot tomorrow.

237
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,960
Ae Jeong has a small face,
so a half cucumber will do.

238
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:21,710
Even a half is too much.
You put them on.

239
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:24,620
Oh, Ae Jeong.

240
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:28,650
You told me someone treated you.
Did you eat well? What did you eat?

241
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,220
I ate. I ate really well.

242
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,880
That's why you were starving all day.

243
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,160
Don't tell my brother.

244
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,360
Don't you have a photo shoot soon?

245
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,610
You're getting slapped around, when
you should be getting expensive facials?

246
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,590
Let me see.

247
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,830
I'm really okay. I put cucumber on.

248
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,950
Mind your age, you can't take care
of your skin with pieces of cucumber.

249
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,220
Look. Those are wrinkles.

250
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,700
Really?

251
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,680
I need to intervene. Tomorrow,
you are going somewhere with me.

252
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:02,920
Where?

253
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:08,920
I think it's a really expensive place.
Thank you.

254
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:12,320
Don't worry. My mom bought
a monthly pass here.

255
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:15,350
- The oriental skin care service here...
- Come, take a seat.

256
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,820
...is state of the art.

257
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:17,790
Morning, Ma'am.

258
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,370
Morning.

259
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,950
Madam Kim and Yoo,

260
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,390
this is your first time here
at Doctor Yoon's clinic?

261
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:28,940
What a luxurious and well-decorated clinic.

262
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,170
Because we made it look all bling bling,

263
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,550
there aren't any patients who only
take cheap treatments...

264
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,690
...and order cheap *Ssang Hwa Tang
(*medicinal tonic).

265
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,010
Get some tea over here.

266
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,060
Okay.

267
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:43,010
Hello, my Director Yoon.

268
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,640
They are members of my club.

269
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:49,250
- Hello.
- Hello.

270
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,370
Weight reducing acupuncture for Madam Kim,

271
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,250
Herbal treatment for Madam Yoon,

272
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,640
and Madam Han is getting herbs
for her husband.

273
00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:00,010
I promised to give them 20% off. Okay?

274
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,880
Director Yoon, take special care of them.

275
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,320
Yes, I'll take care of them.

276
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:04,620
Hey. Hey, hey!

277
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:09,620
- The director here looks really handsome.
- All right.

278
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,740
That's why there are so many women here.

279
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,320
I guess so.

280
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,700
My Director Yoon is going
to be on TV soon,

281
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:20,040
"Couple Making" featuring Kang Se Ri.

282
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,780
That show's really famous.

283
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:25,760
You know my son is really handsome.
The producer is begging him...

284
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,580
- ... to come on the show.
- I think the director here...

285
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,690
...is the bachelor on Couple Making.

286
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,360
I should've taken a closer look.
I only got to see his profile.

287
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:34,230
You can go in there and see.

288
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,990
Never mind, if I see him now,

289
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,230
my surprised reaction on the show
will look less realistic.

290
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,440
Come on, you aren't curious?

291
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,640
When bringing out the tea,

292
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:49,540
exaggerate that this tea is a
several-decades-old-cure-all medicine.

293
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,830
Madam!

294
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,950
I heard Director Yoon went to
the producer and turned it down.

295
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:59,640
- What?
- I'm working on things as planned.

296
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:03,880
I am more suitable for studying
in a lab than seeing patients.

297
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:08,790
So far I stayed for you
but I'm not happy here.

298
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:12,380
Then, do a last trade with me.

299
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,930
Just go on the show.

300
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:21,220
I'll let go my grip on you,
if you do the show.

301
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,080
What are you thinking?

302
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:27,590
Just go on the show
and meet the best women out there,

303
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,250
and be famous for dating a celebrity.

304
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,690
Do everything there is to do,

305
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,930
and enjoy all there is to enjoy
and if you're still not happy...

306
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,790
then you can do whatever you want.

307
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,740
You're going to let me do
whatever I want?

308
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:41,750
Yes.

309
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,190
- You can promise me that?
- Do you want me to sign a contract?

310
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,650
- Is the director here?
- Yes.

311
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:53,450
She wants to book a treatment.

312
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,750
Sure. Just fill out this form.

313
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,710
Yes.

314
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:00,840
Unni. If I'm going to see him,
shouldn't I be put together better?

315
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:04,890
No way, then he might recognize you.

316
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,250
You think?

317
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:10,110
You're right, if I'm wearing makeup
on the show, he won't recognize me.

318
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,530
Of course.

319
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,900
How's patient Kim Eun Sook?

320
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:18,480
Here is the chart.

321
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:22,350
- Looking good.
- Yes.

322
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,720
He is really handsome.

323
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:27,870
- What about the next patient?
- She's waiting on the bed.

324
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,320
But why does he look so familiar?

325
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,870
- What is the problem?
- She has a small pain in the ankle.

326
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,700
Please calm down.

327
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,940
You shouldn't live like that.

328
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:48,990
The guy from...

329
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:50,370
OK, I got it.

330
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:57,110
Hello. Can I see where
you are having a problem?

331
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,250
Your ankle?

332
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,930
Gu Ae Jeong?

333
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:09,050
Gu Ae Jeong?

334
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,280
I'm okay, Doctor.

335
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,630
Are you really Gu Ae Jeong?

336
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,340
I think I don't have any problem.

337
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,580
Gu Ae Jeong!

338
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,580
- Unni! Let's get out of here.
- What's wrong?

339
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:25,780
100 billion, 100 billion. Why is
he here? What if he recognizes me?

340
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,350
- 100 bil...
- Let's go quickly!

341
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,100
Gu Ae Jeong!

342
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:32,620
I have such bad luck these days.
Let's go quickly.

343
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:37,000
She really is Gu Ae Jeong.

344
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:44,420
The director is the 100 billion guy?
The one you mistook for a sponsor?

345
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,320
Yes.

346
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:49,220
You also threw water in his face.
Oh my goodness.

347
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,990
He must not have recognized me this time?

348
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,350
That doesn't make any difference.

349
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,820
You're going to see him on the show.

350
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:57,770
You're right. What should I do?

351
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,330
If he comes on the show,

352
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:03,950
you are going to be eliminated
in the first round.

353
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,900
You are eliminated even if
you give me 100 billion.

354
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,680
I was crazy. I was so stupid.

355
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:14,970
Stop hitting where you got hit before.

356
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,090
Unni, seriously speaking,
what should I do?

357
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,290
Before you meet him on the show,
get things worked out now.

358
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:25,520
Do you think he'll accept my apology
if I buy expensive medicine?

359
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,860
It is certain that the one
who slapped Gu Ae Jeong yesterday

360
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,590
is Manager Jang from the girl group Candies.

361
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,420
They shoot together.

362
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,990
Manager Jang used to be...

363
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,540
...the manager of the former girl group,
National Treasure Girls?

364
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,340
They have not been on good terms.

365
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,540
He's been dissing Gu Ae Jeong
since long ago.

366
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:48,330
Ha Ru Mi from Candies
is also on Couple Making.

367
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:52,100
Then Ae Jeong is going to keep
bumping into Manager Jang.

368
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:55,300
Ha Ru Mi is on the rise these days, so
Ae Jeong's going to be dug over by her.

369
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:58,290
Right, and why are you whispering?

370
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:03,890
Dok Go Jin doesn't like to hear
about Gu Ae Jeong.

371
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,590
You are interrupting me from reading
the script. Go outside to talk.

372
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,550
Okay, let's go.

373
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:21,520
Yes, Representative.

374
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:23,660
What should Gu Ae Jeong do now?

375
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:27,460
- I need to have, I need...
- That's true, that Gu Ae Jeong.

376
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:39,020
Dug over by Ha Ru Mi, stepped on
by Kang Se Ri, ploughed by Manager Jang.

377
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,670
What a way to farm Gu Ae Jeong.
There will be a good harvest.

378
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,270
Come in.

379
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:56,380
Hello.

380
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,730
Have a seat.

381
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:06,990
Gu Ae Jeong, you came back again.

382
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,290
- Yes.
- Director, here is the chart.

383
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,820
Oh yes, thank you.

384
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:13,000
Why did you run out like that just now?

385
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:17,170
I was a bit taken aback then.

386
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:20,720
You thought I wouldn't recognize
you if you hid like that.

387
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:22,090
You recognized me?

388
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,740
You are from National Treasure Girls.

389
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:25,720
You do recognize me.

390
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:30,060
I'm not a famous celebrity
and you still recognized me.

391
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,350
I'm grateful.

392
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,360
Why?

393
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:35,290
You told me you are worth more
than 100 billion.

394
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:37,740
Did you recognize me?

395
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:44,600
I'm so sorry, Doctor.

396
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:49,050
That night, I entered the wrong room.
There was a misunderstanding.

397
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:56,310
You also said things
that fed my misunderstanding,

398
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,670
so I thought you were going to do something
with me after giving me 100 billion.

399
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,990
I didn't say that I was giving
you 100 billion from the start.

400
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,090
Right.

401
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:05,630
That's the amount
that I came up by myself.

402
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,630
Anyway, it's a good thing we met again.

403
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:13,160
I've been thinking and
the situation then was as though

404
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:15,580
I was trying to buy you with money...

405
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:18,720
Right, Right. No need to talk about that.

406
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:22,250
I mistook you for such a bad person.

407
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,400
I'm so sorry.

408
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:27,480
You didn't come back after
you left, so I felt bad,

409
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:30,410
thinking that you were
mistaking me for a bad person.

410
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,330
It's a good thing that you are not.

411
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,870
Yoon Pil Joo really can't do this?

412
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,750
He said he's not doing it.

413
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,990
In that case,
what about Baek Chan Young?

414
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,530
Baek Chan Young said...

415
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:42,550
...he's not going to do the program
with a celebrity involved in a scandal.

416
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,370
Who? Gu Ae Jeong?

417
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,160
Yeah, we can find another
female celebrity if we want to,

418
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:52,840
but there are no more options
for the male lead.

419
00:26:54,670 --> 00:27:00,010
By the way, I heard that you are
going to be on the television show.

420
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,080
Did Eun Ho the producer tell you
that I'm going to be on it?

421
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:07,740
I'll also be on the show.

422
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:12,030
But if you see me again on the set,

423
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,670
please shake off all the
bad feelings toward me,

424
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,490
and pretend that you don't know me.

425
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:21,260
I haven't taken the offer yet.

426
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,260
Really?

427
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,670
Really.

428
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:31,520
Good thinking.

429
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:35,020
If you get famous after appearing on TV,
it's going to be really tiring.

430
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:37,920
If you want to keep leading
a graceful and classy lifestyle,

431
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:41,300
it's better not to appear on TV.

432
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:44,850
Really? I was going to think about it.

433
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,870
Don't ever think about it.

434
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:50,990
I'll bear that in mind since it's
coming from an expert in the field.

435
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,630
Yeah. Before I go,

436
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:58,300
I'll take a promotion photo
and give my autograph.

437
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:05,640
Perfect, very nice. Perfect. Perfect.

438
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,570
Perfect.

439
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:10,610
Perfect, perfect!

440
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,790
Stop.

441
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,930
- Stop clapping your hands like that.
- Why?

442
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,750
Yesterday, I saw something
I shouldn't have seen,

443
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:21,290
and the clapping produces a
sound that reminds me of that.

444
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,750
Sorry. Sorry.

445
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,950
Sorry. Sorry, sorry.

446
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:37,180
Dok Go Jin. This photo shoot
for Allure magazine

447
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:39,430
is featuring you and Se Ri as a couple.

448
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,710
Don't you have to
coordinate the style with Se Ri?

449
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,980
I'll pick the style,
tell Se Ri to match her outfit.

450
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:48,490
Dok Go Jin, I feel uneasy whenever
I see your heart rate monitor.

451
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,130
Does everyone who has undergone
heart surgery need to wear it?

452
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,360
I told you, you didn't see my
surgical scar even when you saw it.

453
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:55,410
Sorry.

454
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,250
Director, Ha Ru Mi from Candies came.

455
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,070
Okay, tell her to wait.

456
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,140
Yes.

457
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,820
You sponsor a girl group too?

458
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:08,940
Sure, they are on the rise these days.

459
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:12,880
Oh yeah, Dok Go Jin, Representative Moon
came and I sponsored a dress

460
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:14,690
for Gu Ae Jeong from your company.

461
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,480
I am a good boy, right?

462
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,360
Sure, we are so busy these days.

463
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:23,500
The dress you wore before was so pretty.

464
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:25,740
This one, it is so pretty.

465
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:26,900
That's right, that's right.

466
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,490
I think it's going to make me
look too young among the group.

467
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:34,750
- Can I pick something else?
- Sure, sure, have a look.

468
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:38,200
This one?

469
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:41,340
I'm afraid it's going to be difficult.
We already sponsored it for Gu Ae Jeong.

470
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,630
- Gu Ae Jeong?
- Yes.

471
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:46,450
She's in the same company
as Dok Go Jin. I couldn't refuse.

472
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,260
Can I wear this, please?

473
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:51,280
It's difficult; it's reserved.

474
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:55,340
Gu Ae Jeong wearing this dress
versus Ha Ru Mi wearing it,

475
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:58,310
who do you think will make
this dress shine more?

476
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:02,090
It's okay. Gu Ae Jeong is not
in a position to complain.

477
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,840
Why? They are on different levels.

478
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,620
Okay, Gu Ae Jeong can wear something else.

479
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:10,180
- Right.
- She can choose another one.

480
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,640
Manager Jang.

481
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:16,620
Hi, Dok Go Jin. What a coincidence.

482
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:23,320
Can I take this dress?

483
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:26,670
Why would you?
Are you going to give it to Se Ri?

484
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,430
I shall take everything.

485
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:34,430
Okay, here.

486
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,070
Okay then. I'll take this instead.

487
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,330
That also, I shall take it.

488
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,400
Okay, let's wear something else.

489
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,570
Then, let me take this...

490
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:55,950
That also, I shall take it.

491
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,730
Then...

492
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:06,040
That also, I shall take it.

493
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:07,100
That also...

494
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:10,950
Of course, that also, I shall take it.

495
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:14,800
Ru Mi, then, let's take
the one we picked first.

496
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:20,430
That also, I shall take it.

497
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:28,090
What are you trying to do?

498
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:35,600
Your face is all red as though
you got slapped somewhere.

499
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:39,300
But then, I saw a face
that looked more hurt yesterday,

500
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:41,960
your red face doesn't interest me a bit.

501
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:51,720
You are not in the position to complain
that I'm taking them all.

502
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,290
Why?

503
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,530
We are on such different levels.

504
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,540
Why did I lug them up here?

505
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:31,670
Dok Go Jin, why did you do this?
Are you going to wear them all?

506
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:44,450
Since I avenged the poor thing,
I'll ask her to come here and take them.

507
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,830
Why would the producer want to see me?

508
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:54,440
Maybe they want to talk with the rising
star of the show before the show starts?

509
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:58,020
- You think?
- That's right. Take the call.

510
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,730
This is the number that I shouldn't take.

511
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:05,030
He told me not to take his calls;
why is he calling me?

512
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,480
The call has been forwarded...

513
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:09,160
She's not taking my call?

514
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:12,870
You are going to regret
behaving as I told you to behave.

515
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,510
What is this?

516
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:19,760
If she didn't take the call
because she knew it was me,

517
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,920
that means she still has my number. Right?

518
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,610
This lass.

519
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,700
What?

520
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,760
I don't get to appear on the show?

521
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:35,690
The male lead doesn't want
to be on the show with you.

522
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,630
Why does he not want her on the show?

523
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,290
These days,

524
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:44,250
people casually talk about which celebrities
they like and which they don't.

525
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,620
Because of his personal preferences...

526
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:53,470
You didn't come back
after you left, so I felt bad,

527
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,360
thinking that you were
mistaking me for a bad person.

528
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,580
It's a good thing that you are not.

529
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:04,320
He said all that and he still... jerk.

530
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:09,440
Right, I've been a real jerk
this time. I'm sorry.

531
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:12,390
Let me take this call.

532
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:23,960
In fact, our first choice was someone else,

533
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:26,030
but it didn't work out so well with him.

534
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,720
Please don't get us wrong.

535
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,770
Right.

536
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:33,920
You know how things got awkward
because you turned it down?

537
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:36,050
I'm sorry to have made you awkward but...

538
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,430
...I think I'm going to give it
another thought.

539
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,610
What? Another thought?

540
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:42,390
Are you saying you are going to do this?
You have to be clear with me.

541
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,160
Yes. I'll do it.

542
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:46,790
- Someone promised me something and also,
- [if you go on TV, then do what you want]

543
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:53,040
I think it's going to be fun.

544
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:57,480
Could you please give it another thought?

545
00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:00,750
I'll meet the male lead
and try to persuade him.

546
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,770
That's going to be difficult.

547
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,950
I'm sorry, Gu Ae Jeong.

548
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,050
Let's go.

549
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,480
Please do something.

550
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:15,030
Ae Jeong, Ae Jeong. Don't go, don't go.

551
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:16,940
What's the matter?

552
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,290
Got it, Ae Jeong,
you don't have to go.

553
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,420
Our first choice decided to do it.

554
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,020
He did?

555
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:29,020
Then, a different male lead
is going to be on the show,

556
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:30,910
not the one who didn't like me?

557
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,920
Yes.

558
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:36,590
We also didn't care for the guy who
tackled us because he didn't like you.

559
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:39,040
It's all worked out now that
you don't have to go.

560
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:40,210
Yeah, that's right.

561
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,960
I'm so glad. I'm so glad.

562
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:45,750
Thank you.

563
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:56,460
Is Gu Ae Jeong here?

564
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:02,960
Since when has she been listening to me
so well she doesn't pick up the phone?

565
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,020
Dok Go Jin!

566
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:09,390
You mushroom, you frightened me.

567
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:15,310
That's really Dok Go Jin!

568
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,570
Am I your friend?

569
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:22,690
You are my aunt's friend. Hello.

570
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:29,320
Are you the "Ding Dong" who called me?

571
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,620
I'm not your aunt's friend.

572
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:35,790
And if you call me again like that...
you will be spanked.

573
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:38,870
What are you looking at?

574
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,390
Because it's surreal.

575
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,700
No wonder it's surreal.

576
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:45,140
Why is your moustache shaped
like the letter "Soh"*? (*ox)

577
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:45,960
What?

578
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:48,840
Why is your moustache
shaped like the letter "Soh"?

579
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,320
My moustache is like "Soh?"

580
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,720
It's "Soh"!

581
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:54,620
Mushroom, that kid...

582
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:09,820
[Soh]
(ox)

583
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:13,250
It is "Soh".

584
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,260
Dok Go Jin?

585
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:25,650
What are you doing here?

586
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:30,600
Gu Ae Jeong, is my moustache...

587
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,870
What about your moustache?

588
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:38,180
Never mind.

589
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:43,250
Why are you not picking up the phone?

590
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:46,080
Did you come here to meet me?

591
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:48,130
You didn't pick up the phone
knowing that it was me?

592
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,870
That means you saved my number again?

593
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,290
Since I didn't erase the record
of out-going calls,

594
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,350
you slyly saved the number from there.

595
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,880
I have to mark the numbers
so that I know not to pick up.

596
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:02,150
Are you here to nitpick over that?

597
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:08,030
Isn't this a restaurant?
Anyone can come to a restaurant.

598
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:11,730
It's an honor if a special
person like me comes.

599
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:14,400
Then, have a good meal.

600
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:16,110
Let's go, Hyung Gyu.

601
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:22,720
- Let's go.
- Auntie. This man...

602
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:24,130
Ding Dong.

603
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:32,930
Please refrain from voicing your personal
opinion regarding my private matters.

604
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,110
Understood?

605
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:43,860
"Soh". I'm telling you
not to talk about it.

606
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:50,670
Do you drink Ssang Hwa Tang?

607
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,910
No, I don't.

608
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:54,040
Just take it.

609
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,470
You said I don't have to pay
you back for the taxi.

610
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:03,330
Let's call it even with this. Have a
good meal. Say good-bye, Hyung Gyu.

611
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,610
- Good-bye.
- Let's go.

612
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:11,330
Auntie. You told me that's really expensive.

613
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,040
That's true,

614
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:16,380
but I can't get myself to drink
that because of the bastar...

615
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:21,100
the bad doctor who
made that Ssang Hwa Tang.

616
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,210
Let's go.

617
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:30,220
Who is she?

618
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:33,020
Everyone's high standard except for her.

619
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:37,960
National Treasure Girls?

620
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:42,480
She's gone rusty and she's being
bashed on the Internet these days.

621
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:45,570
Pil Joo, eliminate her first.

622
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,500
Hello.

623
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:58,950
I called Jae Seok. Why did you come?

624
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:04,610
A thing came up
and he asked me to come instead.

625
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,750
Come in.

626
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,690
Why did you come?

627
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,510
I was with my brother and followed him.

628
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:19,510
This house is really good.

629
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,640
Come in.

630
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,940
Wow. You have so many clothes.

631
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,680
Forget it. Don't touch it.

632
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:39,820
They are all women's clothes.
Ah, there was somebody.

633
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:42,510
No, they are all mine.

634
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:47,300
They are all yours?

635
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:54,780
I also wear whatever I want
when I'm at home... but still...

636
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:00,210
You have a special hobby.

637
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:05,280
I said they are mine.
I didn't say I wear them.

638
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:07,950
If you wear them, these will show.

639
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:24,620
Stop imagining.

640
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:25,910
Sure.

641
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,900
I have something to give to
Representative Moon. So wait here.

642
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:34,670
No, this is not what you think.

643
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,880
This is unisex.

644
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,800
You don't understand fashion.

645
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:44,510
Wow. There is a game room in this house.

646
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,400
Oppa, what are you doing?
Come over quickly.

647
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:48,830
Look at this!

648
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:53,380
Don't do it. Don't.

649
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:54,650
It's going to be fine.

650
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:01,780
Don't touch anything downstairs.
They are all very expensive.

651
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:02,840
Yes.

652
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:04,630
Oppa, stop it. Get up quickly.

653
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,460
Don't do it. Get up.

654
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:12,880
What's up? You can't take it off?

655
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:13,940
What should we do?

656
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:15,740
One... two... three...

657
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,350
Are you touching anything there?

658
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,710
- If I catch you, I'll call the police.
- Oppa, don't!

659
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:24,570
What should we do?

660
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:29,300
Oppa. I'll go up and buy some time.

661
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:38,740
What is this?

662
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:41,650
This is Dok Go Jin's bedroom...

663
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:44,000
Gu Ae Jeong, did you
throw away your manners?

664
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:46,820
How dare you come up here?
Go down.

665
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:48,650
Dok Go Jin!

666
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,130
Have you gone crazy?

667
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:57,010
Where did you buy the mattress from?
It's really good.

668
00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:00,380
Watch where you sit. Get up.
You're contaminating it.

669
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:04,370
Wow, it's even better when I lie down.

670
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:10,390
It's that good?

671
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:13,690
Do you want to sleep over tonight?
Shall we have fun together?

672
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:19,090
I was just wondering if I should
get a new mattress for myself.

673
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,050
Go downstairs. Now.

674
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:24,810
Dok Go Jin!

675
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,080
What now?

676
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:34,550
- Can I borrow this?
- What?

677
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:39,370
I decided to do a sexy dance
for the first shooting of the show,

678
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:42,170
and I think it'll be funnier to wear this
than wearing a wig. Don't you think?

679
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:45,360
Do you think this is an inventory
for props? I will not lend it to you.

680
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:49,710
I'll go to the inventory and borrow then.

681
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:55,550
Gu Ae Jeong. Do you want to go
on TV and dance wearing this?

682
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,790
I have to, so I don't get edited out.

683
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:01,840
I want to show my face on TV
even for one more minute.

684
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:05,700
That's how I make my living.
I staked my life on the show.

685
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:07,560
I can do anything.

686
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:12,070
Sure, while being beaten by a newbie
and stepped on by your colleague,

687
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:13,400
work hard to hang in there.

688
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:18,010
Did you just cheer me up?
I'm grateful.

689
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:20,090
You are honored.

690
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:24,010
- This...
- Ae Jeong!

691
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:28,590
I need to give this to her. Right?

692
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:44,140
Belonging to a company
is a real treat, huh?

693
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,650
You are sponsored by a shop like this.

694
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:48,780
Right.

695
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:50,270
Gu Ae Jeong.

696
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,540
Hello.

697
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:54,520
Hello. We are here to pick up
the sponsored dress.

698
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:56,150
Please come over here.

699
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,610
- Yes.
- Yes.

700
00:44:58,680 --> 00:44:59,870
Here.

701
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,610
Which is the one that I'm going to wear?

702
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:10,000
Here it is.

703
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:12,240
Which one?

704
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:17,350
Everything. Everything is sponsored
for you. Just wear whatever you want.

705
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:18,300
Really?

706
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:19,240
Sure.

707
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,900
What was that?

708
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:29,540
You took everything
and you brought them back.

709
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:31,790
I thought you were
going to give them to Se Ri.

710
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,420
I don't know.
She'll wear someone else's.

711
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:35,680
That's why you passed them to her?

712
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:37,230
I don't know.

713
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:40,490
Since we are in the same company,
I guess the company arranged it like that.

714
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:41,780
Why, is there a problem with that?

715
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:45,820
Never mind. You are the best.
Do whatever you want.

716
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:56,330
Let me introduce Gu Ae Jeong
who is making a strong comeback...

717
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:57,830
Gu Ae Jeong!

718
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,890
Hello. My name is Gu Ae Jeong.

719
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:02,180
I'll do my best with my fresh resolve.

720
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:09,440
Because of you my chest,
my heart goes "thump thump".

721
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:16,470
I love only you,
I yell with my whole heart.

722
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:20,000
I'm dreaming you'll see me with

723
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,050
trembling lips waiting and my eyes closed,

724
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:31,750
and that you'll act first to give me a hug.

725
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:51,150
At first, we didn't get along

726
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:58,480
We only fought
and frustrated each other

727
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:02,400
It's so strange

728
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:06,210
Suddenly our hearts connected

729
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:14,770
When you're not around,
I miss you like crazy

730
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:18,650
My special someone

731
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:22,360
My exciting gift

732
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:26,340
Dok Go Jin?!

733
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:36,960
What is this song?

734
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,430
What are you?

735
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:54,860
Why is it doing this?

736
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:19,200
We will start. Relax.

737
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:24,130
One more time.

738
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:27,580
The results indicate no problem.

739
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:30,510
What are the symptoms exactly?

740
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,200
At first, I thought the
heart rate monitor was broken.

741
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:35,470
But it turns out it was not.

742
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:40,370
Whenever I hear this weird song,
the heart rate goes up.

743
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:49,700
Because of you my chest,
my heart goes "thump thump. "

744
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:52,570
I love only you,

745
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:54,340
- I yell with my whole heart.
- So...

746
00:48:54,350 --> 00:48:56,000
did you feel pain?

747
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,890
Yes, a while ago I did for a moment.

748
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:12,490
No doubt, whenever I listen to that song,
my heart pounds.

749
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:26,010
Why is it doing this?
Should it be opened again?

750
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:29,370
Are the artificial components
in me reacting...

751
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:32,450
...to some kind of sound waves
of the song?

752
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:34,040
Are you shooting a Sci-Fi film here?

753
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:38,320
You asked to be called an iron man...

754
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:40,480
...when you first got
the artificial heart implant.

755
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:42,780
Stop trivializing.

756
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:46,360
Though it is true that you too
are saved by a miraculous luck.

757
00:49:46,370 --> 00:49:47,710
Right.

758
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:52,210
This has been loyally beating only for that
special creature who's alive by a miracle.

759
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:54,070
I'm telling you,

760
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,300
when this is randomly beating for
someone else, no, for some other reasons,

761
00:49:57,310 --> 00:49:59,940
it is not normal.

762
00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:03,340
Doctor, am I really okay?

763
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:05,830
Sure, there is no abnormality.

764
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:12,160
Okay. Then, I'll get going.

765
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:15,070
Dok Go Jin.

766
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:19,360
Isn't that a simple symptom
that everyone experiences?

767
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:20,260
What is?

768
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:24,180
Isn't your heart fluttering because
you have a crush on someone?

769
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:30,470
Doctor, you got old,
did your brain go stale?

770
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,650
Anyway,

771
00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:35,840
it's a good thing the heart of an arrogant
person like you seems to be normal.

772
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:39,440
Sure. Let me get going.

773
00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:07,440
These are all the scenarios available
in the Korean movie industry

774
00:51:07,450 --> 00:51:09,500
except for the romantic movies
that you despise so much.

775
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:15,790
Representative Moon,
do you like romance movies?

776
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,020
Yes, why?

777
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:21,720
I'm asking because it might help me
to act out emotional scenes.

778
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:24,680
You know, when you watch
a movie like that,

779
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:28,190
two people fall in love and then
they cheesily gaze at each other,

780
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:31,920
and then you put lame
heart-pounding sound effects and all...

781
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:32,730
Yes?

782
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,300
Is it like that in real life?

783
00:51:34,410 --> 00:51:37,480
It's not heard outside
like in a movie but...

784
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:39,850
...you can hear the pounding in yourself.

785
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:45,780
Then, if it pounds when
you see her cry, laugh...

786
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:49,040
does that mean you like her?

787
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:50,980
Not necessarily.

788
00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:52,690
Right.

789
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:57,150
It may pound because
she's laughable or pathetic.

790
00:51:57,260 --> 00:52:01,790
You are right.
Laughable and pathetic, I like that.

791
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,570
For sure,

792
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:08,190
there is a case when the heart pounds
only because you like her.

793
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:09,740
When?

794
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:13,860
You can be certain of it
if your heart races

795
00:52:13,870 --> 00:52:17,020
when you see that person
with someone of the opposite sex.

796
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:18,210
It means you like her.

797
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:20,440
Representative Moon.

798
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:21,700
Yes?

799
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:30,570
Then, it's not the case.
Of course, how could it be?

800
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:45,760
Couple Making is starting off again
with a new season.

801
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:49,690
Please tune in and show enthusiasm
like you did for Seasons 1 and 2.

802
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:50,720
Kang Se Ri,

803
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:54,130
how does it feel to work with former
National Treasure Girls member, Gu Ae Jeong?

804
00:52:58,030 --> 00:53:00,690
It's been 10 years,

805
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:04,870
but I feel comfortable like
I have a sister.

806
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:09,850
And I feel much more secure
having her by me.

807
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:13,540
These days, there are
a lot of mini groups around.

808
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:15,740
Why don't the two of you form a
National Treasure Girls mini group?

809
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:17,190
Shall we?

810
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:20,930
And... shall we call it
National Treasure Sisters then?

811
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:28,520
I'm going nuts because of Gu Ae Jeong.

812
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:31,500
Why does she keep hooking me with her?

813
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:34,240
What?! National Treasure Sisters?

814
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:36,600
It's helping the publicity of the show.

815
00:53:36,610 --> 00:53:39,220
That's why we cast her
in the first place.

816
00:53:39,230 --> 00:53:42,670
Only for the show. I'll tolerate
this until the first shoot.

817
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:46,770
After that, there won't be any occasion to
bump into her, since she'll be eliminated.

818
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:52,410
But, do we have to eliminate Gu Ae Jeong?

819
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:54,050
- What!
- Gu Ae Jeong...

820
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:55,990
...diligently showed her face on TV,

821
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:58,680
and has consolidated her image
as an unlikable character.

822
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:00,800
If we get rid of the
First Impression test,

823
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:02,880
we can keep the show interesting
with her in it.

824
00:54:02,890 --> 00:54:03,790
What are you talking about?

825
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,760
the First Impression test
is what keeps the tension alive.

826
00:54:05,770 --> 00:54:11,350
We can't get rid of that. The biggest
reason we cast her is for that.

827
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:18,480
Why don't we create a new framework
for the new season?

828
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:21,610
Elimination at the First Impression test...

829
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:25,520
Let's change things up this time.

830
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:30,750
It already came out.

831
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:34,020
The casting is quick and fitting
for a popular show like this.

832
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,800
This season, all of them are competitive.

833
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:43,640
5th, 4th, 3rd, 2nd, 1st.

834
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:46,020
Gu Ae Jeong is the first?
Is it in the order you like them?

835
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:47,820
In the order of ugliness.

836
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:50,480
Well Gu Ae Jeong is also in first
place for the Internet survey.

837
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,020
- What is?
- It's called the First Impression test.

838
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:54,930
It eliminates someone
in the early phase of the show.

839
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:58,180
On the internet, they are surveying
who has the best first impression.

840
00:54:58,390 --> 00:55:00,010
Gu Ae Jeong is in first place?

841
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:01,660
Of course the 5th.

842
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:03,810
She's the most likely person
to be eliminated first.

843
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:06,520
Before I forget, I should vote too.

844
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:10,680
Who should I vote for?

845
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:12,250
Who knows? I don't care.

846
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:15,430
Since she's in the same company,
I should vote for her, right?

847
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:19,060
No, should I vote for
Ha Ru Mi from Candies?

848
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:20,780
Ha Ru Mi?

849
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:21,980
Gu Ae Jeong?

850
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:24,500
Ha Ru Mi?

851
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:27,250
Gu Ae Jeong? Ha Ru Mi?
Gu Ae Jeong? Ha Ru Mi?

852
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:30,900
A vote for pretty Ha Ru Mi, yeah.

853
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:39,390
Did you highlight all my scenarios?

854
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:43,500
Yes, I highlighted all the parts
that you are cast for, in yellow.

855
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:47,720
Yellow makes my eyes burn with pain,
change them to blue.

856
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:50,320
Why, you don't want to?

857
00:55:50,450 --> 00:55:53,350
No. I'll change them, Hyungnim.

858
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:57,930
Leave the computer.

859
00:55:58,950 --> 00:56:00,120
Okay.

860
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:27,730
Finally, tomorrow is the first shooting.

861
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:32,130
Is the first elimination
going to be in the first shooting?

862
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:34,290
Yes, at the end of the shooting.

863
00:56:34,610 --> 00:56:36,480
What would you do if you get eliminated?

864
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,750
Even if I get eliminated,

865
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,960
With footage from the introduction part
and the game at the start,

866
00:56:40,970 --> 00:56:43,260
I can be on TV for two to three weeks.

867
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:47,100
Elimination just 5 minutes
into the show.

868
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:49,760
It creates a nice tension
and wouldn't it be interesting?

869
00:56:49,770 --> 00:56:52,730
You won't be on TV for even 5 minutes
if you get eliminated?

870
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:55,740
And that person is most likely
to be Gu Ae Jeong.

871
00:56:56,010 --> 00:56:57,600
Gu Ae Jeong came here every day

872
00:56:57,710 --> 00:57:00,180
to show us the talent
performance she practiced.

873
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:02,440
Ae Jeong might not be eliminated first.

874
00:57:02,870 --> 00:57:08,380
It's only that she's most likely
to be eliminated.

875
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:13,100
- Look, this is it. It's a killer.
- It looks great.

876
00:57:13,110 --> 00:57:14,940
Wow, look at this!

877
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:19,740
This is brand new. It should be
really comfortable driving this van.

878
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:22,540
It's all because of this van
that I got involved with Dok Go Jin.

879
00:57:22,550 --> 00:57:26,430
I thought it was from another world.
And I get to be in this van now.

880
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:28,960
Not in your lifetime!

881
00:57:32,270 --> 00:57:33,650
It's my personal van.

882
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:35,930
You are not on a level
to share this vehicle with me.

883
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:38,210
Representative Moon told me to use this.

884
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:40,250
It's not yours, it's the company's.

885
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:42,820
This company is the same as me.

886
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:46,520
Jae Seok, I'll use this van tomorrow.

887
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:48,760
So drive it to my house by 7 AM.

888
00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:50,270
You don't have any schedule tomorrow...

889
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:54,350
I'm going to drive around
Seoul in this van.

890
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:13,630
Who's honking at this hour?

891
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,560
Stop honking! Shut up!

892
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:25,060
Are you crazy, Kim Jae Seok? Stop it.

893
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:26,360
Good morning.

894
00:58:30,070 --> 00:58:31,480
You.

895
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:34,630
Throw this away.

896
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:41,270
Gu Ae... Gu Ae Jeong,
you... stop that... car...

897
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:48,010
I feel much better now.

898
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:52,110
Ae Jeong, now that you are feeling
better, let's go and nail the show.

899
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:53,830
Yeah, let's do it, Manager.

900
00:59:18,370 --> 00:59:21,340
- Morning.
- Hello. Hello.

901
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:25,430
Hello, Hello. Hello

902
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:30,350
Gu Ae Jeong, you look happy today.

903
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:32,350
You must have not seen the script yet.

904
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:38,070
Is there something in the script?

905
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,880
If they were going to do this, why did they
ask you to practice your gig and dance?

906
00:59:41,890 --> 00:59:44,330
Why do you think I'm going to be eliminated?

907
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:45,900
I'm going to do everything.

908
00:59:45,910 --> 00:59:48,720
I'll leave only after I finish
showing the gig that I prepared,

909
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:50,490
and the sexy dance I practiced.

910
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:02,230
I do have a good first impression.

911
01:00:02,970 --> 01:00:06,120
Who knows? That perfect man
might fall for my first impression.

912
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:11,340
Gu Ae Jeong came to my house
and left after honking loudly.

913
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:13,100
Bring her here as soon as
she finishes shooting.

914
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:15,490
Why don't you leave her alone today?

915
01:00:15,770 --> 01:00:18,460
After the shooting,
she is going to be depressed.

916
01:00:18,570 --> 01:00:19,330
Why would she be depressed?

917
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:22,850
She's going to be "out"
after shooting the first scene.

918
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:29,240
She said she's going to stake her life
and do her best on the show.

919
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:30,270
Why?

920
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:33,940
Hello, my name is Gu Ae Jeong.

921
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:36,030
Hi, I'm Gu Ae Jeong.

922
01:00:47,990 --> 01:00:49,510
[Blocked Number)

923
01:00:52,990 --> 01:00:54,300
Yes, why?

924
01:00:54,430 --> 01:00:56,520
Gu Ae Jeong, don't do the show
and just come out,

925
01:00:56,530 --> 01:00:59,040
I'll get you a commercial,
a movie, whatever.

926
01:00:59,050 --> 01:01:00,780
Tell them that you can't do this
and just come back.

927
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:03,020
Why would you do that?
I'm going to do this.

928
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:05,860
You're going to be humiliated
as soon as the shooting starts.

929
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:07,750
- Why would you do this?
- What about it?

930
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:09,330
You still don't understand?

931
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:10,900
I understand it clearly.

932
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:15,010
I'm okay because I can understand
my situation so clearly.

933
01:01:15,310 --> 01:01:17,720
I'll go on the set now. Bye.

934
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:22,970
You never listen, Gu Ae Jeong!

935
01:01:28,630 --> 01:01:34,250
I staked my life on the show.
I can do anything.

936
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:39,130
Who exactly is the man
who will eliminate her?

937
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:41,100
The male lead on the show.

938
01:01:41,290 --> 01:01:45,880
I should go negotiate to make the
male lead and Gu Ae Jeong a couple.

939
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:50,960
There is no time to ponder. So just
pick according to your first impression.

940
01:01:51,050 --> 01:01:53,650
They are all professionals,

941
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:55,740
you don't have to feel sorry
for the eliminated person.

942
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:57,930
They all chose to appear knowing the risk.

943
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:02,000
According to my first impression...
and no need to feel sorry.

944
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:03,190
Right!

945
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:17,060
Hello. Welcome to Couple Making
Season 3. I'm Kang Se Ri.

946
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:19,650
We invite you to the
romantic secret dates...

947
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:22,190
...of female celebrities
and an attractive bachelor.

948
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:26,090
Couple Making is now
embarking on a new story.

949
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:42,600
It's the time you've all been waiting for.

950
01:02:42,610 --> 01:02:48,240
Let me introduce "The Perfect Man"
whom we discovered for this show.

951
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:50,770
Please come out of the secret room.

952
01:02:54,790 --> 01:02:57,480
Shall we all clap?

953
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:05,840
Hello, My name is Yoon Pil Joo.
I'm a doctor.

954
01:03:05,950 --> 01:03:08,660
You can see right away how sweet he is.

955
01:03:08,670 --> 01:03:15,160
Now please look at the contenders
for 3 seconds.

956
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:33,930
Now 3 seconds have passed.

957
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:52,560
Now it's time for the first impression test.

958
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:56,420
Please give the roses to the contenders...

959
01:03:56,430 --> 01:03:58,740
...who passed the first impression test.

960
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:03,900
Which contender will not
get Pil Joo's rose?

961
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:21,180
Three roses have been given.

962
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:24,240
Now, only one rose remains.

963
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:26,040
Between celebrity Kim Hee Jin and...

964
01:04:26,050 --> 01:04:29,490
...Gu Ae Jeong from the original
girl group, National Treasure Girls,

965
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:32,570
one will be eliminated.

966
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:39,230
Who will be eliminated first
in Couple Making Season 3?

967
01:04:45,910 --> 01:04:48,030
Now, Mr. Yoon Pil Joo,

968
01:04:48,130 --> 01:04:51,540
please hand out
the final rose.

969
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:21,520
You can be certain of it
if your heart races

970
01:05:21,730 --> 01:05:24,890
when you see that person
with someone of the opposite sex.

971
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:31,930
It means you like her.
