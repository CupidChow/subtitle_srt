4
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,450
Elder Chongguang.

5
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,680
Let me ask you.

6
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,320
Can you tell everyone the truth?

7
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,030
I was telling the truth.

8
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,830
Did you tell them

9
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,840
you are the son of Qionghua's traitor,

10
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,020
Yun Tianqing?

11
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,120
The son of a traitor?

12
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:22,140
How could he...

13
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,380
So you are Yun Tianqing’s son.

14
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,770
Who are you calling a traitor?

15
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:33,410
Ignorant boy.

16
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,460
Except the new disciples,

17
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,250
everyone knows about it here.

18
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,220
Your father,

19
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,300
Yun Tianqing,

20
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,079
is a traitor of Qionghua

21
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,070
who killed his fellow disciples.

22
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,320
I don’t believe your nonsense!

23
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,690
Elder Chongguang.

24
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,990
Yun Tianhe passed the training

25
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,370
through just there days of training by himself.

26
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,010
I agreed to let him enter.

27
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,350
Su Yao.

28
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,790
I shouldn't have come.

29
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,870
But as the Grandmaster,

30
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,370
you took in the son of a traitor.

31
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,510
Have you forgotten what

32
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,910
Yun Tianqing owed Qionghua?

33
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,230
Not to mention the debt he has to pay.

34
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,130
at that moment,

35
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,510
you should have abolished his spiritual power

36
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:15,550
and expelled him.

37
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,630
Elder,

38
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,930
that's too serious.

39
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,820
Don't listen to this old man.

40
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,840
Shall we go?

41
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,829
Wait.

42
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,190
Wangshu belongs to our sect.

43
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,880
Return Wangshu

44
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,600
and get out of Qionghua!

45
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,030
I won't leave!

46
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,829
My father gave me this sword.

47
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,700
Tell me clearly what happened to my dad.

48
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,590
What does my father owe you?

49
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,650
19 years ago, the demon clan did evil.

50
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,710
We fought for the sake of the world.

51
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,910
We were about to win,

52
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,360
yet your father

53
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:52,430
colluded with the demon clan

54
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,720
and causing everything to be in vain

55
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:57,170
His fellow men from the sect were severely injured.

56
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,700
Among over 3,000 disciples

57
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:02,160
only tens of them survived.

58
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,120
This is a heinous crime.

59
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:30,830
Impossible.

60
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,610
My father would never do such a thing.

61
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,200
My father has always

62
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,830
protected the weak and can tell good from evil.

63
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,590
He was even worried that I would be used

64
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,110
and bring chaos to the world

65
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,440
so he wouldn'y let me leave Qingluan Peak.

66
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,580
He wouldn't harm his fellow disciples.

67
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,990
Our four Sect Leaders and Elders,

68
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,430
including Grandmaster,

69
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,830
all went through it ourselves 19 years ago.

70
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,510
You can ask Grandmaster if you don't believe me.

71
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,990
Wangshu belongs to our sect.

72
00:04:58,409 --> 00:05:01,180
Yun Tianqing was just a disciple.

73
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,880
If he hadn’t colluded with the demon clan

74
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,940
and stole Wangshu,

75
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,620
why would you have the sword?

76
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:07,330
Exactly.

77
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,550
Su Yao,

78
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,300
as the Grandmaster,

79
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,960
are you not admitting to such a big issue

80
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,620
for the ties and grudges you had?

81
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,870
The war 19 years ago

82
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,510
was indeed true.

83
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,190
And Wangshu

84
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,960
was indeed taken by your parents.

85
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,710
So it’s true.

86
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,450
Yun Tianqing is a murderer!

87
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,070
Son of a traitor. Get out of Qionghua!

88
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,930
-You!
-Son of a traitor. Get out of Qionghua!

89
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:52,250
Son of a traitor. Get out of Qionghua!

90
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,200
Even so,

91
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,180
you shouldn't be bullying Tianhe.

92
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,240
Get out of Qionghua!

93
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:03,190
Son of a traitor. Get out of Qionghua!

94
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:05,530
Son of a traitor. Get out of Qionghua!

95
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,690
Do you remember what I told you before?

96
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,110
Promise me,

97
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,460
control your temper.

98
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,500
Don't explode as and when like a firecracker.

99
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,910
Don't let other people's words

100
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,100
get to you.

101
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,550
Okay, I promise you.

102
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,870
Get out of Qionghua!

103
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:26,750
Son of a traitor. Get out of Qionghua!

104
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:38,550
Son of a traitor. Get out of Qionghua!

105
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,550
Didn't you say my father was a traitor?

106
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,510
I shall return the sword ot you.

107
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,780
You do it.

108
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:36,590
This sword

109
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,700
is right here.

110
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,870
Who can take it away?

111
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,330
Chongguang will definitely make things difficult for this child.

112
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:05,370
As an elder,

113
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,490
I must go.

114
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,150
No.

115
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,790
If I dig up what happened 19 years ago,

116
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,050
what should I say?

117
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,560
I can't go.

118
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,730
But to be honest,

119
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,390
I really want to see

120
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,430
what Yun Tianqing’s son looks like.

121
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,750
I have to go.

122
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:26,440
I...

123
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,070
If he asks me

124
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,690
about his father 19 years ago,

125
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:31,880
what should I say?

126
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,150
I definitely can't go.

127
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,789
I can't go. I can't go.

128
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,330
Focus on meditation. Focus on meditation.

129
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,020
I never know

130
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,240
what's the difference between meditation and sleeping.

131
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,810
Since you said

132
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,790
Tianhe's father stole Wangshu,

133
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,150
then why can only

134
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,470
Tianhe's father and

135
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,930
Tianhe pick this sword up?

136
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:06,560
It's not that I don't return the sword,

137
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,320
but you can't take it away.

138
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,190
Wangshu Sword is a sacred object.

139
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,720
It will choose its own host.

140
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,310
So,

141
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,830
Wangshu Sword

142
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,270
chose Mr. Yun's parents as hosts.

143
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,830
It wasn't stealing.

144
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,790
Since this Wangshu Sword

145
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,960
left with Tianhe's parents voluntarily,

146
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,350
then what do you mean by they colluded with the demon clan and killed their fellow disciples?

147
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,150
That's right.

148
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,420
Besides,

149
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,570
it's Wangshu Sword which chose Mr. Yun to hold it.

150
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,560
Elder,

151
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,830
are you going to expel Mr. Yun and Wangshu Sword

152
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,390
together?

153
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:47,470
Elder,

154
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,960
we're waiting for your answer.

155
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,370
Not to mention that we're all people who experienced it ourselves.

156
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,350
There are records of this war 19 years ago

157
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,800
on Qionghua's Book of History.

158
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:06,110
What did you experience then?

159
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,130
Of course I experienced the war

160
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,210
and witnessed the deaths of my fellow disciples.

161
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,190
Did you experience yourself

162
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,590
how my father colluded with the demon clan?

163
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,500
Since you didn't see it with your own eyes,

164
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,830
why should I believe you

165
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,480
that my father is a traitor?

166
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,490
Because I'm an Elder of Qionghua.

167
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,600
Because I can

168
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,920
get you out of the this sect's gate.

169
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,160
You're just acting on your seniority.

170
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:33,610
Miss Han.

171
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,750
You're a new disciple.

172
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,110
But you can be kicked out

173
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,570
for just being impolite to the elders.

174
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:42,120
However,

175
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,770
all decisions to be made for Qionghua

176
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:48,330
are all decided by Grandmaster.

177
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,670
Yun Tianhe,

178
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,290
no matter how much you question and quibble,

179
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,630
you can't change the fact that the tragedy 19 years ago

180
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,840
is related to your father.

181
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:09,480
If you choose to stay in Qionghua,

182
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,630
you will face

183
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,510
everyone's despise and hatred.

184
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,980
Are you still willing to stay?

185
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:19,130
A soldier can be killed but not humiliated.

186
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:21,790
I want to stay!

187
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,410
I want to stay in Qionghua!

188
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,910
To find out the truth

189
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,570
and clear my father's name!

190
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,150
Very well.

191
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,550
According to Qionghua's rules,

192
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,070
a new disciple

193
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,350
must be accepted by the Sect Leaders

194
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,510
to become a real disciple of Qionghua.

195
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,120
If no one accepts you,

196
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:43,860
you can only leave.

197
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:45,790
So,

198
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,970
will anyone take them as their disciple?

199
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,630
Sect Leader Xu Zhao,

200
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,450
you've always cherished talents.

201
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:05,970
What do you think?

202
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,910
I will never accept the son of a traitor.

203
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,130
What about the two ladies?

204
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,810
If they are implicated because of what happened in the past,

205
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:20,620
that isn't your usual style.

206
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,630
Grandmaster,

207
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,830
I have the most number of disciples.

208
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:27,680
My old injury relapsed recently. I'm afraid...

209
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,670
Yeah, right!

210
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,400
I won't go even if you invite me.

211
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,610
Liu Mengli once practiced some magic.

212
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,000
She has a good foundation.

213
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,960
I would love it if you could

214
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,270
practice in my Heart Sect.

215
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,730
Thank you for your appreciation.

216
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:48,650
If Mr. Yun and Lingsha can't stay in Qionghua,

217
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,540
I will leave with them.

218
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:56,790
Grandmaster,

219
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,770
I can accept Han Lingsha.

220
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,050
She's proficient in fengshui.

221
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,460
She is a rare talent.

222
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:06,390
Our sect specializes in fengshui and looking for mines. We attach importance to smelting.

223
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,170
If she studies under me,

224
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,630
she'll achieve something in the future.

225
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,880
Thank you for your appreciation.

226
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,860
But like Mengli,

227
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,260
we'll stay together.

228
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,320
If one of us leaves, we will all leave.

229
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,630
Then there's only Yun Tianhe left.

230
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,830
Who will take him?

231
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,590
Whoever takes him

232
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,260
will be recorded

233
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,680
in Qionghua's Book of History.

234
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,290
It's not that you don't choose Tianhe,

235
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,290
but that Tianhe isn't choosing you!

236
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:47,240
Goodbye!

237
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,250
Let's go.

238
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:58,600
This sword

239
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,430
was left to me by my father.

240
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:03,910
No one can wield it except me.

241
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:06,710
Don't say that I,

242
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,910
Yun Tianhe,

243
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:11,230
stole this sword on that whatever book of yours.

244
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:19,360
Wait.

245
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:29,630
Grandmaster,

246
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,520
I'm willing to take Yun Tianhe in.

247
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:40,640
Ziying.

248
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,220
You know who he is,

249
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,340
but you still want to take him in.

250
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,900
Have you made up your mind?

251
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:48,710
Grandmaster,

252
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,920
I only know that Yun Tianqing rebelled,

253
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,750
but didn't experience it myself.

254
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,750
But along the way,

255
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,690
I've been through a lot of dangers

256
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:57,250
with Yun Tianhe.

257
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,740
If he wasn't willing to sacrifice himself

258
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,990
he wouldn't have been able to take back Wangshu

259
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,560
and save thousands of innocent lives in Chenzhou.

260
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,290
But his father is Yun Tianqing.

261
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,060
That's a traitor

262
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:09,290
who killed his fellow disciples.

263
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:10,100
Why?

264
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,870
Are all of your parents

265
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,430
from noble families and heroes?

266
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:14,630
People know not to ask

267
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,090
a hero about their family.

268
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,430
You are Qionghua Sect, yet you're scrutinizing everyone.

269
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:22,090
I think you're the one who only look good but don't have any skills.

270
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,590
Lingsha is right.

271
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:28,920
Today,

272
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,310
if we drag down Yun Tianqing's son

273
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,430
for his sins,

274
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,540
then what would the people of

275
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,670
Chenzhou and Shouyang who were saved by Tianhe

276
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,190
think of Qionghua?

277
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,840
Grandmaster, Elders,

278
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:51,230
I can prove that

279
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,260
in the battle between Chenzhou and Beike,

280
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,540
Mr. Yun risked his life

281
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,720
and saved the people of Chenzhou.

282
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,650
Huaishuo.

283
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,520
You don't normally speak much.

284
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,390
Why can't you keep your mouth shut today?

285
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,800
I'm just telling the truth.

286
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,700
Grandmaster has always been fair.

287
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,230
Please make your decision.

288
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,680
Since the Wangshu Sword reappeared,

289
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,910
I sent Ziying to investigate.

290
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,550
I know everything Yun Tianhe did

291
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,110
on his way here.

292
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:26,270
That's why I allowed him to enter Qionghua Mountain.

293
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:27,320
Su Yao,

294
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,670
as the Grandmaster,

295
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,790
you can't be merciful.

296
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,130
It's exactly because I'm the Grandmaster of Qionghua,

297
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,930
that I need to be strict and fair.

298
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:39,510
Qionghua chooses disciples based on talent and character.

299
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,880
Not because they are someone's son.

300
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:44,750
If Yun Tianhe is not the son of Yun Tianqing,

301
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,850
I’m afraid all of you would want him as your disciple.

302
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,700
Yun Tianhe.

303
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,490
It's fate that Wangshu chose you.

304
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,230
But criticism and rumors

305
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,390
are things you have to handle too.

306
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,100
Let me ask you again.

307
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,750
Are you really going to stay?

308
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:07,750
Of course!

309
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:13,290
No matter how hard it is, you must stay?

310
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:15,380
I want to stay!

311
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,280
Because

312
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:20,020
♫You, who is isolated in the darkness♫

313
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,970

315
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,410
♫You, who is as insignificant as dust♫

316

but those people are so vicious.

353
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:35,780
Tianhe,

354
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,510
don't be too sad.

355
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:39,620
It's okay.

356
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,030
I just...

357
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:45,550
didn't expect them to say that about my father.

358
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,000
Although rumours are scary,

359
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,120
it may not be true.

360
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,550
I know.

361
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:52,850
Tianhe,

362
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,090
since you've decided to stay,

363
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:59,690
and I've accepted you as my disciple,

364
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,620
both you and I have no turning back.

365
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,470
We can only move forward.

366
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,990
I heard from Senior Huaishuo that

367
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:12,940
Qionghua's disciples would all come here

368
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,380
after learning their sword skills

369
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,650
to show their sword array to the Sect Leader.

370
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:18,450
That's right.

371
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,810
I still remember when I was young,

372
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:25,110
I used to wield my sword 300 times to show my father every day.

373
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,190
I asked him

374
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,100
why do I have to practice swordsmanship.

375
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,260
My father said

376
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,680
everyone has their own purpose to practice sword.

377
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,470
But his sword

378
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,930
is only to protect the weak;

379
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,840
to keep the good, and eliminate evil.

380
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:42,210
Did your father really say that?

381
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,030
Yes.

382
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,090
So I don't believe my father

383
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,900
would do anything to harm his fellow disciples.

384
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,530
I must find out the truth

385
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,430
and clear my father's name.

386
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,030
Very well.

387
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:57,920
I'll help you with your investigation.

388
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,670
Now that you're Qionghua's disciple,

389
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,090
you still have a lot of time

390
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,290
to find out the truth.

391
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,490
Don't think about that for now.

392
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,890
I'll take you to get familiar with

393
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,800
various areas in Qionghua first.

394
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,850
Do you know a place called Zuihuayin?

395
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:21,090
[Drunken Flower Yin]

396
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:26,890
This is Zuihuayin.

397
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,400
It's just that rarely anyone comes here normally.

398
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:33,070
I've never seen such a beautiful tree before.

399
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,520
Such bright red flowers

400
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,360
can grow on such a white tree?

401
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,760
The tree trunk is magestic and straight.

402
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,920
I don't know why

403
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,080
but I'm touched by the sight of it.

404
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,440
This is the Phoenix Flower Tree.

405
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,900
I heard that years ago

406
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,210
some predecessors who had close relationships

407
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:51,210
would often gather under this tree.

408
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,040
"Fragrance fills the air in Zuihuayin,

409
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,920
giving joy to the prime of life I'm in,

410
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,180
beating away the chill in early spring."

411
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,880
Didn't you say

412
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,240
your father had never taught you poetry?

413
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,440
How did the verse come out of your mouth?

414
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,370
I didn't compose it.

415
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,570
My mother did.

416
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:11,630
My father said

417
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,250
my mother especially liked

418
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,730
a place called Zuihuayin.

419
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,920
Whenever she thought of Zuihuayin,

420
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,320
she would say this verse.

421
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:22,870
Later, everytime my father missed my mother,

422
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,190
he would recite the same verse.

423
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:28,150
I didn't expect

424
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,440
I could really see Zuihuayin in Qionghua Sect.

425
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,750
I guess

426
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,970
among those who Mr. Murong said

427
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:37,400
to often gather under the Phoenix Flower Tree,

428
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,000
there must have been Uncle Yun and your mother.

429
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,150
Mr. Murong,

430
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,380
do you know who else would do that too?

431
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,360
It's just a story I heard.

432
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,810
I don't really know the details.

433
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:48,480
Mengli,

434
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,060
we've all become disciples of Qionghua Sect.

435
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,730
You don't need to refer to them as Mr. Yun

436
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:52,550
and Mr. Murong.

437
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,210
Just call them by their names.

438
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:56,170
Ziying,

439
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,130
this time, you protected Tianhe

440
00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:59,420
and took him in as your apprentice.

441
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,950
I'm deeply moved by that.

442
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,780
From now on, I won't call you Ice Cube anymore.

443
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:06,150
Ziying, I will work very hard

444
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,540
and live up to your expectations.

445
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,080
From now on,

446
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:12,870
you should call me Uncle.

447
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,760
Uncle.

448
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:23,000
Go and take a rest.

449
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:26,070
Senior Su Xi and Senior Xu Liang are excellent sword users.

450
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,670
Mengli, Lingsha,

451
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,920
you must listen to your masters.

452
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,830
We'd like to meet Grandmaster.

453
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:38,800
Uncle!

454
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,660
Yun Tianhe has been to Zuihuayin?

455
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,430
I

456
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,360
saw that happen with my own eyes.

457
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,480
Yun Tianqing must have told his son

458
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,410
about Zuihuayin.

459
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:09,080
The area under the Phoenix Flower Tree

460
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:12,760
was our favorite place when the four of us were young.

461
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,190
What a shame!

462
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,530
The phoenix flowers are still the same

463
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:20,350
but the four of us have already changed.

464
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:37,330
Greetings, Grandmaster.

465
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:38,570
The three of you

466
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,330
are official disciples of Qionghua Sect now.

467
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,470
Instead of meeting with your masters,

468
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,740
you came to me. Why?

469
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,190
Grandmaster,

470
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,530
Lingsha and I would like to ask you a favor.

471
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:53,670
Go ahead.

472
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:56,380
We want to join Tianhe

473
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:58,250
and be apprenticed to Uncle Ziying.

474
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:58,690
Yes.

475
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:00,990
The three of us must not be separated.

476
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,730
When Ziying first entered the sect,

477
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,640
due to his unique talent,

478
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,120
all sect leaders competed for him.

479
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:12,620
At last, I entrusted him

480
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,240
to the care of my junior, Su Shen,

481
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,650
and asked Zong Lian and two other elders to teach him.

482
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,100
It was unprecedented.

483
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,400
However, Ziying has never had an apprentice.

484
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,570
He has no experience in being a master

485
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:26,870
but now he's getting three apprentices all at once.

486
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:29,270
Such a thing has never happened in the sect.

487
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:32,850
Grandmaster,

488
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,280
I know I'm young

489
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,840
and that I've never had an apprentice.

490
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,980
However, Tianhe and his friends have built a deep bond.

491
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,670
If I take on the identity of Uncle Ziying

492
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:40,820
when I teach them,

493
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:43,050
then it won't be a violation of rules.

494
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,980
I hope you'll agree to that, Grandmaster.

495
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,450
We hope you'll agree to that, Grandmaster.

496
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:48,280
Ditto!

497
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:51,790
Now that the three of you are united as a team,

498
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,820
I'll grant your request

499
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,460
and see this as a new task for Ziying.

500
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,580
Thank you, Grandmaster.

501
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:01,230
I will do my best to teach them

502
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,980
and never let you down, Grandmaster.

503
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:06,470
Yun Tianhe,

504
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,250
since now you've joined us,

505
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,020
you should return Wangshu Sword to Qionghua Sect,

506
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,620
which your father took away.

507
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:16,250
If you do so,

508
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,230
the elders and sect leaders

509
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:20,370
won't make a complaint anymore.

510
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,340
I'll certainly do it.

511
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,480
Good.

512
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,580
Now that the three of you

513
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,760
have officially become disciples of Qionghua Sect,

514
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,390
you must be respectful,

515
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,240
courteous and rule-abiding.

516
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,350
We'll bear that in mind, Grandmaster.

517
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,130
It's time we took our leave.

518
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,270
Let's go.

519
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,340
The three of them

520
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,220
remind me of

521
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:48,210
the younger me, Su Yu,

522
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,280
and Xuan Xiao.

523
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,170
Master,

524
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,080
you have

525
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,860
promised me more elixirs.

526
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,910
Are you still thinking about that girl?

527
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:00,940
Don't worry.

528
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:03,750
There is still some time before she dies.

529
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,110
No need to rush.

530
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,850
This Disciple Assembly has made me

531
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,010
realize what kind of person Xu Zhao really is.

532
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,150
He calls me Grandmaster

533
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,450
but secretly takes Chongguang's side.

534
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:31,430
He's the son of a traitor!

535
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,630
You punks!

536
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,420
Even Mengli has learned to curse.

537
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,690
Senior Huaixin.

538
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:51,900
Are you also assigned to this assembly point?

539
00:27:58,090 --> 00:27:59,450
Even Grandmaster has admitted Tianhe to the sect

540
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:00,750
but you're still smearing him behind his back.

541
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,080
Talk louder, I dare you!

542
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:03,020
Lingsha!

543
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,900
I'll speak up then.

544
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,100
Your eloquence can't change the facts.

545
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:11,150
He is indeed the son of a traitor.

546
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:11,550
You...

547
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:12,620
May I ask

548
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,140
who your father is?

549
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,320
My father is a merchant in Chenzhou.

550
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,110
I come from a long line of prominent figures and men of integrity.

551
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,280
Then you should know

552
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,940
that years ago when Chenzhou was plagued by demons,

553
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,870
it was my father who repelled them.

554
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:29,550
Well, doesn't that mean your father owes Tianhe's father

555
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:30,470
a "thank you"?

556
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:31,670
Nonsense!

557
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:34,590
You...

558
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,250
I will reveal the evil in you!

559
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,350
Are you done with the chitchat?

560
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,350
-Back to your own positions!
-Come on.

561
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:42,880
Lingsha!

562
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,120
Every day, after gathering in your own divisions,

563
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,120
you ought to come here for training.

564
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:13,770
Senior Huaixi,

565
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,520
you haven't discovered the evil in us yet.

566
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,680
What, you already can't wait to make a fool of yourself?

567
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,080
You...

568
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:20,460
Quiet!

569
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:33,120
Back to your places.

570
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:34,870
The training starts now.

571
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,090
Today, we'll learn how to control our swords.

572
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,310
Dad.

573
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,390
Everyone here

574
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,810
says you betrayed the sect and hurt your fellows.

575
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:06,020
I'm so mad about it.

576
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,380
My wrath is blazing up.

577
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,200
But I know

578
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,830
my rage and anger

579
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:16,250
can't change what people think.

580
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,560
Rest assured, dad.

581
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:24,270
I will prove your innocence.

582
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:26,970
I'll have everyone here know

583
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,590
that my father Yun Tianqing was a great hero.

584
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:33,530
Tianhe,

585
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,880
I've never seen you like this.

586
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,420
You must be in tremendous misery.

587
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:44,490
Lingsha!

588
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,800
I'm not doing anything bad!

589
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:48,600
I know.

590
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:51,870
What brings you here?

591
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,230
Where is Mengli?

592
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:55,150
Mengli is in her room.

593
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:56,590
Now it's meditation time, isn't it?

594
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,810
If a senior comes to check up on us juniors,

595
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:59,140
Mengli can cover for us.

596
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:00,670
Now you've become a better man.

597
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:01,700
You no longer easily get angry

598
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,030
or fall out with people.

599
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:05,810
Anger hurts no one but ourselves.

600
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:08,040
It can't change what people think.

601
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:09,510
Nevertheless,

602
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,600
when I prove my father wasn't a traitor,

603
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,240
I will make those slanderers

604
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:15,350
kneel and apologize to my father.

605
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,760
That's right.

606
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:17,230
As the saying goes,

607
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:20,510
"He who ignores minor distractions will achieve his ambitions."

608
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,640
How will you clear your father's name?

609
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,010
Elder Chongguang!

610
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,350
Given that he said he had been through that hard time,

611
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:29,410
he must know what happened back then.

612
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,200
I'm gonna find Uncle Ziying

613
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,270
and ask him where Elder Chongguang is.

614
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:35,370
I knew you would look for Elder Chongguang.

615
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:35,830
So,

616
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:38,440
I've asked Mengli to put in a good word with Xuanji.

617
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,570
Has Xuanji told you where the elder is?

618
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:42,740
I’ll take you there.

619
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:43,130
Let's go!

620
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:43,500
Go!

621
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,500
According to the location Xuanji said,

622
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,150
this should be Elder Chongguang's residence,

623
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:57,390
Qingfeng Valley.

624
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:00,440
It turns out that all the elders live in such places.

625
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,440
Xuanji has said,

626
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:03,890
since the war that happened 19 years ago,

627
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,280
Elder Chongguang has rarely asked about the sect's affairs.

628
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,140
He chose a scenic place in the sect for cultivation.

629
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:12,360
Lingsha,

630
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,530
someone seems to be cooking.

631
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,830
What a big chunk of lamb!

632
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:44,910
Lingsha!

633
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,380
What kind of taste is this?

634
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,400
It tastes so weird!

635
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,800
Then why would you eat it?

636
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:51,210
It's not edible, is it?

637
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:56,360
What is this?

638
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:58,520
What I just ate tasted so weird.

639
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:01,440
Confess!

640
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:03,150
Are you here to steal my medicinal soup?

641
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,150
Who sent you here?

642
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:06,600
No, no, no!

643
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:09,550
Sir,

644
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,140
do you know where Elder Chongguang is?

645
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:15,790
You scared me.

646
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:18,300
I thought someone was stealing my medicinal soup.

647
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,700
That old man lives there.

648
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:22,880
Are you a servant of Elder Chongguang?

649
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,400
What?

650
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,040
Young lady,

651
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,300
don't I look like a decent immortal to you?

652
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,090
Do I seem like a sevant of that old man?

653
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:32,810
Are you blind or what?

654
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:35,510
Xuanji has said Elder Chongguang lives here.

655
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,970
She hasn't mentioned there lives a crazy old man.

656
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:38,280
Hasn't that little lass Xuanji

657
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:38,980
told you

658
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,550
two elders are living here?

659
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,760
Qionghua Sect respects me

660
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,970
as Elder Qingyang.

661
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:47,670
You are an elder?

662
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,700
I seem to have heard about him from Ziying.

663
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,620
Ziying is my precious apprentice.

664
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,230
We are Ziying's precious apprentices.

665
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,230
I am Lingsha.

666
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,980
Yun Tianhe!

667
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:05,900
You...

668
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:22,010
Since you're an elder,

669
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,750
I bet you know my father.

670
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:25,949
Do you hate my father

671
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:27,949
like Elder Chongguang does?

672
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,929
Elder Qingyang!

673
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:36,310
Well,

674
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,480
I can tell that you look at Tianhe

675
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,350
differently from Elder Chongguang does.

676
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:42,510
Could you tell Tianhe

677
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:44,040
what happened 19 years ago?

678
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:45,639
19 years ago?

679
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,630
I have no memory

680
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,290
of what happened 19 years ago.

681
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:52,639
I can only remember Yun Tianqing's name.

682
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:53,880
That’s all.

683
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:54,730
Oh, right!

684
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:57,170
You are Ziying's precious disciples.

685
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:59,330
Ziying is my precious disciple.

686
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:01,650
That makes you my grand-apprentices.

687
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,520
Today, I insist that you two

688
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,070
try some of my carefully cooked medicinal soup.

689
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:06,730
Give me a second!

690
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,630
-I'll get you something.
-Elder Qingyang!

691
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,750
Get us some rice wine.

692
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:12,280
How did you know I was gonna get some rice wine?

693
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,190
Don't...

694
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:13,930
Lingsha,

695
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:15,790
we can't eat that medicinal soup!

696
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:18,420
He doesn't remember anything.

697
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,440
You shouldn't drink wine with him.

698
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,790
It's not true that he can't recall anything.

699
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:22,920
He just don't want to tell us the truth.

700
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:28,630
Elder,

701
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,300
Su Yao showed great determination in the Disciple Assembly.

702
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,160
Her target must be Wangshu Sword.

703
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,240
If I had been on Qingluan Peak,

704
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,080
I would have killed Yun Tianhe

705
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,130
and protected myself from being injured by Xuan Xiao,

706
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:43,750
which denied me the chance to reach a higher realm.

707
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,790
I've visited Xuan Xiao in the forbidden area.

708
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:47,270
He is still frozen.

709
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:50,170
So there's unknown truth about your injury.

710
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,630
You can’t put all the blame

711
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:53,750
to Yun Tianhe alone.

712
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:54,950
Elder,

713
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,220
I have a question.

714
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,620
Why would you chase him away

715
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,140
and protect him at the same time?

716
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:03,540
All I want is to separate him from Wangshu Sword forever.

717
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:07,590
It's the only way to disconnect their spiritual power

718
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:09,390
and keep Qionghua Sect from having a war

719
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:11,580
like the one that happened 19 years ago.

720
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,530
If I kill him,

721
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,380
I'll be a villain, won't I?

722
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:15,730
Then what should we do?

723
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,400
Su Yao has always been a meticulous person.

724
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:19,950
There must be a reason

725
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,810
for everything she's done.

726
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,580
Now I need you to investigate those two girls

727
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,940
and await my new plan.

728
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:38,110
I can't believe he gave you Wangshu Sword.

729
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:41,530
It originally belongs to Qionghua Sect.

730
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:42,920
Where is he?

731
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,860
Do you want to see him?

732
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:46,460
Right.

733
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,520
You should really see him.

734
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,250
His eyes

735
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,420
and his smile

736
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,400
just look like Su Yu's.

737
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,230
But speaking of the heroic spirit within his eyes and brows,

738
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:01,440
he takes after his father Yun Tianqing.

739
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:03,420
What are you trying to say?

740
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:06,650
I'm just saying

741
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,560
that after 19 years,

742
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,280
Xihe Sword and Wangshu Sword

743
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:14,390
are finally reunited.

744
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:17,240
You don't deserve to hold Wangshu Sword.

745
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:19,980
Master meant to let me learn to use Wangshu Sword.

746
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,680
It should've been me who paired with you for sword training.

747
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,230
But Su Yu took Wangshu Sword

748
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,260
and you away!

749
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:26,710
She's the one who didn't deserve it!

750
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:29,820
How dare you compare yourself with Su Yu!

751
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:44,800
You've overreached yourself, mediocre woman!

752
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,660
It's true that I'm mediocre,

753
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:48,480
but

754
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,390
it's me who's always been with you.

755
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,230
Do you know

756
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,200
how much I've done for you?

757
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,280
I don't care what you've done for me.

758
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,400
I won't let you have this sword, not even when you're dead!

759
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,290
Fine.

760
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,460
Now that you've set your mind on it,

761
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,630
I'll wait till I have an ultimate Yin body

762
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:11,070
so I can make Wangshu Sword recognize me as its new owner!

763
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,240
Su Yao,

764
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:15,180
if you dare to lay a hand on Su Yu's son,

765
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,360
I'll maim you right now!

766
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,660
Even...

767
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:28,650
Even if I'm out of the picture,

768
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:32,680
Chongguang and the guys won't let him live.

769
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:36,110
Find a chance

770
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:40,180
to bring Su Yu's son to me.

771
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:45,180
Before I become Wangshu Sword's ruler,

772
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,560
I won't let you see him.
