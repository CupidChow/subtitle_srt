00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,860
[Episode 8]

4
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:46,400
Mengli,

5
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,740
what's wrong?

6
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,020
My master once told me

7
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,700
there is a kind of illusory sound spell called Mind Control.

8
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,430
It's very similar to the Fantasy I played before.

9
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:00,630
But... my spell

10
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,520
can only cause slowed thinking temporarily.

11
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,050
While Mind Control

12
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,210
can make people sleep for a long time.

13
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:09,030
It's extremely evil.

14
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,190
Did the Qin family ask you to deal with me?

15
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,850
We're not from the Qin family.

16
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,950
But why did you hide a spell in your qin's sound

17
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,270
to make the people in Chenzhou sleep?

18
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,150
Sleep?

19
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,630
I didn't use any spell.

20
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,590
But Mengli checked it just now.

21
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:43,450
It was you who used the Mind Control spell.

22
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,310
I don't know what Mind Control is.

23
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,050
I was playing qin here.

24
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,310
I only hope he can hear it.

25
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,420
He?

26
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:51,900
Who is he?

27
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,960
Please tell us clearly.

28
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,290
He's my husband.

29
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,440
He's in Qianfo Temple.

30
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:06,870
Really?

31
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,240
Your husband has become a monk,

32
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,560
yet you still won't let it go and are pestering him?

33
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,790
My husband is dead.

34
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,110
The Qin family put his coffin

35
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,880
in the temple to release his soul from purgatory.

36
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,510
I just want to see him.

37
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,770
I want nothing else.

38
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,950
We saw what you are capable of.

39
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,140
You handled so many servants alone.

40
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,150
It should be easy for you to enter a temple, right?

41
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,600
The Qin family must have invited an eminent monk to cast a spell.

42
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,930
I can't get close at all.

43
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,620
I can only play qin here every day,

44
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,360
even though he can no longer hear it.

45
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,490
No wonder your qin sound was so melancholic.

46
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,920
So you have been separated from the one you love by death.

47
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,730
What is love?

48
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,550
It's hard to explain.

49
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,430
Don't ask now.

50
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,270
My name is Qin Ji.

51
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:00,200
I once adventured in the martial world

52
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,540
because of my admiration for masters and heroes.

53
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,430
Later,

54
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,990
I met my husband, Qin Yi.

55
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,200
I gave up adventuring in the martial world

56
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,310
and married him.

57
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,680
He taught me this melody.

58
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,430
We studied music together back then.

59
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,060
That

60
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:26,030
was the happiest time in my life.

61
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:27,750
Miss,

62
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:30,110
since you love your husband so much,

63
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,070
why have you been away from him for so many years?

64
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,200
Qin Yi is the only son of the Qin family.

65
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,270
But he was innately weak and got sick frequently.

66
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,230
His parents believe in witchcraft and fortune-telling.

67
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,159
They think I am destined to be alone

68
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,740
and my husband will die because of me.

69
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,030
You left him

70
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,420
to prove your true love for him?

71
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,409
I did that to save his life too.

72
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,620
I know he was filial.

73
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,870
That's why I left after leaving a letter to him

74
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,910
to look for a highly skilled doctor and effective medicine.

75
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,220
But I didn't expect it

76
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,250
to take four years.

77
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,340
But sometimes,

78
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,030
a farewell is a farewell forever.

79
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,950
Lingsha,

80
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:19,650
don't worry.

81
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,700
I will stay alive and wait for you to come back.

82
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,970
[Han Lingxiang]

83
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,460
Take this.

84
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,220
Take care of yourself outside.

85
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,320
I completely understand

86
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,960
how desperately you want to save your family.

87
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,320
I believe what she said.

88
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:48,710
Tianhe, Mengli,

89
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:49,920
we must help her.

90
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,330
I believe her too.

91
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:55,390
But there is the Mind Control spell in her qin sound.

92
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,710
Qin Ji is not a demon.

93
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,260
Although she has no demonic aura,

94
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,860
she's controlled by demons.

95
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,750
Mr. Murong,

96
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:13,810
I also checked it.

97
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,450
Qin Ji is not controlled by anyone.

98
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:17,940
It's just that her wish has not been fulfilled.

99
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,270
She's a pitiable woman.

100
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,490
Since she's a human,

101
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,290
why did she hide the evil spell in her qin sound?

102
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:24,750
Undo it now,

103
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,470
so that the people in Chenzhou can live a peaceful life again.

104
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,750
Their Sleep Condition really has nothing to do with me.

105
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,990
Then come with me.

106
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:32,400
Ice Cube,

107
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,500
don't force me to beat you.

108
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,560
I won't let you take Qin Ji away today.

109
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:41,210
Why don't we wait till we figure it out?

110
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,150
Do you want more people in Chenzhou to fall into a sleep?

111
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,030
Sorry.

112
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:03,790
This is the Qianhualing Illusion Formation in the Illusory Sound Collection.

113
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:08,830
Qin Ji,

114
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,200
we will help you fulfill your wish.

115
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,110
Honey.

116
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,440
How did you get in?

117
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,260
You are Qin Yi's cousin.

118
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,909
From the moment you left,

119
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,590
I ceased to be his cousin.

120
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,040
[Ms. Jiang]

121
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,190
I became his concubine.

122
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,530
You've admired him since you were little.

123
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,010
I didn't expect

124
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,150
that you still married him.

125
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,310
That was because you left him

126
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,770
when he was seriously ill.

127
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,900
I married into the Qin family to bring good luck.

128
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,780
I could finally stay by his side.

129
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:17,130
I have remained only as his concubine

130
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,750
even until his death.

131
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,659
This should be the core of the formation.

132
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,240
Today, I'm not here for the title.

133
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,320
I just came to see him.

134
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,550
When he was alive,

135
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,600
it was me

136
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:02,010
who decocted medicine and put on clothes for him day and night.

137
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,540
But what about you?

138
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,870
How could you wilfully abandon him like that

139
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,550
to travel around the world?

140
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,790
I didn't go travel around the world.

141
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:12,920
I went to look for a highly skilled doctor and effective medicine to save him.

142
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,180
But I didn't expect him

143
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,470
to...

144
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:17,830
It's too late to say anything now.

145
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:18,710
If it weren't for you,

146
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:19,750
he wouldn't have died

147
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,150
due to profound sadness.

148
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,150
I won't let you see him no matter what.

149
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,550
Since he is already dead,

150
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,630
what does it matter if you let her see him?

151
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,140
Ziying is right.

152
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:31,510
Qin Ji is Qin Yi's legal wife.

153
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,900
And he loved her very much. Why can't she see him?

154
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,370
Now she knows he loved her very much?

155
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,150
But if it weren't for her,

156
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,850
he might still be alive.

157
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,320
Doesn't she feel ashamed to see him?

158
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,680
You're right.

159
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,590
How fair the pillow

160
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,150
and the embroidered quilt are!

161
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,750
The one I love is dead.

162
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,420
Who will stay here with him till morning?

163
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,500
In this life,

164
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:10,410
I let him down.

165
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,810
In the next life,

166
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,080
I'll accompany him.

167
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,520
Qin Ji,

168
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,270
you really don't know.

169
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:26,750
Actually,

170
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,710
you're already dead.

171
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,410
What do you mean?

172
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,360
You're already a spirit,

173
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,080
yet you want to kill yourself?

174
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,540
I remember now.

175
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,120
One day,

176
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,520
I received a letter from the Qin family.

177
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,500
They said my husband died of an illness.

178
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,880
Could it be that...

179
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,310
you were so anxious

180
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,240
that you died in grief

181
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,940
because you received

182
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,970
the letter I sent?

183
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,910
How could Qin Ji be a spirit?

184
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:28,560
Are you sure?

185
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:34,720
The Mind Control spell originates from obsessions

186
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,180
and ends with obsessions.

187
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,140
I think because of your love for your husband,

188
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,990
you have become a spirit through the qin.

189
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,900
Your qin sound touched the listeners.

190
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,900
That's why those people in Chenzhou fell into a sleep.

191
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:48,500
Only by helping Qin Ji resolve her obsession,

192
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,790
can those people wake up.

193
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,980
A number of people heard her qin sound.

194
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:54,970
Some of them fell into a sleep, but some didn't.

195
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:56,040
Why?

196
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,630
For humans,

197
00:11:58,410 --> 00:11:59,940
love is the most hurtful.

198
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,510
The more love your heart is filled with,

199
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:05,310
the more likely you'll be troubled by obsessions.

200
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,510
Those people in the Sleep Condition

201
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,710
are probably pitiable guys troubled by love

202
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,830
like Qin Ji.

203
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,630
Qin Ji.

204
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,860
Your family members who are still alive

205
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,510
must be very sad.

206
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,020
My husband was my only family

207
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,060
in this world.

208
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,400
When we were alive,

209
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,530
I left him.

210
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,620
Now we are dead.

211
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,990
I can be with him wholeheartedly.

212
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,120
Sister,

213
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,770
I'm begging you.

214
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,800
Please let me see him one more time.

215
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,710
This is the only way

216
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:58,520
to release those people from the Sleep Condition caused by the qin sound.

217
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:02,170
When I was alive, I left him wilfully.

218
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,410
I couldn't save him.

219
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,450
Now I'm dead.

220
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,620
I can't harm the people in Chenzhou.

221
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,230
Fine.

222
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:16,340
The living people are more important anyway.

223
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:50,990
Honey,

224
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,710
I'm back.

225
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,600
We can finally

226
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:02,560
be together in harmony regardless of life and death.

Sister,

287
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,100
I will bury this qin

288
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,920
with Qin Yi.

289
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:03,550
The story of Qin Ji has made me think a lot.

290
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,630
Actually, many things and feelings

291
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,350
are hard to express through words.

292
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,060
Actually,

293
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,950
since the elders in my family

294
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:18,140
passed away one after another,

295
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:23,820
my cousin and I have become each other's only family.

296
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:28,770
She took good care of me like a mother.

297
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,620
But... she's been bedridden for a long time.

298
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,230
My purpose of adventuring in the martial world

299
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:40,080
is the same as Qin Ji's.

300
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,430
Lingsha,

301
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,960
so you want to find an elixir

302
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:47,020
to save your cousin.

303
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,610
Her life is more important than mine.

304
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,180
But...

305
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:56,950
today,

306
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:00,180
since I knew the story of Qin Ji and her husband,

307
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,540
I've been worried.

308
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:02,840
I...

309
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,660
I'm worried when I go home,

310
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,130
my cousin would...

311
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,010
Even if you stay by her side,

312
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:14,150
won't you feel worried or upset?

313
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,590
I can't see her leave me.

314
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:23,290
So,

315
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,250
everyone is doing their best

316
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,000
for the ones they love.

317
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,010
You're doing your best to change her fate.

318
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:32,920
And she's doing her best to stay alive for you.

319
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,500
I think I know what love is.

320
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,300
Loving someone means

321
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,500
this person

322
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,290
is more important than my life.

323
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,820
If I lose this person, my life will be a living hell.

324
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:53,200
Just like my father lost my mother

325
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:56,260
and Qin Ji lost her husband,

326
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,230
right?

327
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,390
So the happiest thing

328
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,640
in life

329
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,240
is to find the one you love

330
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:11,350
to be together forever

331
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,930
and never separate.

332
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,170
Have you found such a person?

333
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:21,310
Then the three of us should be together forever

334
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,970
and never separate.

335
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,750
Then we'll be very happy.

336
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,510
If I can have a bowl

337
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,690
of ginkgo porridge with dates made by Lingsha now,

338
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,720
I'll be happier.

339
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,400
Why are you talking about ginkgo porridge with dates now?

340
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,680
I just want to have it.

341
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,870
We're talking about something else.

342
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,260
Okay, got it.

343
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,030
Lord Beike,

344
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,920
the qin spirit vanished.

345
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,340
What should we do now?

346
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,520
How many people are still in the Sleep Condition in Chenzhou?

347
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,670
Over 3,000.

348
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,360
3,000.

349
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,180
Wen Yao,

350
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,670
do you still want the last bit of Feng Xie's primordial spirit?

351
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:23,070
Lord Beike,

352
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,230
I thought you have destroyed

353
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,930
Feng Xie's purple crystal, right?

354
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:28,090
Since I can destroy it, I can also keep it.

355
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:29,400
If you can accomplish your mission,

356
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,680
it will be yours.

357
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:36,040
I will accomplish it even if I have to risk my life.

358
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,110
Uncle,

359
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,060
I've found out

360
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,190
none of the people in the Sleep Condition in Chenzhou has woken up.

361
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,640
When did Ms. Jiang fall into a sleep?

362
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:47,500
According to her servant, it was between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. last night.

363
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,750
She is also in the Sleep Condition.

364
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,230
What's the cause exactly?

365
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:35,350
What?

366
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:38,450
So many people are still in the Sleep Condition?

367
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,590
Was I wrong?

368
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,490
Qin Ji is not the cause.

369
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:45,980
Maybe someone used the qin spirit.

370
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:48,180
I found something in the qin.

371
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,530
I've never seen this bead before.

372
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,130
Can you take a look?

373
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,790
Isn't this just a black bead?

374
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,280
Is there anything special?

375
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,940
If Ms. Jiang fell into a sleep,

376
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:02,250
and this was found in Qin Ji's qin,

377
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:04,960
there must be something wrong with it.

378
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,980
I hope the ginkgo porridge with dates made by me

379
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,640
tastes similar to that made by Tianhe's father.

380
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,800
This is all I can do for you.

381
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,440
Why am I...

382
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:37,670
sleepy and tired?

383
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,550
There seems to be words in it.

384
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:48,490
They are Chijiang's characters.

385
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,450
Chijiang's characters?

386
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:56,840
Are you sure they are Chijiang's characters?

387
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,990
My father has a friend in Chijiang.

388
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,340
He gave my father a Chijiang item.

389
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,450
It has Chijiang's characters on it.

390
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:05,710
But I don't know Chijiang's characters.

391
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,290
Shushan Sect is near Chijiang.

392
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,860
They also have disciples guarding Jixian Garden.

393
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,260
I'm going to ask them now.

394
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,550
Zi... Ziying,

395
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,030
Lingsha

396
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:20,130
is an expert in things like antiques.

397
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,510
Maybe she knows.

398
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,710
Where is Miss Han?

399
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:26,320
She's been acting mysteriously

400
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,530
since she woke up this morning.

401
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:29,260
She wouldn't let me bother her.

402
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,550
She should be making ginkgo porridge with dates in the kitchen.

403
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:34,350
She wants to give you a surprise.

404
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,430
Really?

405
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:39,780
But...

406
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,930
does it take so long to make a bowl of porridge?

407
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,690
-Lingsha.
-Lingsha.

408
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,100
Did she faint again or is she in the Sleep Condition?

409
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,780
She is in the Sleep Condition.

410
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,740
Take her back to the guest room first.

411
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,640
Lingsha is different from us.

412
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,590
She's more sentimental than us.

413
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:32,150
So it's easier for her to be infected.

414
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:33,430
If I had known

415
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:35,360
she has so many things in her heart,

416
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:38,850
I wouldn't have asked her to go to Qionghua with me.

417
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:43,070
I would have helped her find the elixir for her family first.

418
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:54,000
I don't care if he's a human or a demon.

419
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,810
Even if I have to search every corner in Chenzhou,

420
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:56,690
I will find him

421
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:59,130
and eliminate the Sleep Condition.

422
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:02,440
What if the Sleep Condition

423
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:04,350
can't be eliminated in a short time?

424
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,830
Whether it will take one year, two years,

425
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,030
10 years, or 20 years,

426
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,720
I won't give up until Lingsha

427
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,850
and the people in Chenzhou can wake up.

428
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,030
How is Lingsha now?

429
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:22,920
Currently, Lingsha's situation

430
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,120
is the same as that of other people in the Sleep Condition.

431
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:29,540
Ziying,

432
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:31,470
you've figured out Chijiang's characters, right?

433
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,600
Let's talk outside.

434
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,630
Uncle Dao Zhen from Shushan Sect

435
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:45,690
is in Chenzhou now.

436
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,480
He is a senior and knows Chijiang's medical skills.

437
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,480
I'm sure he can understand the characters in the bead.

438
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,070
Where is he now?

439
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,140
Let's go find him.

440
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,170
I've asked the disciples of Shushan Sect to tell him

441
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:57,430
to meet us at Qianfo Temple

442
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:58,790
and figure them out with us.

443
00:26:58,790 --> 00:26:59,960
Could there be other clues

444
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,150
related to Chijiang in Qianfo Temple?

445
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:04,720
Mengli,

446
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,660
you stay here with Lingsha.

447
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,060
Ziying and I are going to Qianfo Temple.

448
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:08,590
Okay.

449
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,830
Lingsha.

450
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:20,730
You're awake.

451
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,430
So you were not in the Sleep Condition.

452
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,610
I was too tired these days,

453
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:28,720
so I fainted.

454
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,620
Lingsha,

455
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,290
did you really just faint?

456
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,830
But your symptoms

457
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:36,480
are the same as the symptoms of the people in the Sleep Condition.

458
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,720
I just slept soundly.

459
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:40,740
I'm fine now.

460
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:44,990
I'm glad you're fine.

461
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,610
But since last night,

462
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:49,790
Ms. Jiang and more people have fallen into a sleep.

463
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:51,460
Now we need to find a way to solve the problem

464
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,630
as soon as possible.

465
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,180
Have you figured out a way?

466
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,390
Ziying found a black bead with Chijiang's characters inside

467
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:59,510
in Qin Ji's scabbard.

468
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,080
Before you woke up,

469
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,540
Ziying and I were just going

470
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,060
to find clues about that black bead.

471
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,060
We can't just investigate the bead.

472
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:08,030
We should also investigate Qin Ji's previous whereabouts.

473
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,350
Why don't we split up?

474
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:13,140
Mr. Murong and Mengli go investigate the bead.

475
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,450
I'll go with this guy

476
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,650
to investigate Qin Ji's whereabouts.

477
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,720
Is there a problem?

478
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:29,730
Lingsha,

479
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,720
you...

480
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,590
never called Ziying Mr. Murong before.

481
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:36,390
You usually called him Ice Cube.

482
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,590
Sometimes you called him Senior.

483
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:42,100
I called him that just like Mengli does.

484
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,320
I want him to help me,

485
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:45,470
of course I should show some respect.

486
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:47,270
But you never called Mr. Yun

487
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,540
a guy either.

488
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,740
I just fainted.

489
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,140
Of course I can't think straight.

490
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,720
Miss Han,

491
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,690
are you really okay?

492
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:11,490
Yes.

493
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,860
You don't believe me?

494
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:15,630
Ice Cube.

495
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:18,640
Alright.

496
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:21,100
Lingsha just woke up.

497
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,980
She's still a little mixed-up.

498
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,110
Don't waste time.

499
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:24,720
Let's go.

500
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:25,720
Yun Tianhe.

501
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:32,520
Come when you hear the spell, and everything will be clear.

502
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,700
Remember this spell.

503
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,830
The mastermind is no ordinary person.

504
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:37,120
If you are in danger,

505
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,940
summon me by saying the spell with the scabbard I gave you.

506
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,600
And I'll show up immediately.

507
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:45,200
Don't worry.

508
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,280
Miss Han,

509
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,710
take care of yourself.

510
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,120
Let's go.

511
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:17,510
Mr. Murong,

512
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,270
I sensed that

513
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:21,150
you want to ask me a question privately.

514
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:22,070
Is it about the master

515
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,600
who taught me the Illusory Sound Collection?

516
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,830
She gave you

517
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,780
the jade Konghou, right?

518
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:33,110
Master came to Shouyang to see me that year

519
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:36,450
and told me that we were destined to be master and disciple.

520
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,880
So she taught me illusory sound spells patiently.

521
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,080
But... I don't know her very well.

522
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:43,010
I don't know her name either.

523
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:46,650
Her name is Su Shen.

524
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,300
She is my first master.

525
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,590
The song you played that day

526
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:56,310
was composed by Master Su Shen.

527
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,280
She is also a disciple of Qionghua?

528
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,680
Is she still in Qionghua?

529
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:02,490
She left Qionghua

530
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,600
10 years ago.

531
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,410
We have never met again.

532
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,190
It would be great

533
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,110
if you keep this between us.

534
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,440
Don't worry, Mr. Murong.

535
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,280
I understand.

536
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:14,870
One more thing.

537
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,820
Since Lingsha woke up,

538
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,390
I've felt something is not right.

539
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:20,870
But I don't know what is not right.

540
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,930
I've taught Yun Tianhe a spell.

541
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:25,280
It should be helpful if there is an emergency.

542
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,220
Don't worry about being alone on the road ahead.

543
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,150
Who in this world does not know you?

544
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,810
I've heard a lot about you.

545
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:30,840
[Dao Zhen]

546
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,680
I finally get to see you today.

547
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:35,400
Senior Dao Zhen, thank you for coming.

548
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:37,840
This is Miss Mengli.

549
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,910
Although we are from different sects,

550
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,650
you don't need to call me Senior.

551
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:45,660
Ziying, why did you ask me here?

552
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,600
Go ahead.

553
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,480
Recently,

554
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,870
I found out that the Sleep Condition of the people in Chenzhou

555
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:52,200
is related to this bead.

556
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,720
There are Chijiang's characters in it.

557
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,240
I wonder if you know them.

558
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:07,490
This way.

559
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:09,190
Look at Shengping Inn.

560
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:11,580
That is the inn Qin Ji stayed in

561
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,830
every time she came back to Chenzhou.

562
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:13,760
And this street.

563
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:16,810
People going to Qianfo Temple have to pass through this street.

564
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:17,580
Later,

565
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:19,080
let's investigate the shops

566
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,640
along this street.

567
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,070
Why do we have to stay in Chenzhou?

568
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,750
Why don't we go out of Chenzhou to take a look?

569
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:26,560
Maybe

570
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,670
Qin Ji's bead was brought from somewhere else.

571
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:29,510
Impossible.

572
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:32,360
The mastermind's target is Chenzhou.

573
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,790
They must have put the bead in Qin Ji's qin

574
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:36,870
after she returned to Chenzhou.

575
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,070
And I think

576
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:40,820
it's very likely that they are still in Chenzhou.

577
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,540
This bead is very rare.

578
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,070
It's a mind spell tool.

579
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,270
According to what I read in a book,

580
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,870
Chijiang's sorcerers are good at mind spells.

581
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,570
Mind spells are harmful to people.

582
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:53,840
There are various tools.

583
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,900
They can be flowers and plants.

584
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,110
And they can be insects and snakes,

585
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:57,890
or even stones and bamboo strips.

586
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:00,770
This bead is a mind spell tool.

587
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:03,330
The victims are controlled by spells.

588
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:04,350
What will happen to them

589
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,610
depends on the spells.

590
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:08,970
Just like Chijiang's characters in this bead.

591
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,360
The sound controls their feelings.

592
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:14,050
The primordial spirits go with the bead.

593
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:16,710
So someone took advantage of Qin Ji's qin sound.

594
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:18,810
But the sound has been taken care of.

595
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,180
The primordial spirits go with the bead.

596
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:24,100
That means those people's primordial spirits are no longer in their bodies.

597
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,300
They go with the bead.

598
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,250
But I checked it with my spiritual power.

599
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:29,310
There is nothing special in the bead.

600
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,280
But where do the primordial spirits go?

601
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,810
They can't just disappear.

602
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,600
There is only one explanation.

603
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,530
The tool is a pair of Qiankun beads.

604
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:39,390
The two beads

605
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:40,650
are connected.

606
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,000
The one who cast the spell used the Qian bead

607
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,200
to control the person with the Kun bead.

608
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,980
The bead in Qin Ji's qin

609
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:48,330
is the Kun bead.

610
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,160
Dao Zhen,

611
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,370
is it useful to destroy this bead?

612
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:53,050
No.

613
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,530
This is the trick of the person who cast the spell.

614
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,350
Without the Qian bead,

615
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:59,680
it's useless to just destroy the Kun bead.

616
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,440
I have an idea.

617
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,150
Since the bead

618
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,780
was in the qin,

619
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:11,790
they must have activated the bead through the qin sound.

620
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:14,080
If we put the bead in the qin again,

621
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:15,530
I can play qin

622
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,320
and use an illusory sound spell to lure someone's primordial spirit inside.

623
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,650
Maybe we can find out the truth in this way.

624
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:21,860
I'll go inside.

625
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:25,020
Dao Zhen, please use your power

626
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,739
to assist Miss Mengli.

627
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,760
Well...

628
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:29,480
As long as I don't stop casting my illusory sound spell,

629
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,960
it can keep connected to the inside of the bead.

630
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,969
The primordial spirit will return the same way it goes.

631
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:36,350
But considering my spiritual power,

632
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,420
I can only cast the illusory sound spell for two hours at most.

633
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,179
Ziying,

634
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:41,150
we don't know what's inside.

635
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,620
If you can't come back

636
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,840
within two hours,

637
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:45,909
I'm afraid your primordial spirit

638
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:47,840
will be trapped in the qin forever.

639
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:49,770
Two hours.

640
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,000
I got it.

641
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,610
Lead my primordial spirit inside.

642
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,660
What do you think?

643
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,540
But we've investigated in Chenzhou for so many days.

644
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,900
The Sleep Condition still exists.

645
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,020
I think we should go out of the city.

646
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,310
No.

647
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,430
We released Qin Ji's spirit.

648
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:13,230
So those bad people

649
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:16,110
would definitely want to stay in Chenzhou and keep doing bad things.

650
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,510
This time, I think my judgment

651
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,320
is right.

652
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,460
What do you know?

653
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:23,850
Either we go out of the city

654
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:24,780
or we go nowhere.

655
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:29,580
Since you insist on your own idea,

656
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,480
why don't we ask Senior Ziying?

657
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:36,590
Sorry.

658
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,990
The scene brings back past memories.

659
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:41,380
Well, handling the Sleep Condition is more important.

660
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,440
I'll listen to you.

661
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:02,140
Right now,

662
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,340
we just need to trust each other.

663
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:49,630
[Young Murong Ziying]

664
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:49,890
Master.

665
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:53,070
Did you miss me

666
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:54,350
when I was not with you?

667
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:56,590
[Su Shen]

668
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,680
Yes.

669
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,350
I missed you all the time

670
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:58,870
when you were not around.

671
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:00,770
Good boy.

672
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:01,660
Let's play.

673
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:17,270
Master.

674
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,680
Can I... call you Mother secretly?

675
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:24,620
Master, don't be angry.

676
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:25,930
I won't mention it again.

677
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:28,590
I will master the Sifang Sulian swordsmanship.

678
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,500
Call me Mother.

679
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,880
The three elders and Senior Su Yao like you very much.

680
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,530
If you stay here,

681
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:51,380
it will be good for your future.

682
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:55,210
But this place is not suitable for me.

683
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:00,150
I...

684
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,140
have to say goodbye to you.

685
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,160
Maybe we won't be able to see each other

686
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,890
for quite some time.

687
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:12,310
Master,

688
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:14,750
you are my only family.

689
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,800
Why don't you take me with you?

690
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,010
Because...

691
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,640
I want to take him with me.

692
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:37,360
Do you want to go with me?

693
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:44,310
You've always treated me as your mother, right?

694
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:46,790
Then go with me.

695
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,250
That's it. Good boy.

696
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,460
Come with me.

697
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:05,140
Good boy.

698
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,670
Mr. Murong,

699
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:34,100
don't be deceived by the mind spell.

700
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,430
You must get your primordial spirit back.

701
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:53,750
This place...

702
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,160
Is this place...

703
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,190
Are these

704
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:02,130
the primordial spirits of those people in the Sleep Condition?
