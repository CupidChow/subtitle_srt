[Episode 13]

4
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,350
Young Master, this way please.

5
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,140
Brat!

6
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,560
-Hey, brat!
-Little Pig Demon!

7
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,640
Hey, brat!

8
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,750
You really imprisoned Little Pig Demon?

9
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,880
Hurry and let him go.

10
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:57,030
You're all here.

11
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,440
Little Pig Demon.

12
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,110
How come you've lost so much weight?

13
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,110
Did they abuse you?

14
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,250
No, no, you brat.

15
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,310
I volunteered to guard Treasure Pavilion.

16
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,080
Do you know?

17
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,870
This place is just like Qingluan Peak.

18
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,520
The demons here are as honorable as humans.

19
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,850
Also, demons here

20
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,730
can learn spells and martial arts,

21
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:13,840
and become the most powerful demon.

22
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,970
So, you decided to

23
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,329
learn martial arts here

24
00:02:16,329 --> 00:02:17,990
to avenge your father, right?

25
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,910
Yes, they said that

26
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,520
if I take good care of Treasure Pavilion

27
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,329
and become the most powerful pig demon,

28
00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:24,920
I will be able to fight those humans

29
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,350
just like Five-Poison Beast.

30
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,350
Little Pig Demon,

31
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,579
Young Master exhorted that

32
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:32,710
from now on, humans will coexist peacefully with demons and fight no more.

33
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:33,829
Brat,

34
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,200
why did Lord Feng Er call you Young Master?

35
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,550
Brother Yun Tianqing

36
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,440
is the real master of Qingfeng Pavilion.

37
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,700
So of course, Mr. Yun is the Young Master.

38
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,120
I now have a friend who is a Young Master.

39
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,190
You three have to be nice to me.

40
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,190
Yes, Little Pig Demon.

41
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,310
Why do you sound like that?

42
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,800
I heard Brother Tianqing had passed away.

43
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,180
So, I cried [badly].

44
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,440
Enough, Feng Er.

45
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,130
Give me the book.

46
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,260
Young Master.

47
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,580
There's more than just one book.

48
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,510
The valuables and books in this Treasure Pavilion are all yours.

49
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,310
Does that mean

50
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,860
Tianhe can take all of it away?

51
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:08,790
Of course.

52
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,260
I only want the book.

53
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,510
Well then, give him the books,

54
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,110
but give the valuables to me.

55
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,660
Don't look at Lingsha like this.

56
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:18,990
Although she likes valuables,

57
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,030
she will give them to people in need.

58
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,579
Lingsha,

59
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,860
since you plan on giving the valuables to others,

60
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,530
why don't you put leave these valuables

61
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:27,850
with Qingfeng Pavilion?

62
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,750
Let Feng Er give it to those in need.

63
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,630
Young Master,

64
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:33,180
when you saved Five-Poison Beast,

65
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,829
I was sure that you share the same character as

66
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:36,110
Brother Tianqing.

67
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,190
-You two...
-Hey, don't.

68
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,510
Save the flattery.

69
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,510
Hurry up and give the book to Mengli.

70
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:41,850
Okay.

71
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,870
This is the jade's records.

72
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:54,430
The Princess Jade originates from an ancient, magical jade.

73
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,710
The one wearing it

74
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,270
will be full of spiritual power.

75
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,430
It can repel all kinds of evil.

76
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,300
Why is half a page missing?

77
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,990
Master was the one who tore it.

78
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,230
I don't know why either.

79
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,580
So this Princess Jade

80
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,070
was put on me by Uncle Yun.

81
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,870
The Princess Jade has always been stored within Treasure Pavilion.

82
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:13,950
But 19 years ago,

83
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,050
Master Lin and Mrs. Su Yu carried a baby over.

84
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,029
Master, what happened?

85
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,550
Get the Princess Jade. Hurry.

86
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,040
Okay.

87
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:25,710
Here.

88
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,520
This baby is...

89
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,760
She's lucky.

90
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,110
With this Princess Jade,

91
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,810
there's nothing more to be afraid of.

92
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,430
She put the Princess Jade

93
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,440
on this baby.

94
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,550
But why didn't they let her take it off?

95
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,070
Maybe the baby was haunted by evil spirits back then.

96
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,600
Feng Er, listen.

97
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:58,240
Our Qingfeng Pavilion have always helped those in need.

98
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,460
We treat both humans and demons equally.

99
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,320
From now on, you'll be our Master.

100
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,710
Don't interfere with

101
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:04,660
my life or death.

102
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,150
Master.

103
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,880
Keep this painting safe.

104
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,280
I recognize this handwriting as my father's.

105
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,070
But what does it mean?

106
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,350
It says,

107
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,390
"There are no words to describe my anxiety and worries.

108
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,990
The breeze is unfathomable,

109
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,530
but yet it's everywhere."

110
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,350
Tianhe’s father mentioned to take good care of this painting.

111
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,950
Could it be holding secrets?

112
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,150
This couplet seems to have its head and tail omitted.

113
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,030
If we put ourselves in the painting...

114
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,909
You are very close.

115
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:44,520
I'm right here.

116
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,900
Come and find me!

117
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,230
Mengli.

118
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,700
-Who was it?
-Did you hear something?

119
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,220
Mengli.

120
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:53,909
Who are you?

121
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:55,770
Are you hearing that sound again?

122
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:56,870
Feng Er.

123
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,210
I knew something was wrong with the painting.

124
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:00,030
This painting has been hung here for 19 years.

125
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,960
There's nothing unusual about it.

126
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,990
Do you remember who you are?

127
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,510
Come and find me.

128
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,150
You must find me.

129
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,140
Come out!

130
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,930
-Mengli.
-Exactly who are you?

131
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:11,610
Mengli.

132
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,680
Young Master.

133
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,190
We can't hear the sound that she has just heard.

134
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,410
Perhaps, it's her memories that are messing things up.

135
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:21,640
Let her sleep and rest first.

136
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,950
We'll speak again when she wakes up.

137
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:23,510
Okay.

138
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:27,350
Let's go.

139
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:34,340
No, don't leave.

140
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,350
Come back.

141
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:37,270
Come back.

142
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,750
Come back!

143
00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:41,510
Come back!

144
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,230
Come back.

145
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:46,510
I’m here!

146
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,750
Yun Tianqing.

147
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,159
Exactly where did you lock me up?

148
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:55,900
Who?

149
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:57,760
Who are you?

150
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:00,590
Who are you?

151
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:01,790
Mengli.

152
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,330
Who?

153
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:05,370
Mengli.

154
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,600
Who are you?

155
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,220
Don't be afraid.

156
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:10,550
Don't be afraid.

157
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:11,500
Don't be afraid.

158
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:12,880
Don't come over.

159
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,400
Who is it?

160
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,070
Who?

161
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,190
Uncle Yun!

162
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,630
Uncle Yun, save me.

163
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,800
Uncle Yun, save me.

164
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,920
Mengli, I'm Tianhe.

165
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,870
Did you have a nightmare?

166
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,620
All's good.

167
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,060
I...

168
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,840
I had a dream again.

169
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,830
I know.

170
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,630
Did you dream about

171
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,159
my father saving you again?

172
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:56,659
It's all in the past.

173
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:57,950
It's okay.

174
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,030
Lingsha.

175
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,470
I got you some water.

176
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,590
How did I fall asleep last night?

177
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,670
Feng Er cast a spell to make you fall asleep.

178
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,230
He said it must have been your memories

179
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,910
messing you up.

180
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:26,380
I did have the dream I used to have when I was young.

181
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,110
But the difference this time is that

182
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,390
I saw a man,

183
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,669
whose face I couldn't see saving me,

184
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:34,730
and then handing me over to Uncle Yun.

185
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,059
Dreams...

186
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,070
is like making up stories.

187
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,490
Maybe you suffered from too much shock when you were young,

188
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,110
that's why a variety of scenes

189
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,710
would appear in your dreams.

190
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,130
That painting...

191
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,590
Feng Er checked it again and again.

192
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,250
He said the painting was fine.

193
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:51,590
You must have

194
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,790
been too scared, that's why you were dreaming.

195
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,440
Since my father

196
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,070
entrusted you to me,

197
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,100
don't you worry.

198
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,160
I will protect you like my father did.

199
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,070
Drink some water.

200
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:08,390
Well then, I'm going to

201
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,150
get some medicine from Feng Er.

202
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,470
Didn't Feng Er say...

203
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:16,790
Don't listen to her.

204
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,190
Feng Er said you'll be fine after a sleep.

205
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,110
You don't need to take medicine.

206
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,890
Mr. Yun,

207
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,470
you'd better check on Lingsha.

208
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:23,670
It's fine.

209
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,510
She took care of you all night.

210
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,440
Now it's my turn to take care of you.

211
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,240
Drink some water first.

212
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,120
Young Master,

213
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,240
this is as far as we can send you off.

214
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:42,820
Okay.

215
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,870
Unfortunately, I couldn't see Little Pig Demon

216
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:47,800
and Five-Poison Beast one last time before leaving.

217
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,870
Don't worry, Young Master.

218
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,870
We will take good care of Five-Poison Beast for you.

219
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,530
Yes, and Little Pig Demon too.

220
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,550
Lingsha, what's wrong with you?

221
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,160
Are you feeling unwell? Why are you walking so slowly?

222
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,690
This Qiankun bag of mine...

223
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,670
Five-Poison Beast?

224
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,450
Five-Poison Beast, why did you hide in my Qiankun bag?

225
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,410
Five-Poison bro,

226
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:09,010
do you want to go to Qionghua with Young Master?

227
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:11,780
You little thing.

228
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:12,980
For your safety,

229
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,750
you shall stay in Qingfeng Pavilion.

230
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,750
After learning spells in Qionghua,

231
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,870
I'll come back immediately and return the spiritual power to you,

232
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,340
and bring you back to your original form.

233
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,050
Okay?

234
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,430
Young Master,

235
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,870
you can't give spiritual back to him,

236
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,070
not only because you don't know spells,

237
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,370
but because you have

238
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:30,000
a more powerful and peculiar spiritual power in your body.

239
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,600
It has the ability to absorb.

240
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:33,760
Impossible.

241
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,790
Didn't we test my spiritual power and cultivation

242
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,910
in Ziying's spell formation before?

243
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,620
I messed up that formation.

244
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,340
I don't have any spiritual power.

245
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,130
Really?

246
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:52,080
For me?

247
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,590
Is this the Five-Poison Pearl

248
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,980
that can detoxify all types of poison?

249
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:55,530
Yes.

250
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,230
Yes.

251
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,920
It requires more than ten years of life essence

252
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,840
for a Five-Poison Beast to produce a Five-Poison Pearl.

253
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,190
In order to get it,

254
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,870
people in the martial world would

255
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,360
imprison Five-Poison Beasts alive.

256
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,490
That’s how its parents were arrested.

257
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,870
Later,  it was Brother Tianqing who saved them.

258
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,780
It’s so precious, yet he is giving it away.

259
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,220
It shows that he has already recognised Tianhe

260
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,650
as his closest relative.

261
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,390
Little Five-Poison Beast,

262
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,450
let me return this pearl to you first.

263
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:19,830
When I become

264
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,070
a Sword Immortal like my father,

265
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,870
will you give it to me again then?

266
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,430
Okay.

267
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:28,830
We'll leave now.

268
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,110
Take care, Young Master.

269
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:31,930
Take care, Young Master.

270
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:33,330
Take care, Young Master.

271
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,760
Young Master,

272
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,270
no matter where you go,

273
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:45,440
you will always be the Master of Qingfeng Pavilion.

274
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,430
Let's go.

275
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,090
Bye.

276
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:53,640
Take care.

277
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:58,310
Goodbye.

278
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,570
[Qionghua Sect]

279
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:15,060
[Sword Ground]

280
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,050
[Qionghua Palace]

281
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,230
Qionghua is indeed the top sect of Kunxu.

282
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,910
It's built on the side of a mountain. Isn't it magnificent?

283
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:34,980
[Three days later]

284
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,850
I wonder what is waiting for us

285
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,240
behind this door.

286
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,870
Ziying and Xuanji

287
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,600
must be waiting for us.

288
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,430
[Qionghua Palace]

289
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,510
I told the Jixian Garden

290
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,300
not to mention Yun Tianqing,

291
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,570
because he is the biggest traitor

292
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,470
of Qionghua Sect.

293
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,870
They must not have expected that

294
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,240
in just three days,

295
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:55,290
we passed Zi Wei and Bai Hao at Taiyi Path of Immortals,

296
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,860
and even the trial at Three Paths of Xuanji.

297
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,150
Well,

298
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,250
although your parents have trained in Qionghua,

299
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,050
you should still be mentally prepared.

300
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,600
I'm full of excitement.

301
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,800
I'm ready.

302
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,270
No, I mean,

303
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,130
Qionghua is filled with people we don't know.

304
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,150
If they make you unhappy,

305
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,090
we'll leave immediately.

306
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:15,300
We have to get

307
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,360
the elixir to save your cousin before we can leave.

308
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:19,480
Let's go.

309
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:20,590
Let's go.

310
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,590
Stop!

311
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,010
This is Kunxu's Qionghua Sect.

312
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,140
Who are you?

313
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,460
Sir,

314
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,360
we just passed the trial at Taiyi Path of Immortals.

315
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,990
We should be able to go in, right?

316
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,790
How can we just rely on your word?

317
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,170
If someone like you can also pass,

318
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,810
wouldn't any village man like you

319
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:45,740
be able to enter?

320
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,020
You're just a disciple of Qionghua yourself.

321
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,450
Don't look down on us.

322
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:50,890
Ask Murong Ziying to come out,

323
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:51,930
and see how he will decide.

324
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:52,730
That's right.

325
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,590
Uncle Ziying is famous.

326
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,480
It's not strange that you know him.

327
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,680
But, how would he know someone like you?

328
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,780
Mind your words.

329
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,750
Uncle Ziying only has eyes for character,

330
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,550
and not nobility and lowliness.

331
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,360
Sister Xuanji, why are you here?

332
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:09,670
I'm here by order of the Grandmaster,

333
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,940
to receive three new disciples into the sect.

334
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,740
Hey watchman,

335
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,690
did you hear that?

336
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,420
So can the three of us commoners

337
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,470
go in now?

338
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,680
Sister Meng,

339
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,190
I was worried about you.

340
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,640
I didn't expect you to arrive so soon.

341
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,640
Let's head in.

342
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,320
Let's go.

343
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,190
Let's go.

344
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,110
Lingsha, look!

345
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,110
What a big lion.

346
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,080
Isn't Qionghua's mission to

347
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,070
subdue demons and get rid of devils?

348
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:55,130
Why are there a few stone demons here?

349
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:56,870
They are not demons.

350
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:57,960
These are the legendary

351
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,740
four mythical beasts guarding Kunxu Mountain.

352
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,860
Yingzhao, Luwu,

353
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:02,190
Lizhu and Kaiming Beast.

354
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:04,220
Demons are beasts, and so are mythical beasts.

355
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,220
It's almost the same.

356
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,640
It's different.

357
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,310
Mythical beasts will protect the earth.

358
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:11,240
Demons will only bring disaster to the mortal world.

359
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,940
But, not all demons will bring disaster to the mortal world.

360
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,680
I have many good friends who are demons.

361
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,560
Stop it!

362
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,680
Yun Tianhe,

363
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:18,910
you mustn't say such taboo statements

364
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,350
in Qionghua ever again.

365
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,860
Does Qionghua have many rules?

366
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,310
What else can't I say?

367
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,110
The biggest taboo is you.

368
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:30,840
Xuanji...

369
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,760
Do you remember what Ziying told you

370
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,770
at Jixian Garden?

371
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:37,320
You'd better watch your mouth.

372
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,790
Don't always divulge more than you need to.

373
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,990
If anyone asks,

374
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,900
you just have to tell them that your name is Tianhe.

375
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,790
Well, my name is Tianhe.

376
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,350
Did Grandmaster really ask you to pick us up?

377
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,350
Of course.

378
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:51,390
My Godmother is the Grandmaster.

379
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,620
She asked me to come.

380
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:53,730
Let's go.

381
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,000
The Disciples' Academy is right ahead.

382
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,760
Hurry up. Stop looking.

383
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:58,630
Let's go.

384
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,300
Tianhe, this is the Statue of Xuantian Goddess.

385
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:06,350
It is said that Xuantian Goddess is the ancient God of War.

386
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:08,780
She created Qionghua to protect the mortal world.

387
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,940
That's why Qionghua's disciples

388
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,070
have the chance to become an immortal.

389
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,820
The sword is here.

390
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:22,270
I asked you to check if there's anything unusual

391
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,670
about the people inside Qionghua?

392
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,160
None.

393
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:26,230
Wangshu's return to Qionghua

394
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,310
was a series of twists and turns.

395
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,660
I'm not worried about anything else.

396
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,030
But the man in black who stole the sword...

397
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,510
I thought about it.

398
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,190
It can't be a thief from outside.

399
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:38,660
It must be a traitor.

400
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,830
How...

401
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,900
should I investigate?

402
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,190
Not for now.

403
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,480
Since someone doesn't want Wangshu to come back,

404
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:50,280
I'll make a big show out of welcoming the sword.

405
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,520
He will definitely make a move then.

406
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,890
We'll be able to deal with it.

407
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,630
Keep an eye on Yun Tianhe and his company

408
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,990
before Disciples' Assembly,

409
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,650
just in case someone attacks the sword.

410
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:01,210
Yes.

411
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,290
Newcomers?

412
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:28,380
So beautiful.

413
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,950
This is Disciples' Academy.

414
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,110
Over here, this is the male's Disciples' Academy.

415
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,410
On this side, it's the female's Disciples' Academy.

416
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:36,190
I've never lived

417
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,750
with so many girls before.

418
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,960
I don't know if I'll get used to it.

419
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,190
It's okay. I'm here.

420
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,070
Look, that lady is so beautiful.

421
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,790
The one in red is pretty too.

422
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,480
I don't see what's so beautiful about them.

423
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,010
Right?

424
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,700
Yes.

425
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:48,960
Qionghua doesn't have someone

426
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,640
who is as wild as him.

427
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,870
Don't just whisper in the shadows.

428
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:53,490
Come here.

429
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,950
They are new disciples.

430
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,920
This is Liu Mengli.

431
00:17:59,150 --> 00:17:59,960
Her name is...

432
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,510
My name is Huaishu. I've been at Qionghua for two years.

433
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,370
I'm 19 years old.

434
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:03,170
Miss Liu, may I ask

435
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:04,350
how old are you? Where are you from?

436
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,550
What do you like to do in your spare time?

437
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,910
What should I call you, Sir?

438
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:11,220
-Yun Tianhe.
-He’s Tianhe.

439
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,750
Tianhe?

440
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,420
What a nice name.

441
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,020
People at Qionghua are always this arrogant, I see.

442
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,510
Why don't you ask me?

443
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:21,810
Well then, may I ask...

444
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,510
I'll blow your head off.

445
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,550
This lady has a fiery temper.

446
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:26,550
Stop. Stop.

447
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,250
Let me settle them down first.

448
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,920
Grandmaster has ordered that

449
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,860
these three people are to have twin-sharing rooms.

450
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,060
Twin-sharing rooms?

451
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,110
Only disciples who have been here for more than five years

452
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,580
have the rights to a twin-sharing room.

453
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,440
Why do they get to live separately as soon as they are here?

454
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,810
Grandmaster is being unfair.

455
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,150
Who dares to say that?

456
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,740
[Xuanye]

457
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,760
Grandmaster?

458
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,710
This is Senior Xuanye.

459
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,750
Se...Senior?

460
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,350
I saw that so many people are afraid of you,

461
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,480
so I thought you were the Grandmaster.

462
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,980
You've just stepped into our compounds.

463
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,540
You'll officially be part of us only after the Disciples' Assembly.

464
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,390
You don't have to call me Senior for now.

465
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:13,910
Senior,

466
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,190
is there going to be a Disciples' Assembly?

467
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,600
[Huaixin]

468
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:17,060
Sect Leader just told me

469
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,810
to hold a Disciples' Assembly at Qionghua Palace

470
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:21,840
for the whole sect at 7 a.m. tomorrow.

471
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,420
I've been in Qionghua for so long,

472
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,790
and I rarely get to see the Grandmaster's face.

473
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:27,290
We are actually holding a Disciples' Assembly for the three of them?

474
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:27,930
What?

475
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,940
Do you still want to say that Grandmaster is being unfair?

476
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,110
If you still dare to talk about Grandmaster behind his back,

477
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:34,020
I'm afraid you can't even continue to stay in Qionghua.

478
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,400
I'm sorry.

479
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:38,590
Huaixin.

480
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,590
Senior.

481
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,640
This young man

482
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,750
will stay with you for the time being.

483
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,200
Yes.

484
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,380
Ladies, come with me.

485
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,330
You come with me too.

486
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:57,900
Okay,

487
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,380
Senior.

488
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:06,770
Qionghua's disciples will meditate and practice cultivation daily in their room.

489
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,770
Hence, the furnishings are simple.

490
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,360
I think this place is much more comfortable than I thought.

491
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:14,970
Lingsha.

492
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:20,690
It's really rare that

493
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:23,030
you guys are being treated so well by Grandmaster

494
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,300
when you have just arrived at Qionghua.

495
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,020
Senior,

496
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,380
can you tell us the rules of Qionghua

497
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,700
so that we can prevent making ignorant mistakes?

498
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,070
Let's speak again after you attend the Disciples' Assembly

499
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:34,550
and officially become Qionghua's disciples tomorrow.

500
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:37,430
I'll ask someone to send you  your disciples' uniform later.

501
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,840
But whether or not you can

502
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,110
continue donning the uniform,

503
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,620
it's all up to you.

504
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,260
Got it, Senior.

505
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,210
Thank you for taking care of us.

506
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,180
Mengli,

507
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,450
Senior Xuanye doesn't look like she's to be messed with.

508
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:57,500
Let's try to avoid her.

509
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,180
Lingsha,

510
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,520
don't you think

511
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,090
she's hinting to us that

512
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:04,240
the Disciples' Assembly may be a hurdle that we need to pass?

513
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,700
Could it be another trial?

514
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,400
Why is this bed so hard?

515
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,160
It's not as soft as the hides at home.

516
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:32,400
My father didn't live in a place like this, did he?

517
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,120
Senior Huaixin.

518
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,580
We practitioners

519
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:46,390
should be cautious in everything we do.

520
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:49,860
If what's in front of you is cluttered, so will your heart.

521
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,860
You can use the closet over there.

522
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,510
Got it.

523
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,010
All settled.

524
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:16,450
Come.

525
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:17,690
Here's your bedding.

526
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,940
Thank you, Senior.

527
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,050
This is...

528
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,190
From now on, we'll use this line as a boundary.

529
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,550
I'll stay here, and you shall keep to your side.

530
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:35,910
Let's not cross each other's paths.

531
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:38,190
Also, please don't touch my things.

532
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,630
Don't worry, Senior.

533
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:44,680
I will work hard.

534
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,850
I usually prefer to stay quiet.

535
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,230
So, please keep your voice down.

536
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,340
If I don't talk to you,

537
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,940
please don't take the initiative to talk to me.

538
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:58,880
Okay.

539
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,830
Anything else?

540
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:01,530
No more.

541
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,800
I'll let you know if there is.

542
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:05,650
I need to meditate now.

543
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,110
Please don't disturb me.

544
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,000
One last thing.

545
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:12,820
Can I offer incense to my father here?

546
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,740
I am about to meditate.

547
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:17,240
How can there be smoke around the room?

548
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:18,140
Also,

549
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,580
no one burns incense around here.

550
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,860
If you really want to,

551
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:23,400
find a place with no one

552
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:25,080
to avoid trouble.

553
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,350
Okay.

554
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:45,980
Father, Mother.

555
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:49,700
I finally living in Qionghua's Disciples' Academy.

556
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,320
After I came here,

557
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,670
it feels like

558
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,220
you and Mother are right by my side.

559
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,940
[Yun Tianqing]

560
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,860
Father, don’t worry.

561
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,560
I will work hard

562
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,420
to become a Sword Immortal like you.

563
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,920
Ziying, it's you.

564
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,700
I went to pass you your disciples' uniform.

565
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,670
Huaixin said you went out to burn incense.

566
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:27,350
I thought

567
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,550
you would find a quiet place.

568
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,130
You really know me, Ziying.

569
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,120
Yes.

570
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:35,520
Come on.

571
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,590
Father, this is Mr. Ziying.

572
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:42,630
He's really great.

573
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,190
With him around, you don't have to worry about me.

574
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,650
Ziying, this is my father.

575
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:47,880
Yun Tianqing.

576
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:48,870
Put it away,

577
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,440
and don't ever take it out again.

578
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:53,600
I know.

579
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:54,830
Huaixin told me

580
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,390
I have to find a place where no one is around

581
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:59,380
if I want to burn incense for my father in Qionghua.

582
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,150
I mean,

583
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,660
don't burn incense for your father in Qionghua.

584
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:04,970
You must remember.

585
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:07,130
Why?

586
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:10,320
Isn't my father also a disciple of Qionghua?

587
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:13,970
Change into this disciples' uniform

588
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,830
when you attend the Disciples' Assembly tomorrow.

589
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,260
There are some things

590
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,910
I didn't want to tell you.

591
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:31,060
But since you're already in Qionghua,

592
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,360
I don’t want you to be too disappointed.

593
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,100
Your father, Yun Tianqing...

594
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,290
What happened to my father?

595
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:43,560
19 years ago,

596
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,230
he had some grudges

597
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:50,610
with Qionghua Sect.

598
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:54,350
That's why he and your mother left Qionghua.

599
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:56,840
Ziying.

600
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:09,760
I... I'm hungry.

601
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,120
Where can we have a meal?

602
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,940
I've sent some snacks

603
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,260
to Miss Han and Miss Mengli.

604
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,860
I've asked them to wait for you at Sword Ground.

605
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,340
Put away your father's memorial tablet first.

606
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,670
Don't let others see it.

607
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:24,940
Thank you.

608
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:33,860
Father.

609
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,680
What happened 19 years ago?

610
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:55,030
Su Yu.

611
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,430
Are you back?

612
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:12,610
Su Yu,

613
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:17,040
you're finally willing to come back.

614
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:21,610
Yes.

615
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,330
What's meant to come back will come back eventually.

616
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:32,910
Where is Su Yu?

617
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:34,730
Where is she?

618
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,990
Why are you laughing?

619
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,160
What did you do to Su Yu?

620
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,600
Do I even have to do anything with her?

621
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,620
Back then,

622
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:47,850
she was the one who wanted to leave Qionghua.

623
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,940
She's the one

624
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,000
who deserves to die.

625
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,780
What did you say?

626
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,900
I said she died.

627
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:56,480
She died 19 years ago.

628
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,500
If Su Yu has died,

629
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:02,150
why would the jade in your hand continue to shine?

630
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:05,260
Xihe and Wangshu can sense and echo each other.

631
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,520
Don't you dare lie to me.

632
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,360
Junior,

633
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:09,970
you're still so full of yourself.

634
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:11,910
You've been sleeping in the ice for 19 years.

635
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:13,590
Wangshu Sword has long since changed masters.

636
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:14,390
Don't you know?

637
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:16,830
How could there be a new master of Wangshu Sword?

638
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:17,890
You are lying to me!

639
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:21,560
Tell me.

640
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:23,110
Without Su Yu,

641
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,440
why would Wangshu come?

642
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,490
Did you kill Su Yu...

643
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,070
in order to obtain Wangshu?

644
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:29,950
It wasn't me.

645
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,720
I didn't kill her.

646
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,100
I don't know how she died either.

647
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,980
It's her son, who is not afraid of Wangshu's cold aura.

648
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,580
He can in fact, stimulate Wangshu's power.

649
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:41,490
Her son

650
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:45,060
could be the new host of Wangshu.

651
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,590
Su Yu's...

652
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,430
son?

653
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:57,430
Yes.

654
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,720
Su Yu's son,

655
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,760
Yun Tianhe.

656
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:09,260
Yun... Tianhe?

657
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,280
The Milky Way hangs in the sky,

658
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,250
and the stars are shining brightly.

659
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:16,050
The Milky Way hangs in the sky...

660
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:26,220
Yun Tianhe.

661
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,430
Yun Tianhe!

662
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,870
Yun Tianhe!

663
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:38,220
The heat is backfiring.

664
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,350
You need to regulate immediately.

665
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:42,210
Otherwise, you'll be possessed.

666
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:10,980
Lingsha,

667
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:13,150
why don't you tell your employer that

668
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:14,590
we've arrived at Qionghua?

669
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:16,430
You could also tell him about the elixir,

670
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:17,400
and also take the chance to ask

671
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,800
if he works for Qionghua.

672
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,630
You're smart.

673
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,440
I'm here.

674
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:33,230
You don't even talk when you show up.

675
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:35,190
It's scary when you talk all of a sudden.

676
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,190
Your Excellency.

677
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,870
We met once in Chenzhou.

678
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,160
Thank you for taking care of Lingsha.

679
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,270
Sir,

680
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,690
Tianhe and the sword are all at Qionghua.

681
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,630
Can you do me another favor?

682
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,030
Well,

683
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:51,020
can you give me another elixir?

684
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,630
I'm not someone who would break her promises and blackmail you.

685
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:55,710
It's because...

686
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:57,550
the last time, I...

687
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:59,260
Because when we were at Boxian Town,

688
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,040
Lingsha got injured

689
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,110
while trying to protect Tianhe.

690
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,370
Her life was in danger.

691
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,360
We had no choice

692
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,470
but to let Lingsha consume the elixir,

693
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:07,870
in order to save her life.

694
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:10,080
Your Excellency, please help her.

695
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:11,850
I see.

696
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:17,110
Will you give me one more to save my sister?

697
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:21,210
At tomorrow's assembly,

698
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,830
take the initiative to present the sword.

699
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:26,290
As long as the sword is returned to Qionghua,

700
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,110
I'll give you the elixir.

701
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:37,360
Wait for me at Sword Ground.

702
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:49,390
Qionghua's dessert is really delicious.

703
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:53,980
You still owe me a meal of ginkgo porridge with dates.

704
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,820
Fine.

705
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,270
After the Disciples' Assembly,

706
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,510
I'll cook for you

707
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:59,660
once we establish a firm footing here.

708
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:00,810
I don't know why,

709
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,300
but when I think of the Disciples' Assembly tomorrow,

710
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,580
I feel very anxious.

711
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:06,240
You...

712
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,100
You must have been intimidated by Xuanye,

713
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,260
who is stern as a stone.

714
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:10,770
My employer

715
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,260
is most likely part of Qionghua.

716
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,550
He will protect us.

717
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:15,840
We also have Ziying and the others.

718
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,200
Lingsha,

719
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:20,550
your employer asked me to present the sword tomorrow.

720
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,610
I'll give it to him,

721
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:24,590
but he must give you the elixir.

722
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,580
What I'm worried about

723
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,590
is your future in Qionghua.

724
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:31,850
Don't worry.

725
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:34,190
I will

726
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,790
keep my mouth shut

727
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,220
and not spew nonsense.

728
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:39,890
Then you have to promise me

729
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,830
that you would control your temper.

730
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,630
Don't blow up like a cannonball,

731
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:45,030
and don't let other people's words

732
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,300
affect your emotions.

733
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,500
Okay, I promise you.

734
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:52,900
Mengli,

735
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,160
what's on your mind?

736
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:00,770
I'm wondering how my parentage,

737
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:02,070
Uncle Yun's experience,

738
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:03,200
and your sword,

739
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:05,550
all seems to be related to what happened 19 years ago.

740
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:08,030
So what exactly happened 19 years ago?

741
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:10,850
Don't worry.

742
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:13,560
When we become the disciples of Qionghua,

743
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:15,360
everything will be cleared up.

744
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:16,520
Yes.

745
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:17,540
We

746
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:19,600
not only want to know what happened 19 years ago,

747
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,200
but it is also so that

748
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,360
we can become famous Sword Immortals 19 years later.

749
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,820
Let's work hard together.

750
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:26,390
Most importantly,

751
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:28,270
we must be together forever.

752
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:30,790
We'll never leave each other!

753
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:32,450
We'll never leave each other!

754
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,390
We'll never leave each other!

755
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:35,380
We'll never leave each other!

756
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,150
We'll never leave each other!

757
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:37,350
We'll never leave each other!

758
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,270
We'll never leave each other!

759
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,930
We'll never leave each other!

760
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:10,989
Sect Leader is here!

761
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,739
Greetings, Sect Leader.

762
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:19,810
Grandmaster is here!

763
00:34:20,969 --> 00:34:23,310
Greetings, Grandmaster.

764
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:44,170
Qionghua's first-generation Grandmaster,

765
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:46,429
under the guidance of Xuantian Goddess,

766
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:49,550
created the method of cultivating immortality by allowing humans to be one with the sword.

767
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:51,429
For every 20 disciples who enter the sect,

768
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:53,429
we will hold a Disciples' Assembly.

769
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:56,330
Those who can enter Qionghua Mountain

770
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:58,040
are the cream of the crop.

771
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,020
Being a disciple and cultivator of Qionghua

772
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,740
means you are among the best in the world.

773
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:08,250
We, the disciples, will listen carefully to Grandmaster's teachings.

774
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,010
Only we, Qionghua,

775
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,140
can be the leader among Kunxu's eight sects.

776
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,140
Do you know why?

777
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,510
I think it must be because

778
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:25,830
only Qionghua can kill demons

779
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,420
with the Three-Foot Sword,

780
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,020
and be respected by the people in the world.

781
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:29,830
You're right.

782
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,290
Well that depends on who has the sword, right?

783
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,640
Grandmaster,

784
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:51,310
I feel that

785
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,170
a sword is simply an object used by men.

786
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:56,790
The most important thing is the heart of a swordsman.

787
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:59,150
Even if a good sword falls into the hands of a bad guy,

788
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,410
it's still a disaster.

789
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:08,740
What a wild brat.

790
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:11,250
You'll only get to show off in this moment.

791
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,600
There's murderous aura!

792
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,120
What murderous aura?

793
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,190
Tianhe.

794
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:23,630
There's nothing.

795
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:25,580
What did you say?

796
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:26,830
Shut up!

797
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:28,110
Don't talk nonsense.

798
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,030
Nothing.

799
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,580
Maybe I said something wrong just now.

800
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,830
Why can't you control your mouth?

801
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:37,480
Although your words are rough,

802
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,270
but that's precisely the point.

803
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:41,520
What newcomers need to cultivate

804
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:43,610
is neither martial arts nor courage,

805
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,930
but to hone

806
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,320
the integrity and fortitude deep inside your hearts.

807
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,720
Among the new disciples,

808
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:53,950
who are the three who passed the trials in just three days?

809
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:54,980
Grandmaster.

810
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,150
It's me,

811
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,160
Lingsha, and Mengli.

812
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:00,300
The three of you, step forward.

813
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:27,630
Why is the spiritual power in this wild brat

814
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:29,190
so powerful?

815
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,260
What's wrong, Grandmaster?

816
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,310
Is there something wrong with us?

817
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,840
All three of you are gifted.

818
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,470
Although your spiritual power is chaotic,

819
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:41,130
but you've got a lot of energy.

820
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:44,170
With time, you'll definitely get there.

821
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,720
I think there will be a disaster.
