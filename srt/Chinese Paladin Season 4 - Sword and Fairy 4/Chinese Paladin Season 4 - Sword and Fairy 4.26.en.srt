5
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,130
Okay, thank you.

6
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,970
This looks nice. I want this.

7
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,530
There are so many lanterns.

8
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:52,750
This place

9
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:53,710
suddenly reminds me

10
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,970
of us celebrating a festival in Taiping Village back then.

11
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,340
Today, can we eat...

12
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,340
rice dumplings again?

13
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,600
Not every festival is the Dragon Boat Festival.

14
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,630
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

15
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,070
Of course we should enjoy the moon and lanterns

16
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,130
and eat mooncakes.

17
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,820
Why should we turn off the lights when eating?

18
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,240
Enjoy the lanterns, not turn off the lights.

19
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,520
What is a mooncake?

20
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,110
You...

21
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,960
The Mid-Autumn Festival originated from ancient rituals of moon worship.

22
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,790
So people would make round mooncakes

23
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,530
with all kinds of sweet stuffing.

24
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:23,390
The full moon symbolizes a happy reunion of people.

25
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,960
The Mid-Autumn Festival is a day of reunions.

26
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,820
I've been alone for over 10 years.

27
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,320
I'm happy that I'm with you today.

28
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,870
It's also a kind of reunion that the four of us are together.

29
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,620
That's right.

30
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,520
The four of us are family too.

31
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,520
Tonight, let's enjoy lanterns

32
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,950
and the moon and eat mooncakes together.

33
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,760
-All you know is eating.
-Go find her now.

34
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,960
That's right.

35
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:43,610
Keep looking.

36
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:44,329
Please.

37
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,550
You can't go.

38
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,480
Lian Bao has been brought up by you.

39
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,110
How could you do this?

40
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,600
I also want to find Lian Bao.

42
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,200
But you can't go to Yinxiang Mountain.

This is the only place we haven't searched yet.

44
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,100
-Who are you guys?
-That's right.

45
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,560
What are you doing here with a bow and swords?

46
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,320
My bow and sword are for self-defense.

47
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:03,290
Is there a problem?

48
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:03,750
Tianhe.

49
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,140
We just arrived in Jimo.

50
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,470
We are here to find something.

51
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,930
We have no bad intentions.

52
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:12,940
Why are you in such a hurry?

53
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,070
Did something happen?

54
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,590
We are worried about Mr. Xia's adopted daughter.

55
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,070
Lian Bao is missing.

56
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:18,829
-That's right.
-That's right.

57
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:20,890
Lian Bao is seven years old this year.

58
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,170
She's only this tall.

59
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,579
She's pretty and cute.

60
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,140
But she has dementia.

61
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,320
We've searched the whole village

62
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,079
except Yinxiang Mountain.

63
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:29,880
Madam,

64
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,520
I'll figure out a way to find Lian Bao myself.

65
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,340
I'm begging you.

66
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,260
Please go back to celebrate the festival.

67
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,210
Forget it.

68
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,270
Let him be.

69
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,590
Let's go.

70
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,790
Although Lian Bao has dementia,

71
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:41,710
she's still your daughter.

72
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,370
How could you not look for her?

73
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,490
I can feel you are anxious.

74
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,160
But why won't you send people to look for her in Yinxiang Mountain?

75
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,270
We are disciples from Kunxu's Qionghua Sect.

76
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:55,130
It's our duty to protect the people and kill demons.

77
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,640
You can tell us the truth.

78
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,650
Since you're cultivators from Qionghua Sect,

79
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:07,380
please come with me to my house, and I'll tell you about the details.

80
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,550
Mr. Xia,

81
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,360
I heard from the villagers that you're a scholar.

82
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,760
You also know how to fish?

83
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,680
Although you're seriously injured,

84
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,920
I can tell you are not an ordinary person

85
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,670
judging from your unique demeanour.

86
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,600
Please show us your true identity.

87
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,140
You're indeed an outstanding cultivator.

88
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,800
I'm the Mountain God here.

89
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,700
I like the plain life here,

90
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:55,480
so I've hidden my identity and disguised myself as a mortal.

91
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:58,070
We only met demons along the way.

92
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,850
This is the first time we've met an immortal.

93
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,120
My apologies.

94
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,770
Don't bow to me.

95
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,420
I still need your help

96
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,380
with saving my daughter, Lian Bao.

97
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,280
She was taken away by a fairy fox.

98
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,240
A fairy fox?

99
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,720
That fairy fox is a contracted spirit in the Guangji Cold Painting.

100
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,250
The Guangji Cold Painting?

101
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,300
I'm gonna be honest with you.

102
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,430
This time, we are here

103
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,160
for the Guangji Cold Painting.

104
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:29,200
I had the Guangji Cold Painting.

105
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:30,700
But today,

106
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,590
the fairy fox took away the painting along with Lian Bao.

107
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,690
[Lian Bao]

108
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,390
Finally,

109
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,510
[Fairy fox]

110
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,520
I got out.

111
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,320
Lian Bao.

112
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,280
In order to become an immortal,

113
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,400
Hu San made a contract with the Guangji Cold Painting.

114
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,000
He could gain immortality

115
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,160
on condition that he went into the painting to be a contracted spirit.

116
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,880
He escaped once 100 years ago

117
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,330
and committed evil acts everywhere.

118
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,150
He also ordered people to build temples to worship him.

119
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,350
Later, I subdued him.

120
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,920
But unexpectedly, his immortal power has greatly increased

121
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,870
and he broke through my constraints.

122
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,270
I was also injured by him.

123
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,200
But why did he take away your daughter?

124
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,750
To be honest with you,

125
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,220
on the full moon night,

126
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,310
the fairy fox will be taken back by the painting

127
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,230
to continue to be the contracted spirit.

128
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:30,430
Unless he can find a new contracted spirit to replace him.

129
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,100
Do you mean that fairy fox, a contracted spirit,

130
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,130
wants your daughter to replace him?

131
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:37,870
That's right.

132
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,840
Don't worry, Sir.

133
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,790
Take us to the fairy fox.

134
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,310
We'll get Lian Bao out.

135
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,040
The painting's spiritual attribute is Wind.

136
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,300
It can sense my breath.

137
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:49,310
Unless I give up my immortal power and become the contracted spirit willingly.

138
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,650
Otherwise, if I go with you,

139
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,200
the fairy fox will run away,

140
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:53,650
and we can never find him again.

141
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:55,200
Where is the fairy fox now?

142
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,010
The Fairy Fox Temple in Yinxiang Mountain

143
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,270
is now in a wild forest.

144
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,170
I think he must be there.

145
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,460
But a celestial beast is an immortal after all.

146
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,130
You have little chance of winning.

147
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,930
You just need to stall him till the moon becomes full.

148
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:07,330
Okay, don't worry.

149
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,710
Let's go.

150
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,260
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

151
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:15,070
Wait.

152
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:17,670
Young man,

153
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,100
can I take a look at your bow?

154
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,090
Sure.

155
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,460
This divine bow is called the Primordial-Spirit-Initiating Moon-Chasing Bow.

156
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,950
The "Primordial-Spirit-Initiating" represents not regretting the original intention.

157
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,880
The "Moon-Chasing" represents not being afraid of moving forward.

158
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,340
I'm not good at using bows.

159
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,720
So I'm giving it to you.

160
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,550
You are giving it to me?

161
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,020
The immortal is giving you a bow. Try it now.

162
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,150
Okay.

163
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:51,270
Let me try.

164
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:02,790
I can't draw it.

165
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,910
If you want to draw this bow,

166
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:08,030
you need to remain steadfast in your determination without regrets.

167
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,180
It's not easy even for immortals.

168
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,630
As a mortal, you need more experience.

169
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,400
Take this bow first.

170
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:16,240
If you are in danger,

171
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,510
pluck the bowstring.

172
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,980
I will come to help you.

173
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,860
This bow can be summoned anytime.

174
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,100
Thank you, Sir.

175
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,500
If you can save my daughter,

176
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,120
I will give you the Guangji Cold Painting

177
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,780
to express my gratitude.

178
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,690
Don't worry.

179
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:42,750
Leave it to us.

180
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,750
[Yinxiang Mountain]

181
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,830
The fairy fox is indeed here.

182
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,900
I can't believe Xia Yuanchen, that useless immortal,

183
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,960
asked you, immature cultivators,

184
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,650
to find me.

185
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,580
Interesting.

186
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:30,590
I can't believe you've been a pure man for three lifetimes.

187
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:32,840
You stupid fairy fox,

188
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,810
give us Lian Bao and the Guangji Cold Painting.

189
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:35,570
Be a smart guy.

190
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,480
I bet

191
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,250
you won't even have a chance to find Lian Bao.

192
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,220
You like gambling so much.

193
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,420
Then let's make a bet.

194
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,300
What's the stake?

195
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,160
Let's go into the painting first.

196
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:50,650
Okay.

197
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,130
We promise you.

198
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,660
You can only go into the painting if you want to save her.

199
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,830
Once you do,

200
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,020
our bet will begin.

201
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:13,540
Let's begin.

202
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:24,990
There is indeed a vast galaxy in the Guangji Cold Painting.

203
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,740
Didn't Xia Yuanchen tell you?

204
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,360
The Guangji Cold Painting is made by the Northern Black Emperor.

205
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,400
It can turn back time

206
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,530
and change the trajectory of life.

207
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,040
Where is Lian Bao?

208
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,710
If you don't know about Lian Bao's past and present lives,

209
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:41,110
what's the use of finding her?

210
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,240
Past and present lives?

211
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:45,790
How is that possible?

212
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,450
People would forget what happened in their previous lives

213
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,110
after reincarnation, right?

214
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,950
The Guangji Cold Painting records everything through the elapse of time.

215
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,110
Of course it can show

216
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:59,120
the memories in the previous lives of the person in the painting.

217
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,120
That means we can see Lian Bao's previous life, right?

218
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,710
Lian Bao's original name was Jing Lan.

219
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,120
She was seriously ill when she first met Xia Yuanchen.

220
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:12,870
But Xia Yuanchen still married her.

221
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,030
Jing Lan,

222
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,000
let me feed you medicine.

223
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,460
I'm your wife.

224
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,320
[Jing Lan]

225
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:45,930
I should take care of you.

226
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:47,350
Jing Lan,

227
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,510
since we are a couple,

228
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,660
I will accompany you and take care of you forever.

229
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,830
If there is a next life,

230
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:07,860
I will protect you

231
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,310
and repay your kindness.

232
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,550
Xia Yuanchen doesn't know

233
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,790
in order to repay his kindness,

234
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:46,030
Jing Lan was reincarnated as a little dog after she died.

235
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,750
Jing Lan,

236
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,770
I have to leave.

237
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,370
[Tomb of Beloved Wife, Jing Lan]

238
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,120
You should find another owner.

239
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,880
Xia Yuanchen had been gone for 100 years.

240
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:16,510
But this foolish Jing Lan didn't get reincarnated again.

241
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,110
She had been waiting for him.

242
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,550
Until a few years ago,

243
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,740
Xia Yuanchen returned to the fishing village.

244
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:30,110
She insisted on staying by Xia Yuanchen's side.

245
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:34,170
This time, she was reincarnated as a plant with a lifespan of 100 days,

246
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,430
just to stay with him for 100 days.

247
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,450
The flowers withered not long after they bloomed.

248
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:00,790
Her most tragic reincarnation

249
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,670
was just a drop of rain.

250
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:13,510
She wasn't even a living thing.

251
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:17,430
In the six rounds of her reincarnation,

252
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:19,890
Jing Lan finally became a human in this life.

253
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,730
But what a pity.

254
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:28,790
She has dementia.

255
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,510
Through the six rounds of reincarnation,

256
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,440
she has almost exhausted herself.

257
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:44,400
But she still wants to stay by his side to repay his kindness.

258
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,400
But how can a person with dementia

259
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,130
repay someone else's kindness?

260
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,330
Why are you laughing?

261
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:52,270
You old fox.

262
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:54,670
Jing Lan's reincarnation story is so touching.

263
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,680
How could you still laugh?

264
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,080
What happened in the previous life is fate.

265
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,340
But she persists in being with him.

266
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,620
You mortals

267
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:03,920
are really ridiculous.

268
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:05,430
You are...

269
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:08,430
You immortals

270
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,580
have given up worldly feelings or desires.

271
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,080
All you know is cultivating.

272
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,540
How do you know the happiness of being a human?

273
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,140
If I don't make you lose once,

274
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,020
you won't know how stupid you are.

275
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,520
I want my father.

276
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:25,930
I want my father.

277
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,920
Lian Bao has been trapped by me

278
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,180
in Xia Yuanchen's house in the painting.

279
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:33,310
If you want to save her,

280
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:36,140
you're going to have to finish the bet

281
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,130
with me.

282
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,460
You didn't threaten us with Lian Bao to come into the painting

283
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,970
just for this bet, right?

284
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:44,990
Smart guy.

285
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,900
This cultivator is smart.

286
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,320
I took Lian Bao here

287
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:53,380
because she still hasn't changed her mind after six rounds of reincarnation.

288
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,100
Only those who are steadfast

289
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,180
and don't give up easily

290
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:59,360
deserve to be a contracted spirit.

291
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,430
And you guys,

292
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,750
especially you,

293
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,860
a pure man for three lifetimes,

294
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,460
deserve to be a contracted spirit.

295
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,680
Let's make a bet with the four of you.

296
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:12,580
Okay.

297
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,880
What are the rules?

298
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,750
Mortals think they can control their destinies.

299
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:20,040
I'm gonna use the painting to turn back time

300
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,750
and send you back to the past.

301
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:26,200
After you go back to the past, you will only have your memories from that period.

302
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,080
I bet the four of you

303
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,570
will miss out on it forever

304
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,990
and never meet again in this life

305
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,540
because of a slight difference in your thoughts at that time.

306
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,620
Impossible.

307
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:36,730
Good.

308
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,010
If you lose,

309
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:38,970
you'll have to promise me

310
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:42,370
you'll willingly stay in the painting as contracted spirits

311
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,700
and never see each other again in this life.

312
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,810
What if you lose?

313
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,430
If I lose,

314
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,630
I'll let you take away Lian Bao.

315
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,090
If you are not confident,

316
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,440
get out of the painting now,

317
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,360
so that you can still be in one piece.

318
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:05,290
We promise you.

319
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,650
But you can't break your promise.

320
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:10,099
The agreement has been reached,

321
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:12,160
with the painting being the witness.

322
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,830
In an hour,

323
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:37,140
you'll become contracted spirits

324
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,080
and be trapped in the painting forever.

325
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,120
Ziying,

326
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,860
are you willing to accept him as your disciple?

327
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:51,610
Grandmaster,

328
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,780
I've known the three of them for a while.

329
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:58,200
I know they didn't come to Qionghua for cultivation.

330
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,860
They have their own purposes.

331
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,270
Yun Tianhe,

332
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:05,830
if you stay here,

333
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,400
you will be ostracized and slandered by the disciples.

334
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,000
You don't have to experience this.

335
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,260
You should leave here.

336
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,440
Mr. Murong,

337
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:14,900
since you know

338
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,490
we've been through a lot to come to Qionghua,

339
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:19,120
how could you be so cruel?

340
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:20,830
Ziying,

341
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:23,070
I don't care about being ostracized.

342
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,230
Just accept me as your disciple, okay?

343
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:30,430
Ziying.

344
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:33,710
Have you decided?

345
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:37,790
Are you really not willing to accept him as your disciple?

346
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:38,380
No,

347
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:39,950
I'm not willing.

348
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:41,510
You Ice Cube.

349
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,120
You're the one who brought us to Qionghua.

350
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,580
You're also the one who is kicking us out.

351
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,980
-Why did you go back on your word?
-Lingsha.

352
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:47,960
He...

353
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,060
Since no one wants to accept you,

354
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,590
you should leave tomorrow.

355
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,910
Considering you have returned the sword,

356
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,200
I will ask someone to give you the magical medicine

357
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,370
you need.

358
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,620
It's been decided.

359
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,870
You may leave.

360
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:02,710
Ziying,

361
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:04,800
I hope one day,

362
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,720
we can ride swords together again.

363
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,050
Look how reluctant he is.

364
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:12,260
Let's go.

365
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,260
Let's go.

366
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:15,510
Let's go.

367
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:16,740
Stop looking at him.

368
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,230
Good.

369
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,060
One has been left behind.

370
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:25,910
Look.

371
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:28,610
When I got up this morning, I asked the servants

372
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:30,010
to prepare what I know

373
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:31,980
and what should be prepared.

374
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:34,640
Mengli,

375
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,900
don't you want to find out who your real parents are?

376
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:40,480
Li,

377
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,920
have you found out something?

378
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:45,720
Actually, I knew

379
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,180
you are not my biological parents long ago.

380
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,720
But my biological parents died long ago.

381
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,710
I really don't have the heart

382
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,300
to leave my parents who raised me behind

383
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,210
to investigate my dead biological parents.

384
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,190
Mengli,

385
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:05,320
are you really... not coming with us?

386
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:06,750
Miss Han,

387
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:08,500
I've made up my mind.

388
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,050
I have no intention to leave.

389
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:12,100
You and Mr. Yun should leave now.

390
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,720
A slight difference in thoughts

391
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,960
could lead to a farewell forever.

392
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:28,250
So you've agreed to go down the mountain?

393
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:30,110
Give my father's memorial tablet

394
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:32,240
and my mother's stone back to me first.

395
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:32,960
Okay.

396
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,260
I'm going to take my parents home.

397
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,520
Be careful when you go down the mountain.

398
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:48,520
You stupid wild man, how dare you lie to me!

399
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,400
I didn't lie to you.

400
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,590
I just said

401
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,150
give my father's memorial tablet

402
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:57,030
and my mother's stone back to me first.

403
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:59,830
But I didn't agree to go down the mountain with you.

404
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,500
Don't you want to know about your father's past

405
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,960
or the story of this sword?

406
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:07,550
Well,

407
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,750
don't you want to see Little Pig Demon anymore?

408
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,110
It's your best friend.

409
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:13,960
My father said

410
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:15,590
he wouldn't let me go down the mountain.

411
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,220
So I can't go down the mountain.

412
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,350
And Little Pig Demon

413
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:20,510
will come back itself after playing around outside.

414
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:23,230
Now I need to hurry back to help Dajiu hatch eggs.

415
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:25,750
Yun Tianhe,

416
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,030
if you go back,

417
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,120
we will never see each other again.

418
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,630
You're right.

419
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:36,870
We are about to...

420
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,680
say goodbye forever.

421
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,080
Ziying,

422
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,990
I hope one day,

423
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,710
we can ride swords together again.

424
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,470
Everything good in this world

425
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,670
lies in fulfillment.

426
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:00,290
We are not only the people enjoying the scenery,

427
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:02,220
but also the people in the scenery.

428
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:06,030
Thank you, Little Ziying.

429
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,980
Father, Mother.

430
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,890
Let's go back.

431
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:24,610
Young Miss.

432
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:26,690
Young Miss.

433
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,740
I found this manual for beginners in the martial world

434
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,270
in Miss Han's room.

435
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,920
She must have forgotten it.

436
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:39,320
I'm wondering what kind of place Qionghua is.

437
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,750
I want to go to Qionghua with you.

438
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,830
This must be something Lingsha prepared for me.

439
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:47,680
Li,

440
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:49,570
you really don't regret this?

441
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:34,440
You look... so beautiful when you smile.

442
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,130
The full moon is approaching.

443
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,540
You guys

444
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:57,220
just admit defeat and wait to become contracted spirits.

445
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,420
Lingsha, Mengli,

446
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,830
if we leave like this,

447
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:17,270
we will never have a chance to return to Qionghua again.

448
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,270

553
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,910
A father-daughter relationship

554
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:46,240
is also one of the most precious relationships in the world.

555
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,530
The four of us

556
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:49,310
have become family and friends in this life.

557
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,510
We must cherish it.

558
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,000
You are right.

559
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,780
After I get out,

560
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,590
I will forget everything in my previous life.

561
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:03,060
I'll become Yuanchen's daughter, Lian Bao, again.

562
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:06,790
I'll accompany him for the rest of my life.

563
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:09,900
Don't worry.

564
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,230
We won't tell him anything.

565
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,870
Father. Father.

566
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,710
I want my father.

567
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,270
Alright, Lian Bao.

568
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:23,110
We're going to take you to your father.

569
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:23,640
Let's go.

570
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,760
Let's go.

571
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,100
The full moon is approaching.

572
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:29,890
Let's go now.

573
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:44,990
I've lived for a few hundred years.

574
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,280
I've seen too many betrayals, partings, and reunions

575
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,470
in the mortal world.

576
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,760
I didn't expect you guys

577
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:56,420
to win the bet.

578
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,850
Today, we showed you

579
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,750
mortals also have profound love

580
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,950
and eternal loyalty.

581
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:04,610
The full moon has risen.

582
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,670
You should go back into the painting.

583
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,510
Why?

584
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,750
Why can you mortals be together forever?

585
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:20,380
But I'm all alone even though I'm an immortal.

586
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:25,490
On this reunion night,

587
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,510
I'm going to make you

588
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:32,450
have a taste of what an eternal parting feels like!

589
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:35,570
You wish!

590
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:51,670
You stupid fairy fox.

591
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:56,750
Tianhe, you...

592
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,380
I'm fine.

593
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,710
Say goodbye to each other.

594
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,040
Hu San,

595
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:04,660
don't hurt them.

596
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,480
I'll replace you to be the contracted spirit.

597
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,200
Father.

598
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:08,780
Lian Bao,

599
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,660
don't go there!

600
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,160
What's going on?

601
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:23,960
The Primordial-Spirit-Initiating Moon-Chasing Bow.

602
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,590
You are the one

603
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,890
who should be the contracted spirit.

604
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,800
Father.

605
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:58,320
Impressive, Tianhe.

606
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,090
Father.

607
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:01,360
Lian Bao.

608
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,690
So only those who are steadfast

609
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:15,660
deserve to be a contracted spirit.

610
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,960
Luckily, the four of you are very close

611
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,040
and would never abandon each other.

612
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:22,750
Actually, you and Lian Bao are the same.

613
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,360
Although she has dementia,

614
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,040
she only has you in her heart.

615
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:30,520
I used to think she couldn't live without me.

616
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,770
But after what happened this time,

617
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:35,350
I've found that I can't live without her.

618
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:42,950
Sir,

619
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:45,060
this is a divine bow.

620
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,750
I'm giving it back to you.

621
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,450
Mr. Yun,

622
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:51,200
since you can draw this bow,

623
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,100
it means you are the real owner

624
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,350
of the Primordial-Spirit-Initiating Moon-Chasing Bow.

625
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:55,880
This...

626
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,550
Thank you, Sir.

627
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,850
The stars are so beautiful.

628
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,990
Father, I like them.

629
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,040
The painting's spiritual attribute is Wind.

630
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,170
It's difficult for mortals to hold it.

631
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,650
You have a rare body of ultimate Yin and Yang.

632
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:38,540
The power of Yin and Yang can neutralize the five spirits.

633
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,670
Only you can hold it.

634
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,130
It's time for me to fulfill my promise.

635
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,220
I can really feel the wind from it.

636
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,740
Thank you, Sir.

637
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,730
Your immortal power...

638
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:11,560
I became an earth immortal because of the Guangji Cold Painting.

639
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,430
Since I've given him the painting,

640
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:14,990
I've naturally become a mortal.

641
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:15,590
No.

642
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:17,830
Sir,

643
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,020
no matter how important the Guangji Cold Painting is,

644
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,470
it's not worth your life or immortal power.

645
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,080
Since my beloved wife Jing Lan died,

646
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,350
I've never cared

647
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,710
if I'm an immortal or not.

648
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:34,870
Even if I could live for 1,000 years,

649
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:36,990
it would just be endless lovesickness

650
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:37,850
and suffering.

651
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:42,130
In this life, I just want to stay with Lian Bao

652
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:44,230
and live

653
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:46,210
the life of a real mortal.

654
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,520
Father, carry me.

655
00:33:59,070 --> 00:33:59,740
Lian Bao,

656
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,970
I know you want to see lanterns.

657
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,160
Let's go now.

658
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,080
Okay.

659
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:15,949
How about this one?

660
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:16,900
Not bad.

661
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:18,110
Okay.

662
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:19,310
I want these two fish lanterns.

663
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:20,840
-And the lotus ones.
-Okay.

664
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,400
Mengli, look.

665
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,350
In the past, I only knew that lanterns are used for illumination.

666
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:29,150
Now I know they can be used for different purposes.

667
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:31,449
Tianhe.

668
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,310
Where did you go?

669
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:34,530
We went to buy lotus lanterns.

670
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:35,440
One for each.

671
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:36,750
How do you know?

672
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:38,520
I... I was just about to buy one.

673
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,190
The local villagers said

674
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:42,380
if we tell our wishes to the lotus lanterns

675
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,380
and put them in the Jimo Sea, our wishes will come true.

676
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,940
So... you ignorant kid,

677
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:49,989
your wish must be eating mooncakes.

678
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:51,469
Who's an ignorant kid?

679
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:54,139
I've learned a lot more.

680
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:55,800
Tell us then.

681
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:57,310
What have you learned?

682
00:34:58,650 --> 00:34:59,780
Today, I've learned

683
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,430
what the Dragon Boat Festival, the Mid-Autumn Festival,

684
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:03,430
and lanterns are.

685
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,070
I've also learned

686
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:06,000
people

687
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,290
have to experience eternal partings.

688
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,440
Some people would die very young.

689
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:13,110
There are also immortals who can live for thousands of years.

690
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,840
But no matter what fate brings,

691
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:16,330
the most important thing

692
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:19,130
is to be with those who are important to ourselves.

693
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:22,450
Then... what if someone dies first among us?

694
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,460
If I die first,

695
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,930
I would be like Jing Lan.

696
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,650
No matter how many times I would be reincarnated

697
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:29,980
or whether you still remember me or not,

698
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,380
I would always stay by your side,

699
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,580
even if I could only be your Qiankun bag.

700
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,930
I don't want a stupid bag like you.

701
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:39,870
If I die first,

702
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:41,200
I would choose to be the Wangshu Sword,

703
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,730
so that everyone would treat me as a treasure.

704
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,520
Uncle Ziying,

705
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:47,000
if you have a next life,

706
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,400
what would you want to do?

707
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,230
I...

708
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:54,390
If I have to choose,

709
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,840
I would choose to be a scabbard.

710
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,130
I would only stay with my sword.

711
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:00,750
Lingsha.

712
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,210
Then I... would choose to be a lantern.

713
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,070
You would look at me on the Mid-Autumn Festival every year,

714
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,530
and I would look at you too.

715
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:14,810
Okay.

716
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:24,920
Look.

717
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:33,870
Father,

718
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,720
I'll take care of you from now on.

719
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,120
I'm your wife.

720
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,770
If there is a next life,

721
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,670
I will protect you.

722
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:51,680
Jing Lan.

723
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:49,970
Lanterns,

724
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,910
please drift far away,

725
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,390
so that our wishes

726
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:55,010
can come true for a long time.

727
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,470
Please.

728
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:06,500
Here.

729
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:08,590
Drink some.

730
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:09,390
Okay.

731
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,150
How could you drink alone?

732
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:14,280
Little Mengli, Little Ziying,

733
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,020
don't just stand there.

734
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,680
Come on, have a reunion drink.

735
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:18,790
Come on.

736
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:23,580
This is...

737
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:25,280
This is

738
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,740
a toast for the moment

739
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,780
of us being together now.

740
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,570
Then... this is a toast

741
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:32,830
for us to be able to always stay together.

742
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:21,860
My...

743
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:23,760
heart is beating so fast.

744
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,270
And my cheeks feel very hot too.

745
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,660
Lingsha, why are your cheeks red too?

746
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:34,840
My...

747
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,620
My cheeks are red

748
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,800
because I just drank wine.

749
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:39,990
Ziying

750
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,850
and Mengli also drank wine. Their cheeks are also red.

751
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:42,740
Let's drink.

752
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,530
Come on, sit down.

753
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,050
Let's drink.

754
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:48,820
Come on.

755
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:02,530
Mengli,

756
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,220
after we retrieve the next cold weapon and go down the mountain,

757
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,820
we'll teach you how to drink.

758
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,360
By the way, Ziying,

759
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,730
we've made a deal.

760
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:11,870
After Senior Xuan Xiao

761
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:13,440
tells us the truth,

762
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:14,920
we'll leave Qionghua.

763
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:16,290
Can you...

764
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:18,960
Can you come with us?

765
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:22,680
Let's go travel around the world happily.

766
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:30,570
Qionghua might face a war with the demon clan.

767
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,930
I can't leave if that really happens.

768
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,520
How about this?

769
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:40,010
If you have to fight, we'll fight side by side with you.

770
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:41,870
We'll leave together after that.

771
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:42,800
I don't have another choice.

772
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,500
I'll fight side by side with you.

773
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,260
Me too.

774
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,730
You don't have to stay with me.

775
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,340
You can do whatever you want.

776
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:52,870
I promise you.

777
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:54,890
If this war won't happen,

778
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:56,670
I will leave Qionghua

779
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:59,400
and go find you to travel around the world

780
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,270
and live happily.

781
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:05,260
♫You, who is isolated in the darkness♫

782
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:03,660
Deal.

783
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:05,250
I will keep my promise

784
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:08,470
♫You, who is as insignificant as dust♫

785
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:06,670
for the rest of my life.

786
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:07,900
Little Ziying,

787
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,100
is this the wish you made?

788
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:10,910
♫Falling into the crowd, disappearing♫

789
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:10,550
Little Lingsha,

790
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:12,540
what's the wish you just made?

791
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:13,640
♫Licking your broken wings♫

792
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:17,450
I think we all know what our wishes are

793
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:17,830
♫Trapped in a situation full of lies♫

794
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,740
even if we don't tell each other. Right?

795
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:21,080
♫To pursue the mystery about my background♫

796
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:24,060
Then... why don't we say our wishes together?

797
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,680
♫Dash through thorns and trudge over soil♫

798
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:26,640
♫With your undying pride♫

799
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:30,670
One, two, three.

800
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:32,530
♫You're like a star that can pierce the sky♫

801
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:35,040
We wish we could be together forever.

802
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:36,840
♫Gather into a burning ball of fire♫

803
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:42,150
♫Shining on the long journey ahead♫

804
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:43,780
♫In the dark♫

805
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,300
♫You flail your arms♫

806
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,170
♫And light up yourself♫

807
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:48,400
♫Light up every late dawn♫

808
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:50,110
♫You'll do anything♫

809
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,570
♫Use your youth♫

810
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:54,630
♫Go against the current and create a new world♫

811
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:56,610
♫You've refined your dream and roots♫

812
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,970
♫Into passion♫

813
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:58,870
♫And put it over yourself♫

814
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,000
♫Without hesitation, you transmit it♫

815
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:04,510
♫Because of you, the earth under my feet♫

816
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:07,090
♫At every corner♫
