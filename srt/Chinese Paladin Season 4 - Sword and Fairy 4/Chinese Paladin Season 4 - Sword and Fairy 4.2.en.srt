[Episode 2]

4
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:47,550
It smells so good.

5
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,920
Eat up, woman.

6
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,150
Let me ask you.

7
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:54,960
Ordinary swords

8
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,910
are made of iron and copper.

9
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,080
If it was better,

10
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,550
black iron or black gold.

11
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,770
But your sword is neither gold nor jade.

12
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:07,720
I can't tell what material it's made of.

13
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,400
Did your father tell you

14
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,140
what its name was?

15
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,130
This is A Sword.

16
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,260
I know. I'm asking for its name.

17
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,370
This is A Sword.

18
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,890
Are you playing dumb or are you really stupid?

19
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,290
I'm asking for its name.

20
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:24,350
The name of this sword is "A Sword."

21
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,090
That's strange.

22
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,750
Your father gave it such a dumb name.

23
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,630
It's not dumb.

24
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,030
And my father didn't name it.

25
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,829
I did.

26
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,510
Dad, can you teach me some new sword moves?

27
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,430
I only practice these moves every day.

28
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,490
I can’t even defeat Little Pig Demon.

29
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,280
How can I, Yun Tianqing,

30
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:47,020
let others bully my son?

31
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,530
Use it to practice.

32
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,380
This is such an old sword.

33
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,500
Does it have a name?

34
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:56,640
You are the owner. You name it.

35
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,100
I named it A Sword.

36
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,910
It's simple and easy to remember.

37
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,830
For example,

38
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,580
my name is Yun Tianhe today.

39
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,930
I can also call myself Yun Ahsan tomorrow.

40
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,400
But it's still me.

41
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:08,820
This sword is the same.

42
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,930
Your father is definitely not a Sword Immortal.

43
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,190
He's a weirdo like you.

44
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,030
Woman.

45
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,110
Don't speak ill of my father.

46
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,960
I can't stand it anymore.

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,430
Can you stop calling me that?

48
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,310
Men and women are just genders.

49
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,710
It can't replace a name.

50
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,700
My name is Han Lingsha.

51
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,710
You look like you're around my age.

52
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,190
Just call me Lingsha.

53
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,329
Ling... Lingsha?

54
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,710
Not Ling Lingsha.

55
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:36,590
Just Lingsha.

56
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,310
Lingsha.

57
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,290
You said your name was Yun Tianhe, right?

58
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:42,950
Yes.

59
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:44,810
Then I'll call you Tianhe.

60
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,540
What do you think?

61
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:00,920
When someone calls you by your name, you need to answer them.
It's a courtesy.

62
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:03,750
Lingsha.

63
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,490
Can you call me again?

64
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:07,910
Yun Tianhe.

65
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,430
No, don't include the first word.

66
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,690
Then... Tianhe.

67
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,280
My father used to call me Tianhe too.

68
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,210
But after he left,

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,150
I never heard anyone

70
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,380
call me Tianhe again.

71
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:41,250
Alright.

72
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:43,430
Tianhe.

73
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,570
Tianhe.

74
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:46,960
Tianhe.

75
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:48,430
If you are

76
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,920
willing to give me this sword,

77
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,640
I can call you Tianhe many times.

78
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,870
As long as you can stay at Qingluan Peak,

79
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,570
I'll give A Sword to you.

80
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:15,510
Why do I feel dizzy again?

81
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,310
What's wrong?

82
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:17,800
I feel dizzy.

83
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,230
It must be because your hand is still wounded.

84
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,690
That's why you feel dizzy.

85
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:24,760
Follow me.

86
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,410
Where are we going?

87
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,150
Junior,

88
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,130
that woman hurt you so much,

89
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,400
but you just couldn't let her go.

90
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,720
Unfortunately,

91
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,350
the two of you

92
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,390
will never meet again.

93
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,150
Raise your head.

94
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,630
[Xuan Ying]

95
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,590
Tell me.

96
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,730
If my stubborn junior

97
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,040
knew that the woman was dead,

98
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,230
what kind of expression would he make?

99
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,050
I don't know.

100
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,430
I only know that

101
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,610
anyone who hurts my master

102
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,610
must be killed.

103
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,510
Then tell me,

104
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,060
am I qualified to take this jade?

105
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,220
I...

106
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:52,840
Don't know.

107
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,290
You don't know?

108
00:06:58,990 --> 00:06:59,950
All these years,

109
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,420
why doesn't he understand me?

110
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,750
As long as it makes you happy, Master.

111
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,430
Actually,

112
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,400
it's good that your parents left you here

113
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,460
to live on your own.

114
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,440
Although you've never seen the outside world,

115
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,070
you don't have so many things to worry about.

116
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:37,520
My father said that life is unpredictable.

117
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,659
The most important thing is to be happy and free.

118
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,200
One should live and die without regret.

119
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,640
In my life,

120
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,730
I'm destined to not have that kind of happiness and freedom.

121
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:53,920
My life depends on me,

122
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,140
not heaven.

123
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,070
Father.

124
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:23,060
Didn't you always forbid me to bother Mother?

125
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,020
Because today,

126
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,710
your mother and I

127
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,710
will be buried together.

128
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,470
I don't want you to leave me.

129
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:34,890
If you leave me,

130
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,720
I'll be the only one left.

131
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,230
Help me protect

132
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:48,820
Qingluan Peak, where humans and demons can live together.

133
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,350
Guard the Shichengxi Cave.

134
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,080
Don’t let outsiders in.

135
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,400
I got it.

136
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,470
Father.

137
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,310
Father!

138
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,720
Don't go!

139
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:06,660
Father!

140
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,310
Lingsha.

141
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:33,980
Why am I still dizzy?

142
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:49,870
A murderous aura.

143
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,510
Stop!

144
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,930
This is Qingluan Peak's holy ground, you can't enter.

145
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,300
Demon. Prepare to die!

146
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:01,530
Who are you?

147
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,110
How dare you speak wildly here?

148
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,800
If you're a demon, you must die.

149
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,050
They look like cultivators.

150
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,070
If you are a human,

151
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,090
get lost immediately.

152
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,290
My father said that

153
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,900
In Qingluan Peak, humans and demons are equal.

154
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,830
You're the ones who deserve to die.

155
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,670
Your father is Yun Tianqing?

156
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,390
You know my father?

157
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,470
Give me the Wangshu Sword

158
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,940
and I'll spare your life.

159
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,110
Wangshu Sword?

160
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:32,870
Wangshu Sword...

161
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,590
I don't have this Wangshu Sword you speak of.

162
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,030
But I can show you

163
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,740
how good my archery is.

164
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,190
I have not lost

165
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:50,230
a single fight in this mountain.

166
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,150
Tianhe!

167
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:28,740
Lingsha!

168
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,160
Your sword!

169
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,460
Be careful!

170
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,970
Master, this is...

171
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,220
This is the Wangshu Sword.

172
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,500
Form the formation.

173
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:52,700
Tianhe!

174
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,350
Lingsha!

175
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,150
Father!

176
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:56,890
Be careful!

177
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,150
Father!

178
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:08,960
Big Pig Demon!

179
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,160
Father!

180
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,320
Father.

181
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:17,690
Father.

182
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:20,020
Father, don't scare me.

183
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,840
Big Pig Demon.

184
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,120
Father, don't scare me.

185
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:34,550
Dajiu!

186
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,000
You leave first.

187
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,710
I have a way to deal with them.

188
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:41,550
You brat.

189
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,600
Give me the Wangshu Sword and I'll spare your life.

190
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,720
But I don't want to spare you.

191
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,680
Between Heaven and Earth,

192
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,030
the Dao lives eternally.

193
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,440
Ascending heaven and reaching earth,

194
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,370
forms shift, and spirits connect.

195
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:05,590
The Wangshu Sword will be the core of the formation.

196
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,300
What a powerful spiritual energy.

197
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,820
It's the Qionghua formation. Retreat!

198
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:29,270
Father!

199
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,430
Don't scare me, Father.

200
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,640
Hang in there. I'll get you some herbs.

201
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:36,810
Kid.

202
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,720
I can't

203
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:44,670
fulfill your father's wish.

204
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,160
His wish?

205
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,660
Cultivator, why did you build a barrier here?

206
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,010
Humans and demons should coexist.

207
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,510
The only thing I can do

208
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,650
is to keep this land safe for you.

209
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:06,490
Once I leave,

210
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,440
this barrier can protect you.

211
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:10,910
Leave?

212
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:12,710
Where are you going?

213
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:16,610
I'm a mortal. I'll die eventually.

214
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,160
I have a favor to ask.

215
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,160
Keep an eye on my son.

216
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,400
Don’t let him leave Qingluan Peak.

217
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,900
He's a human, not a demon.

218
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,720
Why won't you let him leave?

219
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:34,090
Tianhe is extraordinary.

220
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,840
He has the strongest power in the world.

221
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,530
But he doesn't know it yet.

222
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,730
I'm worried that he will be used by people

223
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,130
with ill intentions once he leaves the mountain.

224
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,770
If that happens, it will cause chaos

225
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:45,700
and bring suffering to the people.

226
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,530
Kid,

227
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:56,000
you must remember what your father said.

228
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:01,230
Father!

229
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:01,990
Big Pig Demon.

230
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:02,790
Father!

231
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:05,250
Big Pig Demon!

232
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,130
Father!

233
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,820
Father! Father!

234
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,510
Where did you go, Father?

235
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:15,820
Father!

236
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,200
I want to avenge my father!

237
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,230
Little Pig Demon!

238
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:30,570
Little Pig Demon!

239
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,510
We are leaving Qingluan Peak at this rate.

240
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,110
Did Little Pig Demon run out?

241
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,420
My father said

242
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,450
my mother told him that

243
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:44,850
life and death are one's choices to make.

244
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:47,910
This choice cannot be buried by the earth or altered by heaven.

245
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:51,110
That is the meaning of "My life depends on me, not heaven."

246
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,060
Little Pig Demon’s life

247
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,250
depends on itself too.

248
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,280
There is unrest in Mount Kong.

249
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,070
It must be caused by the sword aura of Wangshu Sword.

250
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:15,070
I've been searching for it for 19 years.

251
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:17,470
Now, I have finally found its whereabouts.

252
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,150
I don't want Ziying to get involved in this.

253
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,280
Go now

254
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,750
and get the Wangshu Sword before he does.

255
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,010
Also,

256
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,490
his cultivation is above you.

257
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,390
Don't let him see you.

258
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,660
Yes, Master.

259
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:14,910
Lingsha.

260
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:29,220
In the end, Lingsha still left.

261
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:34,930
I want to go with you.

262
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:45,190
Father.

263
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,820
Han Lingsha...

264
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,300
Since that wild man can wield the Wangshu Sword just fine,

265
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,960
I'll let him be the human scabbard

266
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,690
and leave the mountain with me.

267
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,620
That wild man sleeps so much.

268
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,800
Lingsha!

269
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:26,230
Why did you take my father's memorial tablet

270
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,280
and my mother's stone?

271
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,320
Behind you...

272
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:28,910
What?

273
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:29,640
Behind you.

274
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,690
Behind what?

275
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,050
Not behind me!

276
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,110
This...

277
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,250
You again?

278
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:37,000
Can't you stop?

279
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,740
The Three Talents Chaoyuan Formation.

280
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,790
Heaven and Earth Sword Energy.

281
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,190
Three talents combined.

282
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:44,510
Execute!

283
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:53,190
Lingsha.

284
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,260
They've gotten stronger.

285
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:55,860
Go!

286
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:56,540
No.

287
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,240
I have to take you with me.

288
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,750
It's indeed the Wangshu Sword.

289
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,060
Master, how could this happen?

290
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,500
I don't think you can take this sword.

291
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,030
Don't bother snatching it.

292
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,080
With the Chiyun Sword Case,

293
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,520
I'm not afraid of the Wangshu Sword.

294
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,480
How's that? Now you have no case.

295
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:54,590
Kill them!

296
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:25,810
Such amazing swordsmanship.

297
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,120
What a handsome Sword Immortal.

298
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,690
This is the secret formation of the Qionghua Sect.

299
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,850
[Murong Ziying]

300
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,330
How did you two learn it?

301
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,570
Since you don't know what transpired,

302
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:43,640
you best not interfere, my friend.

303
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,470
Friend?

304
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,750
These two are obviously not good people.

305
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,070
How could this handsome Sword Immortal

306
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:48,870
be friends

307
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:50,030
with them?

308
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,480
He means they are fellow Taoist disciples who cultivate together.

309
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,160
Besides,

310
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,030
accomplices don't group themselves according to appearance.

311
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,590
If the three of them fight us together,

312
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,990
it'll be terrible for us.

313
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,700
Misty rain distraction!

314
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,960
The Qionghua swordsmanship is for eliminating demons and defending justice.

315
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,160
How can you put it to such insulting use?

316
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:25,900
Are they really

317
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,950
from the Qionghua Sect?

318
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,760
This won't do.

319
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,790
Where are you going?

320
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:39,990
I'm going to ask them

321
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,980
why they want my father's sword.

322
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:42,430
Also,

323
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:45,350
why is this sword called Wangshu Sword?

324
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,590
Could it be that it looks comfortable?

325
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,950
You stupid wild man, what time is it?

326
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,690
Why are you still asking about this when your life is in danger?

327
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:51,690
Let's go, come on.

328
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:52,520
Let's go.

329
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:54,390
What now?

330
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:55,790
Lingsha.

331
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,260
Why did you

332
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,350
take my father's memorial tablet

333
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,610
and my mother's stone?

334
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,260
I'm protecting all of you.

335
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:05,950
Protecting us?

336
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:08,990
Those two bad guys

337
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:10,510
must want to take your father's sword

338
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,790
and kill you after that.

339
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:12,900
Of course, they'll also destroy

340
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,130
your father's memorial tablet and your mother's stone.

341
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,190
-So...
-Thank you.

342
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:17,860
Lingsha.

343
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,470
So, leave the mountain with me.

344
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,220
Leave the mountain?

345
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,880
But you heard my father's wish.

346
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,190
He also said

347
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:32,850
my physique is abnormal.

348
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,330
If I leave the mountain and get used by bad guys,

349
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,240
I'll be doomed.

350
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,480
But I'm a good person.

351
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,550
How could I

352
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,750
let the bad guys use you for their gains?

353
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,940
But if I leave,

354
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,350
no one will protect Qingluan Peak.

355
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,230
Listen.

356
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,840
You will suffer if you continue to stay at Qingluan Peak.

357
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,250
As long as this sword is in Qingluan Peak,

358
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,290
bad people will continue to come here.

359
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,010
You won't protect

360
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:56,710
Qingluan Peak by staying here.

361
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:57,840
Neither can you protect your father's sword.

362
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,950
Why is this sword

363
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:01,410
attracting so much trouble?

364
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:02,830
Why do so many people

365
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:03,990
want this sword?

366
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,220
So you see,

367
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,390
to achieve our ultimate goal,

368
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:08,110
we have to leave Qingluan Peak.

369
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,190
You need to know what your parents

370
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,390
had experienced in the past

371
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,550
to know the truth.

372
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,770
Dajiu, don't be sad.

373
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:37,580
When I find out the truth,

374
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:40,190
I'll return and help you hatch your egg.

375
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:49,630
Here.

376
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,300
Take your parents' stuff.

377
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,350
Let's go.

378
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:58,870
Dajiu!

379
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,240
Take care of the house.

380
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:13,280
[Taiping Village at the foot of Mount Huang]

381
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:14,270
Herbal tea.

382
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:15,550
Herbal tea.

383
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:16,470
Listen.

384
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:18,200
The mountain is your territory.

385
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,790
But you have to listen to me now that you're here.

386
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:21,780
There are even chickens.

387
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,510
Have you never seen one before?

388
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:36,740
It's so sweet. It's delicious.

389
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:38,990
This costs money.

390
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,850
Outside the mountain, if you take things without paying or asking,

391
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:42,380
it's considered stealing.

392
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,640
Can you listen to me?

393
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:51,390
Yes.

394
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:53,330
I already bought the melon.

395
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:53,840
Take it.

396
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,640
I sense a murderous aura.

397
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:05,360
It's gone again.

398
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,150
I think that's just your dumb aura.

399
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:08,900
Take your melon, let's go.

400
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,250
All kinds of masks.

401
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,010
Come and take a look.

402
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,310
Come and take a look.

403
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:21,140
Men, women, kids, and elderly. We have it all.

404
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:21,920
Take a look.

405
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,780
Lingsha, look.

406
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,530
-So many faces!
-Please have a look.

407
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:26,220
These are not faces. They are masks.

408
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:26,690
Yes.

409
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,410
Every Dragon Boat Festival in Taiping Village,

410
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:30,870
there is an evil-purging mask performance.

411
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,400
Take a look at this.

412
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,700
This is called a vagrant mask.

413
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,080
It's only sold in Taiping Village.

414
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,010
It suits you the best.

415
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:37,050
A vagrant mask?

416
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:39,690
Look, Lingsha.

417
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,000
What do you think?

418
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,130
It does suit you.

419
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,070
Buy one.

420
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,130
Something smells good.

421
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,340
Hey, don't wander off!

422
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,270
Here you go.

423
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:50,010
-Okay.
-Wait!

424
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:51,210
Thank you. Take care.

425
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,500
Did you forget everything I told you?

426
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,120
Did you forget everything?

427
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:03,110
No.

428
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:03,860
Well...

429
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:05,550
Lingsha.

430
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,400
When I'm hungry,

431
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,790
my brain doesn't work.

432
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,920
Boss, a bowl of porridge.

433
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,230
And one...

434
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,570
Three servings of lotus cakes.

435
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:19,370
Okay.

436
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,360
Here, three servings of lotus cakes.

437
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,760
Lingsha, you are so nice.

438
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:26,740
Ginkgo porridge with dates.

439
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,280
Have some too.

440
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,140
I'm not hungry.

441
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:30,610
How is it?

442
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:31,880
Try this.

443
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,900
This porridge is delicious.

444
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,330
Have some too.

445
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,260
It's okay.

446
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,370
I'm not hungry.

447
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,160
What's wrong?

448
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,110
Is there a worm?

449
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,600
I... I seem to have had this porridge before.

450
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,650
You have?

451
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:04,840
This ginkgo porridge with dates is only available in Taiping Village.

452
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,840
How could you have tasted it before?

453
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:10,310
It's true!

454
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:13,230
My father made this porridge for me when I was young.

455
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:14,760
It tasted exactly the same.

456
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:16,490
Could it be that

457
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:19,310
your father used to live in Taiping Village?

458
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,070
How about this?

459
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,600
I'll ask the village chief.

460
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,390
Who is the village chief?

461
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:25,110
The village chief is the leader of this place.

462
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,270
Since we plan to stay here,

463
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,170
we have to talk to him anyway.

464
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:27,650
Okay.

465
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:28,920
Go ask the village chief, then.

466
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,180
I'll wait for you here.

467
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:33,460
You really do become smarter after eating.

468
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,660
Be good and stay here.

469
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,720
Behave yourself.

470
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:37,870
I want to see you here when I come back.

471
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:38,350
I know.

472
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,780
Elder, I failed your request.

473
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,430
I couldn't retrieve the Wangshu Sword.

474
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:50,230
The sword box was destroyed too.

475
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:54,200
You're injured?

476
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:57,390
I was hurt by the Wangshu Sword's cold aura.

477
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:00,390
That's why he was able to strike back.

478
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:03,300
Elder, as far as I can see,

479
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,640
Yun Tianqing’s son is not afraid of this sword.

480
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,980
He can use the Wangshu Sword.

481
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:13,600
Could it be that the Wangshu sword has chosen him as its host?

482
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:14,270
Elder.

483
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:17,990
I saw Murong Ziying at Qingluan Peak.

484
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,920
Why did he go to Qingluan Peak?

485
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:23,290
Su Yao must have

486
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:26,510
secretly sent Murong Ziying to retrieve the sword.

487
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,990
Don't be targeted by Ziying.

488
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,030
When you get better,

489
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,250
bring this Yun kid to me immediately.

490
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:36,180
Understood.

491
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,380
Come pick some fresh vegetables.

492
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,530
They are very fresh.

493
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,100
Young man.

494
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:57,740
Young man.

495
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,010
Handsome Sword Immortal!

496
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:03,270
I remember you.

497
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:05,130
Your swordsmanship was amazing.

498
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,010
Why did those two try to kill you?

499
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:13,310
First, I'm not called Young Man.

500
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,990
My name is Yun Tianhe.

501
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:15,490
Second,

502
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:16,730
I know you're

503
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:17,710
a good person.

504
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,990
Because you don't have any murderous aura on you.

505
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:20,500
Third,

506
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,840
those two people in black robes...

507
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:23,890
Help me ask them

508
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:25,710
why they want my father's sword.

509
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,910
Can I take a look at the sword?

510
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:37,750
Sure.

511
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,090
If it's really that sword,

512
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,640
we can't let it fall into Qionghua Sect's hands.

513
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:50,360
No, wait.

514
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,290
Lingsha said

515
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,120
I can't show this sword to others casually.

516
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:58,550
However,

517
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,840
you're a good person,

518
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,150
and you helped us.

519
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:05,450
Let me show you secretly.

520
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:07,930
Show who secretly?

521
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,430
You don't even know his background,

522
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:14,800
and you're showing it to him?

523
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,320
I am...

524
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:18,920
There's a demonic aura.

525
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:21,550
I hate expressionless people

526
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,350
who pretend to be aloof like him.

527
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:24,910
Wild man.

528
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,940
Today is the Dragon Boat Festival. The ancestral hall is hosting a big opera show.

529
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:29,310
The village chief asked us to watch the opera.

530
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:30,630
Are you not angry anymore?

531
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:31,660
Why would I be angry?

532
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,450
Wait, what is an opera show?

533
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:34,760
An opera show is when

534
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:37,920
people sing, dance, and tell stories. It's very lively.

535
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,040
Fine, as long as you're not angry.

536
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,220
I'm not angry. Take your sword with you.

537
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,070
Take care.

538
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:04,390
[Qionghua Palace]

539
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,120
Grandmaster.

540
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,840
The day before yesterday, a blast of red flames was seen in the forbidden area

541
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,310
and a thunderous sword roar was heard.

542
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:12,250
[Su Xi]

543
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,220
Could it be...

544
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:12,900
That person?

545
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:14,830
That's right.

546
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,890
Xihe is resonating.

547
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:19,100
Xuan Xiao must be awake.

548
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:21,490
Great.

549
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:23,030
War is coming.

550
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,150
Now that Master Xuan Xiao is awake,

551
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,410
[Xu Yi]

552
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:27,000
heaven has truly blessed the Qionghua Sect.

553
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:28,600
Did Senior...

554
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,680
Did he...

555
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:32,920
Xuan Xiao is of sound mind.

556
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:34,660
From the looks of it,

557
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,000
he has no sign of turning demonic.

558
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,640
I failed to perform my duty.

559
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,180
Back then, you ordered me to look for the Wangshu Sword.

560
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:47,780
But now, 19 years of reincarnation are coming,

561
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:50,150
The host of Xihe Sword has awakened.

562
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:52,350
But I have yet to find the Wangshu Sword.

563
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,140
I, Xu Zhao, have let you

564
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:57,260
and the Qionghua Sect down.

565
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:59,930
You exaggerate, sect leader Xu Zhao.

566
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:02,490
But Xuan Xiao had just woken up.

567
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,220
His demonic energy has yet to be removed.

568
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,930
I'm worried that something might happen.

569
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:11,250
All four of you sect leaders should stay and guard the sect.

570
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:16,280
Understood.

571
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,380
Sect leader Xu Liang.

572
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,780
Have you found out the reason for the

573
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:29,990
Eight-Diagram Formation's abnormalities in Kong Mountain?

574
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,600
[Xu Liang]

575
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,510
Junior Ziying

576
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,370
has gone to Mount Kong to investigate.

577
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,150
Why don't I know about this?

578
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,400
None of you reported to me about this.

579
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,860
Do you still respect me as your grandmaster?

580
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:44,790
I'll go to Chenzhou right now to check on the formation.

581
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:54,280
So Murong Ziying wasn't dispatched by her?

582
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:30,650
It's starting.

583
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:32,520
Look at that.

584
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,850
He refused to study or get a proper job.

585
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,070
He deceived everyone, including his parents.

586
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,920
A hooligan at the foot of Mount Kong,

587
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:52,470
the bully of Taiping Village.

588
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:54,030
Nice!

589
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,410
Don't scare me!

590
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,820
Look, my mask is exactly like his.

591
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:01,770
What are they talking about?

592
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:02,870
They said

593
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:05,290
there was a bad guy in Taiping Village

594
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:08,550
who cheated and bullied his fellow villagers since young.

595
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:10,760
Nice!

596
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,120
He even beat an old man.

597
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,310
He's so bad.

598
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,909
How could he do that?

599
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:26,310
Who is this man, you ask?

600
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,690
The unfilial son and grandson, Yun Tianqing.

601
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:32,840
Bravo! Bravo!

602
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:36,510
Is he talking about my father's name?

603
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,030
We're not watching anymore. Let's go.

604
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:41,620
My father is Yun Tianqing.

605
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:43,260
You know him?

606
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:46,550
What? His father is Yun Tianqing?

607
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,340
Yes.

608
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,929
The mask opera about purging evil

609
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:52,380
was talking about your father.

610
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:55,219
The bastard, Yun Tianqing!

611
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:58,720
Nonsense!

612
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,090
My father...

613
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:02,200
How could he do such a thing?

614
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,330
Back then, your father

615
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:07,120
was a vicious bully.

616
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,000
He even made a scene in the ancestral ancestral temple.

617
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,350
That's why he was expelled from Taiping Village.

618
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:13,230
He is a sinner of our village.

619
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:16,000
The shame of the Yun family!

620
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,720
Shame! Shame! Shame!

621
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,080
You're hitting him now?

622
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:23,820
So you knew

623
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:25,510
Tianhe is Yun Tianqing’s son.

624
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,940
You put on this show on purpose, didn’t you?

625
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,940
I think you are the despicable ones.

626
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:31,550
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

627
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:32,740
He's a sinner! He's a sinner!

628
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:33,290
Shut up!

629
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,080
He is...

630
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,940
Who's making a scene?

631
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,900
Chief.

632
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:37,430
Tianhe.

633
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,630
Chief, you are the fairest.

634
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:41,040
Please be the judge.

635
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:43,310
Okay. I’ll be your judge.

636
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,010
Dear villagers,

637
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,310
everything the opera said is true.

638
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,170
I was the one who expelled Yun Tianqing

639
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:55,220
from Taiping Village forever.

640
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:57,170
You are his child.

641
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,910
You're not welcome here.

642
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,510
Be on your way.

643
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:01,810
Get out of here! Hurry!

644
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,740
Get out of here!

645
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,830
Get lost!

646
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:10,100
A heinous crime must be paid for by 9 generations.

647
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:13,610
The son of a bad guy couldn't possibly be a good person.

648
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,610
Yunhai, I’ve made up my mind.

649
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,310
Let them go.

650
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,230
It's not up to you.

651
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,640
None of you can leave today.

652
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,470
Hand over your sword and

653
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,290
I'll give you a quick death.

654
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:45,910
What person are you?

655
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,410
Why do you want my sword?

656
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:51,290
A person?

657
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:54,350
I hate you humans the most.

658
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,670
It's indeed the Wangshu Sword.

659
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:30,420
Lingsha.

660
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:42,370
Tianhe!

661
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:44,340
Lingsha.

662
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:47,930
Run!

663
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:49,310
She wants my sword.

664
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,190
I can't let her kill them.

665
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:52,980
Those villagers humiliated you.

666
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,510
You still want to save them?

667
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:04,800
Lingsha.

668
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,350
Lingsha.

669
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,850
Humans are the most hypocritical scum.

670
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,640
Today, I want to see

671
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:22,320
whether you are sincere.

672
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,320
I'll give you the sword.

673
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,590
Release Lingsha!

674
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,860
I've already told you.

675
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,800
Today,

676
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,520
I'll take the sword

677
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:43,940
and kill everyone.

678
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:45,830
No!

679
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,380
Lingsha!

680
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:58,660
Lingsha.

681
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,360
Lingsha.

682
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:04,620
What is your purpose

683
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,080
for wreaking havoc here?

684
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:07,130
You...

685
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,070
Feng Xie.

686
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:10,550
What did you do to Feng Xie?

687
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:13,370
Thank goodness you're okay.

688
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:14,900
If you dare to hurt Feng Xie,

689
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:16,910
I will tear you into pieces!

690
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:23,700
Sword!

691
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,630
She wants to steal my sword!

692
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,720
A purple crystal?

693
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:44,050
Don't get hurt by her scales.

694
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:47,190
Otherwise, your primordial spirit will be dispersed.

695
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,120
Lingsha!
