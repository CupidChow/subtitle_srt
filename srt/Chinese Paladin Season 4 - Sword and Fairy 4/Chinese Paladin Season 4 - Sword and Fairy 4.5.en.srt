[Episode 5]

4
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,120
Just now, Miss Han, Mr. Yun, and I

5
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:43,140
countered the invaders together.

6
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,789
Miss Han is decisive and brave.

7
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:46,500
If she can find

8
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,120
and save the missing people,

9
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,090
it can make up for her mistake.

10
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,610
I'll agree first.

11
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,700
Later, I can run off with the wild man.

12
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:54,840
Deal.

13
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,840
It's a deal.

14
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:57,750
Yes, Unc Liu.

15
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,910
I went to Nyuluo Cliff with Lingsha before.

16
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,990
The plants there were strange.

17
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,110
Anyway,

18
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,200
if we go,

19
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,460
not only can we save people,

20
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,460
but we might also save those plants.

21
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:09,740
That's inappropriate.

22
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,910
What if you run into

23
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,150
demons or monsters?

24
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:13,910
Father,

25
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,340
I know some spells.

26
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,579
Besides, there are three of us.

27
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:19,990
I'm still worried.

28
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:21,630
Father,

29
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,500
this concerns my marriage.

30
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,430
You can also let me see

31
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:26,329
if Mr. Yun

32
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,490
is the person I want to be entrusted to.

33
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,390
Then, as my daughter wishes,

34
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,890
this lady can stay here temporarily.

35
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:45,360
Mr. Yun,

36
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,850
your bow was damaged in the illusion formation earlier.

37
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,630
It's fine.

38
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,180
Even without a bow, I still have my sword.

39
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:54,720
Miss Han,

40
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,510
come with me.

41
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:56,090
Okay.

42
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,300
Us girls are going to sleep. What are you doing?

43
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,950
I need to sleep too.

44
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:05,250
Let's go.

45
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,860
They'll arrange it for you.

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,600

where do you live?

51
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,990
How is your father?

00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,829
I...

53
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,030
Since I was a child, I've been wandering

54
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,829
and carefree.

55
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,270
Miss Han,

56
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,670
you can travel the world

57
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:36,470
and live according to your own wishes.

58
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,550
I envy you.

59
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,070
I envy you too.

60
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,950
You have a complete family and your parents are loving.

61
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,810
Not everyone is blessed like you.

62
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:47,970
Lord, Madam.

63
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,230
Mr. Yun is here.

64
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,200
As expected, clothes make the man.

65
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,700
After putting on these clothes,

66
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,560
you really have the looks of a hero like your father.

67
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,430
Really?

68
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,269
I've never worn this kind of clothing before.

69
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,430

00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,750

71
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,510
No, no, no.

72
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,270
You always wore fur

73
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,190
like a wild man.

74
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,430
Now that you've become a gentleman,

75
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,990
what's wrong with taking a second glance?

76
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:32,720
I can't look?

77
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,520
You can.

Alright.

There are so many dishes for breakfast.

85
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:48,280
Okay.

86

88
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,510
I know you like light food.

This is osmanthus porridge specially made for you.

90

This morning, I had Pei Jian

94
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,880
buy this from Wang Xiao'er's dessert shop.

95

It's time to eat.

103
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,810
I'll eat first.

104

Why aren't you eating, Lingsha?

105
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,560
I'm eating.

106
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,120
Why are your eyes teary?

107
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,320
What's wrong?

108
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,350
Don't talk nonsense.

109
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:01,910
It's nothing.

110
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:02,660
I'm happy.

111
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,800
Miss Han,

112
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,510
I don't have siblings.

113
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,140
Just treat this as your own home.

114
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,500
Yes, Miss Han.

115
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,430
It's not easy for you to wander alone.

116
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,860
Next time you come to Shouyang,

117
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:14,700
come here.

118
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,380
Lord, what do you think?

119
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,010
You are all right.

120
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:18,890
Yes.

121
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,100
Thank you, Lord Liu.

00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:20,980
Madam Liu,

123
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:21,920
and Miss Liu.

124
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,150
Unc Liu, Ant Liu,

125
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:27,550
you're so nice.

126
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,180
It's Uncle Liu, Aunt Liu.

127

Uncle Liu, Aunt Liu.

128
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:34,290
Uncle.

129
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,820
Unc and Uncle are both fine.

130
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:42,470
Eat.

131
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,760
You're going to Nyuluo Cliff today.

132
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:48,720
I've sent Pei Jian to investigate.

133
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,400
If there's any danger,

134
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,280
just run away.

135
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,740
Don't worry, Uncle Liu.

136
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,340
I will take good care of them.

137
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:58,550
Come on.

138
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:59,560
Come eat.

139
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:00,320
Eat.

140
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,350
This is Pei's horse.

141
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,310
Pei should be inside.

142
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,850
The people who went missing recently

143
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,090
were all at the entrance of the Tomb of Prince Yunan.

144
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,280
We should be able to find him

145
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,610
by going down this path.

146
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,580
We're already at Nyuluo Cliff.

147
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,640
Why haven't we seen Uncle Ziying yet?

148
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:35,590
Senior,

149
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,340
look.

150
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,020
What a beautiful girl!

Lingsha.

152
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,920
look at the patterns on their token.

153
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,450
They're exactly the same as Senior Ziying's.

154
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,820
You've seen Uncle Ziying?

155
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:48,310
Yes.

156
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:49,990
No.

157
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,990
Senior Ziying is at the same age as you.

158
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,640
Why do you call him Uncle?

159
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,770
Uncle Ziying has very high seniority.

160
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,470
Where did you meet him?

161
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,560
Watch your manners.

162
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,450
Why do you all speak the same way?

163
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,190
Even if I knew where that Ice Cube was,

164
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:05,910
I wouldn't tell you.

165
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,230
You rude girl.

166
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,110
How could you say that?

167
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,350
-How dare you say my uncle is an Ice Cube?
-Xuanji!

168
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,870
-I’ve never seen your uncle.
-Xuanji.

169
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:11,830
You started it.

170
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:15,750
Everyone,

171
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,940
my junior Xuanji is young and immature.

172
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,070
Please forgive her.

173
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,070
I'm Huaishuo, a disciple of Qionghua Sect.

174
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,890
[Huaishuo]

175
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,350
If you have seen our uncle,

176
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,400
please tell us.

177
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:25,790
Qionghua?

178
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,230
You're from the Qionghua Sect?

179
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:27,860
Yes.

180
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,490
Qionghua is very famous.

181
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,720
Fairy, you must have heard of it before.

182
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,669
Stop pretending to be friendly.

183
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:35,110
-I’m not.
-We haven’t seen your uncle.

184
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,240
What's wrong, miss?

185
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:38,010
The three of us have been together the whole time.

186
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,830
We haven't seen the Uncle Ziying

187
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,000
that you mentioned.

188
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:42,929
Alright.

189
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,750
You don't look like you're lying,

190
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,790
so I believe you.

191
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:46,450
Senior,

192
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,230
let's hurry and look elsewhere.

193
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:48,750
Okay.

194
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:51,550
You...

195
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,060
How is it?

196
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,410
You're from the Qionghua Sect?

197
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,630
I think you're from the annoying sect.

198
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,410
Annoying sect!

199
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:55,990
Lingsha,

200
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:56,950
ignore her. She's crazy.

201
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:57,510
Let's go too.

202
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:57,950
Ignore them.

203
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:58,390
Let's go.

204
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,030
So annoying.

205
00:08:59,030 --> 00:08:59,510
Okay.

206
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,520
Let's go.

207
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:06,910
Mengli,

208
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,190
a lady like you

209
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,850
probably hasn't taken so many mountains paths before.

210
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,190
Do you want to take a rest?

211
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,790
I often come to Nyuluo Cliff.

212
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,570
The lixiang herbs should be flourishing right now.

213
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,940
I don't know why they're so wilted.

214
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:20,510
The flourishing period?

215
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,990
The last time we came here,

216
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,990
I don't think they were so wilted.

217
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:24,870
Normally,

218
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,670
the plants near yin residences won't be very lush.

219
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,610
What is a yin residence?

220
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:33,950
They're like the Shichengxi Cave where your parents are buried.

221
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,190
The mountains here

222
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,510
have both the Green Dragon and White Tiger

223
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,390
of the four directions.

224
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,350
It can also guarantee that the feng shui point won't be attacked by external wind.

225
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,870
It would be great if it could

226
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,110
continue to form a pool.

227
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,340
The art of feng shui is very difficult.

228
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:48,270
For most people, it takes 10 to 20 years to partially master it.

229
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,730
Miss Han, you're amazing.

230
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:50,750
Mengli,

231
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,640
why does everything sound better when you say it?

232
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:57,070
What is the art of feng shui?

233
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,320
Can you teach me?

234
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,510
Mengli said

235
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,120
that most people

236
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,910
have to study for 10 to 20 years.

237
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:01,450
For you,

238
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,120
a wild man,

239
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,540
it'll take 30 to 50 years.

240
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,120
I...

241
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:06,190
I...

242
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,600
I'm not dumb.

243
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,000
Pei?

244
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,190
Pei?

245
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,710
Pei.

246
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,480
He doesn't have injuries.

247
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,490
Was he poisoned?

248
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,720
Why does he have such a dark pallor?

249
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,550
His pulse is rapid.

250
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,960
It must've been caused by the invasion of demonic aura.

251
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,830
Demonic aura?

252
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:28,990
Tianhe just said

253
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,120
that there was demonic aura nearby.

254
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,810
No.

255
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,920
The demonic aura last time wasn't murderous.

256
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,190
It couldn't have hurt anyone.

257
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,920
I'll used the Suhe Potion I made

258
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,850
to restore his energy as soon as possible.

259
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:39,110
He should wake up soon.

260
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,700
Pei—

261
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,140
Lingsha.

262
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:48,940
Miss Han.

263
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:53,340
Miss Han.

264
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:56,430
Lingsha!

265
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,340
Looks like Miss Han fell into this cave.

266
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,120
Lingsha.

267
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,190
Lingsha.

268
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,390
I'm very familiar with Nyuluo Cliff.

269
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,590
How come a hole opened up here suddenly?

270
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,340
Lingsha.

271
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:33,070
Lingsha, are you okay?

272
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,630
Say something.

273
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:37,400
Lingsha.

274
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:38,090
Mr. Yun,

275
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,140
don't worry.

276
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,830
Miss Han is just unconscious.

277
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,880
She's unconscious?

278
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:56,850
You're awake.

279
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,770
Lingsha, you're awake.

280
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,880
You're okay!

281
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,620
Your shaking is about to make me unconscious again.

282
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,890
I think I was dragged down by something.

283
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:10,950
What about you two?

284
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,320
I think we were dragged down too.

285
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,640
Could it be

286
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,870
these vines?

287
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:20,630
What if this is the yin residence of the Prince Yunan?

288
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,890
We'll be in trouble if we disturb it.

289
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:22,780
Let's hurry up.

290
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:25,110
That old Yunan has been dead for thousands of years.

291
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,010
It'd be a feat for him to have a bone left.

292
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,660
Don't worry about disturbing him.

293
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,660
Let me take a look.

294
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,570
Look.

295
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,750
No need to discuss further.

296
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,360
This is the corridor of the Tomb of Prince Yunan.

297
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:44,920
Let’s go.

298
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,980
This is just a tomb of a marquis,

299
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,220
but it's so grand.

300
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,600
I wonder how many lives were lost to build it.

301
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,490
Wasting money and labor for a dead person

302
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,250
is too...

303
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,860
Too bastardly.

304
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,910
It feels better to let out the insults for these things.

305
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:08,550
Try it.

306
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:09,270
Insult him.

307
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,130
Such a bastard.

308
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,250
Such a bastard.

309
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:11,940
Do it like him.

310
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:12,800
Such a bastard.

311
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,950
That's right. Insult him.

312
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:14,560
Such...

313
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:15,530
Such...

314
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,200
Such...

315
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:20,630
Such...

316
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:21,840
Such...

317
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,560
Fun.

318
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:27,840
That works.

319
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,790
Lingsha is better at insults.

320
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,180
Even if you insult someone,

321
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,910
it'll sound as pretty as a poem.

322
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,420
This place is a bit strange.

323
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,690
It's not a murderous aura,

324
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,040
but it just feels wrong for some reason.

325
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:55,130
Mount Bagong is a place of great feng shui.

326
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:57,490
After thousands of years of going from stone to wood,

327
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:59,730
then back from wood to stone,

328
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:02,100
it's like a mortal transforming completely.

329
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,780
It's a great omen.

330
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,490
Let's go. Trust me, I'm an expert.

331
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:09,350
Let's go.

332
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,590
Lingsha is amazing.

333
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,600
I don't understand a word she said.

334
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:22,820
Miss Han,

335
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,980
When searching for treasures,

336
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,250
did you ever encounter hauntings

337
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,970
that people often mention?

338
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,350
My father said

339
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,100
that so-called hauntings

340
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,870
are just a traps put in

341
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:35,200
during the construction of the tombs.

342
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,080
Traps?

343
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:39,150
Like what my father set?

344
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:40,730
Kui Zhao is really scary.

345
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,190
Not really.

346
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,930
Throughout my life, I've only heard my uncle say

347
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,400
that the strangest tomb pass in the world

348
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,730
is the recurring realm.

349
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,260
It traps mortals inside and return to the starting point,

350
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,350
repeating until they don't know whether they're alive or dead.

351
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,110
Humans fear death the most,

352
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:56,960
let alone

353
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,530
this experience of recurring life and death.

354
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,150
We've been walking north.

355
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:03,950
No,

356
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,110
we were just here.

357
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:11,690
Why do I feel that we've been walking around,

358
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,980
but this place has never changed?

359
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:17,690
You just said the recurring realm

360
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,400
repeats without knowing

361
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,910
if one is alive or dead.

362
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,640
No, that's impossible.

363
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,950
That's just a myth.

364
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:28,950
It's an upward needle.

365
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:31,070
An upward needle, yin aura enters, friendly yin protects.

366
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:31,990
What does that mean?

367
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:32,750
It means

368
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,040
that even though yin aura has entered the body,

369
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,100
it's friendly yin.

370
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,670
Maybe it's a deceased ancestor

371
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,990
or a God of Fortune guarding us.

372
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:43,610
Woman?

373
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,870
Why are you calling me "woman" again?

374
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,120
What's going on?

375
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,040
Was this a human, a demon, or a so-called ghost?

376
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,480
I...

377
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,040
My compass can't be wrong.

378
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,760
Maybe she is a Goddess of Fortune.

379
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,290
No matter what she is,

380
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:08,320
she's not a living human.

381
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,360
Let's go out.

382
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,200
The compass is normal now.

383
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:15,230
My guess is

384
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,500
that she's guiding us.

385
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:19,800
Let's go.

386
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:45,840
Miss.

387
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:49,830
Mr. Yun.

388
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,630
Miss.

389
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,040
Is Yun Tianhe the Mr. Yun that you're looking for?

390
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:57,720
Yes,

391
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,390
and also my lady.

392
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,750
Have you seen them?

393
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,640
Why are they here?

394
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:03,910
Recently,

395
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:06,270
people have gone missing at Nyuluo Yan

396
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,550
and the plants are abnormal too.

397
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:09,589
My lady

398
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,460
brought Miss Han and Mr. Yun here

399
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,490
to investigate.

400
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:16,020
After I woke up, I saw my lady's handkerchief,

401
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,430
but I couldn't find them.

402
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:20,010
You were possessed by demonic aura.

403
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,680
Possessed by demonic aura?

404
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,150
I only remember

405
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,520
I suddenly lost consciousness

406
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,570
near the Tomb of Prince Yunan.

407
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,630
Tomb of Prince Yunan.

408
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:32,920
You stay here.

409
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I'll go find them.

410
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:45,820
Take it easy.

411
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,990
How come all the lights turned on?

412
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,180
What is that?

413
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,570
It looks so scary.

414
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,530
This is a talisman beast.

415
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:08,780
They're connected to each other.

416
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,110
Once you light one lamp,

417
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,790
all the lamps will be illuminated.

418
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:15,790
This mechanism only existed in the royal tombs of the previous dynasty.

419
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,730
These lamps have been here for so long.

420
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,530
How long can they last?

421
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,310
My father said

422
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:27,430
that long-lasting lantern oil is made by a secret technique.

423
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,670
After being lit, it won't be extinguished for millenniums.

424
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:32,070
But this old Yunan was actually just a duke.

425
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,640
He could use so many treasures,

426
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,700
so he was probably not a great person.

427
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:38,670
This old Yunan was quite interesting.

428
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:41,030
He had so many people to hold up lamps for him.

429
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,510
These are tomb statues.

430
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,920
He made statues of his officials and generals

431
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,680
when he was alive

432
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:47,980
and placed them here to guard his tomb.

433
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,670
However, the point is

434
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:52,150
that these should be on the deity path outside the tomb,

435
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:53,270
instead of inside.

436
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,310
I heard that

437
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:57,910
he was rich, but he was obsessed with magic.

438
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,630
He found many ways to cultivate the immortality pills.

439
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:03,530
Maybe that's why he brought in the people he thought were immortals

440
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:04,660
to keep him company.

441
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:07,370
Behind you.

442
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,220
At midnight,

443
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:16,690
the prince dreamed of the heavens above.

444
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,880
A rooster crowed at sunrise.

445
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,310
Purple smoke soared from the furnace.

446
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,110
Use the Crimson Jade Flask

447
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,670
and the Daoxianxia Pill is formed.

448
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,030
The Daoxianxia Pill?

449
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,550
Could the Daoxianxia Pill

450
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:34,210
be the elixir of immortality?

451
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,620
Then who is the one in this tomb?

452
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:44,100
The ground is littered with yellowed flowers.

453
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:48,660
-Who pities it now?
-It’s her again.

454
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,160
What is she talking about?

455
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,100
Her voice sounds quite sad.

456
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,450
If she is a Goddess of Fortune,

457
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,590
why is her voice full of sadness?

458
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,630
Let's not move forward.

459
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,190
No matter what she is,

460
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:02,810
I must see

461
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,100
if the elixir of immortality is in there.

462
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,440
It’s okay, Mengli.

463
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,680
We can't leave Lingsha behind.

464
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,210
Let's go.

465
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,880
There's a powerful cold and evil aura here.

466
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,040
Look over there.

467
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:04,330
Be careful.

468
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,140
We are in an underground palace.

469
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:21,270
How can there such a strange scene?

470
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,550
They're all fresh.

471
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,270
Mr. Yun,

472
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:30,830
you cannot

473
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,180
randomly touch things in these places.

474
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:34,410
Got it.

475
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,570
I'm just looking.

476
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,090
This is a true treasure.

477
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:42,340
Lingsha, slow down.

478
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,080
Isn't this just a pair of toads?

479
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:48,310
These two toads

480
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:50,930
correspond to Red Jade and Yellow Jade,

481
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,630
which further correspond to

482
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,220
the Red Aura God of the Sun

483
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,870
and the Yellow Aura Goddess of the Moon.

484
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,910
This coincides with the saying in immortal stories

485
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:02,170
about harmonious yin yang and the man and heaven being one.

486
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,030
Could this be...

487
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:15,830
It's the Yin Yang Jade.

488
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,880
Yin Yang Jade?

489
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,360
My father talked about them before.

490
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,020
The Yin Yang Jade can be eaten.

491
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,160
You'll become stronger after eating it.

492
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,230
That's half right.

493
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:26,940
The Yin Yang Jade

494
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,950
is split into the yin and yang halves. They grow underground.

495
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,770
The jade forms after thousands of years.

496
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:33,010
It's already a treasure after digging it out now.

497
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:34,010
But this is jade.

498
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,510
How can you eat it?

499
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:36,670
Well,

500
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:38,070
that's the magical part.

501
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,240
If the Yin Yang Jade isn't dug out

502
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:42,230
after turning into jade,

503
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,510
the jade will come to life after thousands more years.

504
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,660
You'll get limitless spiritual power by eating it.

505
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,650
However, after it comes to life,

506
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,790
the yin and yang halves will run separately,

507
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,620
so it's hard to find them both.

508
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,180
I didn't expect

509
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:56,820
that such creatures would be in the Tomb of Prince Yunan.

510
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,880
What are you doing?

511
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:02,660
Aren't you always dizzy and weak?

512
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:03,970
I'll take these out

513
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,310
and bury them somewhere.

514
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,240
After they come to life,

515
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,040
I'll get them so you can eat them.

516
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:09,630
Silly.

517
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,080
How can I live that long?

518
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:13,990
It'll already be a feat to live for a few decades.

519
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:14,730
A feat?

520
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:17,950
Nothing.

521
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,100
Lingsha.

522
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:10,660
I've never seen

523
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,880
so many fairies dance together before.

524
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:19,570
They are amazing.

525
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,320
They must be the fairies

526
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:23,310
that became immortal with Prince Yunan.

527
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,950
There must be an immortality pill.

528
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:25,880
Be careful.

529
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,620
These dancers are strange.

530
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:50,430
It's been a long time

531
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,830
since I've last seen mortals.

532
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:58,910
Lingsha.

533
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:01,210
Did you really cultivate the immortality pill and become an immortal?

534
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:03,790
My physical body has been dead for millenniums.

535
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:05,430
If I didn't become an immortal,

536
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:08,310
how could my tomb be like heaven?

537
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:12,010
This is my immortal residence in the mortal world.

538
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,510
Since this is your immortal residence,

539
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:15,590
then have you seen

540
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:19,110
the farmers who've gone missing from Nyuluo Cliff recently?

541
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,480
Since I've become an immortal,

542
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,540
mortals

543
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:26,560
need hundreds of years of luck to meet me.

544
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:28,150
Evidently, you three

545
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,820
are fated with me.

546
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,750
My father was also a cultivator,

547
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,630
but he said

548
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,160
that immortals are all in the sky.

549
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:39,910
Why are you underground?

550
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:41,550
Your father?

551
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:44,370
Who is your father?

552
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:45,970
Yun Tianqing.

553
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:52,080
No wonder you are fated.

554
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:55,480
You are the son of my immortal friend.

555
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:57,400
Good.

556
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,420
Immortal friend?

557
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:00,750
Did Uncle Yun become an immortal too?

558
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,590
Yes.

559
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:03,670
Tianqing

560
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:05,610
has become an immortal.

561
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:07,830
What about my mother?

562
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,190
Did my mother become an immortal with him?

563
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:12,750
They both achieved completion

564
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:15,460
and became my immortal friends.

565
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:19,790
Your mother often talks about you.

566
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,510
Then, did they tell you that I burn incense

567
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:24,350
for their tablets every day?

568
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,390
Of course.

569
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,930
Your mother is very pleased

570
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:29,780
to have a filial son like you.

571
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,560
A memorial tablet hasn't been set for your mother for years.

572
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,960
This was what she wanted.

573
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,570
We shouldn't disobey her.

574
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:38,870
Prince Yunan,

575
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,470
do you still have more immortality pills?

576
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,770
I will definitely

577
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,580
bestow liquid jade wine upon those

578
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:48,820
fated to meet me in my immortal residence.

579
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:52,640
Drink it and you'll live forever.

580
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,410
Lingsha,

581
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,360
you can't drink it.

582
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,430
Didn't you hear?

583
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,220
It can make you immortal.

584
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,920
Lingsha,

585
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,100
he's lying.

586
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,230
After my mother passed away,

587
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,730
she didn't allow my father to set up any memorial tablet.

588
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:22,790
You can’t drink it.

589
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:27,570
As expected of Yun Tianqing's son.

590
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,510
However, why are you

591
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:33,310
stopping others from ascending to immortality?

592
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,280
I don't know what you're up to.

593
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,350
Lingsha.

594
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:40,050
You saw it.

595
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,600
A mortal's desire for immortality

596
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,400
is a greed that can't be stopped.

597
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,070
You can't stop it.

598
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:54,200
Give me the wine.

599
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,310
I want to live forever.

600
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:55,840
Lingsha.

601
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:57,010
-I want the immortality pill.
-Lingsha, what's wrong?

602
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:58,440
-I want immortality.
-Lingsha!

603
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,760
-You stinky old man!
-Lingsha.

604
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,000
What did you give her?

605
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,920
She was entangled by her own inner greed.

606
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:07,550
She brought it upon herself.

607
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,670
They are indeed in this tomb.

608
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:34,280
I serve heaven and earth. Shatter the door to the depths of hell.

609
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:34,990
Enter!

610
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,920
Today, I will avenge Feng Xie.

611
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,760
It really is you, you demon.

612
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,810
Sword Transformation!

613
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,360
Karma.

614
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:27,750
Karma.

615
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,400
You think you can take revenge?

616
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:40,060
This person's life is mine.

617
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:15,550
How did this happen?

618
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,100
There's a murderous aura.

619
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,690
Lingsha, be careful.

620
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:41,570
Lingsha, look at us.

621
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,200
We are your friends.

622
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,190
Friends?

623
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:50,510
Why would my friends stop me from eating the immortality pill?

624
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:52,040
Lingsha, look carefully.

625
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,270
There are no immortality pills or residences here.

626
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:55,270
This is a tomb.

627
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,270
Liar.

628
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:04,590
Liu Mengli,

629
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:06,910
how come you can have a family,

630
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:09,710
a father, and a mother,

631
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:13,110
while I struggle to survive like an orphan?

632
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:15,160
I just want to live.

633
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:16,630
Am I wrong?

634
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:19,510
Lingsha,

635
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:21,490
we stopped you

636
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,480
because we wanted you to live.

637
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,740
Yun Tianhe, you're the biggest mistake!

638
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,730
If I didn't go to Qingluan Peak for the sword,

639
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:30,260
I wouldn't have had to deal with you until now.

640
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,340
But it's fine.

641
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:34,940
If I hadn't tricked you to come here,

642
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,780
I wouldn't have been able to enter an immortal residence

643
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,230
and get the immortality pill.

644
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:40,260
You tricked me?

645
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,710
How could you trick me?

646
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,740
If you stop me, all of you will die!

647
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:51,670
Kid,

648
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,240
how could you be so careless

649
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,100
and let evil aura enter your body?

650
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,750
I'd like to see

651
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:59,320
how much longer you can last for.

652
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:02,660
You colluded with Prince Yunan and went such lengths

653
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:04,190
just to kill me?

654
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,580
No.

655
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:07,930
You think too highly of yourself.

656
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:09,210
What I want to kill

657
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:11,510
are all the lowly humans.

658
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:13,850
I deceived that old Yunan

659
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,210
to lure you into the trap with his evil aura

660
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,550
and invade your body.

661
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:18,570
I'll kill you first

662
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:21,340
because I sent Feng Xie and Wen Yao to destroy the sword,

663
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,370
but you wanted to protect the sword.

664
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:26,370
You know the origin of the Wangshu Sword?

665
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:28,860
Didn't your grandmaster Zong Lian

666
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,720
tell you about the Wangshu Sword?

667
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,240
You know my grandmaster?

668
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:37,130
That shoddy box must be Zong Lian's, right?

669
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:39,510
Unfortunately, he was unlucky

670
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,500
and met me.

671
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,340
It was you.

672
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,630
You were the one who killed my grandmaster.

673
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:54,810
There were too many humans and demons who wanted to kill Zong Lian.

674
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:56,690
I just helped them

675
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,930
and let him die sooner.

676
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:02,010
Demon, die!

677
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,250
Thousand Afterglow Sword.

678
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,800
I'll let you die with closure today.

679
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,710
Evil aura is not all-pervasive.

680
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,600
The deeper your obsession is, the deeper the poison will be.

681
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,730
You're obsessed with killing demons.

682
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,540
The more you hate me, the more you want to kill me,

683
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,010
the weaker you will be.

684
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,750
Mr. Yun, she's possessed by evil aura.

685
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,180
She's no longer Lingsha.

686
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:00,390
If you can find her personal belonging,

687
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,850
it might help her regain her consciousness.

688
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:35,760
Lingsha, look.

689
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:41,710
Lingsha.

690
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:43,840
you never

691
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,250
took out this bracelet before.

692
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,920
It must be very important to you.

693
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,140
How dare you steal my soul stones?

694
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,750
Mr. Yun.

695
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:15,620
Woman,

696
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,280
I'm the wild man.

697
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,580
When we were at Qingluan Peak,

698
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,160
you said that your name was Lingsha.

699
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,230
I'm Han Lingsha.

700
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,420
You look to be around my age.

701
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,660
Just call me Lingsha.

702
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:34,760
Do you remember?

703
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:37,890
You told me

704
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,610
to follow you.

705
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,690
You said you were a good person.

706
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:46,350
My physique is abnormal.

707
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,920
If I go down the mountain and bad guys take advantage of me,

708
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,800
I'll be doomed.

709
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:49,910
I'm a good person.

710
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:53,140
How could I let you be taken advantage by bad guys?

711
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:54,990
Take your parents' things.

712
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:55,720
We're going.

713
00:36:58,910 --> 00:36:59,640
Lingsha.

714
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:05,550
If you want me to choose

715
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,270
between this sword and your life,

716
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:08,110
I choose you.

717
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,400
Lingsha,

718
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,280
it's me, Tianhe.

719
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:17,820
Wild man?

720
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:32,870
Mr. Yun.

721
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:34,100
Mr. Yun.

722
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,540
Mr. Yun.

723
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:47,580
I'm fine.

724
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:54,980
Why is this place different?

725
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:58,610
-Did I faint again?
-Lingsha.

726
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,380
Lingsha.

727
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:02,750
Miss Han.

728
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,920
Lingsha seems to have recovered.

729
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,230
You're injured?

730
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,130
Miss Han,

731
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,120
Mr. Yun put himself at risk

732
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,410
in order to wake you up.

733
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,430
It's fine. It's just a minor injury.

734
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:15,190
Besides,

735
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,130
the one who hurt me was the possessed Lingsha,

736
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:19,200
not you.

737
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:21,010
What?

738
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:22,920
What else did I do?

739
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:25,630
You...

740
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,230
You still have a sharp tongue,

741
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:28,740
even when you're possessed.

742
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,380
Just now,

743
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:32,360
you said that Mengli has a grudge against you.

744
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:33,800
You also said...

745
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,070
I...

746
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,940
You tricked me down the mountain

747
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,180
to steal my sword.

748
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,070
That's all nonsense that you said

749
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,120
while you were possessed.

750
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,200
We don't mind.

751
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:43,560
You don't have to worry.

752
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:44,210
Yes.

753
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:46,460
Mr. Yun,

754
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:47,660
let me heal you.

755
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,140
Hurry.

756
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,160
How are you?

757
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:57,960
I'm fine, Lingsha.

758
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,610
All of that nonsense

759
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,570
was what Prince Yunan said in your body.

760
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:02,500
We all know that.

761
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:07,520
Look.

762
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:09,980
I've put him back in his original form.

763
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:13,690
Are you okay?

764
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:14,930
I'm fine.

765
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:28,060
Her clothes

766
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:31,240
and Qiankun bag...

767
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:33,310
Lingsha,

768
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:34,750
let's go.

769
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,580
Prince Yunan used me as a substitute.

770
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,910
This skeleton is mine.

771
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:55,000
Miss Han,

772
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:58,110
this must be an illusion created by Prince Yunan.

773
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:01,550
This bracelet is one of its kind.

774
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,480
This is not an illusion.

775
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,920
This is a recurring realm.

776
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:10,670
I, Han Lingsha, have already died in this tomb.

777
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,630
I've thought about many ways of dying.

778
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,760
I never thought it would be like this.

779
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,260
It's because I want too badly to live, right？

780
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:22,990
Impossible.

781
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:26,530
It's alright.

782
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:29,070
Take Mengli home.

783
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:31,450
Protect Uncle and Aunt Liu.

784
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:33,650
You still have a long way to go.

785
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,400
Impossible.

786
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:37,630
Lingsha,

787
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,370
you can't die.

788
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:41,990
I won't let you die.

789
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,860
It must be this evil old man!

790
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:49,240
Old Yunan,

791
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:50,440
come out!

792
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:53,160
You're a coward hiding in the shadows!

793
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,510
I am the world's prince.

794
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:57,700
If it weren’t for Yun Tianqing,

795
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,990
I wouldn’t be trapped here.

796
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:02,950
The heavens didn't kill me,

797
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:05,380
allowing me to meet you all.

798
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,510
If you want them to live,

799
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:18,830
you

800
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,280
must stay here.

801
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:24,470
I want to know

802
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,280
why you want me to stay.

803
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,510
I became a demon of void because of a cultivation mistake,

804
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:31,470
while you have

805
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,310
a once-in-a-century cold yin physique.

806
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:37,540
I can use your body

807
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:38,620
and break out of the underground palace

808
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:41,580
to take revenge in this world.

809
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:42,940
Prince Yunan,

810
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:46,130
you were devoted to accumulating merit and becoming an immortal.

811
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:47,700
Why are you so violent?

812
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,670
Violent?

813
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,240
Did you know

814
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:53,240
that my wife, my family, and I

815
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,390
were deceived by a shameless cultivator

816
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:57,030
and almost died

817
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,990
after taking the Daoxianxia Pill?

818
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,710
That demonic cultivator saw that a disaster was brewing

819
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:05,140
and he was afraid that I would take revenge,

820
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:06,820
so he used a spell

821
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:10,070
to seal me here before escaping.

822
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:14,150
For these thousands of dark years,

823
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:19,720
I've not gone a second without thinking of revenge.

824
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,610
It's been a thousand years.

825
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:22,880
Those cultivators are already dead.

826
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,830
Why do you still want revenge?

827
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:26,500
All cultivators in the world are my enemies.

828
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:30,810
When I went through hardships

829
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:34,090
and tried using the Yin Yang Jade to break through the seal,

830
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:37,070
your father, Yun Tianqing,

831
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:39,190
stole the Yin Yang Jade

832
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,830
and resealed my demon body

833
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:44,270
in the Crimson Jade Flask.

834
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:50,210
Fortunately, demons broke the seal for me.

835
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:54,080
That's why I must see the light again

836
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,460
and kill all the immortal cultivators in the world.

837
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:58,700
You deserved it.

838
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:01,630
My father should have sealed you, you scourge.

839
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:04,030
If you want to use me to kill innocent people,

840
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:05,100
I won’t allow it even if you kill me.

841
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:07,790
No one in the world is innocent.

842
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,750
You will all die with me.

843
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:22,280
Are these the missing civilians?

844
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:27,360
These lowly people have ordinary physiques.

845
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:30,740
You

846
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:34,880
are the body that I want.
