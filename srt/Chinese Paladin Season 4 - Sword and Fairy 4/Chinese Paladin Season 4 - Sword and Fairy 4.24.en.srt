[Episode 24]

4
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:45,830
You're awake!

5
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,509
Old man,

6
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:48,720
do you want some water and food?

7
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,180
I'll get you a bowl of medicinal soup.

8
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,770
Ziying.

9
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,140
How do you feel now?

10
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,470
I will continue to treat you.

11
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:58,340
In a few days,

12
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:00,370
your vitality will recover more.

13
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,290
I can't recover.

14
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,630
This is all predetermined fate.

15
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,400
Stop wasting your spiritual power.

16
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,130
Has that Xuan Xiao...

17
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,350
been sealed in the ice again?

18
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,620
Yes.

19
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,220
Old man,

20
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,500
you have to let go of your obsession.

21
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:23,490
At the same time, you are also giving yourself a break.

22
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,250
No.

23
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,140
You have to help Xuan Xiao...

24
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,600
break out of the ice.

25
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,270
One moment you want to kill him,

26
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:32,590
and the next you want to help him.

27
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,550
Are you senile?

28
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:35,570
I wanted to kill him

29
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,310
to protect Qionghua.

30
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,300
I want to help him now

31
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,990
to protect Qionghua too.

32
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,910
The 19th year Reincarnation Hell War is coming.

33
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,950
And I've lost all my power.

34
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,730
I'm now already a dying old man.

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,460
Now the power of Qionghua's disciples

36
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,200
is not as powerful as before.

37
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,980
Only Xuan Xiao

38
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,000
can protect Qionghua now.

39
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,980
But Uncle Xuan Xiao was possessed by a demon.

40
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,310
He was possessed by a demon

41
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,940
because he didn't have Wangshu Sword

42
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,340
and suffered the backlash from Xihe.

43
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,110
Now Wangshu is back.

44
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,990
Ziying.

45
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,510
You must remember

46
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:27,820
to control Yun Tianhe.

47
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:30,550
He is a restraint to Xuan Xiao.

48
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,440
I'll keep that in mind.

49
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,400
Good.

50
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,240
Good.

51
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,140
That's all I can do.

52
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:45,260
You old man, it's been decades.

53
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,620
You looked down on me and feigned insanity to escape from me.

54
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,829
But I'm still the one who knows you the best.

55
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,350
Grandmaster.

56
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,120
Senior Xuan Xiao has been sealed in the ice again.

57
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,800
Is there any way to help him break the ice?

58
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,360
Why do you ask?

59
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,520
Elder Chongguang has awakened.

60
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,910
He said the 19th year Reincarnation Hell War is coming.

61
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,790
Now that he has lost all his power,

62
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:19,029
only Senior Xuan Xiao can protect Qionghua.

63
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,550
So he ordered me to help Xuan Xiao break out of the ice.

64
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,030
It seems Elder Chongguang and I

65
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,930
are finally on the same page for something.

66
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,280
So,

67
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,450
the 19th year Reincarnation Hell War is real?

68
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,550
It's time I told you.

69
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,550
Huanming Realm is like a star.

70
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,070
It travels along a fixed trajectory.

71
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,190
Every 19 years,

72
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:44,190
it will be above Kunxu Qionghua.

73
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,850
19 years ago,

74
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,520
Huanming Demon Clan used the purple crystal's spiritual energy as the bridge

75
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,380
to enter the mortal world and slaughter the people.

76
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,890
That was why

77
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:58,870
we had a fierce war with Huanming Demon Clan.

78
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:04,390
Qionghua spent three generations of manpower and material resources

79
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,870
to make the two divine swords of Xihe and Wangshu.

80
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,870
We sacrificed countless disciples

81
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,670
to protect the people.

82
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:15,470
Unfortunately, we failed 19 years ago.

83
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:16,860
In that case,

84
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,630
Huanming Realm will reach above Qionghua

85
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,150
and the Huanming Demon Clan will cause chaos to the mortal world again.

86
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,530
This is why Elder Chongguang

87
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,860
wants Xuan Xiao to be broken out of the ice.

88
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,580
Grandmaster.

89
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,300
Since we can seal him in the ice,

90
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,760
there must be a way to break the ice.

91
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,670
There is.

92
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,350
But only one person can do it.

93
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,260
Who?

94
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,510
I, Yun Tianhe, request to see Grandmaster.

95
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,620
Grandmaster.

96
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,430
Uncle Ziying.

97
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,150
Were you referring to Tianhe?

98
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:53,940
Yes.

99
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,670
If you want Xuan Xiao to break out of the ice as soon as possible,

100
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,430
you have to find three cold weapons,

101
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,550
among which the Suoluo Fruit is in my hands.

102
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,270
Grandmaster.

103
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,090
What are the other two cold weapons?

104
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:05,640
I only know one of them is called the Kun Scale.

105
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,230
It is a scale that fell off the northern Kun fish

106
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,630
when it transformed into a roc.

107
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,290
No one knows its whereabouts.

108
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,440
As for the third cold weapon,

109
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:14,890
I don't know its name.

110
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,200
I only know that when it appears,

111
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,260
there will be a phenomenon of stars descending to the mortal world

112
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,390
and the Milky Way hanging upside down.

113
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,210
I think

114
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,120
it must be a rarer treasure.

115
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:27,200
The stars descending to the mortal world and the galaxy hanging upside down?

116
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,330
Could it be the Guangji Cold Painting?

117
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,409
You know it?

118
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:33,470
Of course.

119
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,720
My Han family has always been proficient in the art of feng shui.

120
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,840
Naturally, we've collected many ancient books

121
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,830
that record the location of treasures and foreign objects.

122
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:42,360
Among them is... a treasure hunting journal.

123
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,030
I saw the Guangji Cold Painting

124
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,360
in the map drawn inside.

125
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,390
Since there was a mark on the map,

126
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,820
it should be where the Cold Painting is.

127
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,370
This is a blessed fate.

128
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,810
Tianhe, did you hear that?

129
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,440
We can go find the cold weapon together.

130
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,170
You can't go!

131
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,540
That's a cold weapon.

132
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,670
You'll be attacked.

133
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:07,070
Lingsha.

134
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:10,620
Of course I hope you can go with us.

135
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,410
But Uncle Ziying is right.

136
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,350
The cold weapon will hurt you.

137
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,080
I told you not to worry about me.

138
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,380
Grandmaster gave me spiritual power herself.

139
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,200
I'm fully recovered anyway.

140
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,310
Don't forget

141
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,280
we three agreed

142
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,110
to never be apart no matter what.

143
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,880
-But...
-All right. No buts.

144
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:29,580
Grandmaster.

145
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,159
The trio's bond reminds me of the past.

146
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,270
Let them go together.

147
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,300
Then you three will go to Lingsha's house

148
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:51,300
to look for the ancient book with the clue of the Guangji Cold Painting.

149
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,030
Lingsha.

150
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,430
I know you have the cold disease.

151
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,750
I'll make arrangements

152
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,010
to ensure your safety.

153
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,030
Thank you, Grandmaster.

154
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,430
Grandmaster, we won't let you down.

155
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,450
I've sent the trio including Ziying and Yun Tianhe

156
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:24,750
to help you find the cold weapons to help you break out of the ice.

157
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,480
The trio including Yun Tianhe?

158
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,950
How could you let Han Lingsha go?

159
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,500
I also noticed

160
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,250
that the girl named Han Lingsha

161
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,220
is the real host of Wangshu Sword.

162
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:37,909
However,

163
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:40,650
although Han Lingsha is the host,

164
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:42,190
she was born weak.

165
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,870
With just her power,

166
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:46,710
it'll be hard to control the Wangshu Sword.

167
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,530
After you break out of the ice,

168
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,250
I'll help you accomplish your great cause.

169
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,120
I'll tell you one last time.

170
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,470
With your constitution,

171
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:05,190
you will never become the host of Wangshu.

172
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:08,170
The only thing you can help me with

173
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,470
is to protect Han Lingsha

174
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:13,040
at all costs.

175
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:20,990
Okay.

176
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,350
I'll do as you say.

177
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,030
Anyway, I think

178
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,510
it's great to be able to ride the sword.

179
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,870
We get home really quickly.

180
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,670
It used to take a few days to travel on the road.

181
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,110
Yes.

182
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,800
This mission is tough.

183
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,100
Especially you two,

184
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,580
don't act recklessly.

185
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,130
No matter when or where...

186
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:57,080
-Always observe the code of conduct.
-Always observe the code of conduct.

187
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,940
It seems they have remembered it.

188
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,070
Uncle, let's go.

189
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,060
Let's go.

190
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:14,920
[Han Residence]

191
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,100
This is my home.

192
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:32,740
Sister.

193
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,180
Seven.

194
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:37,510
It's me.

195
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:41,650
Don't move.

196
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,980
Seven.

197
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,490
I promised you...

198
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,020
to wait for you to come back.

199
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,950
I've been holding on to my last breath...

200
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,870
just to see you one last time.

201
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,150
Sister.

202
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,030
We still have a long way to go.

203
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:11,290
I still want...

204
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,830
I still want to see you get married to your Mr. Right

205
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,490
and watch you become a mother.

206
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:20,430
Silly girl.

207
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,190
Now that I've seen you for the last time,

208
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:27,550
I have no regrets.

209
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,600
You won't die.

210
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:32,310
I went out to find the immortality pill for you.

211
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,110
I found the medicine. I found it.

212
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:37,390
Look.

213
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:40,390
This is the Fuyao Immortal Fruit Pill that can cure all diseases.

214
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,550
It's near impossible to obtain even one in the world.

215
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,440
You'll be fine after you eat it.

216
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,470
It's near impossible to obtain?

217
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,440
You must have worked so hard to obtain it.

218
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,190
In that case,

219
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,140
why are you giving it to a dying person?

220
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,870
Seven.

221
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,530
You must live well.

222
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:05,190
This is my biggest wish.

223
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,300
I ate it when I got hurt.

224
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:11,730
And I'm now a disciple of Qionghua Sect.

225
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:14,230
Grandmaster said she can cure me.

226
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:15,530
Really?

227
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:16,670
Yes.

228
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,510
Eat it now.

229
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,780
Sister, you must live well

230
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,750
so that I can live well.

231
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,120
Sister.

232
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:34,710
Now that you've taken the medicine,

233
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,240
you need to take a good rest.

234
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,190
I'm a little... tired indeed.

235
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,170
I'll sleep with you.

236
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,420
Let's sleep together

237
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,700
like when we were kids.

238
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:54,950
Let me tell you

239
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:57,210
everything that happened in my journey.

240
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,800
I went to a place where humans and demons coexist.

241
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,360
It's called Qingluan Peak.

242
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,420
I met my most important friend there.

243
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,590
His name is Yun Tianhe.

244
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,070
Why is it completely silent?

245
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,270
It should be fine.

246
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:46,000
If something bad happened, it wouldn't be so silent.

247
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,270
What if something bad happened?

248
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,500
I can’t let Lingsha face it alone.

249
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,140
I'd better wait for her by the door.

250
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:17,710
Sister?

251
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:20,110
You're awake.

252
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,290
How do you feel now?

253
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,060
What do you think?

254
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,330
You've recovered?

255
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:27,790
I knew it!

256
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,990
I knew the immortality pill would work.

257
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,510
Not just that,

258
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,450
but I'm even a little hungry now.

259
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,250
I want to eat Uncle Hu's cooking.

260
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:36,670
Well,

261
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,750
if Uncle Hu knows about your current improved state,

262
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,390
he would cook up a feast

263
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:41,380
of all our favorite dishes.

264
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,680
I've recovered.

265
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:44,550
Put it on. You just recovered.

266
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,270
Okay, I'll listen to you.

267
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:49,710
Let's go.

268
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,490
Let's go.

269
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,010
You've been here this whole time?

270
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:59,370
Uh, no, I just arrived.

271
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:00,990
Well...

272
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,810
This is your cousin?

273
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,660
You are Yun Tianhe?

274
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,320
Just call me Sister like Seven.

275
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,110
Sister.

276
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,270
Tianhe, listen.

277
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,750
That Fuyao Immortal Fruit Pill really works.

278
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,750
Sister is completely fine now.

279
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,430
Really?

280
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:16,670
That's great!

281
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,150
I'll go tell Mengli and Ziying.

282
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:18,710
Okay.

283
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,800
Sister, let's go.

284
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:26,750
I, Lingxiang, thank you all for sending Seven home.

285
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,990
Pardon

286
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:28,920
the simple fare.

287
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:32,830
Uncle Ziying.

288
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:36,190
Quickly have a bite, even if you're just pretending.

289
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,420
I'm starving.

290
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,520
Pretend?

291
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,190
Sister Lingxiang.

292
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:42,260
For his cultivation, Uncle Ziying

293
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,720
has to fast all year round.

294
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,960
Please don't mind it.

295
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,400
Are you really eating?

296
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,240
Well...

297
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,390
All right, I've eaten.

298
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,050
Why don't you dig in?

299
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:08,670
Miss Mengli.

300
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,770
This is five-spice water caltrop.

301
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,170
It's Seven's favourite.

302
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,260
Try it too.

303
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,370
Ziying.

304
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,350
You finally broke your fast.

305
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,100
Try this

306
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,660
five-spice water caltrop.

307
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,380
This is my home.

308
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:23,990
Let me call you Ziying.

309
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:26,920
It's exhausting keeping up with formalities all day long.

310
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,510
Yes.

311
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:35,350
You don't have to force yourself.

312
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:37,350
It's enough that everyone's happy.

313
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,490
I'm not breaking my fast for be polite,

314
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:43,090
but to celebrate Lingsha fulfilling her wish

315
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:44,290
of her family member recovering

316
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:46,020
and reuniting with her family.

317
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,660
Not everyone is blessed

318
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,640
to be able to reunite with their family.

319
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:52,970
Uncle Ziying.

320
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:57,130
I've always heard you talk about your master,

321
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,040
but never your family.

322
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:00,070
Where are they?

323
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:04,230
My parents sent me to the mountain gate when I was seven.

324
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,260
I have no parents or family now.

325
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:11,980
It's fine.

326
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,310
So it seems that apart from Mengli,

327
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,740
we are all children without parents.

328
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,339
That's why I feel even more guilty.

329
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:22,880
When I return,

330
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:25,510
I'll love and care for my parents even more.

331
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,160
You're all so nice to Seven.

332
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,230
From now on, this will be your home.

333
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,070
Lingsha.

334
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,270
Why does Sister call you Seven?

335
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,710
I'm the seventh in my family in terms of age.

336
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:40,510
Sister.

337
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:43,530
Where are Second Brother and Fifth Brother?

338
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,720
They're not back yet.

339
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:47,740
Not back yet?

340
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,390
I was hoping to see them before I leave.

341
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,800
Are you leaving again?

342
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,040
Where are you going?

343
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:54,580
Miss Lingxiang.

344
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,900
We're here not only to give you the immortality pill,

345
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:00,270
but also to find some treasures for our sect.

346
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,290
One of them is called the Guangji Cold Painting.

347
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,230
I heard from Lingsha that

348
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:05,520
it was recorded in the Han family's ancient book.

349
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,690
Guangji Cold Painting?

350
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:07,280
Sister.

351
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,290
You must have seen the Guangji Cold Painting.

352
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:11,220
It's in our treasure hunting journal.

353
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,350
Such a sacred object

354
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:15,010
is most likely located in perilous terrain

355
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:17,400
or where there are many poisonous insects and beasts.

356
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,710
It's extremely dangerous.

357
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:20,440
We are cultivators now.

358
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,310
Also, Uncle will protect us.

359
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:23,880
Miss Lingxiang.

360
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,750
Can you let me have a look at this book?

361
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:34,360
The Han family has a huge collection of books.

362
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,640
I have to look for it.

363
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,490
Sister, you've just recovered, so you shouldn't exhaust yourself.

364
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:40,030
Give me the key to the room in the wing.

365
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:40,780
I'll go find it.

366
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,650
Seven.

367
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,800
I've been sick.

368
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,770
I can't remember

369
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,900
where the key is right now.

370
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,410
The two things you take care of the most in the Han family

371
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:51,200
are me

372
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,520
and the key to the room in the wing.

373
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,520
You can't find it?

374
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,310
All right.

375
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,380
I want you to have a good meal

376
00:18:58,630 --> 00:18:59,830
and a good rest first.

377
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,140
I'll find the key tomorrow

378
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,500
and give it to you, okay?

379
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,070
Sure.

380
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:06,760
Hurry up and eat.

381
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,220
My ancestors.

382
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,080
I'm doing this

383
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,860
because I have no choice.

384
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,350
Please forgive me.

385
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,870
Master Ziying? You...

386
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,520
During our meal just now,

387
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,440
I'd already sensed

388
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,950
your panic and anxiety.

389
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:19,600
Besides, as the eldest daughter who protects the Han family,

390
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,130
how could you have forgotten where the key is?

391
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:25,390
I suppose this book

392
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:29,690
is the treasure hunting journal that records the Guangji Cold Painting.

393
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,160
Since you have guessed it,

394
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,030
I won't lie to you.

395
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,120
I must burn it.

396
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,980
If you're worried about Lingsha's safety,

397
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,220
I can protect her with my life.

398
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,830
But this book

399
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,530
is very important to the safety of Qionghua.

400
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,550
But Seven is also very important to the Han family!

401
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,300
At least Qionghua's people are still alive.

402
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,850
But look at the Han family.

403
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,760
The Han family now...

404
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,580
only has Seven and I left.

405
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:38,010
I can't let anything happen to her.

406
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,790
Sister.

407
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:45,780
Uncle Ziying, you're here too?

408
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,550
Why are you burning the treasure hunting journal?

409
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,270
Seven.

410
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,390
I don't want you to leave home again.

411
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,040
But I must go.

412
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,510
If I help Qionghua get the cold weapons,

413
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:04,480
I can get more Fuyao Immortal Fruit pills.

414
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,340
Then Second Brother and Fifth Brother can be saved.

415
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,490
Look over there.

416
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,120
Second Brother?

417
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:18,930
Fifth Brother?

418
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,510
What happened to the Han family?

419
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,740
There has been no exception for six generations of the Han family.

420
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,250
No one has lived over 30 years old.

421
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,040
Countless family members

422
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,770
have been on the search for a radical cure.

423
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:33,890
But in the end,

424
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:39,480
the solutions were always shortlived.

425
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:44,420
I'm afraid Seven and I can't escape this fate.

426
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,650
So I can only protect her for the rest of her life.

427
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,140
I don't believe that.

428
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,000
I only know that my life is up to me.

429
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:54,110
Can you overcome predetermined fate?

430
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:55,400
Do you dare say you can?

431
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:09,780
Seven.

432
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,030
If you insist on leaving,

433
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:16,950
we will no longer be sisters.

434
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:19,880
Miss Lingxiang.

435
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:22,640
Master Ziying, say no more.

436
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:39,400
I can give the treasure hunting journal to Qionghua.

437
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:40,940
But the condition is

438
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:44,310
that Han Lingsha is no longer your disciple

439
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:48,110
and she has nothing to do with Qionghua anymore.

440
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:51,420
She can only be the daughter of the Han family, our Seven.

441
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:10,530
Ziying, you should persuade Sister.

442
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:12,410
Lingsha.

443
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,750
I am not without parents.

444
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,020
When I was seven,

445
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,210
I insisted on leaving home

446
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,440
and went to Qionghua.

447
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:25,040
But when I returned home because I missed my parents,

448
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,370
they were already dead.

449
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,520
This is the pain I can't make up for.

450
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,270
I don't want you to end up like me.

451
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:44,150
Let me thank you on behalf of Qionghua.

452
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:46,100
Miss Lingxiang.

453
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:48,850
You know how Lingsha feels better than I do.

454
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,030
Please take care of it.

455
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,110
Uncle!

456
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:58,550
Seven!

457
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,520
The immortal master has made his choice.

458
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,210
What about you?

459
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:15,650
If you haven't made up your mind,

460
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,960
kneel in this ancestral hall

461
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:23,210
and think it through in front of our ancestors!

462
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,650
If you dare step out of this ancestral hall...

463
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,230
or leave with them,

464
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,030
I will burn away

465
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,550
along with

466
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,410
the Han Residence.

467
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:10,990
Wasn't Lingsha going to look for the book

468
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:12,520
first thing in the morning?

469
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,150
Did she oversleep?

470
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:17,670
Why do I have a bad premonition?

471
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:21,270
Uncle.

472
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:23,250
Uncle Ziying.

473
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:25,190
Go and pack up.

474
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,130
Get ready to leave.

475
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:27,870
Leave?

476
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,540
But we haven't found the book with the clue

477
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,740
of the Cold Painting.

478
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,160
I've gotten the treasure hunting journal.

479
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:37,560
You've found it?

480
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,340
That's great.

481
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:40,770
I'm going to inform Lingsha

482
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:41,960
to pack up so we can leave together.

483
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,090
You don't have to go.

484
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:45,520
Lingsha has decided

485
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:48,200
to stay at home with Miss Lingxiang.

486
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,860
How could it be?

487
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,210
Did something happen?

488
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:56,360
They are sisters who depend on each other.

489
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,890
We can't hurt their kinship

490
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,870
for the sake of finding the cold weapon.

491
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:00,870
Immortal Master.

492
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,470
Miss Lingxiang asked me to ask you

493
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:06,200
when you will set off

494
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,850
and if there's anything else you need.

495
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:09,570
I'll prepare it right away.

496
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,750
It's fine, thanks.

497
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,720
What happened, Uncle Ziying?

498
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:21,070
Uncle Hu, where is Lingsha now?

499
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:24,630
Her elder sister made her kneel in the ancestral hall as punishment.

500
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:25,770
She hasn't eaten or drunk anything.

501
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:26,440
Tianhe.

502
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,260
If you still obey me, your master,

503
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,910
don't get involved.

504
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,670
But I have to know why.

505
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,890
I can't stand by when Lingsha hasn't eaten or drunk anything

506
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,020
and is kneeling in the ancestral hall.

507
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:42,470
Unless Lingsha tells me herself,

508
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,070
I won't leave either.

509
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,950
Tianhe, go back to your room first.

510
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,670
Let me discuss it with Uncle.

511
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,360
Uncle.

512
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,860
Can you tell me what happened?

513
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:09,460
Uncle.

514
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,990
I feel terrible.

515
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,560
Can you tell me why?

516
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:18,030
I...

517
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,550
I just want Lingsha

518
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,710
to live in peace.

519
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:35,610
Lingsha, look!

520
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,240
I secretly went to the kitchen to get this

521
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,670
when Uncle Hu was away.

522
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:41,700
Look.

523
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,980
They won't notice if you eat this.

524
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,920
It's a waste if you don't.

525
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:50,330
You even know how to be slick now.

526
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:51,530
Try it.

527
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,580
This is my favorite sugar cake when I was young.

528
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,440
Sister must have made it herself.

529
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,660
Lingsha.

530
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,320
Sister has just recovered.

531
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,450
She didn't expect you to leave so soon.

532
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:12,600
It must be hard for her to accept it right away.

533
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,620
I know how she feels.

534
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,250
I thought Sister

535
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,470
seemed quite amiable.

536
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:21,610
Why did she change suddenly?

537
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,100
Uncle Ziying has suddenly changed too.

538
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,320
Are you... hiding something from me?

539
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,740
Look at those memorial tablets.

540
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:36,040
They are almost all my family members.

541
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:39,170
Now even Second Brother and Fifth Brother are gone.

542
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,690
Sister must want me to spend

543
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:43,310
the rest of her life with her.

544
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,850
What do you mean?

545
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:51,250
My parents and uncles passed away when I was young.

546
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:54,550
Sister raised me alone.

547
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:57,400
She always showed me the positive side of things.

548
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,860
So she thinks I don't know,

549
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,790
but actually, I already knew

550
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,660
that adults in my family

551
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,540
can't live past 30 years old.

552
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,130
They said this is predetermined fate.

553
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:10,350
So,

554
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:13,590
this is why I must find the immortality pill.

555
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,810
Not only do I want to save my cousin,

556
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,740
but also everyone in my family...

557
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:21,700
and save myself.

558
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,640
Wait, Lingsha.

559
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,600
Don't believe in some predetermined fate.

560
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,830
One dictates their own fate.

561
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,310
Why should we leave it up to God?

562
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,040
Don't worry.

563
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,600
I'll go with you to look for it.

564
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,750
I'll find the solution even if I have to risk my life.

565
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:37,550
You and Sister

566
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,690
will be able to live on healthily.

567
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:46,720
I agree with you too.

568
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,120
But I am Sister's only family.

569
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:52,350
If I accompany her,

570
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:55,070
I can spend around ten years with her.

571
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:56,570
Tianhe.

572
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,060
If you were me

573
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,710
and your parents wouldn't let you go with me,

574
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:00,710
what would you do?

575
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,640
What will I do?

576
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,240
I'll definitely go with you.

577
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,930
In this world,

578
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:13,060
don't we live to do the things we want to do

579
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,720
and be with the people we love?

580
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:17,960
My parents would have agreed to it.

581
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,140
Because they were the same.

582
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:25,290
Then if I were like your mother,

583
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,760
I would have long...

584
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:34,670
Don't talk nonsense.

585
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,090
You won't.

586
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,250
Then...

587
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:40,630
What if?

588
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,300
Then I'll stay with you.

589
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,710
Dead or alive,

590
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,690
I'll always be with you.

591
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:57,470
Thank you, Tianhe.

592
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,940
Why are you thanking me?

593
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,010
I was still hesitant and conflicted.

594
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:16,600
But now I've decided

595
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,420
to look for the cold weapons with you.

596
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:23,680
I think

597
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:27,350
my family will understand.

598
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:47,660
Miss Lingxiang.

599
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,540
Ziying and Mengli are here to see you.

600
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,400
Please come in.

601
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,290
Miss Lingxiang, you look pale.

602
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,730
You must have also stayed up all night.

603
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,670
Have a seat.

604
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:12,960
Even if you didn't come,

605
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:15,180
I was planning to look for you.

606
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,510
Miss Lingxiang, do you have a favor to ask?

607
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,130
To be honest,

608
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,870
I overheard Yun Tianhe and Seven's conversation

609
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:24,220
outside the ancestral hall last night.

610
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,740
Every word they exchanged

611
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,300
touched me.

612
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,200
Although Yun Tianhe is still an ignorant child,

613
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:33,930
when I heard that

614
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:37,080
he wanted to protect Seven even if it cost his life,

615
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:40,520
I knew they have a genuine bond.

616
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,390
So,

617
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,050
I want to entrust Seven to you.

618
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,520
I don't know if Seven

619
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,460
can change her fate.

620
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,600
But I can see that

621
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,880
you care a lot about Seven too.

622
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,830
I hope you

623
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:03,390
can always stay by Seven's side.

624
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,360
If Seven is critically ill,

625
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,630
Yun Tianhe will be devastated

626
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,310
and unable to recover from it.

627
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,790
So I can only entrust Seven to you.

628
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,020
I hope you

629
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:21,880
can accompany her to the end.

630
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,770
Miss Lingxiang.

631
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:38,179
I swear

632
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,960
to protect Lingsha.

633
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:44,290
Thank you, Immortal Master.

634
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:14,700
Sister.

635
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,550
Sister.

636
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:23,750
Do you still want to punish me?

637
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:26,090
Then I'll continue kneeling.

638
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:27,430
Sister.

639
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,970
Lingsha and I have been facing hardship together

640
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,140
and share one life.

641
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:34,660
If you want her to kneel as punishment,

642
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,790
I'll kneel with her.

643
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:38,830
You share one life?

644
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,330
Lingsha

645
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,270
will sacrifice her life for me.

646
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:47,420
I'll also risk my life for Lingsha.

647
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,460
Senior Xuan Xiao said

648
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,360
only extraordinary friends

649
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,440
would live and die together.

650
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,640
You two, get up.

651
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:00,820
Seven, come with me.

652
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:02,870
I have something to tell you.

653
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:12,880
Tianhe.

654
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:14,950
What's wrong?

655
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:16,760
Nothing.

656
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,130
He probably didn't dare to wake you up

657
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:20,330
when you fell asleep,

658
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:23,370
so he maintained the same posture all night.

659
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,190
I'm fine. I'll be fine in a while.

660
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:28,790
Go chat with Sister now.

661
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:30,780
Let's go.

662
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,800
I know what you want to say.

663
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,030
But...

664
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:53,230
Open it.

665
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,750
There are so many treasures!

666
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,480
These are magical instruments passed down

667
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,320
from our ancestors of the Han family.

668
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,110
There must be many dangers in the search for cold weapons.

669
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,590
Pick some useful ones

670
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,820
and put them in your Qiankun bag.

671
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:15,910
Sister.

672
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,100
Are you allowing me to leave?

673
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,800
You and Mr. Yun are so persistent.

674
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,130
Your master and Mengli also said a lot to me.

675
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,900
Since you have someone

676
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:28,160
who would risk his life for you,

677
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,320
why would I be worried?

678
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:32,790
Sister.

679
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,390
I know what you think.

680
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:37,050
If I can get the immortality pill to save you this time,

681
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:39,040
it means there's hope for everything.

682
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,720
But if I stay at home,

683
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:43,200
it means there's no hope at all.

684
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:45,980
Seven.

685
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:49,050
My heart aches for you.

686
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,520
In this family,

687
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:53,540
you've had to face so many deaths and partings.

688
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,830
No matter how long your life is,

689
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:02,100
I want you to be happy,

690
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,520
instead of being cooped up here.

691
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:15,200
Here.

692
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:17,590
Take these two.

693
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,550
These two are the most valuable.

694
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:23,210
They can help you in an emergency outside.

695
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:26,980
Sister.

696
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:28,980
I promise you

697
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,270
I will come back safely.

698
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:32,420
You must wait for me.

699
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,040
Seven.

700
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:41,580
Have you forgotten?

701
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,340
I ate your immortality pill.

702
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,120
I will definitely

703
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:49,180
wait for you to come back.

704
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,160
Don't cry anymore.

705
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,110
Look, what else do you need?

706
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,620
Nothing. I just want a hug.

707
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:07,630
Are you really going to Penglai?

708
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:11,110
Since the Guangji Cold Painting is by the sea,

709
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,090
we plan to go to

710
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:14,990
Penglai Sect situated in the East Sea to try our luck.

711
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:15,900
Don't worry, Sister.

712
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,700
I will take good care of Lingsha.

713
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:22,940
I trust that

714
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:25,100
you will risk your life to protect Seven.

715
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,140
But remember,

716
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,230
you have to protect yourself first

717
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,940
before you can take care of others.

718
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:30,780
Understand?

719
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,810
Yes, Sister.

720
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:32,720
Don't worry.

721
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,510
Sister, don't worry.

722
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,080
We will return in triumph.

723
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,010
Just wait for me.

724
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:42,030
I will wait for you.

725
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,670
I won't let you come back

726
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,680
to an empty house.

727
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:48,000
Sister, don't cry.

728
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:50,000
I will cry if you cry.

729
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,270
Since this medicine works,

730
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,600
don't be pessimistic or think too much.

731
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:57,870
You should leave now.

732
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,680
Or I will regret it.

733
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:04,290
Uncle Hu.

734
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:07,760
Send them off for me.

735
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:08,430
Yes.

736
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,610
Sister, take good care of yourself.
