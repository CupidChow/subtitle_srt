[Episode 18]

4
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,330
You won't live to that day.

5
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:43,080
Prepare to die!

6
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,640
Elder Chongguang.

7
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,470
Xu Liang's daughter.

8
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,450
How many times have you made me

9
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,000
take the blame for you?

10
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:08,870
Old Chongguang!

11
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,680
Tianhe.

12
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:19,990
Old man.

13
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,520
Why did you call us here?

14
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,800
I promised Ziying

15
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,840
to keep Yun Tianhe safe and sound.

16
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,960
Of course I'm here to save him.

17
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:29,900
Xuanye.

18
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,940
Who ordered you to kill Tianhe?

19
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,750
I'm avenging my father.

20
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,800
Why do I need someone else's order?

21
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,780
Avenge your father?

22
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,410
But it was your father's master who died.

23
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,990
Even Xu Liang has looked beyond what Tianhe did.

24
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,390
Why do you bother?

25
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,430
I don't want to get involved in unnecessary matters either.

26
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,150
Or you may suspect me again.

27
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,260
Just take care of yourselves.

28
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:54,350
This old...

29
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:08,540
Sect Leader.

30
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,510
I didn't expect

31
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,710
you to know Illusory Sound Collection.

32
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,720
What's your relationship with Su Shen?

33
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,120
Before I joined the sect,

34
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,490
I was Master Su Shen's disciple once.

35
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,350
You didn't enter my mind

36
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,180
when I was unconscious, did you?

37
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,440
What did you see?

38
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,910
You tampered with the history book

39
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,870
and framed Yun Tianqing in order to protect her, right?

40
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,510
It’s a matter of Ye’s safety.

41
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,670
I can't let you live.

42
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,540
Master!

43
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:45,870
Master.

44
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,040
Master.

45
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,010
Sect Leader Xu Zhao asked me to tell you

46
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,950
that Senior Xuanye and Yun Tianhe are at Thousand-Man Tomb.

47
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,890
Besides, Uncle Ziying, Elder Qingyang,

48
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,950
and Elder Chongguang were all there.

49
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,120
Oh no.

50
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,360
Xuanye.

51
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,190
I've reminded you before,

52
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,110
but you still decided to put all your eggs in one basket.

53
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,680
Who incited you to do this?

54
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,920
Yun Tianhe should pay with his life.

55
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,530
No one incited me.

56
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,790
Ye, shut up!

57
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,470
Tianhe.

58
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,380
Senior.

59
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,890
So it's really you who want to kill Tianhe.

60
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,620
If he killed your next of kin,

61
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,250
would you let him live?

62
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:36,909
Ye.

63
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,540
Stop being so wrongheaded.

64
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:41,150
Kowtow to apologize to Elder and Sect Leader

65
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,500
for their leniency.

66
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,790
His father killed my parents.

67
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,490
He's the one who should kneel and plead guilty.

68
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,390
Are you out of your mind?

69
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,030
I'm standing right here.

70
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,790
Ye, stop talking nonsense.

71
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,330
Once some matter surfaces,

72
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,930
you'll have to die.

73
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:04,600
-Your father won't end up well either.
-It must be a misunderstanding.

74
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:22,930
Father.

75
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,770
Forgive me for being unfilial.

76
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:28,910
Let go!

77
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:29,650
Ye!

78
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:32,900
Ye.

79
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:34,890
Master.

80
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:35,990
Senior.

81
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:39,090
You don't know the truth about what happened 19 years ago.

82
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:41,130
Sect Leader Xu Liang only tampered with the history book

83
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,330
to save your life.

84
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,310
What nonsense are you talking about?

85
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,250
Mengli, what happened exactly?

86
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,700
I dare not lie.

87
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,470
When Sect Leader Xu Liang had a migraine

88
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:52,670
and was dazed,

89
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,020
I used illusory sound skills to treat him

90
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,220
and entered his mind.

91
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,980
So I saw the truth.

92
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,480
Mengli.

93
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:01,980
What is the truth?

94
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,630
Jingci! Jingci!

95
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:24,810
Junior! Junior!

96
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,070
You can't die, Jingci.

97
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,780
I know how you feel.

98
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,700
Please don't say it out.

99
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:35,850
The child is innocent.

100
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:37,370
Senior.

101
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,340
Please

102
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,640
protect her.

103
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,390
Jingci! Jingci!

104
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,409
Senior.

105
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,490
Hurry! Hide!

106
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,000
Uncle Yun.

107
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,300
So this is me.

108
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,960
It's too late. Let's go.

109
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:06,650
Hurry up!

110
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:27,970
Senior Xuanye is Xuan Zhen's daughter.

111
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,770
But Uncle Yun didn't kill your parents.

112
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,230
Before Jingci died,

113
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,590
she entrusted you to Sect Leader Xu Liang.

114
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:51,990
Sect Leader Xu Liang.

115
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,640
Why did you slander my father

116
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:58,590
in the history book even though you know the truth well?

117
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,430
Yun Tianhe.

118
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,800
Stop forcing Sect Leader Xu Liang.

119
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,750
It concerns my master Xuan Zhen's reputation.

120
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,080
So my father's reputation doesn't matter?

121
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,680
Tianhe.

122
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,510
Senior Xuanye wants to avenge her father.

123
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,670
So why can't I clear my father's name?

124
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:14,710
Fine.

125
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:17,030
Since you refuse to let it go,

126
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,720
I'll say it.

127
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,870
You can't do that, Junior Xu Zhao.

128
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,200
Ye is my master Xuan Zhen

129
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,390
and his female disciple Jingci's daughter.

130
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:34,530
Jingci was our fellow junior.

131
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,640
She and Master Xuan Zhen were deeply in love,

132
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,480
which is why they had you.

133
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,470
During the great war,

134
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,200
Jingci gave birth to Ye.

135
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,980
When the demons attacked, she risked her life to protect Ye.

136
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,200
When she was dying,

137
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:50,790
she entrusted Ye to my senior,

138
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,690
Xu Liang.

139
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:55,450
Senior.

140
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,190
This child is the result of Master and Junior's clandestine affair.

141
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,390
We can't let her live.

142
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,720
Just spread the word that the child is dead.

143
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,580
I'll raise her.

144
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,590
You can't do that.

145
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,890
I'm begging you.

146
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:31,550
Xu Liang, how stupid!

147
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:35,560
I had to hide

148
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,930
the truth about Ye's biological parents

149
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,530
to keep her alive.

150
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,520
I only told her Jingci was her foster mother.

151
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,370
Master-disciple adultery is already a great disgrace

152
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,420
to the sect.

153
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,860
If it got revealed,

154
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:55,170
my master Xuan Zhen's reputation would be ruined.

155
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:57,500
Ye couldn't live anymore, either.

156
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,080
It turns out

157
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,440
the revenge I craved for years

158
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,710
was only a shame.

159
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,240
I became a joke.

160
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:17,650
Tianhe.

161
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:21,660
If you still want to clear your father's name at a time like this,

162
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,340
Ye won't be able to protect herself.

163
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,230
Tianhe.

164
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,760
I’m the one who tainted your father's name.

165
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,430
I'm willing to kill myself to atone.

166
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,550
But please spare Ye.

167
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,570
Please spare her.

168
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,110
Sect Leader Xu Liang.

169
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:39,470
Get up first.

170
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:42,410
So

171
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:47,340
I'm the result of a master-disciple clandestine affair.

172
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,430
I mistook you for my enemy

173
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,230
and almost killed the innocent.

174
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,200
And my foster father who I'm indebted to

175
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,780
had to kneel to apologize.

176
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,350
Ye.

177
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:07,340
I know you are loyal and resolute.

178
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,340
Live a happy life.

179
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,870
Your father and I

180
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:17,310
will apologize to Yun Tianhe with our deaths.

181
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,800
I never asked anyone to die.

182
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,380
Uncle.

183
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,060
I, Xuanye, am Xuan Zhen's daughter.

184
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:27,810
How could I live for myself

185
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,890
regardless of my parents’ hatred and Qionghua?

186
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,250
Ye.

187
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,190
If you do it in Qionghua,

188
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,860
you'll only get yourself into trouble.

189
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,020
You'll also get your father implicated.

190
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,280
Actually, some things

191
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:42,030
don't have to be dealt with by bloodshed.

192
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,160
Get out!

193
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,510
Leave! You're not welcome here!

194
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,190
Get out! Get out!

195
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,480
Uncle, don't worry.

196
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,160
Even if I fail,

197
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,110
I won't get you and my father involved.

198
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,780
How can the result of adultery

199
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,220
live on in degradation?

200
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,220
-Ye!
-Senior!

201
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:14,440
Senior!

202
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:17,680
Senior!

203
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:18,570
Ye!

204
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,280
Wake up! Senior!

205
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,110
Ye!

206
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:26,170
Yun Tianhe.

207
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,040
You forced her to die!

208
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:29,810
Ye.

209
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:40,760
Senior!

210
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,320
Senior!

211
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,070
Grandmaster.

212
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,990
Sect Leader Xu Liang has admitted it himself.

213
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:20,160
Xuanye killed herself

214
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,390
in order not to get her foster father involved.

215
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:26,170
How is Sect Leader Xu Liang doing now?

216
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:29,300
He was too sad and had a migraine.

217
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,460
He passed out several times.

218
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,950
I can treat Sect Leader Xu Liang

219
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,180
with illusory sound skills.

220
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,150
Liu Mengli.

221
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,830
It was all because of you

222
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,460
who entered his mind

223
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,200
in the name of curing migraine

224
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,760
that Ye died after finding out the truth.

225
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,260
I didn't tell her the truth.

226
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,310
It was you who said it.

227
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:46,880
I had no other choice.

228
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,110
If it weren't Yun Tianhe

229
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,750
who threatened me with Ye's identity

230
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,950
and kept pressing me,

231
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,100
I wouldn't have told Ye

232
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,720
anything even if I had to die.

233
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,110
Grandmaster.

234
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,590
Tianhe just wanted to find out the truth.

235
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,050
He never intended to hurt anyone.

236
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:06,610
Uncle Ziying.

237
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,640
I was wrong.

238
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,890
I shouldn't have forced her.

239
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:17,630
Grandmaster.

240
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,850
I just wanted to clear my father's name.

241
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:20,710
I didn't expect

242
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,910
that I'd drag Senior into this.

243
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,550
Grandmaster, I, Tianhe, beg you to

244
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:31,480
forgive Sect Leader Xu Liang and Sect Leader Xu Zhao.

245
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,750
I, Mengli, also beg you to suppress this matter, Grandmaster.

246
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,830
Don't let Senior Xuanye

247
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:40,190
be a subject of criticism in heaven.

248
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,750
But if we just let it pass like this,

249
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,040
what about the innocence of Tianhe's father?

250
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,570
Not only will he continue to

251
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,510
bear the name of being the son of a traitor,

252
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,630
but some people will also think

253
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,060
he was the one who forced Senior to die.

254
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:51,860
Grandmaster.

255
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,360
If we spread the word about this in Qionghua,

256
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,420
how can my master Xuan Zhen and Jingci

257
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,880
rest in peace?

258
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,070
Ye has died,

259
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,980
yet she still had to bear the name of being a bastard.

260
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,380
And Sect Leader Xu Liang.

261
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,650
How can he maintain his foothold here in Qionghua?

262
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,000
Su Yao.

263
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,780
There are things we know clearly about.

264
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,420
We have to do what we have to,

265
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,780
and we need to know when to stop.

266
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:26,370
Back then,

267
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,970
Sect Leader Xu Liang only did this to protect

268
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,830
Master's child who was orphaned.

269
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,620
That's why he got mentally ill.

270
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,260
He's been tortured by migraine his whole life.

271
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,780
Now he lost Xuanye.

272
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,500
He's got his punishment.

273
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,590
Let's not pursue this matter any further.

274
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:48,110
Xu Xuanye will be buried outside the mountain

275
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,430
in the name of Xu Liang's daughter.

276
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,670
I, Xu Zhao, thank you, Grandmaster.

277
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,020
Thank you, Grandmaster.

278
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,120
As for Yun Tianqing,

279
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,690
he had more to do with

280
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:04,030
that great war 19 years ago.

281
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,000
What do you want me to do with that?

282
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,810
I just want to clear my father's name.

283
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,690
I don't believe my father

284
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:23,290
was a traitor who killed his fellow disciples.

285
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:24,870
Grandmaster.

286
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:26,350
You, my parents, and Xuan Xiao

287
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,040
were fellow disciples.

288
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,240
You must know my parents very well.

289
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,790
Please tell me the truth, Grandmaster.

290
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,200
What kind of person

291
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,230
was my father Yun Tianqing?

292
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,750
Over the past centuries,

293
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,830
there've been few people as talented as him in Qionghua.

294
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:48,620
Xuan Xiao is determined and resolute.

295
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:53,050
Xuan Qing is intelligent and honest.

296
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,150
Grandmaster.

297
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,070
I don’t want to be named Xuan Qing.

298
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:57,230
I still want to keep my name as Yun Tianqing.

299
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,030
How impudent!

300
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,440
Qionghua has its own rules.

301
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,970
Do you think you can do whatever you want here?

302
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,720
[Xuan Zhen]

303
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,520
Heaven sends down talents of more kinds than one.

304
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,630
I agree.

305
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:10,859
Every disciple

306
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:12,829
has chosen their division.

307
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,140
What about you?

308
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,630
Master, I'll choose Sword Division.

309
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,160
Is there a reason?

310
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,530
Of course I need to learn from the best

311
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,710
so that I can live up to my ambitions.

312
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,740
What about you?

313
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:30,850
I...

314
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,060
Grandmaster and elders, may I ask,

315
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:35,980
who among you is the busiest on weekdays?

316
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,180
Of course Grandmaster is the busiest.

317
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,500
Then I'll choose Grandmaster too.

318
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,390
Master, you're usually the busiest as Grandmaster.

319
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,770
You won't have to spend time worrying about me.

320
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,900
I'll share your burdens in the future.

321
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:48,170
Youngster.

322
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,670
Since you have no aspiration to ascend to immortality,

323
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,560
why did you choose me as your master?

324
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,850
I didn't come up the mountain for immortality.

325
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:59,220
I was here to learn some skills to help those in need.

326
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,080
If I can't,

327
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:02,390
it'll be enough if I can protect myself.

328
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,370
Since you chose first, you can be my senior.

329
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,370
Remember to take care of me, Senior.

330
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:19,870
Yun Tianhe.

331
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,040
You only came to Qionghua

332
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,880
to know about your father's background?

333
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:25,860
Don't you

334
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,190
want to attain immortality?

335
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,620
Of course.

336
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,090
I didn't come up the mountain

337
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:33,570
for immortality.

338
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,960
I only want to learn some skills

339
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,680
to protect myself and help those in need.

340
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:41,100
As expected from Yun Tianqing’s son.

341
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,270
What about my father?

342
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,890
Why did he come to Qionghua?

343
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,200
What exactly happened 19 years ago?

344
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,790
Yun Tianqing

345
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,630
was as outspoken

346
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,580
and recalcitrant as you.

347
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,030
He also had his own way of dealing with things.

348
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,230
So I hope

349
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,930
you can restrain yourself.

350
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:00,120
Don't be an outlier of Qionghua

351
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,000
like your father.

352
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,090
As for what happened 19 years ago,

353
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,950
there's a different truth in everyone's eyes.

354
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:10,830
So,

355
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,150
what exactly is the truth?

356
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,150
What about Xuan Xiao?

357
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,350
Why is there no record

358
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,010
about him in the history book?

359
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,430
Where is he now?

360
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,680
Yun Tianhe.

361
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,550
It's exactly because of your persistence

362
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,230
that Ye died.

363
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,670
Do you want to cause internal conflict

364
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:27,820
and make Qionghua unstable because of you?

365
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,420
You're a sinner of Qionghua,

366
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,910
just like your father.

367
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,730
Yun Tianhe.

368
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,100
Even though I'm the Grandmaster,

369
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,510
I still have to follow

370
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,370
the sect rules of Qionghua.

371
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:41,750
We must know

372
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,740
when to stop.

373
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,000
My father said

374
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,730
nothing is more important than protecting people's lives.

375
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:55,560
If this matter will get more people involved,

376
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:57,930
it wouldn't be my parents' wish either.

377
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,870
But as Yun Tianqing's son,

378
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,900
I only have one request.

379
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,000
I don't want my father's headless tomb statue

380
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,200
to stay kneeling at Thousand-Man Tomb.

381
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:22,880
Tianhe's request is not too much to ask.

382
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:29,330
Agreed.

383
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,030
Grandmaster.

384
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:38,350
I also want to ask for a favor for Tianhe.

385
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,150
Please allow him to burn incense

386
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:43,060
for his father's memorial tablet in Qionghua.

387
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,520
That's not too much to ask either.

388
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:52,100
Agreed.

389
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,020
Father.

390
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:21,170
I only wanted to clear your name,

391
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:24,170
but Senior Xuanye lost her life for this.

392
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:31,350
Did I make a mistake?

393
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,350
Yun Tianhe.

394
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,590
You said you were fine,

395
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:39,950
but you must be very upset

396
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,840
that Senior died.

397
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:46,640
Lingsha.

398
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:48,910
Uncle.

399
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,320
What are you doing?

400
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:53,220
Tianhe's father's memorial tablet was smashed.

401
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,530
Although it got fixed,

402
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,990
it's still missing a corner.

403
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,760
I've been looking for it here for days.

404
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,350
I also wanted to try my luck today to see if I can find it.

405
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:00,960
Uncle.

406
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,680
You're also here because you're worried about Tianhe, right?

407
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:07,450
I'm worried that he blames himself

408
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,950
for Xuanye's death.

409
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,230
Well, Uncle.

410
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:13,750
Tianhe said

411
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,370
he doesn't want to see or talk to anyone.

412
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:17,630
He only wants to sleep.

413
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,670
How about we talk over there?

414
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,270
Don't be so superior, okay?

415
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,600
Can't you be more down-to-earth?

416
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,130
Let's go.

417
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,880
What do you want to talk to me about?

418
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:42,860
I want to say

419
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,190
Tianhe’s father's name was finally cleared.

420
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:47,030
He was proved to be framed.

421
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,630
I should be happy,

422
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,670
but I'm sad at the same time.

423
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,090
Sect Leader Xu Liang

424
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,760
only framed Tianhe's father

425
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,500
to protect Senior Xuanye.

426
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:56,670
But because of this,

427
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,630
Senior Xuanye died for revenge.

428
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:00,200
I was thinking

429
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,200
how great it would be

430
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:07,390
if there's no fighting or hatred in this world.

431
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,150
Uncle.

432
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,560
According to the elders and sect leaders,

433
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,180
the war 19 years ago will come again.

434
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,020
Is that true?

435
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,550
The demon clan hasn't been destroyed.

436
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,410
It is possible.

437
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,220
Then why can

438
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:19,710
Yun Tianqing set up

439
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:21,590
places like Qingluan Peak and Qingfeng Pavilion

440
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:22,920
where humans and demons can co-exist,

441
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,440
but not Qionghua?

442
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,210
The more killing is done,

443
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:27,870
the more hatred there will be.

444
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,460
If it goes on like this,

445
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:32,280
something more terrible will happen,

446
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:33,030
right?

447
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,590
Why are you staring at me?

448
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:41,210
There's no answer on my face.

449
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,210
I hope you can give me an answer.

450
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,730
As your master, I want to tell you that

451
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,590
the ultimate wish of a cultivator

452
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:53,400
is to forget about personal hatred

453
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,730
and protect the people.

454
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:57,670
As a friend,

455
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,470
I want to say that

456
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:01,150
in life,

457
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:03,830
we have to experience birth, old age, sickness and death.

458
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:04,590
Hatred,

459
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,550
love and separation

460
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:08,820
are not things that can be controlled.

461
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,350
Why don't we just accept

462
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:12,150
things as they are?

463
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,260
Look at you.

464
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,350
I asked you to be more down-to-earth.

465
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:18,950
But as soon as you talk, you sound superior again.

466
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:19,630
But

467
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,540
this is the first time I've heard you say

468
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,410
we are friends.

469
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:23,950
This should be the most delightful thing

470
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:25,210
I've heard these days.

471
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:28,710
I will try

472
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:30,550
to accept the way of the world.

473
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:32,880
But

474
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,300
I still hope Tianhe's father's memorial tablet

475
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,230
can be complete.

476
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:38,530
I'll keep looking for it.

477
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,260
When did you find it?

478
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,230
When the memorial tablet was smashed,

479
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,910
I thought, when all of this

480
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,880
could come to a conclusion,

481
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:01,010
it could finally be complete.

482
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,160
I knew it.

483
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,990
You must be able to read my mind, right?

484
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:06,450
Tomorrow,

485
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,710
Tianhe is going to smash his father's headless statue.

486
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:09,710
Will you be there?

487
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,110
You will,

488
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,460
right?

489
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,400
You will.

490
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,230
You're here.

491
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:48,950
Thank you, Uncle,

492
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:51,870
for finding the missing corner of my father's memorial tablet.

493
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:52,710
I hope

494
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:55,530
the missing part in your heart

495
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,230
can be complete too.

496
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,030
Uncle Ziying.

497
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,830
Senior Xuanye once showed me

498
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,780
that there are many names

499
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,350
on this tombstone.

500
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,480
But the name Xuanye

501
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:11,750
won't appear in Qionghua ever again.

502
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,480
She was a bastard.

503
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,000
Grandmaster allowed her to be buried as Xu Liang's daughter.

504
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Her reputation has been preserved.

505
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,710
When I was little, my father often told me

506
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:24,050
in this world,

507
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,650
humans and demons should be equal.

508
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,640
There is no distinction between lives.

509
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:32,050
But now I realize

510
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:34,240
that it's not true here.

511
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,310
When Senior Xuanye

512
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:44,390
told me that was my father's kneeling statue,

513
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,760
I wanted to smash it on the spot.

514
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,260
But I know

515
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:51,210
if I smashed it back then, it would have been an act of anger.

516
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,800
It's only justifiable to smash it now.

517
00:26:59,230 --> 00:26:59,790
Tianhe.

518
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:01,880
I'm happy

519
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,670
you finally learned to be patient.

520
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:08,940
Go.

521
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:25,750
Father.

522
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:28,410
You've suffered.

523
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,830
I, Yun Tianhe, hereby swear that

524
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:55,190
one day,

525
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:59,370
I will write the name of my father, Yun Tianqing,

526
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:03,070
on the Thousand-Man Tomb justifiably.

527
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:11,750
Wine?

528
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,740
Didn't Elder Qingyang say

529
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:17,310
your father used to love drinking in Zuihuayin?

530
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,240
Now that you've smashed your father's statue,

531
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,430
of course we should have a drink here.

532
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:26,290
It seems that you shoplifted from

533
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,000
Qionghua's wine cellar.

534
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:29,670
I didn't shoplift it.

535
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:30,540
I only brought the wine of apology to your father

536
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,830
on behalf of Qionghua.

537
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:32,920
Come on.

538
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,910
For Tianhe's father,

539
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,400
for Tianhe,

540
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:39,250
and for the three of us being together safely.

541
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:39,860
Cheers!

542
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:41,600
Come on.

543
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:42,760
Cheers.

544
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:49,250
Why is the Zao jade bright again?

545
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,860
My mother is guiding me.

546
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,790
Why is it so gloomy here?

547
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:30,240
Only few people have been here, right?

548
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:47,520
[Forbidden Area of Qionghua]

549
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,640
Forbidden Area of Qionghua?

550
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,950
When I first joined the sect,

551
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,110
Uncle repeatedly warned me

552
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,710
not to break into this place.

553
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,910
There are few records about this place in the history book either.

554
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:57,240
Since my mother's Zao jade guided us here,

555
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,640
there must be secrets here.

556
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:00,900
How about this?

557
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,890
I'll go in first.

558
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,280
Wait for me here, you two.

559
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,340
Let's go together.

560
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:09,480
Okay.

561
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:11,730
Follow me. Be careful.

562
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:37,020
This door is made of ancient meteorites.

563
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,220
It can't be opened with external force.

564
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,110
This groove

565
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,580
should match your mother's Zao jade.

566
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,750
Maybe it's a mechanism.

567
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:49,310
Try it.

568
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:07,590
Let's go.

569
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:33,040
It must be Lingsha who stole the wine.

570
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:38,620
Something's not right.

571
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,450
Since the wine was stolen,

572
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:42,380
she should have hidden the bottle.

573
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:44,270
She just left it around like this.

574
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:46,190
Did something happen to them?

575
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:14,950
There are stairs.

576
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:28,880
What is this place?

577
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:30,950
I just feel

578
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,400
extremely hot and cold at the same time.

579
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,930
Could this be the holy place of cultivation,

580
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:38,130
the Ice and Fire Holy Spring in the book?

581
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,710
Ice and Fire Holy Spring?

582
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,620
It's written in the ancient book of Kanyu.

583
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:45,000
It's said that there's Ice and Fire Holy Spring at the peak of Kunxu Mountain.

584
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,830
It reaches up to the Hidden Realm of Yaochi

585
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:48,440
and down to Wanfang River.

586
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,840
It's called the Holy Land.

587
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,700
It has abundant spiritual power.

588
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,280
Naturally, you can do more with less by cultivating here.

589
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,680
But if it's the Holy Land,

590
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,450
why did it become a forbidden area of the sect?

591
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,260
Grandmaster has been forbidding me to inquire about my parents

592
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,850
and the war 19 years ago.

593
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:07,270
Could the truth be hidden in this forbidden area?

594
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:10,370
I've been waiting for you for a long time,

595
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,850
Yun Tianhe.

596
00:34:29,389 --> 00:34:32,310
I haven't seen you before, have I?

597
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,560
How do you know my name?

598
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:37,060
Come up here.

599
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:44,030
It's okay.

600
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:46,830
He doesn't have the murderous aura.

601
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:02,640
As Su Yao said,

602
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,790
the way you talk

603
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:07,080
and the expression on your face

604
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,460
are exactly like Yun Tianqing.

605
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,280
Why did the murderous aura appear

606
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,130
as soon as you mentioned my father?

607
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,430
Who on earth are you?

608
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,410
But your eyes

609
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,320
are as clear as your mother's.

610
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:39,630
Why did the murderous aura disappear

611
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,800
when you mentioned my mother?

612
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,460
You must be familiar with my parents.

613
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,640
More than that.

614
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:52,980
Tianhe.

615
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:57,270
Your name was given by your mother.

616
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,990
She loves the Milky Way hanging in the sky the most.

617
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:05,830
Do you know, Senior?

618
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:09,150
The starry sky and Phoenix Flower Tree

619
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:12,920
complement each other. They are so beautiful together.

620
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:15,370
The Milky Way is hanging in the sky.

621
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:17,170
The stars are shining brightly.

622
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:18,410
When you look at them,

623
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,370
you'll naturally feel broadened.

624
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:23,120
The Milky Way is hanging in the sky.

625
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:36,650
Su Yu must have given you this name

626
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,660
from "the Milky Way hanging in the sky"

627
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,700
because she missed

628
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:47,060
admiring the Phoenix Flower Tree under the starry sky with me.

629
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,920
You know so much about my parents.

630
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:52,680
Could it be that you're their senior, Xuan Xiao?

631
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,240
Your mother told you about me?

632
00:36:58,750 --> 00:36:59,590
No.

633
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:02,870
Not long after I was born,

634
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:03,960
she passed away.

635
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,990
It was Elder Qingyang who told me about you.

636
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:08,450
It was my mother's Zao jade

637
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,120
that guided us here.

638
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:15,870
If Su Yu hadn't taken Wangshu Sword with her and left Qionghua

639
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,560
with your father,

640
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:21,340
she wouldn't have...

641
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,700
You are the first person that truly feel sorry for my parents

642
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,980
after I came to Qionghua.

643
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:34,670
Senior.

644
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:35,750
Well,

645
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:38,560
since you're the senior of Tianhe's parents,

646
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,600
why don't you look old at all?

647
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:41,830
Right.

648
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:45,530
I've been frozen here for more than 10 years.

649
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,550
I don't know how long it has been.

650
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:50,480
I just look young.

651
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,350
May I ask

652
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,600
why you're frozen here, Senior?

653
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:14,260
Xuan Xiao.

654
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,770
You've lost your mind and ruined your reputation.

655
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:19,620
Not only did you hurt our disciples,

656
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:22,670
but you also went down the mountain and hurt the innocent.

657
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,230
As the Elder of Justice,

658
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,140
I must get rid of you for our sect today.

659
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,240
Uncle.

660
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:30,640
Before Immortal Tai Qing died,

661
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,440
although he asked me to temporarily take his place as Grandmaster,

662
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,170
Xuan Xiao was

663
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,010
the successor he chose.

664
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,020
He killed innocent people

665
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:40,350
and ruined Qionghua's spotless reputation for the past century.

666
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:41,550
He has become a devil.

667
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,610
We'll seal him in the Xuan Ice

668
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,690
and let him taste the pain of

669
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:48,590
burning fire and freezing ice.

670
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:49,820
Try it.

671
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:50,760
Seal!

672
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,390
Junior.

673
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:17,950
This is for your own good.

674
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,650
As Grandmaster,

675
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,900
I have to do this.

676
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,250
Su Yao!

677
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,040
Let's go.

678
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,720
Chongguang.

679
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,990
I will kill you.

680
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,360
Qionghua was defeated.

681
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:15,120
But I've never betrayed Qionghua.

682
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:17,740
I've never betrayed anyone,

683
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:20,370
but everyone betrayed me.

684
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:23,990
That's why I've been frozen here for over a decade.

685
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,300
It's been a long time

686
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,960
since there were so many people in my quiet area.

687
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:46,990
Yun Tianhe.

688
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:49,530
How dare you ignore the rules

689
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,890
and break into the forbidden area?

690
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,000
Stop fighting!

691
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:11,930
Stop fighting!

692
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:13,620
Uncle Ziying.

693
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:16,380
He's Xuan Xiao, my parents' senior.

694
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,670
You've reached the fifth level of Qian Yuan Realm

695
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:26,830
at such a young age.

696
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:30,650
You're better than those ordinary disciples in Qionghua.

697
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:31,890
Who's your master?

698
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:38,710
Uncle Ziying.

699
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:46,160
I'm Murong Ziying, Master.

700
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:48,970
I was taken in by Master Su Shen when I was little.

701
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:50,430
After Master left the sect,

702
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:52,880
Elder Zong Lian took his place to teach me.

703
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:57,180
So it's Zong Lian.

704
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:59,310
Did he tell you

705
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,270
that I'm in the forbidden area?

706
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:02,970
Grandmaster didn't mention it to me.

707
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:04,030
He just told me that

708
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:06,670
if I get to meet Uncle Xuan Xiao in my life,

709
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,720
I must treat you with respect.

710
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,120
In that case,

711
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:12,670
Yun Tianhe broke into the forbidden area today,

712
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:13,980
which violated the rules.

713
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,380
But you can't punish him.

714
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:20,540
And don't tell anyone about what happened tonight.

715
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:26,530
Yes,

716
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:28,150
Master.

717
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,330
All of you may leave.

718
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:34,320
Let Yun Tianhe stay.

719
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:36,100
No.

720
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:37,360
If he stays, we'll stay too.

721
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:40,020
If you want us to leave, Tianhe will come with us.

722
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:41,560
So annoying.

723
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:44,430
Lingsha.

724
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:49,780
I'll take my leave.

725
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:53,340
It's okay, Lingsha.

726
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:54,160
Lingsha.

727
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,480
Senior Xuan Xiao,

728
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:11,000
are you going to tell me about

729
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,530
what happened 19 years ago?

730
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:14,500
Come closer.

731
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:22,010
Yun Tianhe.

732
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:24,470
You're just a mortal.

733
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:29,020
You haven't even mastered Sword Riding, have you?

734
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:31,610
Anyone from Qionghua Sect

735
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:33,760
can kill you.

736
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,530
So what if you know the truth?

737
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:39,430
I can practice.

738
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:40,510
I can learn.

739
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,010
I can be more powerful than any of them.

740
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:45,720
Okay.

741
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:49,370
Only by stimulating your own abilities to become powerful enough

742
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:51,210
can you have the ability to face the truth

743
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:52,250
and seek justice.

744
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:56,250
Otherwise, you don't deserve to know the truth.

745
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,760
Nor do you deserve the Wangshu Sword your mother left you.

746

What level of cultivation do I have to reach

747
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:04,220
before I can be called powerful?

748
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:08,440
Let's start with the basic spiritual cultivation,

749
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,300
luring the spirit into the sword.

750
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:16,350
When you can master Sword Riding,

751
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:18,870
and when I believe you can achieve unprecedented things,

00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:20,630
