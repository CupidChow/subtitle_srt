[Episode 9]

4
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,670
That's it. Good boy.

5
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:43,600
Come with me.

6
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,830
Good boy.

7
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,680
Oh no.

8
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,570
Why is his primordial spirit so unstable?

9
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:16,660
Mr. Murong,

10
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,050
don't be deceived by the mind spell.

11
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,380
You must get your primordial spirit back.

12
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,790
Are these

13
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,340
the primordial spirits of those people in the Sleep Condition?

14
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,470
The mind spell armor has been created.

15
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,360
It will help you get what you want.

16
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,320
Good.

17
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,000
Everything is ready now.

18
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,190
I just need to wait for Wen Yao to bring the wild guy

19
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,110
carrying the Wangshu Sword to me.

20
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,460
Why don't we split up?

21
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,230
Mr. Murong and Mengli will go investigate the bead.

22
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,520
I'll go with this wild guy

23
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,650
to investigate Qin Ji's whereabouts.

24
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,060
Is there a problem?

25
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:16,660
You never called Ziying Mr. Murong before.

26
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,050
I called him that like Mengli does.

27
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,270
I want him to help me,

28
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,450
of course I should show some respect.

29
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,340
Mr. Murong,

30
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,829
you're finally back.

31
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,640
Our priority now is to find Yun Tianhe.

32
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,390
Miss Han has been possessed by a demon.

33
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,670
They want the Wangshu Sword.

34
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,510
Let's go now.

35
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,430
Okay.

36
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:37,780
Mengli.

37
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:38,660
Miss.

38
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,230
She has used her spiritual power for four hours.

39
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,270
It has done great harm to her.

40
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,530
We need to help her now.

41
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,110
Okay.

42
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,590
We've investigated for so long but found nothing.

43
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,990
Let's eat something delicious here first.

44
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,890
I told you you can't find anything in Chenzhou.

45
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,290
Why don't we go out of the city now?

46
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,070
No hurry.

47
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,060
Listen.

48
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,240
This restaurant

49
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,290
is very famous in Chenzhou, and the dishes here are very delicious.

50
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,790
I've already ordered some dishes.

51
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,870
Why don't we ask

52
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,550
Ziying and Mengli to join us?

53
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,460
No.

54
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,810
They must be investigating the case.

55
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,070
We finally have a chance to be alone.

56
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:29,950
It's great.

57
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,720
You want to be alone with me?

58
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,760
You don't want to?

59
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,030
Your dishes.

60
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,220
Give us your best wine.

61
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:44,990
Okay.

62
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,540
We are going to drink wine too?

63
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,300
We have delicious dishes. Of course we need good wine, right?

64
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,030
Besides,

65
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,070
so many things have happened these days.

66
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,190
We should drink as much as we want.

67
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:54,930
Great.

68
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,680
I haven't drunk for a long time.

69
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,670
But I can only drink three glasses.

70
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:05,910
Let's drink

71
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:07,820
the first toast to you.

72
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,950
You protected me

73
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,280
when I was unconscious.

74
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:11,060
Come on.

75
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,080
You were unconscious.

76
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,910
How did you know I protected you?

77
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,030
Except you,

78
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,940
who else would be so nice to me?

79
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,159
Mr. Murong,

80
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,040
why are you still here?

81
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,430
Lingsha and Tianhe are in danger.

82
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:42,280
Miss.

83
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,159
Calm down.

84
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,810
Yun Tianhe hasn't recited the spell to summon me.

85
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,409
It means everything is fine.

86
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:48,430
But they...

87
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,360
You were in greater danger just now,

88
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,000
Miss.

89
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,370
Luckily, Ziying and I

90
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,080
transmitted spiritual power to you together.

91
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,280
Ziying, don't worry.

92
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,550
She'll be fine after getting some rest.

93
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,230
Then let's drink the second toast

94
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,230
to the Sweet and Sour Mandarin Fish.

95
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,440
-The Sweet and Sour Mandarin Fish...
-Drink first.

96
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,230
Lingsha,

97
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,270
you usually love eating fish.

98
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,360
There would be no fun if we drink without eating fish, right?

99
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,530
Try this fish first.

100
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,420
Listen,

101
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,150
we are lucky to have this fish.

102
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,020
They only serve a dozen fishes every day.

103
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,570
I finally got one.

104
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,310
Try it.

105
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,830
I specially went to the kitchen just now.

106
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,660
The fish was lively and fresh.

107
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,720
When they peeled its scales,

108
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,360
it was...

109
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,630
Fishes are also living creatures.

110
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,610
After hearing what you said, I have no appetite now.

111
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:36,340
Drink first.

112
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,950
But...

113
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:42,000
fishes on dining tables shouldn't be counted as living beings.

114
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,460
This is what Lingsha said.

115
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,060
Looks like

116
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,790
you really are not Lingsha.

117
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:53,090
You are the fish demon from Taiping Village.

118
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,680
Lingsha?

119
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,120
You're quite smart.

120
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,590
When did you find out?

121
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:18,040
I found it out when you called me a wild guy.

122
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,510
Through a few tests,

123
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,050
I'm more certain now.

124
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,020
Tests?

125
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,710
Lingsha won't let me drink.

126
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:25,310
She won't leave Mengli behind

127
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,770
to be with me alone either.

128
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,060
I prepared this fish for you.

129
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:31,970
You did that to humiliate me!

130
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:34,430
I advise you

131
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,720
to get out of Lingsha's body as soon as possible.

132
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:38,860
Otherwise,

133
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,220
you will end up like the fish on the table.

134
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,600
Let me be honest with you.

135
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:46,600
Your Lingsha is still in the Sleep Condition.

136
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:58,659
If you don't want her to die in front of you,

137
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,810
take your sword and come with me.

138
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:08,650
Come quickly when you hear the spell, and communicate through all things.

139
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:09,780
If you are in danger,

140
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,290
summon me by reciting the spell with the scabbard I gave you.

141
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,190
Did Tianhe recite the spell to summon you?

142
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,920
Then he must have seen through the demon's trick.

143
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,230
Mr. Murong,

144
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,700
did you see what kind of demon it is

145
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,100
in the illusion just now?

146
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,040
I heard two people talking

147
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,230
in the illusion.

148
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,940
According to their voices,

149
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,090
one is Beike, the demon

150
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,789
who hurt me at Nyuluo Cliff back then.

151
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:36,919
I've heard of Beike.

152
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,740
He is not an ordinary demon.

153
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,539
Ziying,

154
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,669
I'll go with you.

155
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:41,850
Thank you.

156
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:55,980
Lord Beike.

157
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,070
Lingsha!

158
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,040
Lord Beike,

159
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,410
I've accomplished my mission.

160
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,030
I've brought him and the sword here.

161
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:06,710
Good.

162
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,300
Give me the sword.

163
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,220
This sword is right here.

164
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,500
Come and get it if you can hold it.

165
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:16,440
Don't worry.

166
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,550
To hold the Wangshu Sword,

167
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,350
I specially created this armor.

168
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,270
If you give me the sword,

169
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,790
she will give you her.

170
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,570
The characters on your collar

171
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,790
are exactly the same as those in Qin Ji's bead.

172
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,900
You're the one who made everyone fall into a sleep.

173
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,670
You've seen through my trick.

174
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:38,790
That's right.

175
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,070
I did it.

176
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,350
If you want me to give you the sword,

177
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,630
let Lingsha

178
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,940
and the people in Chenzhou wake up first.

179
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:51,170
Do you think you are qualified to negotiate with me?

180
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,310
Lingsha.

181
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,250
Don't move.

182
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,390
I'm gonna give you the sword.

183
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,640
Lingsha.

184
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:30,850
Lingsha.

185
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,090
Finally, I have the Wangshu Sword.

186
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,830
Lingsha.

187
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,820
I've always been a man of my word.

188
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,850
The spiritual power of this purple crystal

189
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:07,250
is more than enough to support the formation for Miss Ouyang.

190
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:14,730
Goodbye.

191
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:20,940
You did a good job

192
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,190
this time.

193
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:24,580
This is yours.

194
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,530
Thank you, Lord Beike.

195
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,180
Feng Xie,

196
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,520
we can finally get together again.

197
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,230
I can complete this armor

198
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:43,270
with 3,000 more people's primordial spirits.

199
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,070
By that time,

200
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,040
I can destroy the Wangshu Sword.

201
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:03,770
Lingsha.

202
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,060
Lingsha.

203
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,780
Don't scare me.

204
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,230
Lingsha.

205
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:09,770
Lingsha.

206
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,620
What is this place?

207
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,030
Why am I here?

208
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,200
Lingsha.

209
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,030
Tianhe.

210
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:28,890
Tianhe.

211
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:30,680
Say something.

212
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,390
Lingsha.

213
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,310
Lingsha.

214
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:34,510
Wake up.

215
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,430
Look...

216
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,070
Tianhe,

217
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,810
this is Senior Dao Zhen from Shushan Sect.

218
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,590
Although her eyes are open,

219
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,280
her primordial spirit is not in her body.

220
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,350
Do you mean

221
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,130
Lingsha is like a living dead without a primordial spirit?

222
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,410
A living dead?

223
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:02,950
Impossible.

224
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,350
That old demon

225
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,300
promised me

226
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,340
to release Lingsha from the Sleep Condition.

227
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,070
That's why I gave him the sword.

228
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:11,790
Yun Tianhe,

229
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,710
you actually gave the Wangshu Sword to that demon!

230
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,830
They threatened me with Lingsha's life.

231
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:16,690
I had no choice.

232
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:19,020
But how could they possibly take away the Wangshu Sword?

233
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,480
He's the one who caused the Sleep Condition.

234
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,620
He has an armor on his arm.

235
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,870
That's why he could hold the sword.

236
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,750
Miss Han's situation

237
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:28,810
is different from that of other people in the Sleep Condition.

238
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:31,110
I think Beike deliberately released a strand of her primordial spirit

239
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,180
from the Qian bead

240
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,650
to make her seem to be awake

241
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,510
in order to get the Wangshu Sword.

242
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,310
So I fell into a sleep.

243
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:39,210
Yun Tianhe,

244
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:40,310
do you know what consequences there will be

245
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:42,240
if the Wangshu Sword is in the hands of that demon?

246
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,170
But if I hadn't given him the sword,

247
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:45,910
Lingsha would have died.

248
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,100
Now that you've given the Wangshu Sword to that demon,

249
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,000
I'm afraid that even if you die,

250
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,890
you still can't get Lingsha's primordial spirit back.

251
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,390
Once the Wangshu Sword is destroyed by that demon,

252
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,340
Chenzhou

253
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,860
and even the whole world will be in chaos.

254
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:07,570
Now it's not just

255
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,220
about the life of Miss Han alone.

256
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,660
According to an emergency message delivered by Huaishuo,

257
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:14,860
over 1,000 people in Chenzhou suddenly fell into a sleep one after another.

258
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:21,340
This must be the Qian bead they mentioned.

259
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,310
Then those should be the primordial spirits

260
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,800
of the people in the Sleep Condition like me.

261
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,960
Just now, Mr. Yun said

262
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,850
Beike has an armor on his right arm.

263
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:36,710
Could it be that

264
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,370
he is using the Qian bead to collect the primordial spirits of the people

265
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,130
to create an armor to destroy the sword?

266
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,190
Could it be that...

267
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,610
the collar of Beike, that old demon, is the Qian bead?

268
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:53,080
He used that to make Lingsha in the Sleep Condition

269
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,840
have a strand of her primordial spirit.

270
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,170
It must be the Qian bead.

271
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,410
The most important thing now

272
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:58,250
is to take back the Wangshu Sword

273
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,200
and destroy the Qian bead.

274
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,000
That's how we can save everyone.

275
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:01,990
Dao Zhen,

276
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,090
Beike lives in Chao Lake.

277
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,050
A fierce battle is inevitable.

278
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,410
I'm afraid I have to ask you for help.

279
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:09,280
Say no more.

280
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,240
It's also Shushan Sect's duty to eliminate demons and uphold justice.

281
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:12,970
Lingsha,

282
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,600
I will destroy the Qian bead

283
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,680
even if I have to risk my life.

284
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,130
Only by destroying it can I save you

285
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,300
and release

286
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,040
the thousands of primordial spirits trapped in it.

287
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,770
Mengli,

288
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:26,770
please take care of Lingsha.

289
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,690
Wait for me at Jixian Garden.

290
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,400
I'll go with you.

291
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,740
Only I can hold the Wangshu Sword.

292
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,930
Even if I have to exchange my life for her life,

293
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,760
I will exchange my life for Lingsha's primordial spirit.

294
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:46,820
Tianhe,

295
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,220
I'm not worthy of you doing this for me.

296
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:52,930
Wild man,

297
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,410
listen,

298
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,980
you must take back the Wangshu Sword.

299
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,650
I will also do my best for you.

300
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,290
Lord Beike,

301
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,960
the armor is about to be completed soon.

302
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:18,490
You old demon,

303
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,920
give my father's sword

304
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,770
and Lingsha's primordial spirit back to me.

305
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,050
Your father's sword?

306
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,300
Then go ask your father, Yun Tianqing,

307
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,410
why I want to destroy the Wangshu Sword.

308
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:29,760
The Wangshu Sword is Qionghua's sacred weapon.

309
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,330
I won't let you destroy it.

310
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:32,850
Let me be honest with you.

311
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,370
After I destroy the Wangshu Sword,

312
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,610
all of you humans will die.

313
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:23,660
Feng Xie.

314
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:42,680
I really miss

315
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,760
our peaceful life in Chao Lake

316
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,770
over the past 19 years.

317
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,230
It would be great

318
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,140
if there were less resentment or hatred, right?

319
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,090
Demon,

320
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,970
if you give the Wangshu Sword back to us,

321
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,570
we can avoid a fierce battle.

322
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,090
I won't be like her.

323
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:06,190
I have planned this for 19 years

324
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:08,450
and I'm not going to ruin it just for love.

325
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,690
You use the Wangshu Sword to kill demons.

326
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:22,530
Today,

327
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:25,450
I'm going to kill you with the Wangshu Sword first.

328
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,330
Uncle.

329
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:32,700
-Uncle.
-Uncle.

330
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:36,080
Uncle Dao Zhen.

331
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,280
The sword aura slash.

332
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:38,200
Ready the sword formation.

333
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:38,840
Okay.

334
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,570
The mind spell armor.

335
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:57,320
Yes.

336
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:59,600
This is the armor I created

337
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,130
with 3,000 primordial spirits.

338
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:02,960
The cold aura of the Wangshu Sword

339
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,440
can't hurt me at all.

340
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,140
And the longer I hold the Wangshu Sword,

341
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:11,190
the more serious backfire the 3,000 primordial spirits will suffer.

342
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:05,740
Wild guy,

343
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,740
if you help me stop them and let me leave,

344
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,140
I'll keep Lingsha alive. What do you think?

345
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:11,090
Ziying,

346
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,120
the lost Wangshu Sword can be retrieved again.

347
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,290
But the primordial spirits of Lingsha and those 3,000 people

348
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:16,410
can't be destroyed like this.

349
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,080
Yun Tianhe,

350
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,240
don't believe him.

351
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,120
This sword is very important to Qionghua and the world.

352
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,730
I won't let you leave with it.

353
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,390
I don't care about the Wangshu Sword

354
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,400
or Qionghua Sect.

355
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,020
Lingsha and the 3,000 primordial spirits

356
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,420
are very important to me.

357
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,490
My father also said

358
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,380
everything can be destroyed,

359
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:32,640
except lives.

360
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:33,880
Wild guy,

361
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,450
why don't you fight side by side with me?

362
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,110
Yun Tianhe,

363
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:51,870
what your father said is right.

364
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:52,790
But do you know

365
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,850
if he destroys the sword,

366
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:56,130
not only can't we save Miss Han or the 3,000 primordial spirits,

367
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,410
but it will put everyone in this world in misery?

368
00:20:58,410 --> 00:20:59,650
If we try our best to stop him,

369
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,570
maybe all of us and Miss Han will die,

370
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,830
but it can save numerous people's lives.

371
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,910
Don't be deceived by this demon.

372
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,800
Tianhe,

373
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,140
don't be fooled by that evil demon again.

374
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,530
Do you remember what your father told you?

375
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:22,890
Tianhe

376
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,230
has the strongest power in the world.

377
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,820
I'm worried that if he is used by someone after going down the mountain,

378
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,500
the world will be in chaos

379
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,060
and the people will suffer.

380
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,130
My father also told me

381
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,440
if I'm used by evil people,

382
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,040
everyone in the world will be in misery.

383
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,010
How can I associate with you, an evil demon?

384
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:47,870
I'm going to put up a desperate fight with you today.

385
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:49,490
Bring it on then.

386
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,280
There are 3,000 primordial spirits in his armor.

387
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,410
Touching his armor will hurt these primordial spirits.

388
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,160
Then Lingsha...

389
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,340
Remove the formation now!

390
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:19,730
Lingsha.

391
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:22,400
Lingsha.

392
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:28,640
Come on.

393
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,170
Remove the formation now!

394
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:47,050
Stop!

395
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:48,870
Remove the formation now.

396
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,050
Dao Zhen, remove the formation now.

397
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:52,730
No.

398
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,000
If we remove it now, we will definitely suffer a backfire.

399
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:57,890
No!

400
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,460
Tianhe!

401
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,280
Yun Tianhe, do you want to die?

402
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,810
Tianhe.

403
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:26,970
You cowardly humans.

404
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,730
Since you don't have the guts to hurt me,

405
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,290
let me enjoy killing you.

406
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:50,380
I... can't let Lingsha get hurt.

407
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:01,340
Tianhe, be careful!

408
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,310
Tianhe!

409
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:04,760
Tianhe.

410
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,550
Since the Wangshu Sword can hurt you,

411
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:08,470
it means you're not its host.

412
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:18,000
Wild guy,

413
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,460
I really underestimated you.

414
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,120
If you want to live...

415
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,540
My life is up to me,

416
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:36,850
not you.

417
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:17,920
Tianhe!

418
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:27,890
Lingsha, you're finally awake.

419
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:32,700
Mengli.

420
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,190
My primordial spirit could see

421
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,720
everything that happened.

422
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,570
I saw Tianhe

423
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,410
gave the Wangshu Sword to that demon for me.

424
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:45,330
I also saw him put up a desperate fight with that demon.

425
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,010
Tell me where Tianhe is.

426
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,690
I need to find him.

427
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:49,340
Lingsha,

428
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:50,650
since you have woken up,

429
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:51,820
it means Mr. Yun and the others

430
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,220
have defeated the demon.

431
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:57,730
Tianhe.

432
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:58,570
Be careful.

433
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,720
You're really awake.

434
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,720
Ice Cube.

435
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,870
I saw you had a fierce battle with that demon.

436
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:07,980
Are you hurt?

437
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:09,840
I'm fine.

438
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:12,970
What about Tianhe? Why isn't he here?

439
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,180
He's tired.

440
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:16,380
He needs to rest.

441
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:22,400
Why am I feeling uneasy?

442
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:26,450
Are you lying to me?

443
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:27,890
Tianhe had a fierce battle with that demon

444
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:29,300
for me.

445
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,780
Theoretically, he should have come to check on me immediately.

446
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,870
Is he hurt?

447
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,060
Is he?

448
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:44,210
Uncle.

449
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:51,480
Mengli,

450
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:52,960
you have

451
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,200
Suhe Potion that can heal wounds quickly, right?

452
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,140
Use it on Tianhe.

453
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,570
Considering his wound,

454
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:09,410
I'm afraid Suhe Potion won't work.

455
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:11,010
How do you know it won't work?

456
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:12,850
It healed your wound, right?

457
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,850
Miss Han,

458
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,730
Mr. Yun was hurt by the Wangshu Sword.

459
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:17,350
Just now, Uncle transmitted his spiritual power into his body.

460
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,950
That's why he is still alive.

461
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,010
Now the cold aura

462
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:23,340
is approaching Mr. Yun's heart.

463
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,210
What should we do?

464
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,720
Ice Cube.

465
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:31,930
Senior Ziying,

466
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,600
I'm begging you.

467
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,790
Please do something to save Tianhe.

468
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,830
There is a way.

469
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,170
But...

470
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:43,850
But what?

471
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,580
But what? Tell me!

472
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,320
Mr. Murong,

473
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,240
do you have any difficulty?

474
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,090
The Wangshu Sword is extremely cold.

475
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:54,770
Although I can get the cold aura out of his body

476
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:56,050
through Qionghua's extraction technique,

477
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:57,440
I need someone with a cold body constitution

478
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,950
to perform the spell.

479
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,450
Currently, the person with a cold body constitution...

480
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,490
People with a cold body constitution are very rare.

481
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:07,900
It's not easy to find one.

482
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:08,920
I can do it.

483
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,040
When we were in the Tomb of Prince Yunan,

484
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,210
That old Yunan

485
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:14,330
wanted to possess me because of my body constitution, right?

486
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:15,970
I can help you perform the extraction technique.

487
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:16,890
I see.

488
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:20,050
Mr. Murong is worried about your health, Lingsha.

489
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:22,920
Miss Han,

490
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,360
most people with a cold body constitution are weak.

491
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,840
And you just woke up from the Sleep Condition.

492
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,290
If you perform the extraction technique now,

493
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:30,600
even if you won't die, you will...

494
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,730
My lifespan will be shortened, right?

495
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,960
The meaning of my life

496
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:36,410
is to save those who are important to me.

497
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:39,310
Tianhe risked his life to save me.

498
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,680
How can I not save him?

499
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,450
Lingsha.

500
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:43,830
Mengli, Ice Cube,

501
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,290
you know me.

502
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:51,330
Okay.

503
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,720
Don't be impatient.

504
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,970
Follow my lead.

505
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:29,420
The cold aura is coming out.

506
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,440
Keep going.

507
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:20,610
The ice silk has Mr. Yun's blood on it.

508
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,880
Enough, Miss Han.

509
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:25,800
Enough.

510
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:36,030
Tianhe has become warmer.

511
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:37,730
He will wake up, right?

512
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,450
You're awake.

513
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,170
Lingsha.

514
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,400
This time,

515
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,350
I'm really a little tired.

516
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:01,510
Lingsha.

517
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:43,440
Mr. Murong,

518
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:45,670
are you going to check on Lingsha?

519
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,540
This is the medicine

520
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,330
decocted with piper cubeba and the nut grass Elder Qingyang gave me.

521
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:52,170
It's good for dispelling coldness and nourishing vitality.

522
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:52,780
You...

523
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:55,790
deliver it to Miss Han.

524
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:57,810
Why don't we go together?

525
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:03,970
Mr. Murong,

526
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:07,040
yesterday, you helped Lingsha perform the extraction technique.

527
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,350
You should go take a look at her

528
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,010
and see how she's recovering.

529
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:12,040
Uncle.

530
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:15,489
Uncle.

531
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:16,750
You are in such a hurry.

532
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:19,170
Is there any other problem

533
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,610
with the 3,000 people in the Sleep Condition in Chenzhou?

534
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:22,139
We checked on all the people one by one.

535
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:24,020
A girl named Ouyang Mingzhu

536
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,300
still hasn't woken up.

537
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,489
Why hasn't she woken up?

538
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:28,570
More strangely,

539
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,120
this girl fell into a sleep

540
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,080
nine years ago.

541
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:32,400
Nine years ago?

542
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:33,820
But the Sleep Condition appeared

543
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,300
only a few days ago, right?

544
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:36,840
The Ouyang family has been doing business for generations.

545
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,699
Nine years ago,

546
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,620
Lord Ouyang and his wife suddenly died.

547
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,230
So Miss Ouyang was depressed

548
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:42,350
and has never woken up.

549
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:44,770
She has been taken in by Uncle Zhong, an old servant.

550
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:46,030
I got it. You may leave.

551
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:47,290
Okay.

552
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:07,210
You're here.

553
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:10,240
Did Miss Han ever wake up?

554
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,950
Was there anything wrong with her?

555
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:14,810
Yesterday, she was thirsty in the middle of the night.

556
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:15,650
But...

557
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:17,780
the water I got her was a bit hot.

558
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:19,300
She even hit my belly

559
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:20,920
and called me a stupid wild man.

560
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,320
It was very typical of Lingsha.

561
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,250
Mr. Yun,

562
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:26,970
this is the cold medicine Mr. Murong made for Lingsha.

563
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:27,970
Remember to let her drink it.

564
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:28,480
Okay.

565
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:30,450
When Lingsha wakes up later,

566
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:31,320
I'll tell her

567
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:32,650
Ziying made this.

568
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:33,530
I should let her know

569
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:35,410
Ziying's heart is not as cold as ice.

570
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:36,120
Well...

571
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:37,360
no need.

572
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:43,390
Lingsha.

573
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:44,940
Lingsha,

574
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:45,810
you're awake.

575
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:46,770
Where am I?

576
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,100
Mengli and Ziying are worried about you.

577
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,130
Ziying even delivered the cold medicine

578
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:52,570
he made for you here.

579
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,770
Lingsha, what are you looking for?

580
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:00,630
Let me help you.

581
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:07,600
Lingsha?

582
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:12,480
Who are you guys?

583
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:13,610
Miss,

584
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:15,290
do you know where you are?

585
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,650
I don't know where I am.

586
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:19,390
I must still be in my dream.

587
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:21,810
I'm Tianhe.

588
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,950
She is Mengli. He is Ziying.

589
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:24,350
We all are living people.

590
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:25,450
What do you mean by in your dream?

591
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:27,050
Do you know what your name is?

592
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,000
Mingzhu.

593
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,410
Ouyang Mingzhu.

594
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:31,160
Her primordial spirit

595
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,810
is the person Huaishuo mentioned who still hasn't woken up.

596
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:35,210
This bead is flickering.

597
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,560
Only when two people's primordial spirits

598
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,530
are respectively trapped in objects whose spiritual sources are connected

599
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,000
can it lead to the transference of consciousness.

600
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,800
That's right.

601
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,720
It means there's another bead

602
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:44,390
trapping Miss Ouyang.

603
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:46,410
That's why her primordial spirit accidentally entered Lingsha's body.

604
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:47,920
I don't know what you're talking about.

605
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,450
You must have mistaken me for someone else.

606
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:50,430
I'm not Lingsha.

607
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:55,340
You can't leave.

608
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,240
You're in Lingsha's body now.

609
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,890
Miss Ouyang,

610
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,400
If you don't believe us,

611
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,860
you can look in the mirror.

612
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:12,540
This is impossible.

613
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
This is not me.

614
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:15,810
I must still be in my dream.

615
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:16,760
Miss Ouyang,

616
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,690
calm down.

617
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,680
It's complicated.

618
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:21,510
But for now, I can only tell you

619
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,380
your primordial spirit is inside the body

620
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,690
of our good friend, Lingsha.

621
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:25,820
Primordial spirit?

622
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:28,030
How could this happen?

623
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,840
You guys, please find a way to switch our primordial spirits back as soon as possible.

624
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,450
My husband is still waiting for me.

625
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:34,400
Husband?

626
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,200
Over the past nine years,

627
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,330
you've been living with your husband?

628
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:37,960
Yes.

629
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,690
We've never been apart.

630
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:41,250
Miss Ouyang,

631
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,930
can you tell us

632
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,480
how you spent every day?

633
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:48,770
The Ouyang family can be counted as a big business family in Chenzhou.

634
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:50,290
I'm the only daughter in the family.

635
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:51,690
And my parents dote on me.

636
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,170
Blessed by God,

637
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,580
I married a good man.

638
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:56,640
But I don't know when

639
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:59,430
I started to be disturbed by nightmares.

640
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,530
[Ouyang Mingzhu]

641
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:19,910
Put this divination stick under your pillow

642
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:22,640
and you won't be disturbed by weird dreams again.

643
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:39,610
Did you have a weird dream again?

644
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:42,060
As long as I can see you when I wake up,

645
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,700
I'm not afraid of any kind of dream.

646
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,460
[Li Jiangliu]

647
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,520
I'll go to Qianfo Temple to pick you up

648
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:53,820
to enjoy lotus flowers on a boat, okay?

649
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:56,300
Then I'm going to get ready.

650
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:02,040
Young Miss,

651
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,300
you're finally awake.

652
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:05,520
The food for breakfast has been heated for three times.

653
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,180
Tomorrow is Lord's birthday.

654
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:09,290
She must be too tired

655
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:10,370
from preparing a birthday gift.

656
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:11,140
Young Miss,

657
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:12,010
what's wrong?

658
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,280
I'm thinking about my dream.

659
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:15,170
Young Miss,

660
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,020
Uncle Zhong is waiting outside.

661
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:18,750
After you have breakfast,

662
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,650
let's go to Qianfo Temple to pray.

663
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:23,240
Then you won't have weird dreams anymore.

664
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,650
Tomorrow is my father's birthday.

665
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,520
We've been busy preparing birthday gifts these days.

666
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,610
Looks like you've been living in a dream all the time.

667
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:32,650
You don't know

668
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,010
a lot of things have happened in real life.

669
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:36,280
Miss Mengli,

670
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,660
I don't understand what you mean.

671
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,970
What we said and what you see now

672
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:41,930
are the reality.

673
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:44,400
Miss Ouyang, go wash up and get some rest first.

674
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,090
I'm afraid you need to come with us

675
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:47,930
to tell what the reality is

676
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,660
and what your dream is.

677
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,480
Ouyang Mingzhu has been sleeping for nine years.

678
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:05,360
Even if she goes back with the look of Lingsha now,

679
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,490
her parents must be very happy, right?

680
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,440
Her parents already died

681
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:13,620
before she fell into a sleep.

682
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,100
Then... soon, she's about to know

683
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,920
her parents are dead, right?

684
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:21,100
I can't imagine how sad she would be.

685
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,700
But she has to face the reality sooner or later.

686
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,840
I can feel

687
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,700
Miss Ouyang has been very happy

688
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,380
over the past nine years in her so-called dream.

689
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,970
Did the spellcaster make a dream

690
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,800
to prevent her from facing the reality?

691
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,930
The most important thing now is to get Lingsha's primordial spirit back.

692
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:37,160
I'm going to the house of Uncle Zhong, who has been taking care of Miss Ouyang, to take a look.

693
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:37,890
You stay here

694
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,320
and protect Miss Ouyang.

695
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:39,850
Okay.

696
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,120
Uncle.

697
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:42,570
Uncle,

698
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,280
Uncle Zhong said

699
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,960
Miss Ouyang suddenly has weak vital signs.

700
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,650
What?

701
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:49,300
If anything happens to her,

702
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,880
Lingsha won't be able to come back.

703
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,060
Where is Uncle Zhong now?

704
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,220
He's at the door.

705
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,330
I'm going with Uncle Zhong to check on Miss Ouyang.

706
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:56,280
You go check

707
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:58,560
if there is someone called Master Jingxin in Chenzhou.

708
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,170
-Okay.
-Okay.

709
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:00,250
I'll send you messages at any time.

710
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,520
Taking good care of Miss Ouyang

711
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,930
means protecting Miss Han.

712
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:03,570
Okay.

713
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:04,140
Let's go.
