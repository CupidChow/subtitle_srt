[Episode 4]

4
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,570
There's a murderous aura.

5
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,630
Tianhe.

6
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:56,820
He...

7
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,490
He is my friend.

8
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,960
He is your friend?

9
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,310
So you're Lingsha's friend.

10
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,960
I'm also Lingsha's friend.

11
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:14,830
This

12
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,100
is for you.

13
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,560
It's a little cold. I hope you don't mind.

14
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,680
Tianhe.

15
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,440
His Sword Recognition technique

16
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,130
is famous in the martial world.

17
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:26,960
He can find out the origin

18
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,360
of all swords he touches.

19
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:30,870
Hold this for me.

20
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,030
Can you help me

21
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,760
find out the origin of my sword?

22
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,800
Lingsha, why do I feel you have a murderous aura?

23
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,030
Friend!

24
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,600
I wanted to ask his name.

25
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,730
That young senior too.

26
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,270
Just as I was about to ask his name,

27
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,460
he vanished.

28
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,980
The young senior is called Murong Ziying.

29
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,570
How do you know?

30
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,150
It's strange.

31
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,780
The sword is already in the scabbard.

32
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,840
Why did your friend

33
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,500
seem like he couldn't lift it?

34
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,700
Is there something wrong with this scabbard too?

35
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:28,960
Take it.

36
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,170
Forget about that.

37
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:35,950
Lingsha,

38
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,180
are you some big shot

39
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,560
who has done something big before?

40
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,550
Why do you say that?

41
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,079
Just now,

42
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,350
they were putting your portrait up over there.

43
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:46,910
Mine?

44
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,110
I was afraid they would take it away,

45
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,370
so I brought it for you.

46
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,300
Take a look.

47
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,520
It looks exactly like you.

48
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,270
Really?

49
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,390
You almost killed me.

50
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,390
Calm down.

51
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,350
I know it's a bit ugly.

52
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,670
It's not about whether it's ugly or not.

53
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,110
Let's go.

54
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:09,750
My...

55
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,550
Just leave it.

56
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,230
My tofu.

57
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:18,600
It's you.

58
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:19,740
Take a look

59
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,649
and see if my friend is the one you drew.

60
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:23,060
Shut up!

61
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,100
You female thief,

62
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,990
surrender now!

63
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,240
Me?

64
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,040
Open your eyes and look carefully.

65
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,550
How am I a thief?

66
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,510
Our Lingsha

67
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,070
is a heroine.

68
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:35,630
Young man,

69
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,270
it was you who took the wanted notice

70
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,460
and helped us catch the thief.

71
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,190
Why are you protecting her now?

72
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,870
What wanted notice?

73
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,470
I saw that this portrait

74
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,159
looks like Lingsha,

75
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,560
so I just showed it to her.

76
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,040
Get out of the way

77
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,650
or I'll arrest you too.

78
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,360
I'll be responsible for my actions.

79
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,590
I tore the portrait down.

80
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,670
Arrest me if you want.

81
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,230
Move.

82
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,620
Constable Pei.

83
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,900
I heard that the female thief has been found.

84
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:04,950
It's her.

85
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,880
Also, this stupid brat

86
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,810
clearly took the notice,

87
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,980
but now, he's protecting the thief.

88
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,190
If you dare call Lingsha a thief again,

89
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,590
I won't act nice anymore.

90
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,940
Who are you? How dare you stop government officials from working?

91
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,470
I am the mountain peak's wild man, Yun Tianhe.

92
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:28,230
Are you from Taiping Village's Yun family?

93
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,720
What's your father's name?

94
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,630
What?

95
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:33,940
Your dad.

96
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,530
My dad is Yun Tianqing.

97
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,750
Are you really the son of

98
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,080
Yun Tianqing, Hero Yun?

99
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,630
Put down your swords.

100
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:46,390
You called my dad Hero Yun?

101
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:47,670
You know him?

102
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,110
Mr. Yun.

103
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:50,630
I'm Pei Jian.

104
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,790
Hero Yun is good friends with Lord Liu.

105
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,800
Lord Liu has been

106
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,510
searching for him all these years.

107
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,600
I didn't expect to meet you today.

108
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:01,600
Please follow me

109
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,880
to Lord Liu's mansion.

110
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,120
But this lady

111
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,670
has to go to the government office with the officials.

112
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,930
Constable Pei,

113
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,320
think about it.

114
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,130
Your lord is a friend of Tianhe's father.

115
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,590
Tianhe and I are best friends now.

116
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,840
How can you arrest your own people?

117
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,830
You look very similar to that wanted criminal.

118
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,250
I dare not be biased.

119
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,970
Then I’ll go with Lingsha.

120
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,990
I go wherever she goes.

121
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:30,190
Yes.

122
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:30,790
If you dare,

123
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,190
arrest both of us to the government office.

124
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,430
Miss,

125
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,620
Mr. Yun values friendship.

126
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:39,700
If he goes to jail because of you,

127
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,790
you will negatively affect him

128
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,620
and also tarnish Hero Yun's name.

129
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,310
What?

130
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,790
Why would she tarnish my dad's name?

131
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:52,510
Tianhe,

132
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,840
go to Lord Liu's mansion with him.

133
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,790
It's important to know more about your father.

134
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,260
Well,

135
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:00,030
don't let your guard down completely.

136
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,350
If someone tells you something you don't understand,

137
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,260
just say, "Oh."

138
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,040
Keep an eye on you sword.

139
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,170
I'll find you later.

140
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,190
Don't worry, Mr. Yun.

141
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,290
I'll instruct them

142
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,030
to not hurt the lady.

143
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,590
Mr. Yun, please come with me.

144
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,470
Please.

145
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,190
Lingsha, be careful.

146
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,770
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

147
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:24,940
You better be fine.

148
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:34,180
Let's go.

149
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,650
This is the first time we've separated.

150
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,180
Why didn't he call out to me?

151
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:28,410
This sword can absorb spiritual power.

152
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:32,309
I can't hold the sword.

153
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:37,850
Su Yu,

154
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:41,590
is your son also

155
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,000
the host of Wangshu, like you?

156
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,250
Escort him up the mountain.

157
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,160
Kill anyone who takes the sword.

158
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,710
Do not fail.

159
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:00,960
The Wangshu Sword

160
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,590
must be mine.

161
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:11,030
[Liu Mansion]

162
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,800
Mr. Yun, we're here.

163
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,330
How has Hero Yun been these days?

164
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,350
Even if you catch me 100 times,

165
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,310
I will still come back.

166
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:15,640
Move.

167
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,290
Constable Pei.

168
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,420
Why is it him again?

169
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,830
This is the fifth time I've caught him.

170
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:21,830
He never gives up.

171
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,230
He swam through the outer canal this time.

172
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:24,750
Wait.

173
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,300
My lady said

174
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,300
this is the most effective medicine against colds.

175
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,180
Even dying is worth a glimpse of the great daughter of Liu,

176
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,260
let alone going to jail.

177
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,080
Take him away.

178
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:38,850
Go.

179
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,360
What does "going to jail" mean?

180
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,270
It's a cage

181
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:48,530
used to lock up those who violate the law.

182
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,650
And what is the great daughter of Liu?

183
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,050
You have to go to jail after seeing her?

184
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,200
The great daughter of Liu he mentioned

185
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,630
is the young miss of the Liu family.

186
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,120
So scary.

187
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,720
You are humorous.

188
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,210
Please come in.

189
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,910
Mr. Yun, please wait here.

190
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,470
I'll report it to my Lord.

191
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,390
This is for me?

192
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,170
Please enjoy.

193
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,520
Thank you.

194
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,480
We just got rid of Ge Dalu.

195
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,350
How come Constable Pei brought back another wild boy?

196
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,780
He's probably another guy in love with the young miss.

197
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,840
Look, he's wearing coarse clothing.

198
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,230
My good nephew.

199
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:03,950
My good nephew.

200
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,080
What? My name is Yun Tianhe.

201
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,280
I know.

202
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:12,320
Your father, Yun Tianqing, is like a brother to me,

203
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,610
[Liu Shifeng]

204
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,370
so you are my nephew.

205
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,870
You're all grown up.

206
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,240
Let me take a good look.

207
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,680
Lingsha said I should be wary of people I just met.

208
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,040
Let me test if this fatty

209
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,350
truly knows my dad.

210
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:28,960
How about this?

211
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:32,200
Do I look like my dad?

212
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:33,100
You...

213
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:37,530
Your father is handsome and has a great body.

214
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,310
You...

215
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,030
The handsome aura between your brows

216
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,560
is just like your father's.

217
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,080
You do know my dad.

218
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,280
My dad said

219
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,230
that I don't look like him at all,

220
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,610
except my eyebrows.

221
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:55,920
Lord Liu.

222
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,260
Don't call me Lord.

223
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,240
Just call me Uncle.

224
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,030
Unc Liu?

225
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:07,210
I'm Tianhe and you're Unc.

226
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,790
We really are like a family.

227
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,910
Yes, we're a family.

228
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,110
Come, sit down.

229
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:17,160
Your father and I are like brothers.

230
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,150
Does he often mention me in front of you?

231
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,310
Nope.

232
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,950
My dad didn’t tell me anything at Qingluan Peak,

233
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,810
other than teaching me the sword.

234
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,380
This is my first time coming down the mountain.

235
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,010
That old man never mentioned me?

236
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,750
That's why I think you're quite unre...

237
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,110
Very simple and honest.

238
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:45,600
Lord.

239
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,430
Hurry over.

240
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,950
Look who it is.

241
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:52,680
This is Hero Yun's son?

242
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,120
Tian Yun...

243
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,960
Introduce yourself.

244
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,980
My name is Yun Tianhe.

245
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,310
This is my wife,

246
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,550
Ruan Ci.

247
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,740
Just call her Aunt.

248
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:08,860
Ant Liu.

249
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:10,750
Great.

250
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,650
[Ruan Ci]

251
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,430
I heard from the maid

252
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,770
that you're wearing coarse fabric,

253
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,420
so I prepared some clothes for you

254
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,620
They're in your room.

255
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,460
You can go wash and change now.

256
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,030
No need.

257
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,310
I always dress like this on the mountain.

258
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,680
You don't have to be so polite to me.

259
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,020
Ant is so nice to me.

260
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,860
Other than my dad,

261
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,270
no one else has prepared clothes for me before.

262
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,810
It must've been hard for my brother

263
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,130
to raise his kid.

264
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,120
When will he come down the mountain?

265
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,210
I can't wait.

266
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,030
I forgot to tell my dad.

267
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,120
Hold on.

268
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,320
You can still contact him here?

269
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:50,520
Dad,

270
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,760
I met your best friends

271
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,390
Unc Liu and Ant Liu today.

272
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,630
You must be happy too, right?

273
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:58,320
Look.

274
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:01,930
[Yun Tianqing]

275
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:08,040
Could it be that my good brother

276
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,210
has passed away?

277
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,470
My poor child.

278
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:14,620
I...

279
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,150
We should have found you sooner.

280
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:21,530
My good brother Tianqing!

281
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,390
Unc Liu,

282
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,060
my dad said

283
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,180
that he hates it when men cry.

284
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:29,990
I'm not crying yet.

285
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,390
Old Chongguang!

286
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,480
[Qingfeng Valley]

287
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,670
Old Chongguang!

288
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,370
Look what I found.

289
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:00,430
Nut grass treats the depression in your body.

290
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,080
You old man,

291
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,800
[Chongguang]

292
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,440
all you do is cultivate.

293
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,520
Listen.

294
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,420
Without this thing replenishing you,

295
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,230
[Qingyang]

296
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:10,270
Sooner or later, you'll become an old tree root.

297
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,430
Ziying.

298
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,480
Elder Qingyang.

299
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,350
Ziying,

300
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:26,570
give me the rice wine you brought for me.

301
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:28,920
I was in a hurry this time,

302
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,960
so I didn't bring any rice wine.

303
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,540
You're becoming more and more unfilial.

304
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,920
I finally got the nut grass,

305
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,980
but you didn't bring me any rice wine.

306
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:38,960
Elder Qingyang.

307
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,590
Ziying, what's the urgent matter?

308
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,680
Elder Chongguang,

309
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,690
sorry for disturbing you.

310
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:48,800
I have a confusion.

311
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,460
Is there anyone in the world

312
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,720
who hasn't cultivated yet but has strong spiritual power

313
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,780
and can communicate with the spirits of all organisms?

314
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,320
Why would you ask such a stupid question?

315
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,240
Cultivating the elixir

316
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,300
is the root of the spiritual power of cultivators.

317
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,930
How can one be strong for no reason?

318
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,080
Even if one was born with some spiritual power,

319
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,340
those who can perform Spirit Communication without cultivating

320
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,810
must be delusional.

321
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:14,130
Elders, have you reached this stage?

322
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,880
Spirit Communication

323
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,560
requires one to reach the seventh level of the Tai Qing Realm.

324
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,750
Back then, the four of us

325
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,630
went in isolation for ten years,

326
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,560
but no one successfully ascended.

327
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,000
What's so good about Spirit Communication?

328
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,630
Take my nut grass as an example.

329
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,810
If I were able to communicate with it

330
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:31,040
and I knew it's pleading at me,

331
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,220
should I still eat it or not?

332
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,400
How can I strengthen my body if I don't eat it?

333
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,290
Old man,

334
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,340
I think the more nutrients you get,

335
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,670
the crazier you become.

336
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,550
Ziying,

337
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,860
why do you ask?

338
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,390
Did you meet some strange talent?

339
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,130
I don't dare to speak brashly.

340
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,590
I'm still investigating.

341
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,240
This little ant dares to eat my nut grass.

342
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,290
Elder.

343
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,270
Give it to me.

344
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,280
Ziying,

345
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,069
Why did you save it?

346
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:21,839
The Qionghua way

347
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,980
is to help the weak.

348
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:26,280
If it turns into a demon,

349
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,210
will you still save it?

350
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,800
Today, it is just an ordinary being.

351
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,180
It should be saved when in danger.

352
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,410
If it turns into a demon in the future,

353
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:38,410
it must be killed.

354
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:41,630
Ziying,

355
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,020
you must remember

356
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:45,950
that no matter how kind it was before,

357
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:48,630
its nature will change if it turns into a demon.

358
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:50,960
I will remember.

359
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,660
You old man.

360
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,780
Ziying rarely comes here

361
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,430
and you're snatching the chance to lecture him.

362
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,400
What are you doing?

363
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,260
Let me tell you.

364
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,550
He received Senior Zong Lian's teachings,

365
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,710
but strictly speaking,

366
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,350
he's the disciple of all three of us.

367
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,950
He's not just your disciple.

368
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:08,710
Ziying,

369
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,600
I'll teach you to make medicine today.

370
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,200
Come here.

371
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:13,440
Tianhe,

372
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,580
the dinner today

373
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,540
was prepared specially for you.

374
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:18,750
Eat up.

375
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,090
Why aren't you eating?

376
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:26,610
Lingsha said

377
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:29,430
that I can't eat others' food casually.

378
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,680
If I want to eat it, I have to pay for it,

379
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:32,940
but...

380
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:34,970
But I don't have money.

381
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,910
Let me tell you.

382
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,430
We are family.

383
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,240
You don't need to pay family.

384
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:44,210
I...

385
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:45,290
Try it.

386
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,750
When your father came before,

387
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,670
we hosted him like this too.

388
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:53,000
If my father can eat it, then I can eat too.

389
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,910
Of course.

390
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,270
Try my cooking.

391
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,040
Thank you.

392
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:01,310
Here.

393
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,070
Eat.

394
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,950
How can the meat taste like this?

395
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,950
It's even better than roasted meat.

396
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,460
It's so delicious.

397
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,060
What do you think? My nephew is great, right?

398
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,440
Of course, Hero Yun's son is great.

399
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,960
Call Li here and let them meet.

400
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,520
I called her already.

401
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,460
I'll get you some honey wine.

402
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,880
There's wine?

403
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:34,390
Unc Liu,

404
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,210
I came down the mountain

405
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:38,430
to figure out what happened to my dad,

406
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,990
but after I went to the Taiping Village,

407
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:41,920
the people there

408
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,260
told me that my dad

409
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:46,220
was naughty when he was young.

410
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,630
Nonsense. How could he have been naughty?

411
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,040
Your father was a bit rebellious,

412
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,440
but he definitely

413
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,570
wanted to be a hero who helped needy people.

414
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:58,720
Back then,

415
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:01,620
I'd just come to work as the county magistrate

416
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,790
and I encountered thugs on the road.

417
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,940
It was your father who saved

418
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,640
my wife and I.

419
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,080
Nineteen years ago,

420
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,480
the city had a demonic rebellion.

421
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:16,180
Again, it was your father who flew down on a sword

422
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,210
and slayed the demons,

423
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,870
saving the people of the city.

424
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,100
He also saved my daughter from the demons.

425
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:26,710
Since then,

426
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,310
I treated him as my benefactor

427
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,000
and we became brothers.

428
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,470
So, my dad

429
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:40,170
really could fly from the sky to slay demons?

430
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,280
Was he really a Sword Immortal?

431
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,280
Elders, greetings from Su Yao.

432
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,660
Greetings, Grandmaster.

433
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:57,570
Ziying,

434
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,830
The Innate Bagua Formation has detected

435
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:02,070
overflowing evil aura near Nyuluo Cliff.

436
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,440
Go and investigate it.

437
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:05,470
Yes.

438
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,010
Be careful at all times.

439
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:14,830
Su Yao.

440
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,270
It's been a while since you visited us.

441
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,330
Something must have happened today.

442
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,310
Elders.

443
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:23,850
You must have seen the unusual condition Xihe is in.

444
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:25,920
Xuan Xiao

445
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,710
is awake.

446
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,900
He wants to see you two elders.

447
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:34,830
No thanks.

448
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,070
Please leave.

449
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:45,640
Elder Qingyang.

450
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:49,860
I should be abstaining from the consumption of grains today.

451
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,670
Excuse me.

452
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:03,350
Madam.

453
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,150
Where is Young Miss?

454
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,220
I told her about it.

455
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:08,140
But she doesn't want to see him.

456
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,110
Okay, I got it.

457
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,110
Unc Liu.

458
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,720
What about my mother?

459
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,250
What kind of person was she?

460
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:23,950
I've never heard about your mother,

461
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:26,030
not to mention seeing her.

462
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,040
That's impossible.

463
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:32,100
My mother is the most important person to my father.

464
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:33,540
And my mother...

465
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,480
It smells so good.

466
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,970
T-This is honey wine?

467
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,830
Try and get Li here again.

468
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:54,640
Who is Li?

469
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:57,760
Li is my daughter.

470
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:59,380
Daughter?

471
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:03,160
So she is the great daughter of Liu?

472
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:06,120
Forget it. I can't see her.

473
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,910
What if she puts me in prison?

474
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:13,270
Li is not feeling well.

475
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,910
You can't see her anyway.

476
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,660
Didn't she just say that she isn't feeling well?

477
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:18,870
Here.

478
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:19,560
That's a relief.

479
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,290
Let's drink.

480
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,710
No, I can't drink.

481
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:27,850
Lingsha said

482
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,960
this wine

483
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:32,550
smells good, but it doesn't taste good.

484
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,240
And one will talk nonsense after drinking it.

485
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,360
You either become a lunatic or a fool.

486
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:38,410
Nonsense.

487
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:40,430
Your father loves this wine the most.

488
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,960
I've been saving it for him.

489
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:42,910
Here.

490
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,350
Let's drink.

491
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:47,590
Take it as drinking with me on behalf of your father.

492
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,930
Then I'll drink with you on behalf of my father.

493
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:52,630
Here.

494
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:05,810
How is it?

495
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:09,700
This wine is so delicious.

496
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:11,860
It's also sweet.

497
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,040
I...

498
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,110
I feel like

499
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:23,490
I'm floating.

500
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:25,240
The alcohol is getting to him.

501
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,370
I think I can be the Sword Immortal too.

502
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:30,170
Slow down.

503
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,260
C-Can I drink more?

504
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,120
Come on.

505
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,120
Lingsha...

506
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,780
must have drunk fake wine.

507
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:44,750
I realized that not only does

508
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:46,140
this real wine smell good,

509
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,870
but it also tastes even better.

510
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:49,150
Tianhe.

511
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:52,580
You seem to take heed of Miss Lingsha's words.

512
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,690
How long have you known each other?

513
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,780
I've known her for a long time.

514
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,660
It's been days.

515
00:24:58,770 --> 00:24:59,390
Lingsha

516
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:01,440
was even the first friend I made

517
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,800
since I was born.

518
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:04,810
Just a few days.

519
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:08,720
However,

520
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,100
my nephew,

521
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:11,910
I know that

522
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,740
Miss Lingsha is not that simple-minded.

523
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:17,550
I heard from the woodcutter

524
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,190
that they found a female thief

525
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:20,850
on the mountain a few days ago.

526
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,850
The facial composite drawn according to his statement

527
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,510
looks exactly like this girl.

528
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:26,900
Impossible.

529
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,680
Lingsha is a good person. She can't be a thief.

530
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,190
She's just a little weird sometimes.

531
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,190
But she...

532
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:39,430
That means you've never met a good lady.

533
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,370
My daughter is the best lady in Shouyang.

534
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:46,630
She's kind, beautiful and talented.

535
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,790
Do you know how many men are chasing her?

536
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,190
Instead of

537
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,900
being my nephew,

538
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,870
why don't you be my son-in-law?

539
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,200
Son-in-law?

540
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:02,830
Good.

541
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:03,790
It's a deal.

542
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,060
He really can't hold his liquor.

543
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:13,020
But this kid is really innately simple

544
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:16,310
and pure. I'm fond of him.

545
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:18,490
My Lord.

546
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,720
But he kept going on about Lingsha.

547
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:23,800
All men are bound

548
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,270
to have several romantic encounters.

549
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:27,360
Besides,

550
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:30,250
how can a petty thief compare to my daughter?

551
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,320
If you dare to bully him again,

552
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:49,550
I'll beat you to a pulp!

553
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,260
I won't do it again.

554
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:54,820
Thank you for saving me.

555
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,380
Otherwise, I'd be the one beaten to a pulp.

556
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,930
You're just a weak scholar. Why are you imprisoned here?

557
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,330
I just wanted to see Lady Liu's beauty.

558
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:06,400
So I came into Liu Mansion by swimming through the river.

559
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,480
You mean

560
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,410
you broke into Liu Mansion just to see a girl?

561
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,930
Not only are you a nerd but you're also obsessed with women.

562
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:17,430
Your parents supported your studies for nothing.

563
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:18,670
If you had the energy to swim,

564
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:19,470
you should become the number one scholar

565
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:21,400
and meet her in a dignified manner.

566
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:23,810
You're making me really want to hit you.

567
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:26,090
Your teachings have enlightened me.

568
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:32,510
Wait.

569
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,840
Don't try to trick me.

570
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,640
Employer?

571
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,240
Are you here to give me something?

572
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,550
Take him and the sword

573
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,270
to Qionghua.

574
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,150
You want me to bring Tianhe and the sword

575
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,100
to Qionghua?

576
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,040
You understood it.

577
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:52,990
Good.

578
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:54,690
You told me

579
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,100
to bring Tianhe and the sword to Shouyang

580
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,030
and I've done it.

581
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,310
It's your fault that you couldn't take the sword.

582
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,970
You can't go back on your word.

583
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:15,950
You hit people.

584
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,360
That's bad.

585
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:19,790
They bullied the weak.

586
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,150
I had to offer him help.

587
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:34,440
Tianhe. Tianhe.

588
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,510
You are really here.

589
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,440
You stupid wild man!

590
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,150
I'm in jail outside

591
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:55,410
but you're having a good sleep here after feasting?

592
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:58,130
You...

593
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,240
Wake up!

594
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,230
Wake up!

595
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,790
Don't touch me. Don't take my wine.

596
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,630
I still want to give it to Lingsha.

597
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,160
How much did you drink?

598
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:14,740
Get up!

599
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:16,230
G-Get up!

600
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,050
Wake up.

601
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,440
No way.

602
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,860
It's really you, Lingsha?

603
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:29,550
You...

604
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:33,020
Ling-Lingsha.

605
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,430
Try it.

606
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:39,000
This is my father's favorite honey wine.

607
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:39,800
You won't

608
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,560
talk nonsense after drinking this wine.

609
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,590
And

610
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:47,620
you'll feel like you're flying up to the sky like an immortal.

611
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,930
You're already talking nonsense.

612
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:50,820
It seems that the habit of drinking

613
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,350
is the only thing your father passed on to you.

614
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:57,120
I have another piece of good news for you.

615
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,800
My father

616
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:01,490
is really the Sword Immortal.

617
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:03,980
Not only did he save Unc Liu's family,

618
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:07,120
but he can also fly with a sword

619
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:08,270
and kill demons.

620
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,610
He really is a great hero.

621
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,780
This is indeed good news for you.

622
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,830
Try this honey wine now.

623
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:17,590
That...

624
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,340
Unc Liu?

625
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,430
Why does a county magistrate

626
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:22,160
go by such an undignified name?

627
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,640
I wonder about that too.

628
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,470
He also said

629
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:29,470
he wants me to be his son-in-law.

630
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,830
Son-in-law?

631
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:33,540
You agreed?

632
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:35,200
Yes.

633
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:36,970
Or did I not?

634
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,110
I...

635
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:41,030
I...

636
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,110
I think I just said "oh".

637
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:45,450
Didn't you tell me

638
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:47,600
to say "oh" when I don't understand it?

639
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:50,620
I didn't know this would happen.

640
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:51,790
Son-in-law?

641
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:53,850
A son-in-law is the one who has to marry their daughter.

642
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:55,020
As a county magistrate,

643
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,400
how could he let a stupid wild man like you

644
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,570
marry his daughter?

645
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,940
Marry his daughter?

646
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,600
Like how my father married my mother?

647
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,760
That's what it means.

648
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:06,520
But it's different!

649
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,580
Your father and mother

650
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,470
went through the process of knowing each other.

651
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,900
You don't even know what Unc Liu's daughter

652
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:11,830
looks like

653
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,520
and what kind of person she is.

654
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,610
Maybe she is

655
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,440
a heavy demon

656
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,040
who eats humans!

657
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:25,720
No wonder she's called the great daughter of Liu.

658
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:26,700
I also heard that

659
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:28,260
if I look at her,

660
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,690
I'll be put in prison!

661
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,750
It must be because one would rather go to prison

662
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,410
than take a second look at her.

663
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,020
That's why he wants a foolish wild man like you

664
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,280
to marry his daughter.

665
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:38,920
Why am I a fool?

666
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:39,920
You are a fool!

667
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,600
Let's go. Let's go.

668
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:43,520
Take your sword.

669
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:45,460
Hurry.

670
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,190
Leave the wine here!

671
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,440
Try the wine.

672
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:52,430
Wait.

673
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:52,980
Let's go.

674
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,120
Let's go. Hurry.

675
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,640
Godmother!

676
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:02,040
You brat.

677
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,440
Why are you still so reckless?

678
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,720
Grandmaster, please forgive me.

679
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,520
Grandmaster.

680
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,910
I heard from Senior Huaishuo that there's been an unusual phenomenon at Nyuluo Cliff.

681
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:12,940
[Xuanji]

682
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,870
I-I want to go there and help.

683
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,520
Please allow me to do so.

684
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:15,480
Help?

685
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:20,590
Ziying will go there. Is your help needed?

686
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:24,040
I can't hide anything from you.

687
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:27,210
I'm begging you. Please allow me to go.

688
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:38,170
How about this?

689
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:41,310
Go to Shouyang immediately.

690
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,060
-If there is any news...
-Shouyang?

691
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,590
send me a letter at any time.

692
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,620
All right. I’ll go back now.

693
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,100
[Liu Mansion]

694
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,460
Master.

695
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,040
Did you see it clearly?

696
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:03,860
Yes.

697
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,280
After he went in,

698
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,810
he hasn't come out yet.

699
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:07,420
Okay.

700
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:10,090
Take him out as soon as possible.

701
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:10,840
Yes.

702
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:21,480
Why has Unc Liu's yard

703
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,470
changed?

704
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:25,190
The flowers and the sound of the qin have become so beautiful.

705
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:26,320
Something's wrong.

706
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:28,890
This seems to be a magical illusion.

707
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:31,350
Is there even a magic master in Liu Mansion?

708
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,120
Lingsha.

709
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:39,030
There's a murderous aura.

710
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,680
It's you two villains in black robes again.

711
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:49,970
Good.

712
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,680
I'll kill you today

713
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:53,470
and avenge Big Pig Demon!

714
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:54,440
Revenge?

715
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:57,020
You'd better come with us obediently.

716
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:59,310
Looks like they're not here to take the sword

717
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,310
but you this time.

718
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,220
Take me?

719
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:02,750
With just them?

720
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:04,100
Binding Immortal Rope!

721
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:06,330
It's just a stupid rope.

722
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,480
Tianhe.

723
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:19,870
That Binding Immortal Rope is the treasure of the Immortal Sect.

724
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:22,330
It can't be broken by water, fire, or blades.

725
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,889
Once you're bound by its spiritual power,

726
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,489
you won't be able to escape.

727
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,389
I won't let you take Tianhe away.

728
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:31,949
You're overestimating yourself.

729
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:33,460
Lingsha, leave!

730
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,739
Don't bother about me!

731
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:35,270
Tianhe.

732
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:37,290
If I let them take you away,

733
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,929
my family and I will die.

734
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:46,320
Lingsha!

735
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:00,670
Lingsha!

736
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,110
No way.

737
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,920
I'm really going to die?

738
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:32,060
I won't let you die.

739
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,360
Tianhe!

740
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,780
I won't let you die.

741
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:07,920
Tianhe.

742
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:12,590
You even risked your life for me.

743
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,190
But I...

744
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,700
Someone is helping us.

745
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:32,640
This is an illusion.

746
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,920
This person can manipulate the illusion.

747
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,780
Maybe we can do whatever we want. Let's give it a try.

748
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:37,260
Okay!

749
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:39,870
Master!

750
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:42,250
Send us two more helpers!

751
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,170
Come on!

752
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:52,480
We aren't done fighting yet!

753
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,430
Tianhe is right!

754
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,610
Master, what should we do?

755
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:35,950
Illusion Puppet! Break the formation!

756
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,950
Shadows in dreams and flowers in fog

757
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:49,230
are all intangible.

758
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:51,880
Because of distracting thoughts in the heart,

759
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,680
one exiles oneself in the world.

760
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:56,460
One might as well cherish the present.

761
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,460
Who is talking?

762
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:02,310
Watch out!

763
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:01,360
If you don't want to enter the formation again,

764
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,490
you'd better leave.

765
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,790
We've exhausted a lot of our energy and are not suited for battle.

766
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:06,320
Let's go.

767
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,150
Master, are you okay?

768
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,150
I'm fine.

769
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:27,360
[Liu Mengli]

770
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:39,920
How impressive.

771
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,810
She must be a fairy.

772
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:43,880
It's really dangerous here indeed.

773
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,050
Let's get out of here now.

774
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:45,460
Okay.

775
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,240
Mr. Yun, please don't go just yet.

776
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:52,090
My Qianhualing Illusion Formation

777
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:54,490
is activated whenever someone invades it.

778
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:56,230
Sorry for startling you.

779
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,430
Thank you.

780
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,160
Thank her.

781
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,840
I, Tianhe, thank you.

782
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,750
My name is Liu Mengli.

783
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,150
I'm Liu Shifeng's daughter.

784
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:06,670
You...

785
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:10,590
-You are the great daughter of Liu?
-You are the great daughter of Liu?

786
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,730
Lingsha, you're wrong this time.

787
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,960
She's not some heavy demon...

788
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:20,600
Sorry, he's not good with words.

789
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:21,990
Please pardon him.

790
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,870
Lingsha, she's really not like what you said.

791
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:27,340
Enough.

792
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:30,270
Mr. Yun.

793
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,640
Why are you dressed like this?

794
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:35,070
What's wrong?

795
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,720
I always dress like this on the mountain.

796
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,990
I just didn’t expect

797
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:42,200
you and my benefactor Yun Tianqing

798
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:44,240
to share no resemblance at all.

799
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,590
Have you met my father?

800
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:47,950
When I was young,

801
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:50,130
he saved me in the demonic rebellion.

802
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,570
So I remember his appearance clearly.

803
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:56,110
Although you don't have the extraordinary demeanor your father had,

804
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:57,990
you're rather skilled.

805
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,370
Thank you.

806
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:01,500
Li.

807
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,340
Are you okay?

808
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:03,910
Father.

809
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:06,860
Pei Jian and I came here after hearing the commotion.

810
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:08,540
My nephew, you're here too.

811
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:09,210
Unc Liu.

812
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,470
I'm fine.

813
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,340
Mr. Yun and this lady were the ones in danger.

814
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:14,940
Who is this?

815
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,550
She's a thief waiting to be investigated.

816
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:17,800
How dare you break out of prison?

817
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,320
Guards!

818
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,310
Wait.

819
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:22,230
Why is she a thief?

820
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:24,200
I'm the heroic vigilante Han Lingsha

821
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,640
you're looking for.

822
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:27,030
I'm not some thief.

823
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:29,240
I never steal from good people.

824
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:31,010
I only raid bandits' dens.

825
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:33,000
They get their fortunes through burglary

826
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,170
and killing and robbing anyway.

827
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:34,720
Why?

828
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:36,110
Do you think they are fit to use

829
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:36,910
such unearned fortunes?

830
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:38,260
They don't deserve it at all.

831
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,980
So what if I take it to help the poor?

832
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,310
Is it wrong? Is it wrong?

833
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:42,660
I'm not wrong, right?

834
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:43,250
Yes.

835
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:45,440
It's logical.

836
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,260
But the law is the law.

837
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:49,880
If you steal, you're a thief.

838
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:51,070
That's not right.

839
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,200
I'm a righteous vigilante who steals.

840
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,200
A vigilante who steals.

841
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:58,350
Yes, Lingsha is a vigilante who steals.

842
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:02,210
What's the difference between a vigilante who steals and a thief?

843
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:04,500
A vigilante who steals is a thief who upholds justice.

844
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:07,290
But justice should still be upheld in a proper way.

845
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:09,680
So you want your father to capture me?

846
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:12,960
I don't want to make things difficult for my father who is an official.

847
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,490
But I don't want Miss Han to be wronged either.

848
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:16,310
Father.

849
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,030
I have an idea.

850
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:19,070
What is it?

851
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:20,760
Pei said

852
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,220
there's been an unusual phenomenon near Nyuluo Cliff recently.

853
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:25,150
All of the people who went into the mountain to pick the lixiang herb

854
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:27,530
inexplicably disappeared around the Tomb of Prince Yunan.

855
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:29,840
I would like you two to assist with the investigation.

856
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,120
That's not a good idea. The royal tomb is still a tomb.

857
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,390
People shouldn't enter it at will.

858
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:35,030
What if something happens?

859
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:37,480
Just now, Miss Han, Mr. Yun, and I

860
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:39,540
resisted the intruders together.

861
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:41,120
Miss Han was brave.

862
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:43,630
If she could find

863
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,340
and save the missing people,

864
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:47,800
she'd be making up for her mistake.

865
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,430
I'll promise her first

866
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:54,760
and then run away with the wild man midway.

867
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:56,470
Deal. It's a deal.
