00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:37,770
[Episode 3]

4
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:39,789
Lingsha!

5
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,830
Are you really Yun Tianqing’s son?

6
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,650
My father often taught me

7
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,310
to be fearless in danger and save lives.

8
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,710
If he were here, he would have done the same.

9
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,270
You all saw it, right?

10
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,050
He risked his life

11
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,370
to save us.

12
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,770
That's right.

13
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,510
Indeed.

14
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,550
Benefactors,

15
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,880
please accept my bow.

16
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:36,590
Please accept our bow.

17
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,070
Benefactors,

18
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,390
please accept our bow.

19
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:39,770
Don't be like this.

20
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:40,790
My father said

21
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,200
saving a life

22
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,170
is better than building seven levels of Amitabha. No need to...

23
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:46,500
Seven levels of pagoda.

24
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,490
Seven levels of pagoda.

25
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,560
Anyway, don't do this.

26
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,680
If you really want to keep scores,

27
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,930
you should smash that unfilial mask.

28
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,430
Then, you should produce a play

29
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,690
where Yun Tianhe saves Taiping Village.

30
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,750
No need.

31
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,270
They need to.

32
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:02,990
Benefactors,

33
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,150
to educate the children,

34
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,410
we did exaggerate Yun Tianqing's doings

35
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,310
in the play.

36
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,240
Please forgive us, Mr. Yun.

37
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,240
I'll send someone

38
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,090
to prepare a feast for you.

39
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,520
Please, stay for the night.

40
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,760
Seeing your sincerity,

41
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,370
we won't stay any longer. Let's go.

42
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,450
Eat something.

43
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,610
Get changed before you go.

44
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,490
Benefactors!

45
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,829
I think we could have

46
00:03:56,829 --> 00:03:58,270
stayed the night there.

47
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,650
I still have many questions to ask.

48
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,770
I told you,

49
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,330
we need to uphold our pride.

50
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,960
What do you mean?

51
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,700
It means

52
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,640
we should have integrity and dignity.

53
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,240
We need to have integrity at any time.

54
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,780
Even if you're at your limits, you must stand strong.

55
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,640
And at any time,

56
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,540
you can't let others ruin your dignity,

57
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,200
let alone scold your parents.

58
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,980
Don't be sad.

59
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,610
This is such a beautiful place to camp in.

60
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,640
[Chao Lake]

61
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,150
Is this the sea my father mentioned?

62
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,870
It's called the Chao Lake.

63
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,200
It's a lake, not the sea.

64
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,650
This Chao Lake sea is beautiful.

65
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,370
I told you it's called a lake.

66
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,380
You must be so hungry that you're dumb again.

67
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,010
What are you doing?

68
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,290
I'm drilling wood.

69
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,070
Didn't I lose my flame stick?

70
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,020
Drilling wood for fire.

71
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,980
A wild man

72
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,270
from Qingluan Peak like me is most familiar

73
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,530
with this sort of task.

74
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,470
This is too damp, it won't work.

75
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,320
Why don't you get me a dry one?

76
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:19,250
Wait for me.

77
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:35,020
The sword has left the mountain. Pick it up at Shouyang City.

78
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:41,870
Tianhe?

79
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:43,990
Yun Tianhe!

80
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:45,880
Don't scare me!

81
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,800
The bonfire is ready.

82
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,230
All we need is food.

83
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,030
Don't you think

84
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,990
there's always a pair of eyes watching us?

85
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,270
Could it be those two demons?

86
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,190
No one is here.

87
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,200
Don't worry.

88
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,220
I don't feel any murderous aura.

89
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,410
What's that sound?

90
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,000
It must be something again!

91
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:18,910
A bug?

92
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,660
Or something else?

93
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,370
It's my stomach.

94
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,260
Why don't I

95
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,210
get some fish from the Chao Lake?

96
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,870
What's this? Is it edible?

97
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,630
Of course.

98
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,680
This is a rice dumpling.

99
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,150
You eat it for the Dragon Boat Festival.

100
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,550
I took some on our way out.

101
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,030
You told me

102
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,190
taking people's things without permission

103
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,159
is considered stealing.

104
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:54,970
It's immoral.

105
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:57,610
Stealing and taking are different.

106
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:00,190
If you steal from good people, that's stealing.

107
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,230
If you help good people with bad people's things,

108
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,910
it's called robbing the rich and helping the poor.

109
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,170
Like your father said,

110
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,350
humans and demons coexist equally.

111
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,550
But if you meet demons

112
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,510
who want to kill you and steal your sword,

113
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,920
do you think you can coexist?

114
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,910
Of course not.

115
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,550
One party has to die.

116
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:18,310
My father?

117
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,000
Where is my father?

118
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:24,610
Father.

119
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:28,060
I left the mountain with Lingsha in the end.

120
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:29,620
But don't worry.

121
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,590
Lingsha is a very good person.

122
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,390
As long as I follow her,

123
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,850
I won't be used by bad guys.

124
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,210
By the way, Father,

125
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:44,080
I went to the village where you were born today.

126
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,590
The villagers in the village

127
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,130
said you were a bad person.

128
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,820
I have never

129
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,190
felt so miserable before.

130
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,370
But I will prove it to them.

131
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,520
My father is not a bad guy.

132
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,960
My father is a good man and a great hero.

133
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,870
Shouyang.

134
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,660
Your father aside,

135
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,270
I think you're already very heroic.

136
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,710
If anyone dares to say those things about my father,

137
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,440
I'll catch and roast him alive.

138
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:14,970
Lingsha.

139
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,370
Where are we going next?

140
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:16,970
Shouyang.

141
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,300
Well.

142
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,210
I heard from a villager that

143
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,150
an official officer is looking for your father in Shouyang.

144
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,830
It means your father might have been to Shouyang.

145
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:26,910
What's an officer?

146
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,670
Why are they looking for my father?

147
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,510
Officers work for the government.

148
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,870
They usually look for big shots

149
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,710
who did something shocking.

150
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,470
My father is a big shot.

151
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,190
Let's go to Shouyang.

152
00:09:58,690 --> 00:09:59,420
Who's there?

153
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,590
Did you hear something?

154
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,750
Hear what?

155
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,470
Let's pack up and go.

156
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,610
Get up.

157
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,260
It's fine.

158
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,820
There's no murderous aura around here.

159
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,110
Brat!

160
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,180
Little Pig Demon.

161
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,380
It's you!

162
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,100
I was worried about you.

163
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,200
Let me tell you.

164
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,150
I left the mountain to avenge my father.

165
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:32,590
Also,

166
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,700
this woman...

167
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,720
This human woman is not a good person!

168
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,720
There's something wrong with her.

169
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,960
I think there's something wrong with your eyes.

170
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,290
Who is not a good person?

171
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:40,830
Let me tell you.

172
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:41,890
I saw it yesterday.

173
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,210
Last night, you turned a talisman

174
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,140
into a bird and sent it flying away.

175
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,160
That's a communication spell used by cultivators.

176
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:47,800
Brat.

177
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49,440
She must be related to the cultivators

178
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,630
who killed my father.

179
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,980
So I was worried about you

180
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,240
and stayed here all night guarding you.

181
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,550
Use your little pig brain.

182
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,870
I wouldn't have waited until now to hurt him.

183
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:57,430
Who knows

184
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,560
if you're plotting to steal his sword?

185
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:00,590
Then tell me,

186
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,830
why did you send a letter with a talisman?

187
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:03,270
I...

188
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,910
I'm going to Shouyang with Tianhe

189
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,070
to learn about his father.

190
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,660
I have a friend in Shouyang.

191
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,890
I thought I could get my friend to help.

192
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,680
I see.

193
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,990
You must want your friend

194
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,820
to inquire about my father and this sword for us.

195
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,170
Exactly.

196
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,040
Don't worry, Little Pig Demon.

197
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,110
I can assure you.

198
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,460
Even if everyone wants this sword,

199
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,700
Lingsha wouldn't.

200
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,710
You are not cultivators.

201
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:48,350
Hand over your sword and I won't kill you.

202
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,270
What a joke.

203
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,430
That female demon yesterday

204
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:55,360
was almost beaten into a dead fish.

205
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,720
I'm not afraid of you.

206
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,130
Perfect timing. I'll hunt you down

207
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:01,590
and eat roast tiger demon today.

208
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:02,790
Only demons eat humans.

209
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,550
It's the first time I've heard of humans eating demons.

210
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,470
Hearing you say that, I can kill you without concern.

211
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,470
Tianhe, shoot!

212
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:49,760
You're injured!

213
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,350
Amazing.

214
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,790
Help me up.

215
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:19,470
I let you escape yesterday.

216
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:20,930
How dare you show up again?

217
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,010
We almost died here.

218
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:45,970
You're like the two cultivators who killed my father.

219
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:47,030
Stop Ice Cube!

220
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,840
I'll avenge my father!

221
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,080
Little demon, die!

222
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:50,860
Wait! Wait!

223
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,040
Don't kill it.

224
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,600
It's not an evil demon. It's a good demon.

225
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,810
It's my good friend.

226
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,330
Little Pig Demon, run!

227
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,400
I want to avenge my father!

228
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,240
Vermin.

229
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,150
Tell me.

230
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,030
Why do you want the sword?

231
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,350
Feng Xie!

232
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,580
Let go of Feng Xie,

233
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,410
or I'll kill you!

234
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,970
I'm afraid the two of you

235
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:33,830
are the ones dying today.

236
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,730
Wait for me here.

237
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,830
One of them is a demon and the other is a Sword Immortal.

238
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,390
That's not a fight you're fit for.

239
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,120
We need to go.

240
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:55,390
Find a place to hide.

241
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,320
He saved me. How can I leave him behind?

242
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,120
I need to help.

243
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,080
Are you stupid?

244
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,570
Stop, female demon!

245
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,670
Or I'll kill him.

246
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:18,870
Leave me!

247
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,560
Stop! Don't kill him!

248
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,530
Demon! Surrender now!

249
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,050
Don’t hurt Wen Yao!

250
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:36,960
Feng Xie!

251
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:39,990
Tianhe.

252
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,480
Lingsha, are you okay?

253
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,820
I don't want you to die.

254
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,860
I want you to live well.

255
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,220
Go. Go!

256
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:57,640
No!

257
00:15:59,150 --> 00:15:59,920
No!

258
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:07,790
Go!

259
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:09,830
Go!

260
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,670
Go!

261
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:31,630
Lingsha.

262
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:34,900
I feel like you always get hurt when you're with me.

263
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,300
I wonder if there are any herbs around here.

264
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,160
What are you doing?

265
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,980
I'm going to find herbs for you.

266
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,910
I mean the Ice Cube behind you.

267
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,190
Out of the way.

268
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,670
You moved out of the way just because he said so?

269
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,930
What if he's a bad guy?

270
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:55,580
I...

271
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,590
It's healed!

272
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,720
That's an amazing move!

273
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:05,900
I told you, Lingsha.

274
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,109
He is a good man.

275
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,230
Fine.

276
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,240
Thank you.

277
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,819
Thank you, young senior.

278
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:15,319
Didn't you always call him the handsome swordsman?

279
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:17,369
Why are you calling him a young senior now?

280
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,760
In terms of swordsmanship, he's a senior.

281
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,520
But he might be younger than me.

282
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,650
So I'll just call him a young senior.

283
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:25,030
Foolish.

284
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,010
You're the foolish one.

285
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,069
Young senior,

286
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,950
didn't you want to see the sword?

287
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,430
Let me show you.

288
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,000
Don't show him.

289
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:41,000
So this sword is related to the anomaly in Mount Kong.

290
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,110
Judging from his furrowed brows,

291
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,200
he must want the Wangshu Sword.

292
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,030
Oh no.

293
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,510
He's so powerful.

294
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,400
If he takes the Wangshu Sword,

295
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,880
how can I get it back?

296
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,860
What's wrong with you two?

297
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,010
Why are you both furrowing your brows?

298
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,920
Are you afraid of the cold with this sword?

299
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:04,550
No.

300
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,310
I've never felt cold.

301
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,900
He hasn't cultivated before.

302
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,370
But why is his spiritual power so strong?

303
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:24,980
Young senior,

304
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,490
you're so good at swordsmanship.

305
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:29,020
Can you teach me some moves?

306
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,220
What are you doing?

307
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,400
I'm fine.

308
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,900
What are you doing now?

309
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:41,470
The Qionghua Sect uses this formation to test one's spiritual power.

310
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,930
Test for spiritual power?

311
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:44,400
Let me try.

312
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:53,310
This ring of light is so beautiful.

313
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,950
The spiritual power is divided into seven levels.

314
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,510
Although you have never cultivated before,

315
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,070
your cultivation has reached the first level.

316
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,060
Does that mean

317
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,590
I have some talent?

318
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,450
Impressive.

319
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:05,450
Let me try.

320
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:15,200
Why is my ring of light so messy?

321
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,310
It's making me dizzy.

322
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,740
Is this wild man so unruly that

323
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,890
his ring of light is also misbehaving?

324
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,490
How could this happen?

325
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:28,830
Am I not talented?

326
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,070
Hey, Ice Cube.

327
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,440
Every time you ask us questions,

328
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,770
we answer you properly.

329
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,990
But why do you ignore all our questions?

330
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:41,750
The formation can't detect the level of his spiritual power.

331
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,070
Since I joined the Qionghua Sect,

332
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,380
I have never seen anything like this.

333
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,440
I'll tell you after I find the answer.

334
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,790
No need to pretend, just say you're clueless.

335
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:50,320
Let's go.

336
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:51,160
Let's find something delicious.

337
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:51,660
Wait.

338
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,760
Young senior, thank you for saving us.

339
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:57,920
You must be hungry.

340
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:58,850
How about this?

341
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:00,060
I'll use my Wangshu Sword

342
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,920
to hunt some wild rabbits for you.

343
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,120
Wangshu Sword?

344
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:08,520
How can you do such a filthy thing with the Wangshu Sword?

345
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:10,600
You call it Wangshu.

346
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:11,350
But...

347
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,550
Tianhe, tell him

348
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,550
what it is called.

349
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:15,630
I gave it a name.

350
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,310
It's called "A Sword."

351
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:17,900
Enough!

352
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:19,810
Why are you so fierce?

353
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,550
As the owner, he has the right to name it.

354
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,710
Don't think that just because your sword can fly,

355
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:24,350
it's better than Tianhe's sword.

356
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:27,610
The quality of a sword lies in the intention of the wielder.

357
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:30,560
I seriously suspect that you have ulterior motives.

358
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,070
What

359
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,810
do you mean by that?

360
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,340
Feeling guilty now that I've guessed it?

361
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:39,890
You're glaring at me. He's glaring at me!

362
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:41,840
Now I think

363
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,630
you must be in cahoots with those demons.

364
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:45,150
You're all after this sword.

365
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:45,750
Lingsha.

366
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:47,230
What do you mean now?

367
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:48,890
Why are you closing your eyes?

368
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:51,920
You're glaring at me again!

369
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:55,920
He finally left.

370
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,590
Let's go before he comes after us again.

371
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,530
What are you doing?

372
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:03,390
Lingsha.

373
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,310
My father told me

374
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,550
women are gentle and fragile.

375
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,510
You didn't look like

376
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,630
a woman just now.

377
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,360
Don't think only you have a father.

378
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,330
My father said

379
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:18,230
girls should be as brave and determined as men.

380
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,410
You also have a father?

381
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,990
Why didn't you tell me

382
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,450
what your father was like?

383
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,400
Tell me what your father is like.

384
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,270
None of your business.

385
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,470
Tell me.

386
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:28,230
No.

387
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,290
Lingsha.

388
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:32,290
What is your father like?

389
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,110
Who are you? How dare you be so rude?

390
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:46,440
[Dream Tapir Demon General, Beike]

391
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,160
Prince Yunan,

392
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,000
you've been trapped

393
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,390
for a thousand years.

394
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,190
Aren't you bored?

395
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,720
I'm here to make a deal with you.

396
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,590
Over the past thousand years,

397
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,960
you're the only one who dares

398
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:04,320
to come here and make a deal with me.

399
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,750
What kind of deal?

400
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,510
I'll let you see the sun again,

401
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,110
and you'll help me harm the mortal world.

402
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,110
What do you think?

403
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,870
I need to first see if you have

404
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,150
the ability to let me out of here.

405
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,330
If I can't even do this,

406
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,280
I wouldn't have come here.

407
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,470
If I could get out,

408
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,580
[Prince Yunan]

409
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,460
I would kill all the Taoist priests

410
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,030
and people in the world.

411
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:59,250
Indeed, we have the same goal.

412
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,380
But you haven't gathered your primordial energy yet.

413
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,260
Why don't we use your evil aura

414
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,680
to influence the creatures

415
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:06,910
of Mount Bagong

416
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,160
first?

417
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,730
Shouyang City is going to be in chaos.

418
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:17,590
Nyuluo Cliff will be in chaos too.

419
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:34,640
Feng Xie.

420
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,120
I won't let you die like this.

421
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,570
Lord Beike, I failed to accomplish my task.

422
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:50,240
Feng Xie...

423
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,800
If it were that easy,

424
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,950
we wouldn't have waited 19 years.

425
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,310
It's my fault that Feng Xie died.

426
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,910
I underestimated the enemy.

427
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:00,130
Get up.

428
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,500
I touched that sword.

429
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:07,050
I didn't expect it to turn out like this.

430
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,600
The wielder of the sword

431
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,110
is indeed a master.

432
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,240
No.

433
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:13,490
He's a wild boy with no cultivation.

434
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,700
Feng Xie was killed by a disciple of the Qionghua Sect.

435
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,500
That's more interesting.

436
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:24,840
This is Feng Xie's purple crystal.

437
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:25,450
My lord,

438
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:27,060
I have a request.

439
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:28,710
In the crystal

440
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:31,290
is a strand of Feng Xie's primordial spirit.

441
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:32,220
I want to keep it.

442
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:33,850
I know

443
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:37,150
your relationship with Feng Xie.

444
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:39,910
Of course.

445
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:45,830
If it wasn't for

446
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,490
something as useless as love,

447
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,560
Feng Xie would not have died in vain.

448
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,270
I’m sorry.

449
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:53,790
I shouldn’t have asked for the crystal.

450
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:56,100
If you want to keep Feng Xie's primordial spirit,

451
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,560
complete your task first.

452
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,030
That stupid Ice Cube makes me

453
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,560
feel like he will follow us.

454
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,610
You didn't have to

455
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,900
shoo him off like that.

456
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,750
He's a good man.

457
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:19,030
You...

458
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:20,990
You're just too trusting.

459
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,210
Think about it.

460
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:23,640
He is such a skilled swordsman.

461
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,910
Why is he following us?

462
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:27,010
It must be because of your sword.

463
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,080
This is called

464
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,260
do no harm

465
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,560
but always be wary.

466
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:32,320
My father told me

467
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,190
this sword was not important.

468
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:35,910
The most important thing is people.

469
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,630
Why do you think so many people

470
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,480
are trying so hard

471
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,480
to get this sword?

472
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,480
If... I mean if...

473
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:45,100
If someone took your sword,

474
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,120
what would you do?

475
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,520
I would definitely get it back.

476
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,450
This is the sword my father left me.

477
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:51,630
Unless...

478
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,040
Unless what?

479
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,670
Unless you're in danger.

480
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,710
If you ask me to choose between this sword

481
00:25:58,710 --> 00:25:59,790
and your life,

482
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:01,210
I would choose you.

483
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:17,420
Wait.

484
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:19,930
There's a murderous aura?

485
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,150
It's not murderous, but it's demonic.

486
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,780
But this demonic aura is not murderous.

487
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,470
Let's go.

488
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,990
The Sun Emperor of Fusang and the Moon Emperor of Xiji.

489
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:36,160
The four essences and the three auras,

490
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,190
condensed into bright light...

491
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,590
There's no other choice.

492
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:42,430
What are you doing?

493
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,640
I just didn't want you to cut them down.

494
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,720
They don't have a murderous aura. They won't hurt people.

495
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,750
Were you born in the year of the bird?

496
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,080
You keep flying around.

497
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:51,230
It's fine if you want to fly,

498
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:52,560
but you keep scaring us.

499
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,540
No, let me try.

500
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,330
Give me a chance.

501
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,420
Be good. Go back.

502
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:27,590
Look.

503
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,760
They didn't want to hurt us.

504
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:32,130
They were afraid that we'd hurt them.

505
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,430
See?

506
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:37,790
It's fine now.

507
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,790
You can communicate with plants?

508
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:42,350
Communicate?

509
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:48,430
Maybe it's because I've been in the mountains for a long time.

510
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:49,230
My father said

511
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:52,800
everything has a soul. We should meet them with sincerity.

512
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:55,030
So I can be sincere with them and sense

513
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,660
what the plants are feeling.

514
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,550
Don't worry.

515
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:58,960
They won't hurt us.

516
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,110
What level of cultivation is he at,

517
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:04,840
to be able to communicate with all living beings?

518
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:08,100
What are you thinking about?

519
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:08,960
Let me tell you.

520
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:10,110
In the wilderness,

521
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,950
the wild man is more capable than you.

522
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:12,830
Leave now.

523
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,120
Wait.

524
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:25,220
Lingsha.

525
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,580
Look at the token on his waist.

526
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,210
It looks familiar.

527
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,000
A token?

528
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,110
Let me see.

529
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,710
The tokens of the Taoist cultivators

530
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:38,770
all look like this.

531
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,780
But the pattern on his token

532
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:43,110
is exactly the same as the one on my stone.

533
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,470
Wow, it's really the same.

534
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,070
Why do you have this Zao jade?

535
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:56,070
Zao jade?

536
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,030
This was my mother's stone.

537
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:01,430
My mother was called Su Yu. My father was called Yun Tianqing.

538
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,310
Yun Tianqing?

539
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,870
I won’t allow a treacherous traitor like Yun Tianqing

540
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,790
to exist in our sect!

541
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,800
Young senior.

542
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:15,070
You know my stone is called Zao jade.

543
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,170
Do you know my parents?

544
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,430
Did they visit your sect before?

545
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,380
If I did not see for myself, I do not know.

546
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:27,760
Stop asking.

547
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:36,610
That stupid Ice Cube.

548
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,470
He's just showing off that he can fly.

549
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:39,600
What's the big deal?

550
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,220
I think he must know about my parents.

551
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,950
Let's go to Shouyang and see what we can find.

552
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,830
At worst, I'll accompany you to the Qionghua Sect at Kunxu Mountain.

553
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:48,310
Okay.

554
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:49,950
Let's ask your friend

555
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,620
if he knows this sword first.

556
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,190
This way.

557
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,630
Let's go.

558
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:04,790
[Shouyang]

559
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,800
So many people and so many houses.

560
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:17,570
This is the difference between a city and a village.

561
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:21,480
There are so many people in the city.

562
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,010
Do they all know each other?

563
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,510
There are many people in this world.

564
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:26,350
Every encounter is determined by fate.

565
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:28,680
Let's go to the inn and eat something nice.

566
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:29,870
What is an inn?

567
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,490
An inn is a place

568
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,640
where you pay to rest and sleep.

569
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:34,590
Let's go.

570
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:36,750
Let's get down to business

571
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,280
and find your friend first.

572
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:42,270
What's wrong with you?

573
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,340
Why are you so careless?

574
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,070
-Be careful.
-Wait.

575
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:44,600
Hurry up.

576
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:45,770
-Clean it up.
-Is it a murderous aura?

577
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:46,410
I'm sorry.

578
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:47,540
Seriously.

579
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,160
So is it a murderous aura?

580
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:51,270
What's wrong?

581
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:52,710
Say something.

582
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:53,710
You...

583
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:55,370
Hurry up.

584
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:58,290
Here, take it. Be careful.

585
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,360
Lingsha, what water is this?

586
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:09,250
It smells good.

587
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:11,460
It's not water. It just looks like water.

588
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,300
This is wine.

589
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:17,770
This wine smells even better than ginkgo porridge with dates.

590
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:23,200
You're not a drunkard, are you?

591
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,150
What is this?

592
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,080
It can turn people into drunkards?

593
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,380
This is scary stuff.

594
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:30,510
You'll feel dizzy after drinking it

595
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:32,030
and talk nonsense.

596
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,910
And you'll easily do

597
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:35,510
things you'll regret later.

598
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:37,160
It turns people into madmen

599
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,230
and fools.

600
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,510
It's not a good thing.

601
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:40,990
Have you drunk it before?

602
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:44,030
Yes, I have. It was terrible.

603
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,870
So this wine is nothing good.

604
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,940
But it smells so good.

605
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:50,150
I think

606
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,490
you have the potential to be a drunkard.

607
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:52,440
Put it down.

608
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,430
It's better not to touch it.

609
00:31:59,180 --> 00:31:59,910
Take it.

610
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:01,910
Stop looking.

611
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:15,990
Let's eat first.

612
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:16,740
You're about to drool.

613
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,250
Here, take it.

614
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:18,410
Thank you.

615
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,160
Let's wait for your friend

616
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:21,490
to finish his work

617
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:23,070
so we can eat with him.

618
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,510
Isn't eating your top priority?

619
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:27,830
The most important thing now

620
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:28,950
is to figure out the matter with this sword.

621
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,070
Didn't you say

622
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:32,990
we should return the favor we received?

623
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,430
So I've made up my mind.

624
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:36,630
I'll treat your friends to a meal later.

625
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,490
But I don't seem to have money.

626
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:46,040
How about I exchange my sword for your money?

627
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,520
Wild man, you're so silly.

628
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:55,090
Did I say something wrong again?

629
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:55,970
No.

630
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,530
I'm praising you.

631
00:32:58,930 --> 00:32:59,970
Wait here.

632
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:01,460
I'll go find my friend.

633
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,230
Don't move.

634
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:03,700
Stay right here.

635
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,140
Okay.

636
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,670
Don't worry. I'll stand here

637
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:13,570
and wait for you to come back.

638
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:15,120
You'd better be.

639
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:18,950
Silly wild man.

640
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,580
When I come back and take your sword,

641
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,610
you may never talk to me again.

642
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,450
Good sir, want some tofu?

643
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,570
It looks good.

644
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:29,600
As the saying goes,

645
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,790
Shouyang has three specialties.

646
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:32,030
White tofu from Mount Bagong,

647
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,190
fragrant herb from Nyuluo Cliff,

648
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:34,610
and the beauty of the great daughter of Liu.

649
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:37,630
How can your snacks compare to the great daughter of Liu's beauty?

650
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:39,630
It's rare to catch a glance of her beauty,

651
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:41,630
but my tofu is right here.

652
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:42,590
That's true.

653
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,970
Excuse me.

654
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,800
Block the way.

655
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,030
Excuse me.

656
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,430
You're blocking the way.

657
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,710
Why are you standing in the middle of the road?

658
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:51,880
Get out of the way!

659
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:52,390
Move!

660
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:53,110
Move!

661
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:54,030
Move!

662
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:55,230
Get out of the way!

663
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:55,870
Excuse me.

664
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:56,590
Move!

665
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:57,190
Move!

666
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:03,710
I've brought Yun Tianqing's son and sword

667
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:04,670
to Shouyang.

668
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:05,530
Employer.

669
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:07,270
Do you remember our promise a year ago?

670
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,170
Where is the item?

671
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:10,300
I'll give it to you when I get the sword.

672
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:13,949
The sword is at the next street corner.

673
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:14,710
Go get it.

674
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:17,290
I won't go.

675
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,679
I'm afraid...

676
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:19,739
You're afraid

677
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,340
he would hate you.

678
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:23,980
None of your business.

679
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,310
Hurry up and get the sword.

680
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:26,780
Otherwise, that Ice Cube disciple of Qionghua

681
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,570
will be here again.

682
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:29,690
Murong Ziying?

683
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:31,929
You know him?

684
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:45,659
Young senior!

685
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,790
I knew you would come back...

686
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:49,880
Don't stand in the middle of the road.

687
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,480
Follow me.

688
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:51,639
No.

689
00:34:52,969 --> 00:34:53,699
I

690
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:54,870
promised Lingsha

691
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:56,330
to stand here and not move.

692
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:57,980
A bowl of tofu.

693
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:58,790
Okay.

694
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,180
Here's your tofu.

695
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:14,030
I...

696
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:17,490
I... I really promised Lingsha

697
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,910
to wait for her there.

698
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,710
We've made a plan.

699
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,870
After meeting Lingsha's friend in Shouyang,

700
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:28,790
we'll go to Kunxu Mountain together.

701
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,890
Wangshu's cold aura may hurt you.

702
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:32,640
I got this scabbard made for now.

703
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,990
Take it. Don't lose it.

704
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:37,010
Young senior,

705
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,520
please don't blame

706
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:40,000
Lingsha.

707
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:41,820
That's just how her temper is.

708
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,270
Although she spoke a little rudely,

709
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,660
she likes Sword Immortals the most.

710
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:55,750
This sword can't be dusty.

711
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,960
Wipe it twice a day.

712
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,380
I can feel it if you don't do it.

713
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:04,830
Fine, I can wipe the sword.

714
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:07,600
But you have to answer my question.

715
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:12,800
Did my parents cultivate

716
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,580
in the Qionghua Sect before?

717
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:19,330
Since you've decided to go to Kunxu Mountain,

718
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:20,880
you can find out for yourself.

719
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,080
Why bother asking me?

720
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:27,510
He is indeed a cultivator. He has no regard for money.

721
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,480
Young senior. Young senior!

722
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:31,440
Young senior.

723
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:34,200
You saved my life,

724
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:35,350
bought me food,

725
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,280
and even gave me a scabbard.

726
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,710
You are like my friend now.

727
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:40,440
But I don't even know your name.

728
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:54,660
You know that Qionghua disciple?

729
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,480
Why do you want that sword?

730
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,750
Alright, I won't ask anymore.

731
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:01,710
Well...

732
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:05,150
Can you take the sword without hurting Tianhe?

733
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:16,720
What’s going on?

734
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:19,060
Let's go and take a look.

735
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:19,990
Let's go.

736
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:24,990
Okay.

737
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:29,430
Boss.

738
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:30,700
The money is on the table.

739
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,170
Okay.

740
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,180
What's going on?

741
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:37,270
How dare she?

742
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:39,750
Look.

743
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,770
It's a bandit.

744
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:42,950
This bandit is pretty.

745
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:43,480
Yes.

746
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:46,150
What are you doing?

747
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:46,660
Who is this?

748
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,820
Look at him. Gosh.

749
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,050
[Arrest warrant]

750
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,840
This painting looks like Lingsha.

751
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,100
I want to show it to her.

752
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,570
-Why did he tear it?
-Sir.

753
00:37:58,570 --> 00:37:59,540
You tore off the arrest warrant.

754
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,160
Have you seen the person in this painting?

755
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:01,760
Of course.

756
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,160
She...

757
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:05,410
She is my best friend.

758
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:08,210
Do you know where she is?

759
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,490
She'll be back soon.

760
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,920
Sir, wait here.

761
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,250
I'll be back soon.

762
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:16,130
The government will reward you for your report.

763
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:33,850
A murderous aura.
