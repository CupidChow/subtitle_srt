Lingsha,

5
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:47,539
how did it go?

6
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,229
I don't know.

7
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,009
I've said everything I should and shouldn't.

8
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:53,009
It's up to him.

9
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,300
I didn't expect Uncle Ziying to be so upset.

10
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,240
Ziying gave all his loyalty and ambition

11
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,310
to Qionghua.

12
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,610
But Qionghua treated him like this.

13
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,410
Of course he couldn't accept it.

14
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,660
Tianhe,

15
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:09,740
Lingsha,

16
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,640
Master asked me to tell you

17
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,830
although he knows everything,

18
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,340
there's nothing he can do.

19
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,820
So if you need any help,

20
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:17,850
just let him know.

21
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,329
He will do his best to help you.

22
00:02:19,329 --> 00:02:22,250
Please help us deliver our gratitude to Sect Leader Xu Liang.

23

Sect Leader Xu Liang

25
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,329
must be worried about Mengli.

26
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:27,829
Go back and tell him

27
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,910
Mengli is fine.

28
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,210
Also,

29
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,430
I still need to go to Huanming Realm

30
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,200
and try my best to stop the war.

31
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:39,650
Okay.

32
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,290
I'm going to go back to Qionghua first.

33
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:46,930
Tianhe,

34
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:50,670
is your wound caused by the dragon really okay?

35
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,410
I almost forgot.

36
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,010
Although

37
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,150
I got this wound before,

38
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,680
I really am fine.

39
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,470
According to that divine dragon,

40
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,470
having the Primordial-Spirit-Initiating Moon-Chasing Bow is not enough.

41
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,700
You still need Hou Yi's Sun-Shooting Bow to contend against it.

42
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,490
So I think

43
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,560
if you have Hou Yi's Sun-Shooting Bow,

44
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,980
you'll be more powerful, right?

45
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,980
Then the wound caused by the dragon won't be a problem.

46
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,250
I plan...

47
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,220
to go to the Divine Mausoleum

48
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,260
to steal Hou Yi's Sun-Shooting Bow

49
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,260
and give it to you. What do you think?

50
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,560
Lingsha,

51
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:24,870
I know you're worried about me.

52
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:25,630
But look,

53
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,900
I'm fine, right?

54
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,180
Why do I have to contend against it?

55
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:32,500

56
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,150
have darkened a lot.

57
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,780
Did something happen to Sister?

58
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,500
No, no.

59
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:38,550
Sister is fine.

60
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:42,100
The beads can feel my feelings.

61

62
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:44,400

64
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,210
Then hurry. Go now.

65
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,700
Go back... back to sleep.

66

00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,090
It's not...

79
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,060
It's not Uncle Ziying.

It's... It's Lingsha.

81
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,460
I went to deliver breakfast to Lingsha just now.

82
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,050
I knocked on the door several times, but there was no response.

83

00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:09,860
like she broke into Uncle Ziying's room.

88

I saw that she looked pale.

89
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,170
I think she injected her spiritual power into something.

Isn't this Lingsha's bracelet?

100

Why is she injecting spiritual power into the bracelet?

Something is not right.

102
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,780
Why does she look increasingly pale?

103
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:45,540
I must stop her.

104
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,210
Lingsha's primordial spirit is in the bracelet.

105
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,409
If we stop her rashly,

106
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,750
it will hurt her.

107
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,650
Her primordial spirit is in the bracelet?

108
00:05:56,659 --> 00:05:57,659

Ziying, tell me now!

114
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:17,150
I promised Lingsha

115
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,270
not to tell anyone.

00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:23,300
Fine.

It's okay if you won't tell me.

118

But I don't allow anything

119
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,840
to take away Lingsha's primordial spirit.

120
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:32,850
I'm going to smash it now.

121
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,180
This bracelet...

122
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,870
consists of soul stones.

123
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,480
Soul stones?

124
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,030
The life of the person who injects spiritual power

125
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,560
is connected to the stones.

126
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,930
The person lives when the stones are luminous, and the person dies when they are not.

127
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,330
In most cases, people who use the stones

128
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:52,610
in the martial world

129
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,260
will die soon.

130
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,720
The stones' brightness

131
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:00,110
represents the days the person has left.

132
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,430
You mean...

133
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,730
Lingsha will die soon?

134
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:14,340
She will wake up

135
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:17,950
after she finishes injecting spiritual power.

136
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,430
How many days

137
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,390
does one stone represent?

138
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,210
Since I knew

139
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,360
she's wearing a bracelet of soul stones,

140
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,970
I've been paying attention frequently.

141
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,500
It could take dozens of days

142
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,170
or only a few days

143
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,340
for the stones' brightness to fade away.

144
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,740
Maybe...

145
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,420
this is Lingsha's fate.

146
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,570
Why are you... here?

147
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:13,860
What...

148
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:18,040
What happened?

149
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,730
I won't let you die, Lingsha.

150
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,860
You already know?

151
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,430
Then let's spend each of my remaining days

152
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,420
as if it were forever.

153
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,310
I've already put that Red Soul

154
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:44,000
into Han Lingsha's body.

155
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,810
But she has left Qionghua.

156
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,290
I can't absorb the power from her.

157
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:54,990
I need your help.

158
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:03,500
This bead can enhance the Red Soul power in your body.

159
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,080
No matter where she is,

160
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,520
you can absorb her power.

161
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,370
This is...

162
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:12,980
great.

163
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:18,770
Don't worry.

164
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,950
After I absorb

165
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,770
all the power from Han Lingsha,

166
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,720
I will bring her and Yun Tianhe

167
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,130
to you.

168
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:53,730
It will take some time for the Chijiang characters

169
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:55,540
and your blood and body to fuse.

170
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,250
I've fulfilled my promises.

171
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,580
Next,

172
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,650
it's your turn to fulfill your promise.

173
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:03,530
Don't worry.

174
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,680
Yun Tianhe is also a big problem to me.

175
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:09,580
I will not only fulfill my promise,

176
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,510
but also help you take revenge.

00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,960
I didn't expect you

180
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,320
to cooperate with such a despicable person.

181
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,380
Junior,

182
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,370
he is the one who can help us ascend.

183
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,140
Let him go.

184
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,090
He can't die.

185
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,180
Shut up!

186
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,020
Remove the Red Soul mind spell from her.

187
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,180
We

188
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,820
have been conspiring with each other

189
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,790
because we have gone all out.

190

Her body is the vessel.

00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,000
It can never be removed.

192
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:58,370
Junior,

193
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,840
I've started

194
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,990
to absorb Han Lingsha's spiritual power long ago.

195
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,090
Now she is too weak

196
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,600
to control the Wangshu Sword.

197
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,740
After the two souls are fully fused,

198
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,380
I can absorb all the spiritual power

199
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,620
in her body

200
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,410
and become a real host.

201
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,530
If you kill him today,

202
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,700
the Wangshu Sword

203
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,760
will no longer have a host.

204
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,850
If you dare to tell anyone about this,

205
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,900
I'll crush your bones into ashes.

206
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:41,790
Get lost!

207
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,000
Junior,

208
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,570
this is a perfect plan.

209
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,680
But I didn't expect you

210
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,010
to follow me.

211
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,440
Su Yao,

212
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,800
I knew you have evil intentions long ago.

213
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,460
But I still underestimated you.

214
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,280
You gave Han Lingsha the Red Soul.

215
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,150
You made it look like you saved her.

216
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:20,470
But your real purpose was to cast a spell.

217
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,810
You know clearly if Han Lingsha dies,

218
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,690
Tianhe will feel hurt.

219
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:29,170
Then he will definitely take revenge on Qionghua.

220
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:30,340
Then

221
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,920
you can take the opportunity

222
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,210
to make me turn against him,

223
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:36,880
right?

224
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,010
Su Yao,

225
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,740
I'm really impressed

226
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:45,630
by your trick of killing three birds with one stone.

227
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,660
Isn't it

228
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,330
good?

229
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,940
I've compromised for 19 years.

230
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:03,380
Tai Qing said I'm not gifted.

231
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,580
I want to prove to him

232
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,460
it's his ungifted disciple

233
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,620
who will ascend in the end.

234
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,020
I also want you to know

235
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,940
my aspiration is the same as yours.

236
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,770
Just like you,

237
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,350
I can change my fate too.

238
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,770
Even if you can change your fate,

239
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,490
you can't change

240
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,400
the fact that you are inferior in my eyes.

241
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:35,620
I, Su Yao,

242
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:38,850
am willing to be inferior

243
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,820
only in front of you.

244
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,920
Yun Tianhe and the others won't help you,

245
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:48,050
just like Yun Tianqing back then.

246
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,870
I've waited 19 years.

247
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,940
I'm not afraid of waiting another 19 years.

248
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,280
Su Yao,

249
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,790
if you dare to hurt Yun Tianhe,

250
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,370
I'll kill you.

251
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,230
Xuan Xiao,

252
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,630
you finally compromised

253
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:27,580
in front of me.

254
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,100
Who's there?

255
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:43,680
[Qionghua Palace]

256
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,490
Mingguang?

257
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,710
What's wrong?

258
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:56,300
Nothing.

259
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:57,230
What happened?

260
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:57,940
I...

261
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,580
I'm fine.

262
00:15:59,220 --> 00:15:59,930
I saw...

263
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:02,650
I saw...

264
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,360
Just say it.

265
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:05,950
Something happened to Lingsha.

266
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,620
I need to hurry to ask Grandmaster to help her.

267
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,750
If it's for Miss Han,

268
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:09,650
don't go to her.

269
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,940
She won't help Lingsha.

270
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:14,780
Why?

271
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,410
She's always been nice to Lingsha.

272
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,420
This is a very serious matter.

273
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,900
I... I dare not say it.

274
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,080
Right, Tianhe,

275
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,820
go to Senior Xuan Xiao.

276
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,630
I think he will help you.

277
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:29,310
Mingguang,

278
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,240
if you have a problem that you can't solve,

279
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,090
you can go to Sect Leader Xu Liang.

280
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:35,020
He will help you.

281
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,500
Sect Leader Xu Liang?

282
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:39,890
Yes.

283
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,160
I'm going to Sect Leader Xu Liang.

284
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,080
Never lose the ray of light in your heart.

285
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:06,530
Ziying,

286
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:08,329
are you still upset?

287
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:09,859
I'm coming in.

288
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,250
Do you plan to pull yourself together

289
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,819
to be a cleaner in Jixian Garden

290
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:23,420
or to be Murong Ziying again?

291
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:27,970
From now on,

292
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,300
Murong Ziying will be Murong Ziying.

293
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,820
You're right.

294
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,020
You're not even afraid of death.

295
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,770
I shouldn't be dispirited

296
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,540
or upset.

297
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,620
You're finally back.

298
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:52,610
Only you,

299
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,890
Murong Ziying, deserves this.

300
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,820
The Nine Dragons Silk Binding Sword Tassel.

301
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,480
You are indeed knowledgable.

302
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,460
This is a sword tassel

303
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,300
made of ancient ice silk

304
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,700
with the special Nine Dragons Silk Binding technique.

305
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,350
When I left home back then,

306
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,480
Sister asked me to pick something.

307
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,520
I picked it.

308
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,390
If you hang it on your sword,

309
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:13,390
it must look nice.

310
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,420
This is what your sister left you.

311
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,880
How could you give it to me?

312
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,550
Because you deserve it.

313
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,650
I always repay others' kindness to me.

314
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,530
You promised my sister

315
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:31,210
to take care of me for the rest of my life, right?

316
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,420
Of course I should reward you.

317
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,980
We swore

318
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,170
to be together forever, right?

319
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,480
Let this sword tassel be with you on behalf of me,

320
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,450
so that I won't break my promise. Right?

321
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,310
That's more like it.

322
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,290
Well...

323
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,980
I have something very important to do now.

324
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,310
If Tianhe looks for me when he comes back,

325
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,150
tell him

326
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,410
I've gone back to the Han family to visit Uncle Hu.

327
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:10,340
Where is Tianhe?

328
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,130
He...

329
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,050
He has always wanted to help me

330
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,340
find a way to remove the divine punishment.

331
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,210
I told him

332
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,370
Elder Qingyang said

333
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,090
Qionghua has many ways to remove it.

334
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,020
So he went there.

335
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:22,180
Elder Qingyang would never say that.

336
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,740
Qionghua is a sect of cultivating.

337
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:27,060
It doesn't have a way to remove the divine punishment at all.

338
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:27,660
Lingsha,

339
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:31,490
you injected your primordial spirit into the soul stones first.

340
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:33,300
Then you tricked Tianhe into leaving.

341
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,960
What exactly do you want to do?

342
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,110
If you don't tell me the truth,

343
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:42,250
I won't let you go.

344
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:47,810
Ziying,

345
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,940
do you still remember what Illuminating Dragon said?

346
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,490
If mortals are wounded by Illuminating Dragon,

347
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,820
they can never be cured.

348
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:54,670
He also said

349
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,130
Tianhe has the Primordial-Spirit-Initiating Moon-Chasing Bow now.

350
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:59,010
If he also has Hou Yi's Sun-Shooting Bow,

351
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:00,510
he can contend against the divine dragon.

352
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:04,310
Then the wound caused by the divine dragon won't be a problem, right?

353
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,290
You want to go to the Divine Mausoleum

354
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,460
to get Hou Yi's Sun-Shooting Bow for Tianhe.

355
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,320
What about you?

356
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:12,690
Do you want to die?

357
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,540
You know clearly if you go to the divine clan's forbidden area again,

358
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,940
your primordial spirit will be hurt again.

359
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:20,930
If you can

360
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:22,690
save the one you love

361
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:24,580
and everyone else

362
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,820
with your own life,

363
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:27,380
you would do the same.

364
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,590
Ziying, you know me.

365
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:33,570
Han Lingsha would never wait for death.

366
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,660
If

367
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:39,010
I can get Hou Yi's Sun-Shooting Bow for Tianhe,

368
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,060
I will have no regrets in my life.

369
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,260
You should know me too.

370
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,620
I must fulfill my promise

371
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,500
to your sister.

372
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:21,700
Brother,

373
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:23,980
I came to you today

374
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:25,630
for Lingsha.

375
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:28,420
Can you help her?

376
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:31,130
Lingsha will die soon.

377
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,560
Lingsha will die soon.

378
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,130
You already know?

379
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,810
I just found it out.

380
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,730
Lingsha doesn't have a cold disease.

381
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:47,050
Her ancestors

382
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:48,970
accidentally entered the divine clan's forbidden area

383
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,470
and were infected by cold poison.

384
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:53,470
That's why she and her family members can't live long.

385
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,430
Do you have a way to help her?

386
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,340
You mean the divine punishment.

387
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,560
If there really is no way to save Han Lingsha,

388
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,930
she would definitely die young.

389
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:11,390
What would you do then?

390
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,020
Then I would stay with her

391
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:21,650
whether alive or dead, just like my father did for my mother.

392
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:22,420
Tianhe,

393
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,720
humans

394
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:27,060
can never

395
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:29,940
remove the divine clan's cold poison.

396
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,810
But if you become an immortal,

397
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,660
you can fight against fate.

398
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,620
Come back to Qionghua

399
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:42,010
and ascend with me.

400
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,220
Ascend?

401
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:48,990
But if we ascend,

402
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,860
we will still have to absorb Purple Crystal Mountain's spiritual power

403
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,390
and slaughter Dream Tapir Demon Clan, right?

404
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:57,900
Even I wouldn't do this.

405
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:00,420
Lingsha would rather die than do this.

406
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:05,190
Then she can only accept her fate.

407
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,020
Impossible.

408
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:08,080
Lingsha told me

409
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,820
Qionghua has many ways to remove the divine punishment.

410
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,480
You must have a way to help her.

411
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,180
Yun Tianhe,

412
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,870
Qionghua is a sect of cultivating.

413
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:22,070
How could it have a way to remove the divine punishment?

414
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,000
Han Lingsha lied to you.

415
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,090
She lied to me?

416
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:31,130
You'd better go check on her now.

417
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,410
She told you such a lame lie.

418
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,940
There must be a reason.

419
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:43,140
Brother,

420
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,620
if

421
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,930
I can persuade Dream Tapir Demon Clan

422
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,990
to give you the purple crystal power,

423
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:52,040
can you promise me that you won't kill the innocent?

424
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,020
I promise.

425
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,540
Tianhe,

426
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:08,380
do you know a general's success is built on the sacrifices of countless lives?

427
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,890
If a war is inevitable,

428
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:12,380
I can only promise myself

429
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,770
to protect you.

430
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:24,600
[Jixian Garden]

431
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,500
Lingsha.

432
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,630
Hou Yi's Sun-Shooting Bow.

433
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,700
According to the divine dragon,

434
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:58,540
having the Primordial-Spirit-Initiating Moon-Chasing Bow is not enough.

435
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:01,140
You still need Hou Yi's Sun-Shooting Bow to contend against it.

436
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:01,970
So I think

437
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,930
if you have Hou Yi's Sun-Shooting Bow,

438
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:05,360
you'll be more powerful, right?

439
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,360
Then the wound caused by the dragon won't be a problem.

440
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:09,460
I plan...

441
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,500
to go to the Divine Mausoleum

442
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:15,490
to steal Hou Yi's Sun-Shooting Bow and give it to you. What do you think?

443
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:17,570
Lingsha.

444
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:20,450
Tianhe,

445
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,090
some disciples saw

446
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,300
Uncle Ziying and Lingsha left together.

447
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,900
Where do you think they went?

448
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,180
Have you heard of the Divine Mausoleum?

449
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,440
The Divine Mausoleum?

450
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:32,870
I've heard a bit about this place.

451
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:35,300
It's said that it is floating in a sea of clouds

452
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,770
on the west side of Chenzhou.

453
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:38,570
But... why is it on the west side?

454
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,010
Tianhe.

455
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:41,930
Tianhe.

456
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,690
[Divine Mausoleum]

457
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:47,730
The divine clan's mausoleum

458
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:50,090
is usually located at a place of nothingness.

459
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,600
The western paradise is infinite and boundless.

460
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,930
It's indeed on the west side of the clouds.

461
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:00,810
Lingsha,

462
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:03,500
wait for me outside.

463
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:04,900
I'll go in to get the bow.

464
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,620
But I've made up my mind

465
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,170
to take away the divine bow.

466
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,950
So the deities must know it.

467
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:13,300
Whether I go in or not,

468
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,360
I will be punished.

469
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:16,540
Besides,

470
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:20,100
I'm more experienced in treasure hunting than you, right?

471
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,360
I promised your sister

472
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,640
to protect you.

473
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:26,750
It would be great even if you can stay alive for just one more day.

474
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,010
You sinner.

475
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:56,220
How dare you break into the Divine Mausoleum!

476
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,620
Are you a deity or a ghost?

477
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,430
I am the divine guard, Gou Mang.

478
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:01,280
No one has dared to enter this place for thousands of years.

479
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,410
I noticed that you want to break into the forbidden area.

480
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:07,130
Divine Guard, please calm down.

481
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:07,880
We came here

482
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,770
because Hou Yi's Sun-Shooting Bow

483
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,610
can avoid a fierce battle between humans and demons.

484
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:12,940
We are risking our lives

485
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:15,650
to borrow the divine bow to avoid the slaughter of innocent lives.

486
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:18,250
You must hope the people can be safe too, right?

487
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:20,530
Please allow us to take away the divine bow.

488
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:21,370
Stop talking.

489
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,650
The moment you entered the mausoleum,

490
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:25,680
I knew you are a sinner with the divine punishment

491
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,340
because your ancestors broke into the forbidden area.

492
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,330
Yet you still entered the Divine Mausoleum.

493
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:31,130
You are committing another sin.

494
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:32,890
I know I'm guilty.

495
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,780
But even if I have to die now,

496
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:36,940
I must take away the divine bow.

497
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:38,530
In this way,

498
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,090
I can protect the most important person in my life

499
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,660
and thousands of people.

500
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,690
This can be counted as a way

501
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:48,090
to atone for the sin of my ancestors. Right?

502
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,160
Divine Guard, please give me the bow.

503
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:52,060
Lingsha.

504
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:56,540
Lingsha.

505
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,020
Stand up.

506
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,700
You shouldn't have lied to me.

507
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,020
You shouldn't have come here either.

508
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:02,420
Let's go.

509
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:02,870
Wait.

510
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:08,310
So you're a pure man for three lifetimes.

511
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,840
Divine Guard, may I ask

512
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,580
what a pure man for three lifetimes means?

513
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,460
It means a man who has been innocent

514
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,750
and had a pure heart for three lifetimes.

515
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:19,810
What's rarer is you have a body of ultimate Yin and Yang.

516
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:22,980
I can give it a try.

517
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:27,430
Let's see if the divine bow will accept him as the owner.

518
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:29,210
But your lifespan will definitely be shortened.

519
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:30,140
Do you regret it?

520
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,480
-No.
-I don't want it.

521
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,300
Tianhe,

522
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,600
the bow is already in my hands.

523
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:45,890
I've got the bow.

524
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:49,730
But this is just a bow.

525
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,900
It's not worth your life.

526
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,700
Even just one day

527
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:55,500
or a moment of your life.

528
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,150
Divine Guard,

529
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:01,850
take back the divine bow.

530
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,790
Give back Lingsha's years of life.

531

Tianhe,

532
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,180

Divine Guard,

534
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:18,860
thank you.

535
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:19,810
You're quite generous.

536
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:21,090
He left me four beads.

537
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,340
No.

I'm begging you.

540
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:36,510
Give Lingsha's years of life back to her.

541
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,180
You...

542
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,220
You can punish me however you want.

543

I'm begging you.

544

The divine bow has accepted you as its owner.

545
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,210
It can't be taken back.

546
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:45,650
If you die in 100 years,

547
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,970
it will return to the Divine Mausoleum.

548
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,430
You guys should leave now.

549
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:50,670
Stop making noise.

00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:12,460
♫Maybe it's our tacit understanding♫

562
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:10,780
You have to shoulder the responsibility of saving the people

563
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:13,440
and avoiding the war between humans and demons.

564
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:17,510
♫I dare not look into your eyes♫

565
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:21,010
♫My heart is trembling♫

566
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:26,470
♫Now it's full of wounds♫

567
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:27,610
Open the door.

568
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:32,080
♫I imagine I could be with you♫

569
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:31,140
Open the door!

570
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,710
♫Holding each other every time♫

571
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:37,390
♫The breeze caresses my hair♫

♫I'm trapped in your world♫

Divine Guard.

574
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,840
Open the door!

575
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,890
♫I comb through my memories♫

576
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:42,910
Open the door!

577
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,920
Open the door! Open the door!

578
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:48,740
♫Falling into the abyss in your world♫

579
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,060
Open the door!

♫But memories won't let me go♫

581
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:54,870
♫They follow me everywhere♫

♫Every time I close my eyes♫

584
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:02,720
♫It's all about you♫

♫Tears fall at once♫

588
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,340
I can't even protect the person I love.

589
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:13,420
♫I dare not open my eyes♫

590
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,190
♫I dare not let in a ray of light♫

591
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,980
What's the use of being the chosen one?

592
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,310
♫I just want to indulge myself♫

593
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:21,030
♫Lying to myself♫

594

Tianhe.

♫Even if it's just a dream♫

596
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:26,860
Look at me.

597
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,600
If you don't want my sacrifice to be in vain,

598
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,290
make full use of the two bows

599
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,190
to fulfill your mission

600
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,320
and become the upright Yun Tianhe

601
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,730
who protects the people

602
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,300

♫It's all about you♫

620
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:27,390

♫I keep thinking about you gradually getting closer♫

♫Holding me tightly again♫

624

♫In this world♫

640

♫To see you again♫

641
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,170
Junior,

642
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,900
something happened.

643
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,160
You are so flustered.

644
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:44,310
Is it because the Red Soul power in your body

645
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:47,230
can't make you the host of the Wangshu Sword?

646
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:52,550
Huaishuo came to ask me for the Spirit-Reinforcement Pill for Ziying.

647
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,520
He said

648
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:56,730
Han Lingsha, Yun Tianhe, and Ziying

649
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:59,180
went to the Divine Mausoleum today.

650
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,180
It must be because

651
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,380
they wanted to steal Hou Yi's Sun-Shooting Bow.

652
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:09,060
Tianhe has got the Primordial-Spirit-Initiating Moon-Chasing Bow.

653
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:11,340
If he gets Hou Yi's Sun-Shooting Bow...

654
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:12,870
If he masters the skill

655
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,929
of merging the two bows,

656
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:16,739
he will

657
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:18,230
have the divine power

658
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,090
that can subvert the sun and moon.

659
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:28,540
Do you want to kill Yun Tianhe again?

660
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,310
Junior,

661
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,010
do you think I want to kill people?

662
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:32,739
Do you think

663
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:35,469
I enjoy getting my hands dirty with blood?

664
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:36,380
But

665
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,770
if Yun Tianhe

666
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:40,210
really masters the skill of merging the two bows,

667
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:41,250
he will become

668
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:45,150
a strong enemy preventing us from ascending.

669
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,020
I have promised Tianhe.

670
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,630
If he can persuade Dream Tapir Demon Clan to give up the fight

671
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,610
and give me the purple crystal spiritual power for ascension,

672
00:34:57,610 --> 00:34:59,090
I won't kill anyone.

673
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,580
You're so naive.

674
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:05,050
Why would Dream Tapir Demon Clan listen to a human?

675
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:07,820
This war

676
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:09,920
is inevitable.

677
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,600
Even if the war is inevitable,

678
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,780
I will protect Tianhe.

679
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:18,990
This is my promise to myself.

680
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,580
Fine.

681
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,690
Now there is only one way.

682
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,590
The Red Soul power in my body

683
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,420
can keep absorbing

684
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:42,650
Wangshu's power in Han Lingsha's body.

685
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,940
But you and I

686
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:48,490
have to master the double-sword technique

687
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:50,820
before Yun Tianhe merges the two bows.

688
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:51,780
When we

689
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,590
master the technique,

690
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:56,000
should we send a vanguard team first

691
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:58,680
like we did 19 years ago?

692
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,240
If so, I can prepare some men in advance.

693
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,350
Junior, if you don't say anything,

694
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:08,850
I'll take it as a yes.

695
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,380
Mingguang?

696
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:16,830
Just imprison him.

697
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,700
Don't kill him.

698
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,380
Mingguang,

699
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:32,510
you're injured.

700
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:34,170
It was... It was Grandmaster.

701
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,090
It was Grandmaster.

702
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:36,090
I told you to leave

703
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,310
and go find Ziying immediately that day.

704
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:38,800
You...

705
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,470
You shouldn't have stayed here for further information.

706
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:43,110
Master, listen to me.

707
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:46,330
-Grandmaster and Uncle Xuan Xiao...
-Mingguang.

708
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:50,070
Grandmaster,

709
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:52,220
Mingguang is guilty of following you.

710
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,340
But he didn't hear anything.

711
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,400
I can vouch for him.

712
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:55,330
Grandmaster,

713
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:56,790
please let him leave here.

714
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:57,900
Let him leave here?

715
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,330
To go to Yun Tianhe

716
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,390
and become an enemy of Qionghua?

717
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:06,050
You used the Red Soul to absorb Lingsha's spiritual power

718
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:08,890
and tricked Qionghua's disciples into going to Huanming Realm to die.

719
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:10,020
Mingguang, shut up!

720
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,420
Grandmaster.

721
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,340
Master.

722
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:24,160
Did Junior Mingguang do something wrong?

723
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,270
Mingguang colluded with the enemies and betrayed us.

724
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:27,460
The war is coming.

725
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,740
I have to make an example of him.

726
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,310
Father,

727
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:37,970
Lingsha and Ziying went to the Divine Mausoleum

728
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:40,170
to get Hou Yi's Sun-Shooting Bow for me.

729
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:44,260
Now both divine bows have accepted me as their owner.

730
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:48,220
[Yun Tianqing]

731
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,700
Maybe this is my fate.

732
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:48,620
For you, Mother,

733
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:50,700
and Lingsha,

734
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,220
I will merge the two bows

735
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,260
to avoid the war.

736
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:58,520
Hero Tianqing,

737
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:01,730
we will try our best to stay alive for each other.

738
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:03,340
We will also try our best

739
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:05,250
to keep our families and more people alive.

740
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,180
Uncle Tianqing,

741
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:07,740
I'm ashamed.

742
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,920
I have finally understood

743
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:11,860
your kindness and righteousness.

744
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:15,270
I'm willing

745
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,060
to risk my life with Tianhe

746
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:19,930
to accomplish your unfinished mission.

747
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:37,040
Today is the last time I burn incense for you.

748
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,760
Until I send the news of victory

749
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,890
to the Netherworld.

750
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:57,750
Tianhe,

751
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,580
you are the host of the Wangshu Sword.

752
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:00,810
If you are not in Qionghua,

753
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:03,210
the Wangshu Sword would be a piece of trash.

754
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:05,660
Actually,

755
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:09,040
I'm not the host of the Wangshu Sword.

756
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,660
Then how can you hold the Wangshu Sword?

757
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:16,690
That's not right.

758
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:21,190
That day in the forbidden area,

759
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,550
Tianhe could hold

760
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:23,980
the Wangshu Sword and the Xihe Sword at the same time.

761
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:24,740
Yes.

762
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,610
Back then,

763
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:30,360
according to Elder Zong Lian's Manuscript,

764
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,000
my father found Yin Yang Jade

765
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:34,520
that can neutralize Wangshu's cold aura in my mother's body.

766
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,380
But later, in order to protect me,

767
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:38,980
they put Yin Yang Jade into my body.

768
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:41,650
That day,

769
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:43,620
we did see Yin Yang Jade

770
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,270
in the Tomb of Prince Yunan.

771
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,820
That was just an empty shell.

772
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,250
I didn't tell you

773
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,720
because I didn't want to alarm Qionghua.

774
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,170
My father didn't know

775
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:56,260
who the real host of the Wangshu Sword is.

776
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,260
No wonder you have

777
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,130
overwhelming power in your body.

778
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:00,190
Since Yin Yang Jade

779
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:01,610
can make you hold the divine swords of ultimate Yin and Yang

780
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:02,890
at the same time,

781
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:04,370
I think

782
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,800
it can help you merge the two bows too.

783
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:11,810
Uncle.

784
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:16,610
This is the magical medicine

785
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:19,930
Grandmaster asked me to bring you to heal wounds and build up health.

786
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:20,660
Heal wounds?

787
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:24,100
You told Grandmaster we went to the Divine Mausoleum?

788
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:24,520
I...

789
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:27,210
I think Huaishuo said it because he didn't know.

790
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,500
Uncle knows me.

791
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,470
I always thought

792
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:33,540
Grandmaster allowed me to come to Jixian Garden

793
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,270
because she cared about Uncle.

794
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,790
So I told her whatever she asked me.

795
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:40,770
However,

796
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:44,240
she killed Mingguang.

797
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:45,700
What?

798
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:49,140
Why did she kill Mingguang?

799
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,560
Master didn't say anything.

800
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:53,020
He just asked me

801
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:55,260
to get more money from Heming Hall

802
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:56,990
and give it to Mingguang's family members

803
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:58,190
to bury him properly.

804
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,610
Go back

805
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,860
and tell Sect Leader Xu Liang.

806
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,940
If he makes up his mind,

807
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,750
he can send a talisman to me anytime.

808
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:08,930
Got it.

809
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:25,900
A fellow disciple died before the war starts.

810
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:28,910
Xuan Xiao promised me

811
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:31,130
that he wouldn't kill the innocent.

812
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:33,420
But he just let Su Yao kill her disciple.

813
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:35,500
Tianhe,

814
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:38,420
you should merge the two bows as soon as possible.

815
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:40,620
Then you can contend against Xuan Xiao.

816
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:42,760
I know your spiritual power best.

817
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,740
Let me help you regulate your breath.

818
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:45,870
I'll accompany you.

819
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:48,130
Okay.

820
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,960
Only when our minds echo each other

821
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:57,530
can we master the double-sword technique.

822
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:01,090
Su Yu.

823
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,590
My mind does echo yours.

824
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:20,140
But I'm Su Yao.

825
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:33,540
I'm not in the mood today.

826
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:39,060
Let's stop practicing the swordsmanship.

827
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:41,730
You and I are going to master the technique soon.

828
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:43,770
If you miss Su Yu so much,

829
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,650
take me as her.

830
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:53,810
Su Yu was kind.

831
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:58,280
She would rather hurt herself than hurt others.

832
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:03,380
But you just killed a disciple yesterday.

833
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:07,050
How do you expect my mind to echo yours?

834
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,490
How can a disciple

835
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:13,500
be as important as our ascension

836
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:16,050
and taking revenge for Master?

837
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:22,780
Tai Qing was incompetent and craved for success.

838
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,410
He deserved to die.

839
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:27,970
How could you compare me to him?

840
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,140
If Yun Tianhe manages

841
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:35,370
to merge the two divine bows before we master the technique,

842
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:36,810
don't expect to ascend.

843
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:38,940
Because we may

844
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,580
get killed by them.
