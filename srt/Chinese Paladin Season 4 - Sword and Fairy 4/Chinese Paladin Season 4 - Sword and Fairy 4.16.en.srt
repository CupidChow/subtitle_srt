[Episode 16]

4
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,000
Mengli.

5
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,480
I want to tell you...

6
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,289
that my father...

7
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,830
may be the enemy who killed your parents.

8
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,290
-But I...
-Tianhe.

9
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,930
We all know what you want to say.

10
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,829
Now I know

11
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,880
why you are endlessly

12
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,110
looking for books in Yunjing Pavilion.

13
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,050
I'm sorry, Mengli.

14
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,590
Upon knowing this,

15
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,690
you must be more upset than me.

16
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:54,390
Tianhe.

17
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,280
What’s done is done.

18
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,130
What are you thinking now?

19
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,870
I don't believe my father would have done such a thing.

20
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:02,390
But...

21
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,200
But I can't

22
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,750
prove his innocence either.

23
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,620
Mengli.

24
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,590
Take me as your enemy.

25
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,380
As long as it helps ease your sadness,

26
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,870
you can beat me and scold me.

27
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:20,140
You can ask me to pay with my life for your parents too.

28
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,840
As long as it eases your sadness,

29
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,480
okay?

30
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:28,870
Silly boy.

31
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,630
If Mengli hates you so much,

32
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,450
she wouldn't be in so much agony.

33
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:34,590
Tianhe.

34
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,310
Uncle has told me a lot.

35
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,090
With you like this,

36
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,770
all the more can't I hate you anymore.

37
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,120
I don't want to continue investigating it anymore.

38
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,650
I don't want our friendship

39
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,520
to be affected because of old grudges.

40
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,750
Yes, we won't investigate it anymore.

41
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,590
In my opinion,

42
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,260
this matter is over.

43
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:05,500
Uncle.

44
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,930
I really don't understand

45
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,810
why my father wanted to kill Xuan Zhen.

46
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,950
Did he kill the whole sect

47
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,670
just to seize Mengli?

48
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,060
That's what I'm confused about too.

49
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,560
I hope you can find out the truth.

50
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,610
Before the truth is revealed,

51
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,830
don't be blinded by old grudges

52
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:25,810
in front of you.

53
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,710
I really don't understand why.

54
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,590
If my parents

55
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,610
killed Senior and seized Mengli,

56
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,659
why did he give Mengli

57
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,400
the Princess Jade which can strengthen spirits?

58
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,800
They even asked Uncle Liu

59
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,530
to take good care of Mengli

60
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,440
and take care of her for the rest of his life.

61
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,960
My parents treated Mengli better

62
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,120
than they treated me.

63
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,570
I don't believe they would have done such a thing.

64
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:01,830
Tianhe.

65
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,240
No matter what the truth is,

66
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,190
I hope

67
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,700
we can be like when we first came to Qionghua.

68
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,540
Before, we only knew

69
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:44,670
that Yun Tianqing colluded with the demon clan

70
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,930
for the Wangshu Sword.

71
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,630
It turns out he even committed shameless acts

72
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:51,030
like killing a brother and seizing a child.

73
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,550
It's not true. It's not true.

74
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:54,500
Get out! Get out!

75
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,909
Your father is an unforgivable traitor.

76
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,870
Yun Tianqing is despicable and shameless!

77
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:00,420
Get lost!

78
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:01,980
He's a scum of Qionghua.

79
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:05,270
Father.

80
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,090
Father.

81
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,670
I'm sorry, Senior Huaixin.

82
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,030
Junior.

83
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,650
My father has passed away too.

84
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:37,990
So from now on,

85
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:39,670
you should burn incense

86
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,870
and pray to your father in this room too.

87
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,670
I can keep watch for you outside.

88
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,080
Thank you.

89
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:13,310
Father.

90
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,430
I came to Qionghua

91
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,440
to understand you.

92
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,200
But now,

93
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,400
I'm finding you more and more distant.

94
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,980
I can barely recognize you now.

95
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:29,230
Father.

96
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,520
I just want to ask you one thing.

97
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,909
Did you kill

98
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,130
Mengli's parents?

99
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:43,159
Father, didn't you say

100
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:45,780
you can hear me?

101
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,260
Then answer me.

102
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:50,810
Just one reply.

103
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,580
The son of the traitor

104
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,700
is secretly burning incense for the traitor Yun Tianqing.

105
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,740
Sorry, Junior.

106
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,460
I really had no choice.

107
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,490
What do you mean?

108
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,270
Do you want to be a traitor too?

109
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:22,960
[Yun Tianqing]

110
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,960
Don’t give Senior Huaixin a hard time.

111
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,360
It is a son's natural duty

112
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:37,159
to burn incense for his father.

113
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,600
With you burning incense for the traitor in Qionghua,

114
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,150
how can we face

115
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,539
the 3,000 valiants buried behind the mountain?

116
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:43,460
That's right.

117
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:44,950
Yun Tianhe.

118
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,750
You're insulting Qionghua.

119
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,160
It's intolerable!

120
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,250
Insulting Qionghua is intolerable!

121
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:52,990
Give it to me!

122
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:53,610
Don't resort to violence.

123
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:54,680
-Give it to me!
-Don't resort to violence!

124
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,030
Give it to me.

125
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,710
Calm down.

126
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,420
Don't resort to violence!

127
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,180
Let go!

128
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,930
Give it to me!

129
00:08:59,470 --> 00:08:59,910
Let go!

130
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,550
Give it to me.

131
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,080
Stop!

132
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:02,930
What are you doing?

133
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:03,660
Stop!

134
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,250
Move aside! Move aside!

135
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,330
-What are you doing?
-Senior.

136
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:08,890
Stop them now. Help Tianhe.

137
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,540
What are you doing?

138
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,600
So many of you are bullying one man.

139
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,960
You're the ones insulting Qionghua.

140
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,510
Fine.

141
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,470
If he still wants to stay as a disciple of Qionghua,

142
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:23,020
he must destroy the memorial tablet of the traitor Yun Tianqing.

143
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,700
Disciples!

144
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,690
Smash Yun Tianqing’s memorial tablet!

145
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,970
Smash his memorial tablet!

146
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,550
Lingsha!

147
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,610
-Smash it!
-Lingsha!

148
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:31,870
Smash it. Give it to me.

149
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:32,760
Are you okay?

150
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,550
I'm fine.

151
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:37,350
Let's see who dares to smash my father's memorial tablet!

152
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,200
What happened?

153
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:09,370
Tianhe.

154
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,050
I hid my heart in this memorial tablet

155
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,080
and it'll grow up with you.

156
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,670
It'll never leave you,

157
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,110
okay?

158
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,130
You won't let my father go even when he's dead.

159
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:50,920
Then none of you shall live!

160
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,710
Tianhe!

161
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,650
Tianhe! Tianhe!

162
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:09,310
Don't! Tianhe!

163
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:11,370
The son of the traitor has gone crazy!

164
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,400
Stop!

165
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:15,650
Uncle.

166
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,380
Tianhe.

167
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,080
Tianhe.

168
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:28,520
The sect will decide how the matter of Yun Tianqing will be handled.

169
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,420
How dare you cause trouble together?

170
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,100
How dare you disregard the rules?

171
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,650
Then what should we do about Yun Tianhe

172
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,220
physically hurting others?

173
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:35,940
Uncle!

174
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,750
They smashed the memorial tablet of Tianhe's father first!

175
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,250
I'll report it to Grandmaster and it will be dealt with.

176
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,710
Grandmaster has an order!

177
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:53,430
Grandmaster has found out what happened here.

178
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,360
You guys are causing trouble.

179
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:59,400
Go find your own master and receive your punishment.

180
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:00,900
Yes.

181
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:05,090
Yun Tianhe physically hurt others.

182
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,970
If he doesn't bow down and apologize to the seniors,

183
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,630
he'll be sent to Sifan Valley.

184
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:19,820
Tianhe.

185
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,680
Apologize to all of the seniors immediately.

186
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:23,740
My father...

187
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,430
I didn't do anything wrong.

188
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:28,680
Apologize!

189
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,230
Uncle Ziying.

190
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,910
I didn't do anything wrong!

191
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,430
Apologize!

192
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,550
Take him to Sifan Valley.

193
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,190
-Yes.
-Aunt Su Xi!

194
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:36,190
[Sifan Valley]

195
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:35,770
Father.

196
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,500
Father.

197
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:42,870
Father.

198
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,310
I'm sorry, Father.

199
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:58,050
I promised you I wouldn't cry.

200
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,080
But today,

201
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,830
I was so useless.

202
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:16,140
I couldn't even protect your memorial tablet.

203
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:22,310
I don't want to investigate it anymore.

204
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,880
I should have listened to you.

205
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:30,250
I should have returned to Qingluan Peak.

206
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,520
I shouldn't have gone down the mountain.

207
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,230
Father.

208
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,040
Father.

209
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,630
Are you not coming back?

210
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,110
Father.

211
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:54,970
Father.

212
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,270
Father.

213
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,590
Uncle.

214
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,390
I heard from a senior

215
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:20,990
that only disciples who make big mistakes

216
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,430
are locked up in Sifan Valley.

217
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,310
Why do I feel

218
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,190
this place is not that dangerous?

219
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,740
How long has Tianhe been in there?

220
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,710
Almost an hour.

221
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,130
Uncle, what kind of place is Sifan Valley?

222
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,390
Why are you so nervous?

223
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,040
Sifan Valley...

224
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:34,490
As the name suggests,

225
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,590
it's to let those who enter to calm down and reflect.

226
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:37,790
But the difference is

227
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,640
that one day outside the valley

228
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,240
is equivalent to ten or so days in Sifan Valley.

229
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,680
So a few days outside the valley

230
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,110
is months in the valley?

231
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,320
This is the cruelty of Sifan Valley.

232
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,910
It's like draining your life with time.

233
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,360
I hope Tianhe will only stay for a moment.

234
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,000
It's almost time. Release him.

235
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,550
It's not that we don't want to release him.

236
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,630
Grandmaster ordered

237
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:00,800
that if he doesn't come out by himself,

238
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,130
no one can go and get him.

239
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,829
Tianhe! Yun Tianhe!

240
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,300
-Come out now!
-Lingsha.

241
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,440
According to Tianhe's temperament,

242
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,839
he wouldn't come out and admit his mistake.

243
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,680
I'll go find Grandmaster.

244
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:13,950
We'll go with you.

245
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,300
Mengli.

246
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,300
Go with Uncle to find Grandmaster.

247
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,829
I'll look for someone else.

248
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:19,900
Okay.

249
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:27,490
Grandmaster.

250
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,790
Tianhe loves his father deeply.

251
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,780
His anger is understandable.

252
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,790
Then isn't the disciples' anger

253
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,360
understandable?

254
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,230
Not only did he not admit his mistake,

255
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,730
but he also physically hurt others.

256
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:39,990
It's not unfair for him

257
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,070
to receive this punishment.

258
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:45,490
I asked Yun Tianhe to reflect on himself in Sifan Valley.

259
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:48,290
If he doesn't come to his senses, he can't come out.

260
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:51,000
If it's been a month and he still hasn't come to his senses, he can't come out.

261
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,310
I want to use time

262
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,050
to temper his temperament.

263
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,770
If he can't figure it out,

264
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,830
then he can stay in there.

265
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,750
If Tianhe stays in Sifan Valley,

266
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,380
I’m afraid he’ll die of old age in months.

267
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:03,890
Grandmaster.

268
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:07,100
When Ziying's master Su Shen left the sect,

269
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,150
Ziying was as much of an emotional wreck as Tianhe is now,

270
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:11,370
but he was forgiven by you and the other sect leaders.

271
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:14,770
This time, please spare Tianhe too.

272
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,540
Sparing his life

273
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,460
is already the greatest mercy I can offer him.

274
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:21,000
Our four sects have suffered severe casualties.

275
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,310
A scoundrel like him

276
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:25,580
should have his spiritual power absorbed and his bones broken.

277
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,350
Since Yun Tianhe has entered the sect,

278
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,100
the disciples have been pestering him nonstop.

279
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,140
They've been relentlessly provoking him with his father's rebellion.

280
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,670
Such behavior is improper.

281
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,360
Grandmaster, you should evaluate this matter thoroughly.

282
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,460
Don't just listen to one side of the story.

283
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,260
Grandmaster.

284
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,870
I, Xu Zhao, am here to implore you to take Yun Tianhe

285
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,230
out of Sifan Valley.

286
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,690
Thank you, Uncle Xu Zhao.

287
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:48,490
Your gratitude is premature.

288
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,000
I'm not finished yet.

289
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,830
Even if Yun Tianhe is not the son of a traitor,

290
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,890
his crazy outbursts are still a problem.

291
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,200
His presence is a threat to our safety.

292
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,190
So I implore you to

293
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,630
eradicate Yun Tianhe.

294
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,760
Tianhe is unfamiliar of worldly affairs and forthright.

295
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,630
He just wanted to protect his father.

296
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:09,960
What's wrong with that?

297
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,000
Who was it that

298
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,160
lured Tianhe to attend your class?

299
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,020
And who instigated the disciples

300
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,370
to be so agitated?

301
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,320
Grandmaster.

302
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,770
When Tianhe seized the Wangshu Sword

303
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,120
from Beike in Chenzhou,

304
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,510
he had an outburst of spiritual power too.

305
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,790
But without Tianhe's power,

306
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:29,900
the Wangshu Sword would have been destroyed by that evil demon Beike.

307
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,700
Grandmaster, Tianhe is indeed extremely gifted.

308
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:35,060
The majestic spiritual power in his body just lacks guidance

309
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:35,840
and he can't control himself.

310
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,970
I've been looking for a mediating solution.

311
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:39,250
Junior Ziying.

312
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,780
I'm afraid that before a mediating solution is found,

313
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,000
he'd have already gone crazy

314
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,430
and caused a disaster.

315
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:47,890
Senior Xu Zhao, are you doubting my ability?

316
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,680
Ziying is a unique genius.

317
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:52,350
He advanced to the fifth level of Qian Yuan Realm at the age of 15.

318
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:55,630
Now, he's about to advance to the sixth level of Wu Xiang Realm.

319
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:58,180
He will be on a par with the two elders soon.

320
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,260
Grandmaster.

321
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,360
I think rather than locking Yun Tianhe in Sifan Valley,

322
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,450
we should hand him to Nephew Ziying.

323
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:06,850
I believe that given time,

324
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:09,180
Ziying will surely tame his temperament.

325
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:10,710
Everyone of you

326
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,830
has their own opinions and they're all logical.

327
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,430
I just want to know one thing.

328
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:19,170
How should I explain it to the disciples?

329
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,940
I can't have everyone unsatisfied

330
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,420
just because of him.

331
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:26,430
Since Yun Tianhe is Qionghua's disciple,

332
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,280
I won’t give him the death penalty

333
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,720
because of Yun Tianqing.

334
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:31,650
Just like everyone else,

335
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:34,490
he has to obey Qionghua's rules.

336
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,940
Everyone should be treated equally.

337
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,800
Must we force Tianhe to death before everyone will be satisfied?

338
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,880
Liu Mengli.

339
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,620
By ordering him to reflect on himself,

340
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,490
Grandmaster is already being merciful.

341
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,350
He’d better stay in Sifan Valley.

342
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,730
If he comes out,

343
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,190
according to the law,

344
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,350
it'll be the Ice and Fire Whipping punishment.

345
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,200
Grandmaster, please give the order

346
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,010
to bring Tianhe out immediately.

347
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,330
As Tianhe's master,

348
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,990
I didn't teach him well.

349
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:15,580
I'm willing to take the punishment for Tianhe.

350
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,370
Ziying.

351
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:25,390
Do you know the consequences of Ice and Fire Whipping?

352
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:29,720
Hurry up.

353
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,480
Greetings, Elder Qingyang.

354
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,140
Step aside.

355
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,060
I want to go in with Little Master.

356
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,460
But Grandmaster ordered

357
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,870
that unless he comes out himself,

358
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:38,260
no one can take Yun Tianhe away.

359
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,990
Let me tell you.

360
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,030
I set this confinement barrier.

361
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,610
No one else in Qionghua Sect

362
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,210
can set up this forbidden realm.

363
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:48,020
If I remove this barrier,

364
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,260
Sifan Valley will cease to exist.

365
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:52,900
If Sifan Valley is gone,

366
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,780
how are you going to explain to Grandmaster?

367
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,460
Elder, please calm down.

368
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,100
May I report back to her about this?

369
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,020
For what?

370
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,310
If Su Yao makes things difficult for you,

371
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,090
ask her to come to me.

372
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:02,490
Little Master, let's go!

373
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:10,210
Tianhe.

374
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,670
Why are you here?

375
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,220
Let's go!

376
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:31,940
With this barrier,

377
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,940
you won't be consumed by time.

378
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:37,880
Tianhe.

379
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:41,360
Little Master Lingsha asked me to persuade you to leave.

380
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,610
It's good here.

381
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:46,120
It's just me and my father.

382
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,430
Yun Tianhe.

383
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,730
You are really Yun Tianqing’s son.

384
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,680
You are as stubborn as your father.

385
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,890
Back then,

386
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:12,670
he was often in agony because what he wanted

387
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:15,070
was different from what Qionghua desired.

388
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:17,840
But at most, he'd have a round of drinks at Zuihuayin

389
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,570
and be relieved of his worries.

390
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,510
Kid.

391
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,150
You need to learn your father's

392
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:25,210
open-mindedness and calmness in dealing with others.

393
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:26,700
Elder Qingyang.

394
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,430
Tell me the truth.

395
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,750
Is my father a traitor

396
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,210
or a loyal man?

397
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,830
It's been 19 years.

398
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,530
I wish I could personally tell your father

399
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:01,800
that in my heart,

400
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:04,400
he is an upright and loyal man.

401
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,320
Elder Qingyang.

402
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:13,030
You said my father is a loyal man.

403
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,070
Then why

404
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:16,150
did he kill his best friend Xuan Zhen?

405
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,310
Actually, your parents' best friend back then

406
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,170
wasn't Xuan Zhen,

407
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,650
but Xuan Xiao.

408
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,160
Tianqing and Xuan Xiao were from the same sect.

409
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,540
For Xuan Xiao, Tianqing

410
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,680
fought with the other disciples.

411
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:48,110
Xuan Xiao took all the blame for it

412
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:52,620
and was punished by the former grandmaster Tai Qing with the Ice and Fire Whipping.

413
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,720
-Ice and Fire Whipping?
-Ice and Fire Whipping?

414
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,480
Ziying, you're at the critical moment of breaking into the next realm.

415
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,280
If you take the Ice and Fire Whipping,

416
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,630
you won't be able to improve your spiritual cultivation for three years.

417
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,580
I won't improve for three years at most.

418
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,990
But if Tianhe takes the punishment,

419
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:07,720
even if he doesn't die, he won't be able to recover from it.

420
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,570
You're the pride of Qionghua.

421
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,160
Let alone three years, I won't agree to it

422
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,750
even if your spiritual cultivation is hindered just for a year!

423
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:14,630
That's right.

424
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:18,520
How can the pride of Qionghua be punished for a wild man?

425
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,880
Junior Ziying, you must have lost your mind.

426
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:23,160
If I'm not punished,

427
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,100
how can we stop the gossip?

428
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,130
Uncle Ziying!

429
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:26,650
Mengli.

430
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,070
Leave.

431
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,310
Leave!

432
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,060
Grandmaster, don't worry.

433
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,060
Please punish me.

434
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:47,810
Grandmaster!

435
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,300
Grandmaster, please think twice!

436
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,890
Please punish me.

437
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:01,160
The four sect leaders.

438
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,330
Punish him.

439
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:53,930
Let me in!

440
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:56,100
Tianhe!

441
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:57,600
Yun Tianhe!

442
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:02,150
[Sifan Valley]

443
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:59,580
Let her in.

444
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,980
-Ziying!
-Uncle!

445
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:45,750
Uncle Ziying.

446
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,580
Are you crazy?

447
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,350
Don't you know the consequences?

448
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,410
It doesn't matter.

449
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,510
Grandmaster.

450
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,850
You shouldn't have brought Tianhe here.

451
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:58,120
You suffered because of me.

452
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,100
Of course I have to come.

453
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:04,120
The son of the traitor

454
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:07,150
is also a bad disciple who persecuted his master.

455
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,790
Crazy Yun Tianhe.

456
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:16,830
If you dare to act wildly here,

457
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:19,030
don't blame us for being ruthless.

458
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:20,970
You guys!

459
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,410
Tianhe has already entered Sifan Valley

460
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,090
and Uncle Ziying has been punished.

461
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:26,950
Why are you still not letting this go?

462
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:27,900
Yun Tianhe.

463
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:30,110
Since you’ve left Sifan Valley,

464
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:31,690
what do you want to do?

465
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,080
Tianhe!

466
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:10,470
Grandmaster.

467
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:12,440
Sect leaders.

468
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,310
I was momentarily confused

469
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,970
and physically hurt my brothers.

470
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:19,990
I violated the rules.

471
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,960
I admit my mistakes.

472
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,170
I apologize for my offence.

473
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:31,410
What?

474
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,750
Do you think admitting your mistake is enough to resolve this matter?

475
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,080
-I think you should…
-Sect Leader Xu Zhao.

476
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:51,680
I was the one who said

477
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:54,460
that when Yun Tianhe leaves Sifan Valley,

478
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,960
he must admit his mistake

479
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:58,390
and bear the punishment of Ice and Fire Whipping.

480
00:29:58,390 --> 00:29:59,570
That has been fulfilled,

481
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:01,150
so this matter is settled.

482
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,000
Sect leaders.

483
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:05,030
Please manage your disciples well.

484
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,590
Yes.

485
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:11,040
Yun Tianhe.

486
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:12,920
If there is a next time,

487
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:15,120
no one would be able to help you.

488
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:18,220
I'll keep that in mind.

489
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:20,190
Thank you, Grandmaster.

490
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:21,780
Go back and recuperate.

491
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,180
You may leave too.

492
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:28,010
Get up.

493
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:29,680
Let's go.

494
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,870
Su Yao.

495
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:03,010
How could you have willingly whipped Ziying?

496
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,410
Elder Qingyang.

497
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,750
Ziying is the candidate for the next grandmaster

498
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,240
whom I've been meticulously training.

499
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,170
How could I have willingly done it?

500
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,590
With this 300 whips he suffered,

501
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,380
not only did he save Yun Tianhe

502
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:17,610
but he also protected the instigator behind the scenes

503
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,790
and sacrificed himself to stabilize the overall situation.

504
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:23,190
This is also an improvement in how he should conduct himself.

505
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,070
I see.

506
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,560
It seems you already know it,

507
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,230
right?

508
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:31,220
Elder Qingyang, you seem like an old rogue,

509
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,270
but in fact, you're perceptive and clearheaded.

510
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:35,900
Otherwise, you wouldn't have gone to Sifan Valley

511
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,380
to take Yun Tianhe out.

512
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,850
Sifan Valley?

513
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,600
This name sounds familiar.

514
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,110
Is it the place where I collect herbs?

515
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:45,470
My goodness.

516
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,220
My medicinal soup is still on the stove.

517
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:47,930
I have to go.

518
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:49,580
I can't talk to you anymore.

519
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:16,200
Mengli told me

520
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:21,260
the Ice and Fire Whipping will weaken your spiritual cultivation.

521
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,530
Uncle.

522
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,040
I know I was wrong.

523
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:44,590
What did you do wrong?

524
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,080
I shouldn't have hurt others in a fit of rage

525
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,420
and caused such huge trouble.

526
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,100
What else?

527
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,000
I was wrong

528
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:05,580
for not admitting my mistake earlier.

529
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:15,720
I understand it now.

530
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,550
Bowing down for a moment

531
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:21,500
doesn't mean bowing down forever.

532
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:25,690
That's what I wanted to hear the most.

533
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,180
Remember,

534
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:36,870
don't act impulsively when you encounter difficulties.

535
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,120
Learn to be tolerant.

536
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:40,280
Everything

537
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:43,270
depends on one's effort.

538
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,550
I will keep that in mind.

539
00:33:58,780 --> 00:33:59,450
Elder.

540
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:02,150
This time, we could have successfully eradicated

541
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:03,540
the menace Yun Tianhe.

542
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:04,950
But unexpectedly,

543
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:09,420
Murong Ziying actually took the punishment of Ice and Fire Whipping for him.

544
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:12,639
Did I really misjudge Ziying?

545
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,550
This means

546
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,800
Murong Ziying

547
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,400
is not of one heart and one mind with you.

548
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,389
He can't be the future grandmaster

549
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:21,409
of Qionghua Sect.

550
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:24,870
Right now, only you have advanced to the seventh level of Tai Qing Realm.

551
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:28,000
As expected of the best of Qionghua in five generations.

552
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,590
Xuan Xiao has already advanced to

553
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,139
the seventh level of Tai Qing Realm before me.

554
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:37,710
He could achieve that even when he's in the Xuan Ice?

555
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,489
If he has advanced to Tai Qing Realm,

556
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:42,940
that means the Ice-breaking Day is just around the corner.

557
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,449
We must get rid of the menace in advance.

558
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,510
Unless I break through the next realm,

559
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:49,870
I can't suppress him at all.

560
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:52,560
Xuan Xiao holds the Xihe,

561
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,130
while the host of Wangshu is Yun Tianhe.

562
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,530
Both of them are menaces.

563
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:01,810
Xu Zhao, you lackey!

564
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:04,000
Did you instigate the Aura Sect's disciples to make a scene?

565
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,960
Xu Zhao, please leave first.

566
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,550
Qingyang, since you've long decided to play dumb,

567
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:14,410
why did you come here to expose it?

568
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,650
Isn't it good to continue being crazy and happy?

569
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:19,330
I am crazy, but I am not stupid.

570
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:20,890
I don't care about you cultivating your power in Qionghua

571
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:22,770
or your secret plot.

572
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:25,150
But you can't touch that kid Yun Tianhe.

573
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:25,960
Do you hear me?

574
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,280
What virtues and abilities does this wild kid have?

575
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,080
Even you're speaking up for him.

576
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,590
Chongguang.

577
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:34,990
If you dare to secretly send someone

578
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:36,530
to hurt Yun Tianhe,

579
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,760
don't blame me for turning against you.

580
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:39,630
Qingyang.

581
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:44,160
I never once thought about killing Yun Tianhe.

582
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,670
But he refused to go down the mountain.

583
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,450
Xuan Xiao is about to break the ice.

584
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:48,650
If Xuan Xiao finds out

585
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,320
Yun Tianhe is such a person,

586
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,080
I'm afraid there will be trouble.

587
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,390
If it were you,

588
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,790
would you allow everything from 19 years ago

589
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:56,880
to happen again?

590
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,020
I think you're the one who has gone crazy.
