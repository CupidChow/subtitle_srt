00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,830
[Episode 11]

4
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:57,630
How is it?

5
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,300
Is Tianhe badly injured?

6
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,470
This time, it’s not because of Wangshu's cold aura.

7
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,320
So the styrax worked on him.

8
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,550
He'll be fine after a good sleep.

9
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,430
Mengli.

10
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,230
Do you want to

11
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,030
send some of this to Ice Cube?

12
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,810
I think he's badly injured too.

13
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,100
Don't worry.

14
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,500
I’ve already been there.

15
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,280
But he insisted on leaving the styrax to Tianhe.

16
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,310
He also asked me to instruct you

17
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,510
that since you have not recovered

18
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,160
from absorbing Tianhe's cold,

19
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,310
you must rest more.

20
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,440
That's strange.

21
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,670
I was in the Sleep Condition for a few days

22
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,350
and Ice Cube seems to have become a different person.

23
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,350
He even knows how to care for others.

24
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,840
He was also the one who made your cold medicine.

25
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,760
And Tianhe has always been by your side

26
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,940
and never left you.

27
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,180
Now it's my turn to stay by his side.

28
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,210
Bring Yun Tianhe to Qionghua immediately.

29
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,890
He knows you're lying to him.

30
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:19,880
Lingsha.

31
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,000
I have something to ask you.

32
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:22,880
Go ahead.

33
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,980
Lingsha should also be sincere towards Mr. Yun.

34
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,579
How could she be lying to him?

35
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,560
But who is that man in black?

36
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,070
Mengli.

37
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:42,910
You can ask me anything.

38
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:44,710
I...

39
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,070
It's nothing.

40
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,160
Lingsha.

41
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:49,680
You must rest well.

42
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,070
I know.

43
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,260
Go back and rest.

44
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,310
I know what to do.

45
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:04,510
Miss Han.

46
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,550
I envy you, for in reality,

47
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,680
you have a true companion like Mr. Yun.

48
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,390
You mustn't deceive him.

49
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,760
You must be sincere towards him.

50
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,519
I must be sincere towards him?

51
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,300
Tianhe.

52
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,190
I don't know why Miss Mingzhu said that.

53
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:26,660
But I...

54
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,460
Water.

55
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,280
What?

56
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:30,550
Water.

57
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:31,860
Water?

58
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,580
Wait, I'll get it for you.

59
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,900
Even if Yun Tianhe helps to kill demons,

60
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,909
he is Yun Tianqing’s son after all.

61
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,280
Isn't letting him stay at Jixian Garden

62
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,430
an insult to Qionghua?

63
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,030
Yes.

64
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,800
I don't know what Uncle Ziying is thinking.

65
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,190
If Grandmaster finds out,

66
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:47,750
she will be angry.

67
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,670
What nonsense are you talking about?

68
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,180
Senior.

69
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:52,890
We were just stating facts.

70
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,780
Uncle Ziying has long said

71
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,490
that this matter,

72
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,860
including the name Yun Tianqing,

73
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,030
shouldn't be mentioned again.

74
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,830
I think you forgot all the rules.

75
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,160
[Yun Tianqing]

76
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,780
Why did they talk about Tianhe's father like that?

77
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,350
Uncle.

78
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:30,520
I've gone to bed.

79
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:31,870
Let's talk tomorrow.

80
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,390
Uncle.

81
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,270
Grandmaster sent a letter to ask

82
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,640
when you will return to Qionghua now that

83
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,560
Chenzhou's Sleep Condition outbreak has been resolved.

84
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,620
Mr. Yun is injured.

85
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,670
We'll set off after he's fully recovered.

86
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:40,670
Uncle Ziying.

87
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,670
I'm worried about your injury.

88
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:43,590
I’m fine.

89
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,110
Go back and rest.

90
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:45,790
Yes.

91
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,960
But Uncle,

92
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:47,500
I...

93
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,180
Let's go.

94
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:02,130
You...

95
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,070
How can you be so rude?

96
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,070
I...

97
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,130
The lights in your room were on just now.

98
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,380
Well,

99
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,110
you won't be shy if you take me as a man.

100
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,320
What do you think?

101
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,370
Miss Han.

102
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,310
Let's talk tomorrow.

103
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,070
Some things can't wait until tomorrow.

104
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,000
Miss Han, please behave yourself.

105
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,550
I need to rest.

106
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,390
Sure.

107
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,290
Just open the door.

108
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,680
It will spread throughout Qionghua soon

109
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,150
that Uncle Ziying's clothing is disheveled

110
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,750
and he explored a heroine's body late at night.

111
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:54,880
What is it?

112
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:55,690
Tell me now.

113
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:56,850
Then tell me,

114
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,750
why do Qionghua's disciples

115
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,230
assume an attitude of disgust and contempt

116
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,870
upon the mention of Tianhe’s father?

117
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,130
What did his father do?

118
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:05,360
I don't know.

119
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:06,510
Please leave.

120
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,630
You must know.

121
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,660
I won't leave until you tell me.

122
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,150
Fine.

123
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,120
I'll leave.

124
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,150
You can leave.

125
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:13,520
By then,

126
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,230
I'll put the memorial tablet of Tianhe's father

127
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,310
in the middle of Jixian Garden

128
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,570
and we'll pay our respects to his father.

129
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,670
You mustn't do that.

130
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,030
So just tell me.

131
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,720
You know how much Tianhe loves his father.

132
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,430
Why can't anyone even mention his father now?

133
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,230
I told everyone in Jixian Garden

134
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,990
not to mention Yun Tianqing.

135
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,470
Because he is the biggest traitor

136
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,170
of Qionghua Sect.

137
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:47,560
19 years ago,

138
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,330
his rebellion

139
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:54,280
caused a catastrophic disaster to the entire Qionghua.

140
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,610
Out of 3,000 disciples,

141
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,920
only a few dozen people survived.

142
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:02,260
The former grandmaster Immortal Tai Qing

143
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,390
and Master Xuan Zhen

144
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,410
also died in that disaster.

145
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:11,730
I don't know

146
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:12,980
the details.

147
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,720
So you didn't tell Tianhe because you're afraid

148
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,160
he might be devastated?

149
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,160
What good can come out of Tianhe

150
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,430
going to Qionghua?

151
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,150
Grandmaster knows right from wrong.

152
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:29,370
She won't get the younger generation involved in the grudge of older generations.

153
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,990
But I'm afraid the disciples of Qionghua

154
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,390
wouldn't be so friendly.

155
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:33,950
Miss Han.

156
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,360
Tomorrow, you mustn't...

157
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,110
I know. I know.

158
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,240
I won't tell anyone.

159
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:38,840
I won't tell Tianhe either.

160
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,900
What if Tianhe finds out

161
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,320
when he gets to Qionghua?

162
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,590
Tianhe.

163
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,430
If you know

164
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:59,620
that your father was such a despicable traitor,

165
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,290
you will definitely be beyond miserable.

166
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:03,020
No.

167
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,570
I can't let you face that in Qionghua.

168
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,600
But if you don't go to Qionghua,

169
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,670
how can Wangshu Sword be brought there?

170
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,200
How can I get the elixir in exchange

171
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,710
to save my cousin?

172
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,480
What should I do?

173
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,840
Lingsha.

174
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,710
Lingsha!

175
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:29,770
Lingsha!

176
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,310
Tianhe.

177
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,550
I swear

178
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,890
this will be the only thing I'll lie to you about.

179
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,760
If you find out,

180
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,580
you will definitely leave me.

181
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:08,870
Father.

182
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,110
In order to save Lingsha,

183
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,870
a demon named Beike almost

184
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,590
took your sword away.

185
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:17,940
Luckily,

186
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,030
I defeated Beike.

187
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,550
Later,

188
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,910
Lingsha ignored her health

189
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,150
and inhaled the Wangshu's cold aura in me.

190
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,390
Father.

191
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,280
After so many things have happened,

192
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,190
I realized

193
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,790
that in my heart,

194
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,030
I worry about Lingsha the most.

195
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,580
But as long as Lingsha is safe,

196
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,310
my heart

197
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,390
can be at ease.

198
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,630
You can rest assured, Father.

199
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,810
Lingsha is a good person.

200
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,790
As long as I'm with her,

201
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,070
I won't be used by bad guys.

202
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,230
Hero Yun.

203
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:01,850
If you were still here,

204
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:04,030
you wouldn't let Tianhe follow me.

205
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,480
You’re awake, Lingsha.

206
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,030
I just told my father to keep it down

207
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:15,570
so as not to wake you up.

208
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,910
What's wrong with you, Lingsha?

209
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,480
I'm thinking

210
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,650
there's something where if you know about it,

211
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:29,780
you will be unhappy.

212
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,990
But if you don't know about it,

213
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,190
you'll be very happy.

214
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,840
Do you want to know about it?

215
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,870
It depends on what it is.

216
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,300
In any case, my father said

217
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,900
happiness is the most important thing in life.

218
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,340
Miss.

219
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,640
Do you know that this table

220
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,900
has always belonged to Hero Zhang Yutai

221
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,460
of Qingfeng Sword?

222
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,350
I don't know him.

223
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,550
I don't want to talk.

224
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,190
How is an ignorant little girl like you so arrogant?

225
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,400
You're just a woman.

226
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,460
Get lost before I take action.

227
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,100
Hero Zhang, what's wrong?

228
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:27,230
What's wrong?

229
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:29,280
What's wrong with being a woman?

230
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,600
Stupid man, you've ruined my mood.

231
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:32,880
Get lost!

232
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,930
Sorry, heroine. Sorry, heroine.

233
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:40,800
Sorry.

234
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:43,200
Let's go. Hurry.

235
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:43,750
Hurry.

236
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:02,430
Miss.

237
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,040
We are destined to meet.

238
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,090
Let's drink together.

239
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,520
I wonder how much you can drink.

240
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,390
Waiter.

241
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:16,630
Five jars, please!

242
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,560
Coming right up.

243
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:20,010
Well, Ma'am...

244
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,190
Your wine.

245
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,460
Judging from your spell just now,

246
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,990
are you from Qionghua Sect?

247
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,390
I am who I am. I am my own sect.

248
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,680
It's fate indeed.

249
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,710
Come on, we are the same.

250
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,830
Some drink to drown their sorrows,

251
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,070
some drink to boost their mood,

252
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:46,350
some drink to escape,

253
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,560
and some drink to make decisions.

254
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:49,820
Miss.

255
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,710
Which type do you belong to?

256
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,580
In the past,

257
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:56,990
I thought

258
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:01,180
drinking was to be carefree and happy.

259
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,920
But I think my drinking today is for

260
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,540
drowning my sorrows,

261
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,780
making decisions,

262
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,500
and escaping. In any case, there isn't any happiness.

263
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:15,980
In life,

264
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,550
there are indeed many important things to do.

265
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,530
But if

266
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,290
we just do what we want,

267
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,930
everything will be easier.

268
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:26,790
But

269
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,320
what are things one wants to do

270
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:31,220
and what are things that should be done?

271
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,990
The result is all that matters for things one should do

272
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,390
and things one wants to do

273
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,860
depend solely on one's intentions.

274
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:41,570
The result is all that matters for things one should do

275
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:45,310
and things one wants to do depend solely on one's intentions?

276
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:50,890
Well,

277
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:51,610
Ma'am.

278
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,580
How should I address you?

279
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,140
My name is Su Shen.

280
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,760
Just call me Sister Shen.

281
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:57,770
If we're fated,

282
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,030
we'll meet again.

283
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,710
See you, Sister Shen.

284
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,670
She's so cool.

285
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,830
I thought you'd have come earlier,

286
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:25,150
but I didn't expect you to only come now.

287
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,110
Well,

288
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,300
do you no longer

289
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:32,510
need me to bring Tianhe to Qionghua urgently?

290
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,390
A few days ago,

291
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,230
we met.

292
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,310
We met?

293
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:38,970
Yes.

294
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,590
After you woke up

295
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,730
from your Sleep Condition.

296
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,810
No wonder Miss Mingzhu said I'm lying to Tianhe.

297
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,110
So the person he saw

298
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:50,560
was me when I'd exchanged primordial spirits with Mingzhu.

299
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:51,510
I...

300
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,590
I know.

301
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,790
Don't you just

302
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,930
want me to take Tianhe to Qionghua as soon as possible?

303
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,150
We agreed

304
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:02,150
you'll give me the elixir once I get the sword.

305
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,610
Now you broke your promise

306
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,760
and want me to lie to Tianhe to get him to Qionghua.

307
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,630
You are all liars.

308
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,000
You made me a liar too.

309
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:09,780
I want to say

310
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,760
that it's not good for you

311
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,310
to drink.

312
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,190
Now,

313
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,350
I can only drink to decompress.

314
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:21,550
One is my sister's life

315
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,730
and the other is my best friend.

316
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,570
I don't know what to do.

317
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,740
When you go down the mountain,

318
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:28,580
I'll give you

319
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,070
the elixir.

320
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,350
I know.

321
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,430
I know you're just devoted to

322
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,790
getting the sword for your master.

323
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,350
But do you know how I feel?

324
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,040
I lied to Tianhe

325
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:39,830
and Mengli.

326
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,130
I lied to everyone.

327
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,180
I don't want to lie to you now.

328
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,600
To be honest,

329
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,570
I really don't want to bring Tianhe to Qionghua.

330
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:49,930
Do you understand?

331
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,010
Friends can't lie to each other.

332
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,950
That's why I'm in agony right now.

333
00:16:58,330 --> 00:16:59,240
So

334
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:02,120
you didn't lie to me.

335
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:05,630
I thought

336
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,500
you were a stubborn dummy.

337
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:10,650
Looks like you know a thing or two about sentiments.

338
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,550
A dummy?

339
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:19,190
I regard you as a friend.

340
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:20,829
So I hope

341
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,290
you won't lie to me again.

342
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,440
I

343
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,750
am your friend.

344
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:58,250
[Jixian Garden]

345
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,240
Where did Lingsha go?

346
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:10,630
We've finished our meal.

347
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,230
Why hasn't she come back yet?

348
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,110
Could something have happened to Lingsha?

349
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:15,840
Don't worry.

350
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,740
Based on Miss Han's personality,

351
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,540
no one would dare to provoke her.

352
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,690
Mr. Yun.

353
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,880
Everyone has their own worries.

354
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,280
Sometimes we have to solve them ourselves.

355
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:28,230
But didn't we all

356
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,310
solve my worries together?

357
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,430
But I don't seem to have any worries.

358
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,420
This won't do.

359
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,320
I have to go and find Lingsha.

360
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:40,390
Lingsha?

361
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:40,950
Lingsha.

362
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,050
You're all here.

363
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:43,600
Lingsha.

364
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,110
If you still didn't come back,

365
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,830
Mr. Yun would have gone to all the streets and alleys

366
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,030
to call out your name.

367
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:51,280
I'm a heroine in the Martial World.

368
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,810
What's there to worry about?

369
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:54,870
Ordinary people dare not provoke me.

370
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:57,520
Ziying said the exact same thing just now.

371
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,150
Did you drink?

372
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:08,870
Why did you drink?

373
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,030
Some drink to drown their sorrows,

374
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,930
some drink to boost their mood,

375
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,830
some drink to escape,

376
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,920
and some drink to make decisions.

377
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:20,050
As for me...

378
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:23,740
The result is all that matters for things I should do

379
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,940
and things I want to do

380
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,060
depend solely on my intentions.

381
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,970
Lingsha, you're drunk.

382
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,070
These words

383
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,110
sound a little familiar.

384
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,950
A female senior told me all this.

385
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:40,310
Let me tell you.

386
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,810
I get along well with this Sister Shen.

387
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,290
We are both loners.

388
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,030
-It's indeed Master.
-It's indeed Master.

389
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,270
-Master?
-Master?

390
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,760
She's the master who taught me spells

391
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,750
and gifted me the Illusory Sound Collection.

392
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,350
She was also my first master.

393
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,360
But ten years ago,

394
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:56,830
she left Qionghua.

395
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,830
In that case,

396
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:03,110
you two are fellow disciples?

397
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:06,020
Your master used to be from Qionghua Sect.

398
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,320
They'd take your master into consideration and respect you.

399
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,520
Later, if Mengli goes to Qionghua Sect,

400
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,190
no one will bully her.

401
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:16,820
Ice Cube.

402
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,800
Mengli is smart,

403
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,670
but this is her first long-distance trip.

404
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:22,000
She's also your junior.

405
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:23,390
You have to take good care of her.

406
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:23,990
Lingsha.

407
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:26,870
What do you mean by taking good care of me?

408
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,910
Didn't we agree

409
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,470
to go to Qionghua together?

410
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,200
Before, you kept urging me

411
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,660
to escort you to Qionghua.

412
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:34,750
What happened

413
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,430
that made you change your mind?

414
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:37,690
You changed your mind?

415
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:38,950
Lingsha.

416
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,340
Didn't you say

417
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,840
you'd go to Qionghua with us

418
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,370
to find out about my father?

419
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:45,790
I'm homesick.

420
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,610
I'm just homesick.

421
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,120
Enough talking.

422
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:49,660
I want to rest.

423
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:52,060
We have to hurry with the journey tomorrow.

424
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,590
What did Lingsha mean by hurrying with the journey...

425
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:01,870
She's always like this.

426
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:03,030
She's fickle.

427
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:04,990
Maybe when she wakes up tomorrow morning,

428
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:07,120
she'll urge us to go to Qionghua again.

429
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,250
Let's go to bed too.

430
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,240
Miss Mengli.

431
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:18,890
You seem to be hesitant to speak lately.

432
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,160
Did something happen to Miss Han?

433
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,390
I only know that Lingsha must have her reasons.

434
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,570
She will tell us when she wants to.

435
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,230
Lingsha!

436
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,030
Did you just...

437
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,680
just wake up or did you not sleep at all?

438
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,070
I...

439
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,190
I've been thinking about what you said last night

440
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,340
so I couldn't sleep well.

441
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,400
I was going to look for you last night,

442
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:02,270
but I didn't want to wake you up.

443
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:04,830
I didn't expect you to come to me yourself.

444
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:09,370
I'm here to take you away.

445
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,460
We're not going to Qionghua.

446
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,590
We're going back to Qingluan Peak.

447
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,700
We're going back to Qingluan Peak?

448
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,300
Why?

449
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,740
I don't want to go through

450
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,910
those life-and-death battles anymore.

451
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,370
I just like Qingluan Peak.

452
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:24,430
Didn't you always hope

453
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:25,810
I'd stay at Qingluan Peak?

454
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:26,940
Let's go back, okay?

455
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,330
But didn't you promise me

456
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,350
we'd figure out the truth about my parents

457
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,780
before we'd go back to Qingluan Peak together?

458
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,870
Didn't you promise me

459
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,630
you would go wherever I go?

460
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,300
Pack up.

461
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:42,870
Lingsha.

462
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,470
I-I can go with you.

463
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,990
But if this sword doesn't get to Qionghua,

464
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,340
what would you do?

465
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,590
What do you mean?

466
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,960
Actually, the day your primordial spirit

467
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,890
was exchanged with Miss Ouyang's,

468
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,020
your friend mistook her for you.

469
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:02,340
Bring Yun Tianhe to Qionghua immediately.

470
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,630
Then I'll give you what you want.

471
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,250
So you and Mengli know about it.

472
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,830
Then why didn't you ask me about it?

473
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,630
I saw that the weirdo

474
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:14,440
was forcing you to trade the sword for something,

475
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,560
so I knew you have no choice.

476
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,130
I didn't tell you

477
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,400
because I was afraid that if you found out,

478
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,430
you'd be sad and put in a difficult position.

479
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:24,360
I think Mengli thinks this way too.

480
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:25,950
Last night, she even said

481
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,530
one's worries have to be solved by oneself.

482
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:34,020
I'm sorry, Lingsha.

483
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:36,630
I lied to you too.

484
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,250
This is different.

485
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,680
You wanted to protect me.

486
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,150
Actually,

487
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,580
I've been lying to you from the beginning.

488
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,540
That man in black is not my friend.

489
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,430
He is my employer.

490
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,570
He sent me to Qingluan Peak

491
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,670
to get your sword.

492
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,530
But the sword's cold aura was too strong.

493
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:12,400
So I could only use your parents' matter

494
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:14,230
to coax you down the mountain...

495
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,450
and we came all the way here.

496
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,640
If he wants the sword,

497
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:19,760
what do you want?

498
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,140
An elixir.

499
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:25,470
An elixir that can save my cousin's life.

500
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:27,800
Then all the more should we go to Qionghua.

501
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,270
If your friend

502
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,340
can hold this sword,

503
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,190
I can give it to him right now.

504
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,640
But this is the sword your father gave you.

505
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,100
This is the Wangshu Sword.

506
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,290
Only I can hold my father's sword.

507
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:43,930
It must be because he wants me protect lives

508
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:44,780
like him.

509
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:47,940
We'll use this sword to trade for the elixir to save your cousin.

510
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,400
That means the same thing.

511
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,770
If you were a little badder

512
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,820
and more selfish,

513
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,440
I wouldn't feel so sad.

514
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,250
Then why don’t you use your Emei thorn

515
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:59,710
to poke 800 big holes in me?

516
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:04,340
Silly Lingsha.

517
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,820
How can you give up on saving your cousin's life

518
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,540
just to stop lying to me?

519
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:12,750
Lingsha.

520
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:14,510
In the future,

521
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,640
if there's anything you're sad about,

522
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:17,480
just tell me.

523
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,690
Say it out and you'll feel better.

524
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:23,310
Anyway, I, Yun Tianhe, promise you

525
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,680
that no matter what happens in the future,

526
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,010
I won't hide it from you.

527
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,510
But you also have to promise me

528
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:29,710
that you won't hide anything from me either.

529
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:30,510
Tianhe.

530
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:33,880
I really can't bear to tell you about your father.

531
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,830
But I can promise...

532
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,300
I promise that no matter what happens

533
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,510
when we're at Qionghua,

534
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,910
I'll bear every burden with you.

535
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:43,430
Okay.

536
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,630
Why is Senior Ziying taking so long?

537
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:02,790
Be well prepared.

538
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:05,270
Qionghua may not be as good as we thought.

539
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,650
We've been through

540
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,530
so many bad things along the way.

541
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:10,180
But weren't the results always good?

542
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,460
People should be optimistic.

543
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,550
That makes sense.

544
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,170
It's a long journey.

545
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:18,430
Wouldn't it be better to get a horse carriage?

546
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:19,360
No need for that.

547
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:21,810
Uncle Ziying said he would take you there by sword.

548
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:22,610
By sword?

549
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,520
Like how he rides a sword and flies in the sky?

550
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:27,630
Yes.

551
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:29,300
But how can Mr. Murong

552
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:31,240
take the three of us by himself?

553
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:33,860
Don't worry.

554
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,920
I and Yun Tianhe will each ride a sword.

555
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:38,480
I...

556
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,290
I'll ride a sword?

557
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,580
If I use magic to communicate with your minds,

558
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,340
I can control the sword with my mental technique.

559
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,900
You just need to concentrate and it'll be fine.

560
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:47,490
Okay.

561
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,300
Your sword has an intense cold aura.

562
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,630
You and Miss Han can use my Xuanming Sword.

563
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,230
Okay.

564
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,040
Mengli and Tianhe are both so kind.

565
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,390
I should help them get together.

566
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:05,160
Well,

567
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:07,260
then I'll ride a sword with Ziying.

568
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,590
It's for the best, since he'll be more careful

569
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,910
with Mengli watching him.

570
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:13,640
It's for the best, since Mengli won't hit my head.

571
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,350
Mr. Murong.

572
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,510
Let's set off.

573
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:21,330
The mental communication technique

574
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:23,220
will make all three of your thoughts

575
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,260
accessible to me.

576
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:24,940
So...

577
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:26,710
It's fine.

578
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:29,350
I have nothing to hide anyway.

579
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:35,500
Me neither.

580
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:36,950
I'm not worried too.

581
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,000
Ziying

582
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,560
is good at keeping secrets.

583
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,550
Riding a sword is really fun!

584
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,040
Don't worry.

585
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,120
Yun Tianhe is naturally talented.

586
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,440
If he refines his cultivation,

587
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,440
he'll be able to ride his sword well.

588
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:23,880
Mengli, be careful.

589
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,260
That stupid wild man!

590
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,780
I knew he would fly around recklessly.

591
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:36,440
How can Mengli handle those crazy antics of his?

592
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,070
Ziying, catch up with them.

593
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:38,950
Okay.

594
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,300
What happened?

595
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,190
Why is Senior Ziying flying like this?

596
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:58,120
He is a mortal after all.

597
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,580
He must have feelings too.

598
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,240
Xuanji.

599
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:06,420
You...

600
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,640
Fly steadily.

601
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:11,000
You don't have to get too close to them.

602
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:16,800
Are you helping Yun Tianhe and Miss Mengli get together?

603
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,940
A-Although you can tell how I really feel,

604
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,390
it doesn't mean you have to talk about it.

605
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:27,750
What else did you find out?

606
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,560
I dont have to talk about it.

607
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,280
Why don't we look at the beautiful scenery in front of us then?

608
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:41,650
It's so beautiful.

609
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:46,130
But such a beautiful sunset

610
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,650
will disappear in a blink of an eye.

611
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:54,020
Miss Han is actually dealing with much emotional turmoil.

612
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,860
This is actually the first time

613
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,990
I feel like I'm in the sunset.

614
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:03,100
It's just like the poem verses: The setting sun reflects on the accumulated water

615
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:06,700
and the scenery on the border is full of the atmosphere of autumn.

616
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,400
The first time I saw such a beautiful sunset

617
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:12,320
was when I was at Qingluan Peak with Lingsha.

618
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:16,900
All the beauty in Mr. Yun's life stems from Lingsha.

619
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,760
Do you know

620
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:21,010
you're mutually in love?

621
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,200
Mengli.

622
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,300
When we're finished with our affairs,

623
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,960
let's go back to Qingluan Peak

624
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:32,110
and watch the sunset together.

625
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:36,510
All the beauty in this world are about allowing things to be fulfilled.

626
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:37,440
Just like now,

627
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,220
where we are not only people who enjoy the scenery

628
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,950
but also people in the scenery.

629
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,750
Thank you, Ziying.

630
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,320
We took so long.

631
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,580
I almost fell asleep.

632
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:13,490
Uncle Ziying usually

633
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:15,020
travels swiftly with ease.

634
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,600
Because he had to take care of you guys,

635
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,300
it took us half a day to reach Boxian Town.

636
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:18,760
Xuanji.

637
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:21,430
It's decent for someone who was flying for the first time.

638
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:23,470
The key is that just now, we also saw...

639
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:25,830
I only focused on riding the sword in the past.

640
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:26,430
But today,

641
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:29,510
I actually earnestly enjoyed the beautiful sunset.

642
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:31,240
That was what I was going to say.

643
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,260
Ice Cube.

644
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:32,690
You...

645
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,870
Have you broken the spell of mental communication?

646
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:35,800
I'm off my sword.

647
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:37,020
Of course it's broken.

648
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:37,880
That's good...

649
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:40,070
That town looks nice.

650
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,350
Why didn't we just land there?

651
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,680
That town is called Boxian Town.

652
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,480
It’s chaotic.

653
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,080
It's not appropriate to stay here.

654
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,490
You'll stay here tonight.

655
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,440
Tomorrow, we'll continue to climb the mountain southwards

656
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,530
and we'll arrive at Kunxu Mountain's

657
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:53,390
Qionghua Sect.

658
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:57,170
You mean you won't go with us?

659
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,660
All cultivators

660
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,510
must personally climb the mountain.

661
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:02,680
All the experiences in the journey are trials.

662
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,540
It's the same for all the Kunxu eight sects.

663
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,140
So,

664
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,100
I can only send you until here.

665
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:07,830
Okay.

666
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:10,630
There are things I shouldn't say,

667
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:11,960
but I have to remind you.

668
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,380
This town is full of people from all walks of life

669
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,290
and it's very complicated.

670
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:15,490
It's very dangerous.

671
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,400
You'd better take a detour around the city

672
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,330
and not enter it.

673
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:21,500
Then entering Boxian Town isn't a trial?

674
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:22,680
Sister Meng.

675
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,710
Uncle Ziying is doing this for your own good.

676
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:27,370
Among the people who came to Kunxu Mountain to seek immortality,

677
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:28,990
those who are not gifted enough to go up the mountain,

678
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,750
those who were kicked out by the sect for breaking the rules.

679
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,360
and those who specialize in

680
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:34,740
practicing evil and forbidden arts are all living here.

681
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,670
There are even half-human and half-demon monsters.

682
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:38,910
Yes.

683
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:40,060
Besides,

684
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:40,720
we

685
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:41,760
and Uncle Ziying

686
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,310
can't go in and protect you.

687
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:43,920
Ziying.

688
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,070
Don't you usually regard demon hunting as your duty?

689
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,540
Why don't you go in and discipline them?

690
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,740
There is a sect in Boxian Town

691
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,950
called Qingfeng Sect.

692
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:52,530
There are many hidden talents in the sect

693
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:54,270
and they have been in charge of this city all along.

694
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:56,520
The Kunxu eight sects need to yield to them out of courtesy.

695
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,310
I've heard of this Qingfeng Sect.

696
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,860
It's a very powerful force in the Martial World.

697
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,110
It has always been mysterious.

698
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,440
Let's listen to Ziying.

699
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:03,860
Since it's a rule of the Martial World,

700
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,110
let's not get involved

701
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,510
and spend the night here.

702
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:09,330
Mr. Yun.

703
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:10,630
Miss Han. Miss Liu.

704
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:11,470
Take care.

705
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:13,570
Remember

706
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,060
to take a detour around the city.

707
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:36,900
Lingsha.

708
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,280
Didn't your employer

709
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:41,520
say he would give you the medicine when we get down the mountain?

710
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,630
Will he come to us?

711
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,550
I don't know.

712
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:47,020
He comes and goes without a trace.

713
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:48,580
Will he go back on his word?

714
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:52,700
He's weird and cruel,

715
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,750
but I think

716
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,940
he doesn't seem to be a villain.

717
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:57,830
It's okay.

718
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,060
Anyway,

719
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:01,490
he wants my sword.

720
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,570
If he doesn't give you the medicine,

721
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:05,070
I won't give him the sword.

722
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,380
That's what I'm worried about.

723
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,790
Don't confront him forcefully.

724
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,070
My sister's life is important,

725
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,909
but your safety is also important.

726
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:12,949
It seems

727
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:14,510
Lingsha's employer is tied to

728
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,790
Qionghua.

729
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,190
When we get to Qionghua,

730
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,350
we must be careful.

731
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,580
All I know is

732
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,750
that as long as the three of us work together,

733
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,679
we'll be invincible!

734
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,739
All right, it's getting late.

735
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:27,989
We have to go to Qionghua tomorrow.

736
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:28,719
Go to sleep early.

737
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:29,980
Well said. Go to sleep.

738
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:54,510
Master.

739
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:57,600
They have arrived at the foot of the mountain.

740
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,640
Got it.

741
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,990
Xuan Ying, good job.

742
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:05,280
Don't worry about the rest.

743
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,350
What else?

744
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:11,880
I

745
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:13,580
promised her

746
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,860
to give her the medicine at the foot of the mountain.

747
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,650
So what?

748
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,010
I

749
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:22,100
don't want to lie.

750
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:26,990
Humans

751
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:29,070
should keep their words.

752
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:31,290
But you are not human.

753
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,040
If you're not human,

754
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,620
you don't have to keep your word.

755
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:45,720
Master.

756
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,990
She's a friend.

757
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:51,120
You are her friend?

758
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,850
How dare you have feelings for another woman?

759
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,070
How dare you betray me?

760
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,010
Do you know why you were born?

761
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:03,330
I just want a friend.

762
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:05,290
If you have to use your life

763
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,260
to exchange for her elixir,

764
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:08,960
will you do it?

765
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,700
Friends

766
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,560
don't lie to each other.

767
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:22,200
You and my junior

768
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,620
are really alike.

769
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,140
In this world,

770
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,200
deception is abundant.

771
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:32,880
You're lying to yourself if you think otherwise.

772
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:33,840
Forget it.

773
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,460
How can I destroy you

774
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,240
just for a pill?

775
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,340
Master.

776
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,620
I live for you.

777
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:57,930
I will never betray my master.

778
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:02,320
I've absorbed half of your spiritual power.

779
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,320
You musn't use your skills to fight.

780
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,890
I'll replenish it for you another day.

781
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,570
Employer!

782
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,240
Employer!

783
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:48,350
Employer.

784
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,120
I know you're here to rush me.

785
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:50,910
Don't worry.

786
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,600
We will definitely bring the sword to Qionghua.

787
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:55,930
The medicine.

788
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:58,280
Friends

789
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,170
don't lie to each other.

790
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:00,900
Take it.

791
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,120
I didn't expect you to be so righteous.

792
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,390
We won't lie to you either.

793
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:09,320
We will take the sword to Qionghua.

794
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,470
But your master hasn't gotten Tianhe's sword yet.

795
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:17,330
Why did she give you the medicine?

796
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,660
Don't tell me you stole...

797
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:25,710
Why are your hands so cold?

798
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:28,780
Are you sick?

799
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:34,740
Are you prone to the chills like me?

800
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,460
Eat this first.

801
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:42,350
Although

802
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:43,280
I can't

803
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:45,730
bear to give it up,

804
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,360
my friend's health is more important.

805
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:51,630
Friends

806
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:52,740
are

807
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:54,100
more important?

808
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,750
You have to be healthy to get the medicine for me.

809
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,750
I know you must still have a lot of it.

810
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:01,550
Take it.

811
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:04,870
My

812
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:06,590
health

813
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:08,230
is fine.

814
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:09,580
Keep

815
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:10,960
the medicine well.

816
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,330
Don't

817
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,080
tell others about it.

818
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:17,330
Take care, Employer.

819
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,080
Wake up.

820
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,350
Remember who you are.

821
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:57,270
Remember it.

822
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:00,460
Remember who you are.

823
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,340
Come to me now.

824
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,280
Come to Boxian Town to find me.

825
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,600
I've been waiting for you.

826
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:09,850
Who is it?

827
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,800
Did you have a nightmare?

828
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,020
It was a dream.

829
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:19,350
But it also didn't seem to be a dream.

830
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:20,940
Mengli.

831
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:24,080
Why is your jade glowing?

832
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,110
What's going on?

833
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:44,300
Ziying said there are demons in Boxian Town.

834
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,070
Could it be

835
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:47,640
that some demon has put a curse on your jade?

836
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,570
Don't panic.

837
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,030
My mother told me

838
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:53,120
that when Uncle Yun handed me over to my parents,

839
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,450
I was wearing this jade.

840
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:57,090
Back then, when I took this jade off,

841
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:59,290
it'd return to my neck automatically.

842
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,650
Has this jade ever glowed?

843
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,700
I've never seen it glow before.

844
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:08,770
Tianhe's sword is related to his parents' experiences.

845
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:11,170
And he's the only one who can use this sword.

846
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:13,450
Since you're the only one who can wear this jade,

847
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:15,510
it may be related to your background.

848
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:17,870
It was glowing just now because Mengli

849
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:18,830
had a nightmare.

850
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:21,530
What nightmare did you have just now?

851
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,070
There was a voice in my dream.

852
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:23,980
He told me

853
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,050
to remember something.

854
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,260
He told me

855
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,510
he has been waiting for me.

856
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:32,570
He asked me to find him in Boxian Town.

857
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:35,200
Do you want to go to Boxian Town?

858
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:37,590
For now,

859
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,670
both my background

860
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,720
and my Princess Jade

861
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:43,680
are tied to Boxian Town.

862
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:45,010
Tianhe.

863
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,310
You and Lingsha will take a detour.

864
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,770
I'll go to Boxian Town to find out the truth.

865
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:50,540
How could we let you

866
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,110
go to that sinister place alone?

867
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,170
Let's go together.

868
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:57,790
But Mr. Murong specifically warned us against going there.

869
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:59,790
I don't want you to take risks for me.

870
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:01,060
But Ziying also said

871
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:03,610
the best thing in the world

872
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:04,450
is

873
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:06,440
to help each other with their wishes.

874
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,490
Since this concerns your background,

875
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:10,480
Lingsha and I should help you.

876
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:15,130
I don’t care if it's Boxian Town

877
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:15,990
or a demon town,

878
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,800
the three of us

879
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:18,220
will go and explore it!

880
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:19,550
Explore it!
