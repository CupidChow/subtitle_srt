[Episode 6]

4
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,280
These lowly people are of mediocre physique.

5
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:46,670
Your body is

6
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:50,660
the body that I want.

7
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,460
A fire that is burning bodies?

8
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,430
How many lives have been lost in this alchemy furnace?

9
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,430
You bastard!

10
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:09,870
Mr. Yun.

11
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,560
Tianhe.

12
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,360
His evil aura is too strong.

13
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,550
You leave with Mengli first.

14
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,540
If we leave, we leave together.

15
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,070
The foolishness of people in the world is laughable.

16
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,800
I can't believe you still believe in friendship.

17
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,110
All of you shall die!

18
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,660
Mr. Yun.

19
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:30,670
Tianhe.

20
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,790
You're just a mortal.

21
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:48,060
How could you have an elixir body that is both yin and yang?

22
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,540
That's impossible.

23
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,130
Because of your obsession to kill demons,

24
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,700
you're doomed to die at the hands of demons.

25
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,170
Miss Han.

26
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,940
I won't accept it.

27
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,430
What a powerful sword gleam.

28
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,910
Wangshu Sword's aura?

29
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,120
Miss Han.

30
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,120
Lingsha,

31
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,440
how is she?

32
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:35,950
As this sword gleam can completely disperse the primordial spirit of the Yunnan King,

33
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,010
it will definitely hurt Miss Han too.

34
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,630
I also noticed that

35
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,030
this sword has the same temper as my father.

36
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,230
It's quite powerful.

37
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,960
You'd better leave quickly.

38
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,110
Miss Han?

39
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,640
Let's go. This place is collapsing.

40
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:04,870
Come with me.

41
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,550
That's the entrance you guys came in from.

42
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,350
Follow me.

43
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,140
Tianhe.

44
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,560
Put me down first.

45
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,080
It's okay. I'm not tired.

46
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,070
Wild man, listen to me.

47
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,610
Put me down first.

48
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,300
You can't be a living person.

49
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,150
But, you look just like me.

50
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:52,970
Old people often say that

51
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,680
when one is about to die,

52
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,790
one's primordial spirit will be separated from the body.

53
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,430
Are you...

54
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,590
my primordial spirit?

55
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,430
My name is Wumian.

56
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,580
In order to ascend to immortality after his death,

57
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,680
Prince Yunan had no regard for  propriety,

58
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,800
and ordered 108 maids to die.

59
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,550
I'm the combined spirit of

60
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,780
these 108 maids' determined thoughts.

61
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,350
Then why

62
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,710
do you look exactly like Lingsha?

63
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,130
I don't have a face.

64
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,650
My face is the result of your imagination.

65
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:23,300
Whoever whom you are most worried about dying right now,

66
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,430
is who I will become.

67
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:25,830
That's right.

68
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,700
We are most worried about Lingsha dying.

69
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,300
Miss Han.

70
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,450
I am sure you are also most afraid of your own death.

71
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:35,920
I'm afraid of death.

72
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,980
Is there no such thing as a recurring realm?

73
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:56,740
Since you were forced to die, aren't you even more resentful?

74
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,980
Why did you save us?

75
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,560
Because you are Yun Tianqing’s son.

76
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:02,090
19 years ago,

77
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,290
when Prince Yunan used the power of Yin Yang Jade

78
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,660
to break the seal of Crimson Jade Flask,

79
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,570
it was Hero Yun Tianqing

80
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,360
who reinforced the seal of Crimson Jade Flask.

81
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,860
Otherwise, if Prince Yunan escapes,

82
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,740
there would have been a lot of violence and killing.

83
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,670
I knew it.

84
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,350
There must be a reason why that demon of Prince Yunan

85
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:20,810
hates my father this much.

86
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,770
So in order to save more people,

87
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,540
it was my father who sealed him.

88
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:27,180
So, I’m grateful to Hero Yun Tianqing.

89
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,930
But, I’m ashamed that

90
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,920
I led you to the Great Hall

91
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,480
because of Prince Yunan's tyrannical abuse.

92
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:34,470
However, when I found out

93
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,470
you are the son of Hero Yun Tianqing,

94
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,670
I’ve made up my mind

95
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,880
to do my best to help you.

96
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,470
It's my way of repaying him for his kindness.

97
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,230
Miss,

98
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:45,740
Prince Yunan has now turned into ashes,

99
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,750
and you're free from any inhibitions.

100
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,810
You can be free now.

101
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,000
Thank you.

102
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,760
I hope we can meet again.

103
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,290
Uncle Xuzhao sent a letter to inform that

104
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,940
the evil aura is at Nyuluo Cliff.

105
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,740
Uncle Ziying should be here too.

106
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,110
Senior,

107
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,440
let's go and look for it.

108
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,790
We must not let anything happen to Uncle.

109
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:16,770
Don't worry.

110
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,900
Uncle is not a mere mortal,

111
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,010
so he will be fine.

112
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,450
I just noticed that the forest has some sword aura.

113
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,250
Why don't we go in and take a look?

114
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,510
Xuanji.

115
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,100
No.

116
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:27,770
Slow down.

117
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,460
Wait for me!

118
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,000
Xuanji!

119
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,110
Xuanji!

120
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,230
Lingsha, take a seat.

121
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,010
How do you feel?

122
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,070
You must be still recovering from that poisoned wine.

123
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,470
You should get some rest.

124
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,590
Tianhe, Mengli.

125
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:45,950
thank you.

126
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,890
But, I'm also sorry.

127
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,230
We should share weal and woe.

128
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,220
Why are you thanking and then apologizing to us?

129
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,940
Since I entered the Tomb of Prince Yunan,

130
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,080
I only thought about myself.

131
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,270
But it wasn't until I saw Wumian

132
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,910
that I realized you were all worried about my safety.

133
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,510
If Mengli is in danger,

134
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,330
Wumian will also become Mengli.

135
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,750
That's for you.

136
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,530
But, all that I will see

137
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,790
is still myself.

138
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,670
I'm just too scared of dying.

139
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,440
That's why I drank that poisoned wine.

140
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,500
That's why I said so much nonsense to both of you.

141
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,470
Nonsense?

142
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,690
Do you remember?

143
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,750
I don't remember either.

144
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,050
We all believe you.

145
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,930
We believe you won't lie to us.

146
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,750
Lingsha,

147
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,370
all of this is not a big deal.

148
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,670
But you said

149
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,290
you wanted the immortality pill to extend your life.

150
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,220
You are so obsessed with survival.

151
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:55,670
Are you sick?

152
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,110
Yes, Lingsha.

153
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,820
If you have any problems, you can just let us know.

154
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,010
Perhaps, Mengli can cure you.

155
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,180
I...

156
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,560
I just...

157
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,800
All the elders in my family were weak and died young.

158
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,400
Hence, I'm afraid of death.

159
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:12,870
In that case,

160
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,690
I understand.

161
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,480
The elders in my family had also passed away,

162
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,540
but yet I'm not afraid of death.

163
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,060
You are pure and carefree.

164
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,830
But there's too much pain

165
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,910
in Lingsha's heart.

166
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:29,870
Mengli,

167
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,790
do you really know psychometry?

168
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,150
What else did you see?

169
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,430
I just sensed what you were feeling.

170
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,630
If you don't want to share what's on your mind,

171
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,030
others would never know.

172
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,170
Well,

173
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:46,850
I'm slightly thirsty.

174
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,650
I'll get some water to drink.

175
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,320
Lingsha,

176
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,150
have a good rest.

177
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,680
I'll get you some water.

178
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,270
I can get it myself.

179
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,310
Mr. Yun.

180
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,960
What's up with Lingsha?

181
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,180
Maybe she just wants to be alone.

182
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:09,630
Tianhe! Mengli!

183
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,440
Lingsha?

184
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,340
Hurry up!

185
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:12,830
What's wrong?

186
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,190
How did this Ice Cube really turn into an ice cube?

187
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,320
He's not dead, is he?

188
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,060
That's impossible.

189
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,970
He's so skilled. How could he die?

190
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:21,770
Mengli,

191
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,780
take a look at him.

192
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:26,670
He's still breathing.

193
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,210
But his spiritual power has been exhausted,

194
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:30,210
which caused the poison to enter the meridians,

195
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:32,540
leading to the stagnation of qi and blood.

196
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:33,910
Fortunately, the poison has yet to reach his heart.

197
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,510
Let me try using Suhe Potion.

198
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,270
Wake up.

199
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:41,590
Wake up!

200
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,750
He's still unconscious.

201
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:53,680
You're awake.

202
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,280
He's awake!

203
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,750
I knew you wouldn't die.

204
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,120
Get up first.

205
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,150
I'm fine.

206
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,390
Come on.

207
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,630
I found you here,

208
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,700
in a half-dead condition,

209
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,340
while Mengli used Suhe Potion to save you.

210
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,000
And all you say is, "I'm fine?"

211
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:13,670
Thank you.

212
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,070
Thank you to both ladies your help.

213
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,670
I, Murong Ziying, will repay you in the future.

214
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:25,090
It's okay.

215
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:25,770
It's okay.

216
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,180
What about me?

217
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,900
You don't have to repay me.

218
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,470
If I'm not mistaken,

219
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,310
you were too obsessed with killing demons,

220
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:36,010
and brought evil aura into your body.

221
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:36,820
Mr. Murong,

222
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,500
killing of demons should be differentiated between good and evil.

223
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,950
If you are imprisoned by your obsession,

224
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,880
it's also a demonic root in itself.

225
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,480
All demons

226
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:46,930
are evil in nature.

227
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,430
Uncle Ziying!

228
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,270
Uncle Ziying!

229
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:51,110
Uncle Ziying!

230
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:52,830
Uncle,

231
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:53,980
I finally found you.

232
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,310
You little brat.

233
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,770
Didn't you say you haven't seen my Uncle?

234
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:57,850
How dare you lie to me?

235
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:58,250
You...

236
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,230
You're the little brat.

237
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,190
When you met me,

238
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,150
I really haven't seen your Uncle Ziying.

239
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,110
We even saved him after seeing him.

240
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,760
If we hadn't saved him,

241
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:07,630
he would have

242
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,240
long been dead.

243
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:09,750
Yes.

244
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,990
Stop lying, you brat.

245
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:11,270
I...

246
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:11,980
-How are you?
-Xuanji!

247
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:12,470
Xuanji.

248
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:13,840
Let's ignore her.

249
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,100
Yes, let's ignore her.

250
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,360
You know each other?

251
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,470
We just met

252
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,790
when we were looking for you, Uncle.

253
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,790
But Uncle, how did you get hurt?

254
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,820
He has been invaded by evil aura,

255
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,820
and needs to rest.

256
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:27,440
I'm glad there's this sweet sister over here who says nice things.

257
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,070
How should I address you?

258
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,040
You don't know, do you?

259
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,360
Her name is Mengli.

260
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:33,960
Mengli.

261
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:35,050
Sister Meng.

262
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:37,960
Why don't you come with us?

263
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:38,950
No need.

264
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,100
The three of us can go by ourselves.

265
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,760
Just take your Uncle with you.

266
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,580
Uncle,

267
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,440
you should take a good rest given your injuries.

268
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,230
By the way,

269
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:58,110
there was an official looking for you just now.

270
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:00,470
I asked him to wait outside Nyuluo Cliff.

271
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:03,560
Thank you.

272
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:04,750
Official?

273
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,650
He must be talking about Pei Jian.

274
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,120
Let's go find him.

275
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:08,680
Okay.

276
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:09,930
Let's go.

277
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,650
Lord, Madam.

278
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,030
How is Li?

279
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,010
How's Tianhe,

280
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,300
and that Nyuluo Cliff?

281
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,590
And Miss Han?

282
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,000
My Lord, Madam, please don't worry.

283
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,780
The chaos at Nyuluo Cliff has subsided.

284
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:35,750
The three of them, including Young Miss and Mr. Yun, are all safe.

285
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,070
She didn't want you to worry,

286
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:39,270
so she asked me to come back to inform you.

287
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,070
That's great.

288
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:41,680
Hurry up.

289
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,160
Let's have a banquet to celebrate their success.

290
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:44,890
-Yes.
-Wait.

291
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,310
Madam,

292
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,780
haven't you prepared the wedding dress?

293
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,450
Yes.

294
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,830
Well then, there's no other day better than today.

295
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:53,710
How about

296
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,560
we settle their marriage today?

297
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,320
My Lord,

298
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,970
aren't you too anxious?

299
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,500
We haven't made the marriage clear to the two kids yet.

300
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,370
Besides,

301
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,320
you know how Li is.

302
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,960
Although she's a woman,

303
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,380
she wants to

304
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,190
to marry a man whom she likes.

305
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:12,810
Yes.

306
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,190
Li only thinks about repaying the favor.

307
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,890
But the only way to repay her kindness

308
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,200
is for her to

309
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:22,160
marry Tianhe.

310
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,100
Besides, after she's engaged,

311
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,710
there wouldn't be so many idle people who would care about her affairs.

312
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,310
Tianhe would also

313
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:31,000
officially become part of our family.

314
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:32,830
Fine.

315
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,000
Let's go with your plans.

316
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,430
Pei Jian,

317
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,200
I've been raising you like my own son.

318
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:42,350
Today is a big day for my daughter.

319
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,470
You must see to it yourself.

320
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,630
But, my Lord,

321
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,590
Young Miss and Mr. Yun

322
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,170
have only known each other for a few days.

323
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:51,740
This...

324
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,350
W...what?

325
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,030
They might have only known each other for days,

326
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,900
but his father and I have known each other for more than 20 years.

327
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,030
Our families are well-matched for each other.

328
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:58,870
Get going.

329
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:00,110
Go.

330
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:00,820
Yes.

331
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,030
All's good.

332
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,830
I didn't expect the chaos at Nyuluo Cliff

333
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,030
to be solved so quickly.

334
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,760
I'm so happy.

335
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:12,830
That's right.

336
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:13,970
Mengli.

337
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,850
Didn't we just win the battle?

338
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,590
Why do you look unhappy?

339
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,280
I'm wondering what kind of place Qionghua is.

340
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,720
I want to go to Qionghua with you all.

341
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,650
I want to go to Kunxu and Qionghua with you all.

342
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:28,290
Well...

343
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,230
Do you really think it will be a trip where we could be back quickly,

344
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,140
just like how we went to Nyuluo Cliff?

345
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,540
What about your parents?

346
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,110
They have Pei,

347
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:36,550
Luzhu, and Lurong.

348
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:40,530
But, you are their only daughter.

349
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,610
Although I've been at your house for only a few days,

350
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,130
I can clearly feel that

351
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:44,830
they love you

352
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,420
like the apple of their eye.

353
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,690
If anything happens to you,

354
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,260
it could cost them half their lives.

355
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,920
You plan to just abandon them and go to Qionghua?

356
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,760
I have my own reasons.

357
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,080
But...

358
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:57,770
what could be more important than your parents?

359
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,530
How about

360
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,710
let's hear her reason first?

361
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,109
You guys can talk. I'm leaving.

362
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,020
I've never seen her so angry.

363
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,869
Maybe...

364
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,190
it reminded her of her parents.

365
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,670
Could it be that Lingsha's parents are no longer around,

366
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,000
just like mine?

367
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:25,589
Take this over.

368
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:26,920
Is this okay?

369
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:27,900
Yes, yes.

370
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,280
Okay.

371
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,390
I'll put it here.

372
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,300
Put it here.

373
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,350
Come.

374
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,750
Be careful with this.

375
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,170
Okay.

376
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,370
Hold tight.

377
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,100
Give me that red cloth.

378
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,150
Miss Han?

379
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,980
Why are you back alone?

380
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,160
Tianhe and Mengli are behind.

381
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,360
Are you unhappy?

382
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,670
No.

383
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,210
It's just that

384
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,190
everything is written on my face.

385
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,450
I felt that

386
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,780
I was rude to Mengli just now,

387
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,890
and was being unkind.

388
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,350
I wanted to apologize to her,

389
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,150
but I realised she's right.

390
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,100
Young Miss has a big heart.

391
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,620
She wouldn't mind.

392
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,510
Why do you also look unhappy?

393
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:16,060
I...

394
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:19,580
Today is a big day.

395
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,580
Why would I be unhappy?

396
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,660
No way.

397
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,670
We just went to Nyuluo Cliff to fight a demon.

398
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:25,980
Why are you making such a big fuss?

399
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,110
It's as if someone is getting married.

400
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:31,270
My Lord wants to take advantage of today's victory,

401
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:33,200
and betroth Young Miss and Mr. Yun.

402
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,630
For whom?

403
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:37,440
For Miss Liu and Mr. Yun.

404
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,920
For them to get engaged?

405
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,080
No way.

406
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,750
They've only known each other for a few days.

407
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,550
I disagree.

408
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,420
It's the order of one's parents, and also the matchmaker's words.

409
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,080
They don't care if you agree or disagree.

410
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,310
I just don't agree.

411
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,520
I don't want to attend a wedding.

412
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,250
What parents' orders? What matchmaker's words?

413
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,280
How can we let what others have to say

414
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,720
decide our marriage?

415
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:10,210
No.

416
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,720
We have to leave now.

417
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:14,250
Wait.

418
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,720
Why am I so angry

419
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,490
over Tianhe getting married?

420
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,830
Actually, if I don't want that sword,

421
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,860
Tianhe could marry a kind and beautiful wife

422
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,890
It's good for him

423
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,760
to have a home and a family.

424
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:32,620
How about...

425
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,430
I bring Tianhe and the sword to Qionghua,

426
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:40,010
and then let him come back to get married and live a good life?

427
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:45,050
I should clarify if Qionghua is a dangerous place.

428
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,100
Let's meet at the alley at 7 p.m.

429
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:09,830
I have something important to discuss with you.

430
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,320
Tianhe, Li.

431
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:13,830
Father!

432
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:14,490
Li.

433
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,190
Are you hurt?

434
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,150
I'm fine.

435
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,300
Where... Where's Lingsha?

436
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,840
She has gone back to her room to rest.

437
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:23,470
I'm glad she's okay.

438
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:24,530
Well, I'm glad you thought of me.

439
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:24,970
Here.

440
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,280
You will definitely come find me on the count of three.

441
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:31,130
Come.

442
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,630
Uncle Liu,

443
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:35,650
did you want to ask me about killing the demons?

444
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,710
I also have something to ask you.

445
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:40,820
19 years ago, there was a demonic rebellion in Shouyang City.

446
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,200
Was it really my father who killed the demons?

447
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,750
Of course it was your father.

448
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,540
Back then,

449
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,880
were there other disciples

450
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,800
who killed innocent people?

451
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,950
Were they killing without distinguishing between the good and the evil?

452
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,070
I didn't see any other disciples.

453
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:55,090
But the demonic rebellion

454
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:56,940
was not just confined to Shouyang.

455
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,670
Other places were affected too.

456
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,600
But I can tell you responsibly that

457
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:03,930
your father isn't someone who would kill innocent people.

458
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,640
You misled me away from the task at hand.

459
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,080
I don't want to talk about what happened 19 years ago.

460
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,330
I want to talk about what's happening now.

461
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:11,370
What do you mean?

462
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,220
How was your trip to Nyuluo Cliff

463
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:17,720
with my daughter Li?

464
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,600
We had a great time.

465
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,340
Mengli has many great ideas

466
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,220
which I totally agree with.

467
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,150
So you're soulmates.

468
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:28,550
Do you like her?

469
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,000
Of course.

470
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,060
You've fallen for each other.

471
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:36,410
It looks like you'll wear the ceremonial attire today.

472
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:37,940
Ceremonial attire?

473
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,310
I need to change again?

474
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:44,380
I just put on these clothes.

475
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,450
I just need to wash them.

476
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:46,180
Wash them?

477
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,850
These are casual clothes.

478
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:48,910
And they're dirty.

479
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:50,190
This is ceremonial attire.

480
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:52,420
You'll wear them for the engagement dinner.

481
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,230
E-Engagement?

482
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:57,160
But Mom,

483
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,190
you and Dad have agreed

484
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:02,110
that I can decide who I marry.

485
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,500
I want to marry a man

486
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,030
like Uncle Yun,

487
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,790
who's righteous, romantic, and erudite.

488
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:12,030
Life

489
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,050
can't be perfect.

490
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:17,580
Tianhe grew up in the mountain.

491
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,290
You just haven't spent much time with him.

492
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,700
He may turn out to be the right one for you.

493
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,630
But I may not be the right one for him.

494
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,390
Mom.

495
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:31,830
It's irrational to sacrifice two young people's happiness

496
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,710
just to fulfill their parents' wishes.

497
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:34,630
Li,

498
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:37,230
this is not just what I and your father wish.

499
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,410
It's also the wish of your Uncle Yun, who saved your life.

500
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:44,040
Dad always says that Uncle Yun was extraordinary

501
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,550
and free-spirited.

502
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,150
Why would he wish for something like this?

503
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,720
After you and Li are engaged,

504
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,590
I can be relieved with the realization

505
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:55,850
that I've fulfilled your father's wish.

506
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,110
My father's wish?

507
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:00,340
Your father wished that you and Li could get married.

508
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,670
19 years ago,

509
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,340
after your father saved Li,

510
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,860
he said again and again

511
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,280
that if anything happened to us,

512
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,730
we must entrust Li to him

513
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,150
and he'd take care of her.

514
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,670
I didn't understand him

515
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:14,670
at that time.

516
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,630
When I met you that day,

517
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,240
it clicked.

518
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,880
I suddenly understood what he meant.

519
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:22,730
What do you mean?

520
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,910
I've talked so much,

521
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,350
yet you still don't know what I mean?

522
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,310
No.

523
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:32,140
What did my dad want?

524
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,040
Let me explain it to you.

525
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,970
I entrusted her to your father.

526
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,320
Your father died.

527
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:40,390
So naturally, I'll entrust her to you.

528
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:42,390
When I entrust my girl to a man,

529
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:44,730
it means he'll marry her.

530
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,020
But we won't do that today.

531
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,990
You'll just get engaged today.

532
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:52,090
Then we'll pick a good day

533
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:55,030
for your wedding.

534
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:57,360
We'll be family very soon.

535
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,810
You're so tall.

536
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:01,980
I get it now.

537
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,400
My dad wished for me

538
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:07,180
to marry Miss Mengli.

539
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,670
No problem.

540
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:11,550
Done deal.

541
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:14,350
Alright.

542
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,070
It's decided.

543
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,090
I'll get Lurong and the other maids in

544
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,330
to dress you up.

545
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,040
Great.

546
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:31,240
Put on the ceremonial attire.

547
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,510
I'll go arrange a sumptuous dinner.

548
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,110
Okay.

549
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:35,630
Let's shake hands.

550
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,120
Done deal.

551
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:09,200
3,715.

552
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:13,290
3,716.

553
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:16,810
3,717.

554
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:19,700
3,718.

555
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,160
That dumb wild man is really not coming to see me.

556
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:31,290
He finally came.

557
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,470
It's so late now.

558
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,460
You…

559
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,200
Miss Han.

560
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:38,950
Lord and Madam invite you to the dining room

561
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:40,150
for the celebration.

562
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,150
Celebration?

563
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,530
Uncle Liu,

564
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:49,330
are you sure Tianhe is going to marry Mengli?

565
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:51,150
Tianhe left the mountain with the goal

566
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,450
of finding out what happened to his parents

567
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:52,850
and…

568
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,410
And the origin of that sword.

569
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:56,470
How can he stay here and marry Mengli?

570
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:58,430
Look.

571
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,930
That silly boy has gotten a wife effortlessly.

572
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:02,330
He's grinning ear to ear.

573
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,900
No persuasion is needed.

574
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:05,400
Lingsha.

575
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,260
Uncle Liu. Aunt Liu.

576
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,690
Look at our clothes.

577
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:10,520
Why are you dressed like this?

578
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,650
Are you really staying to get married?

579
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:13,790
Yun Tianhe.

580
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,470
Have you forgotten why you went down the mountain?

581
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,740
Have you forgotten about Little Pig Demon?

582
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,750
Are you not curious about the origin of that sword anymore?

583
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:19,470
Do you

584
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,950
not care about your parents at all now?

585
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:24,430
I do care about them.

586
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,310
Marrying Mengli

587
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,540
doesn't mean I can't find out the truth.

588
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:34,550
My Lord, Madam.

589
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:35,630
Has Young Miss

590
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,470
agreed to this marriage?

591
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,030
Li…

592
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:39,850
I disagree.

593
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:42,350
Li,

594
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,700
why are you still wearing casual clothes?

595
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,100
You…

596
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,590
Dad, Mom.

597
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,580
I thought about it carefully.

598
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,190
Uncle Yun wanted to entrust me

599
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:53,270
to his son

600
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:56,070
because he hoped that both of us could be happy.

601
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,050
But if we don't love each other,

602
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:02,020
how can we be happy after we get married?

603
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,580
Nonsense.

604
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,700
Tianhe told me he likes you.

605
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,630
Mr. Yun,

606
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,480
do you like Miss Han?

607
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,770
Yes.

608
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,950
Of course.

609
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:16,800
Do you like my dad,

610
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,500
my mom, and Pei?

611
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:20,690
Yes.

612
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:25,560
Dad.

613
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:28,330
He doesn't like me in a romantic way.

614
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:30,290
How can he understand

615
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,020
what getting married means?

616
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,760
I know what it means to get married.

617
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,050
Uncle Liu told me

618
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,380
that getting married

619
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,210
means becoming family,

620
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:42,160
real family.

621
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,080
Tianhe,

622
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:45,650
getting married

623
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,640
means becoming husband and wife

624
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,630
and spending the rest of your lives together.

625
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:54,060
Do you want to spend your life with Li?

626
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,610
Can the three of us live together?

627
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,500
What are you talking about?

628
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,420
Because my dad wanted me to take care of Mengli.

629
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,710
Wherever I go,

630
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:07,070
I need to take Mengli with me.

631
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:07,670
But

632
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,870
I've also promised Lingsha

633
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,790
to take her with me wherever I go.

634
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:14,020
If the three of us can be together,

635
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:16,550
I can fulfill my dad's wish.

636
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:17,880
You brat.

637
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:19,310
That's not gonna happen.

638
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:21,280
You can't get both girls.

639
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,420
Uncle Liu, I respect you,

640
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,750
but I have to say this.

641
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,210
You like Tianhe because he's unsophisticated.

642
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:29,250
If he were

643
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,050
a dissolute playboy,

644
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,870
would you still marry your daughter to him?

645
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:34,390
We…

646
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:37,350
Dad, Mom.

647
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:39,510
There are many ways to repay kindness.

648
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,990
I hope you can let me decide

649
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,760
who I marry.

650
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,390
Dad.

651
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,470
My Lord.

652
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,080
Fine.

653
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:53,790
My girl has grown up.

654
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:56,100
I can't make decisions for her anymore.

655
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,830
But I'm still very happy today.

656
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,180
The three of you…

657
00:28:59,480 --> 00:28:59,980
No.

658
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,970
The four of you all have great qualities.

659
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:04,170
Let me propose a toast to you.

660
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,860
I like what you said about becoming family.

661
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,990
I allow you to drink.

662
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:11,750
Cheers.

663
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,150
I'll drink to Dad, Mom,

664
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,270
and to all of you.

665
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:15,630
Okay.

666
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:17,500
Cheers.

667
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:34,830
Escort him up the mountain.

668
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,930
Whoever tries to take the sword has to die.

669
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:38,170
No mishap is allowed.

670
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,700
I'm so happy today.

671
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:47,850
Have a good rest tonight.

672
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,100
I'll prepare more delicacies tomorrow

673
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,040
to celebrate your achievements.

674
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:52,750
Uncle Liu.

675
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:53,830
At first light tomorrow,

676
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,370
Tianhe and I will leave for Qionghua.

677
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:57,530
We have to say goodbye to you now.

678
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,810
Qionghua?

679
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,910
You're going to Kunxu Mountain?

680
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,510
I'm going to Qionghua

681
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:04,400
because

682
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,060
I want to visit my father's grave.

683
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,070
I want to know what happened to him there

684
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,250
and what he went through.

685
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:08,970
Yeah.

686
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:11,300
Every child wants to know

687
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,240
about their parents' experiences.

688
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,110
I hope

689
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:16,660
both of you can get what you want.

690
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,150
Not the two of us.

691
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,630
It's the three of us.

692
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:20,760
Mengli is going too.

693
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,780
You're going to Kunxu Mountain with them?

694
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:30,080
Why are you going there?

695
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:31,480
I...

696
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,360
I want to know more about Uncle Yun.

697
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:37,710
I've told you so much about him since you were little.

698
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,550
What more can you find out in Kunxu Mountain?

699
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:40,990
Yes, Li.

700
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:43,570
You've never left us before.

701
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,970
How can we let you go somewhere so far away?

702
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,350
Daughter.

703
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,280
Listen.

704
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,680
Whenever you wanted something,

705
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,640
you'd hold my hand, and I'd just say yes.

706
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,640
No, no.

707
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,850
This won't work now.

708
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:57,500
I'll in no way agree.

709
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,720
I'm begging you.

710
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,720
Just stay by our side, will you?

711
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,270
Mengli.

712
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,390
When I came back this afternoon,

713
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:10,890
I thought I should apologize to you

714
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:12,090
for being mean to you.

715
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:13,270
But now,

716
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:15,150
I think I may be even meaner to you.

717
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:18,160
Your parents love you so much.

718
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,720
Your dad even begged you just now.

719
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,320
Why are you still so willful?

720
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:22,610
Think about it.

721
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,180
Once you leave this house,

722
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,190
your parents will be worried about you every second.

723
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,110
Don't you care about them at all?

724
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:31,030
Miss Han.

725
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,950
I'm not being willful.

726
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:33,870
No.

727
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:35,290
She's not being willful.

728
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,830
She has always been willful.

729
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:37,710
Dad.

730
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:39,350
But Lingsha,

731
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:41,040
didn't the three of us agree

732
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,630
that we'd never be apart?

733
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:44,970
But we can't take her away

734
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,700
and break her parents' hearts.

735
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:49,600
Uncle Liu, Aunt Liu,

736
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,370
don't worry.

737
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:51,950
We won't take her away.

738
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,710
I'll go back and pack up.

739
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,710
Okay.

740
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,440
L-Lingsha.

741
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,200
Think this through.

742
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,200
You have two choices now.

743
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:05,890
Either stay at home,

744
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,490
or don't care about us anymore.

745
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:11,830
Dad.

746
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,750
I'll always put you and Mom

747
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,180
before myself.

748
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:16,600
Girl,

749
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,420
I'm relieved…

750
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,980
I'm relieved to hear that.

751
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,140
I didn't raise an ingrate.

752
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:25,780
I'm going to cry.

753
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:40,870
What's so special about Qionghua?

754
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,470
He wants to go there.

755
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,960
She also wants to go there.

756
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,110
Meet me at the alley at 9 p.m.

757
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,180
It's about something important.

758
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,030
Should I ask my employer

759
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,630
why we're going to Qionghua?

760
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:06,350
-Master.
-Master.

761
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:08,590
Elder has reinforced the Binding Immortal Rope.

762
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:11,390
We can definitely take down that wild boy this time.

763
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:13,960
If you see strange illusions again,

764
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,350
use the magical weapon Elder gave you

765
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:17,910
to dispel them.

766
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:18,730
Yes.

767
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:25,570
Who are you?

768
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,400
Someone who will take your life.

769
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,710
You're dead.

770
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:23,469
Are you a human or a ghost?

771
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:25,389
Why do you want to kill us?

772
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:42,010
It's you.

773
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:43,750
Why are you here?

774
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,600
Whoever tries to take the sword

775
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,310
has to die.

776
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:20,390
What's the matter?

777
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:23,330
I didn't see anything just now.

778
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,030
I just want to ask you something.

779
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,950
After we go to Qionghua,

780
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:29,190
if Tianhe refuses to give you the sword,

781
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:30,870
will you kill him?

782
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,270
Because you just said

783
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,600
whoever tries to take the sword has to die.

784
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,440
I just overheard you.

785
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:39,400
Go up the mountain as soon as possible.

786
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:43,100
I've never begged anyone before.

787
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,740
But today, I beg you

788
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,440
not to hurt Tianhe.

789
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,790
Are you begging me

790
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:50,650
for him?

791
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:52,870
He's my best friend.

792
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:55,670
Friend?

793
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:58,750
Friends

794
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,510
don't lie.

795
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:02,410
I can't lie to Tianhe

796
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,230
and cause him to lose his life.

797
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,560
If you don't promise me,

798
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:07,510
I won't take him to Qionghua.

799
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:08,150
Kill…

800
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:09,870
Kill me now if you want.

801
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,810
It seems that Qionghua is not a good place.

802
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,630
I have to take Tianhe there,

803
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:26,630
but I can't drag Mengli down as well.

804
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:43,120
Mengli.

805
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:46,300
Mr. Yun.

806
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,740
What brought you here?

807
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,400
I asked Lurong where you were.

808
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,120
She said you might be here,

809
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,470
so I came to look for you.

810
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:58,870
This is…

811
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:01,990
This is my dad.

812
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:04,130
So my memory served me right.

813
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,230
I never thought I could see

814
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:09,310
what my dad looked like when he was young.

815
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,240
Unfortunately,

816
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:11,440
my dad and I

817
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,430
bear no resemblance at all.

818
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:16,170
You're as kind and righteous as Uncle Yun.

819
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:18,840
You sympathize with demons.

820
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:21,380
Maybe when you're Uncle Yun's age,

821
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:22,910
you'll do the same.

822
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:27,580
Looking at them now,

823
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:30,520
I have to say Tianhe and Miss Liu are a good match.

824
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:31,920
Sorry.

825
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:33,490
Mengli.

826
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,800
Can you give me this portrait?

827
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,040
By the way, Mengli,

828
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:46,810
I apologize to you on behalf of Lingsha.

829
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:47,950
I also think

830
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:50,320
you should stay with your parents.

831
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,110
How about this?

832
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:57,390
We'll go to Kunxu to check things out first.

833
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:58,890
If it's not dangerous there,

834
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:00,690
you can join us to have fun, okay?

835
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,500
Mr. Yun.

836
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,680
I don't want to have fun.

837
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:05,440
I want to go there

838
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:08,660
because of a secret that I've been keeping for years.

839
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:10,220
What secret?

840
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,130
Wait.

841
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:19,710
Who's there?

842
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:23,540
I already saw you!

843
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:24,790
Come out,

844
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,300
or I'll get you out.

845
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:28,360
Stupid wild man.

846
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:31,180
An old trick like that can't scare me.

847
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,770
No one is there, Mengli.

848
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:38,130
Maybe you just saw a stray animal.

849
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:40,470
Miss Han.

850
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,670
Come out.

851
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,480
I understand why you don't want me to leave home.

852
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,810
But you should come out and hear my reason.

853
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,040
It's really Lingsha.

854
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:58,920
Lingsha.

855
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:01,160
Why are you

856
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,020
dressed in all black?

857
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,770
It's called a stealth suit.

858
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:07,150
If you go out at night and don't want to be noticed,

859
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,880
you have to wear a stealth suit.

860
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:11,990
Mengli is amazing.

861
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:14,500
You put on a stealth suit, but she still noticed you.

862
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,430
I just felt

863
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:17,030
Miss Han's presence.

864
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,030
You can feel murderous auras.

865
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:19,950
She can feel presences.

866
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:21,280
You two are a good match.

867
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:23,310
So,

868
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:24,710
what's your reason?

869
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:29,970
I…

870
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:35,720
I'm not my parents' biological daughter.

871
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:10,950
Elder.

872
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:13,840
You were lucky

873
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,750
to have made it to me.

874
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,190
Sorry. I failed you.

875
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,480
My two disciples died on the mission.

876
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:28,510
I'm willing to accept death as punishment.

877
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:29,920
With me here,

878
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:31,300
you won't die.

879
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:33,710
But now,

880
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:36,090
your heart and meridians are damaged,

881
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:37,800
and your cultivation is ruined.

882
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,130
Even after you recover,

883
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:42,150
you can't improve your cultivation anymore.

884
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:46,670
Elder,

885
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,710
do you mean my cultivation

886
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:51,840
will forever stay on the fourth level,

887
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:54,250
the Huiyang Realm?

888
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:55,870
Yes.

889
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:09,620
Elder.

890
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,350
The one who hurt me

891
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,930
was the man in the forbidden area.

892
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:16,740
He's been secretly protecting that wild boy.

893
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,380
What?

894
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,800
How is that possible?

895
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:21,200
I saw it with my own eyes.

896
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:22,880
It was Xuan Xiao.

897
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:24,590
He said

898
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:27,270
whoever tries to take the sword has to die.

899
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,870
Is there someone in the world

900
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:35,980
who has no cultivation but possesses strong spiritual power

901
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:38,380
and can connect with all living creatures?

902
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:43,050
Has Ziying met that Yun boy before?

903
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,240
Yes.

904
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,160
At Qingluan Peak.

905
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,180
I don't know if he's met him again.

906
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,220
Why did you ask about Ziying?

907
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:54,170
He came to see me a few days ago

908
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:56,250
and said he ran into a strange person.

909
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,800
That wild boy from the Yun family

910
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,010
doesn't fear the cold aura of Wangshu Sword.

911
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:00,760
I think

912
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,800
he must be Wangshu Sword's host.

913
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,080
A disaster is coming.
