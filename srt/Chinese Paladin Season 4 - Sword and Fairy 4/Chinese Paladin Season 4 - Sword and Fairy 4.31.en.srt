[Buzhou Mountain]

5
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,790
According to Elder Chongguang’s description,

6
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,450
the entrance to the Netherworld should be here.

7
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,039
Watch out!

8
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,750
This is no ordinary thunder and lightning.

9
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,150
You mortals.

10
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,420
This is the Netherworld.

11
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,579
Leave right away.

12
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,930
This should be the Illuminating Dragon of Buzhou Mountain.

13
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,660
We want to go to the Netherworld.

14
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,150
Divine Dragon, please let us pass through.

15
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,670
In the six realms,

16
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,310
you're just insignificant mere mortals,

17
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:56,710
yet you want to enter the Netherworld?

18
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,310
Do you know what kind of place the Netherworld is?

19
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,240
I'm a disciple of Qionghua Sect of Kunxu.

20
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,910
I specialize in cultivating immortality and following the Way.

21
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,030
I know the Netherworld

22
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,890
is where the primordial spirits gather

23
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,220
before they dissipate.

24
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,470
If it wasn't urgent,

25
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,060
we wouldn't have come here to bother you.

26
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,390
Mortals who dream of cultivating immortality are even more ridiculous.

27
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,190
Through the ages,

28
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,790
how many people can fulfill their wishes?

29
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,910
Why don't you just accept your fate?

30
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,950
After you die,

31
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:27,200
let your primordial spirits enter the Netherworld.

32
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,690
We can't wait any longer.

33
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,690
We must go to the Netherworld today.

34
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,670
Answer me.

35
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,640
What's your name?

36
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,430
My name is Yun Tianhe.

37
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,730
Divine Dragon.

38
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,720
I know you guard Buzhou Mountain.

39
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,070
But I also have family I want to protect.

40
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,570
We must go to the Netherworld today

41
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:49,790
and get the Barrier-Crossing Branch to save her.

42
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:50,630
If it's possible,

43
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,230
we can save even more people.

44
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,950
Well, Divine Dragon.

45
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,290
Don't be angry.

46
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,079
Tianhe is not good with words.

47
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,210
Did you forget?

48
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,570
Elder Chongguang warned us

49
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:01,740
not to enrage him.

50
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,710
It's been thousands of years.

51
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,190
All I've heard

52
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,950
were words of humble mortals praying for blessings.

53
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,740
This is the first time I've heard such nonsense.

54
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:12,710
Fine.

55
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,390
I'll give you a chance.

56
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,930
But you have to go through my test.

57
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:17,779
Okay.

58
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,760
What test?

59
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,170
Tianhe.

60
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,960
We are just mortals.

61
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,760
How can we accept a trial from a divine lord?

62
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,090
I don't think it has a murderous aura.

63
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,550
Besides, for us to enter the Netherworld,

64
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,530
we'd have to go through its trial no matter what.

65
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:39,600
So just let me try.

66
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:43,950
Be careful.

67
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:47,570
Divine Dragon!

68
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,950
I accept your test.

69
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,370
Yun Tianhe.

70
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:51,540
I admire

71
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,280
your courage.

72
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,770
If you can resist one attack of mine,

73
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,470
I will open the path to the Netherworld.

74
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,280
Otherwise, I'll send your primordial spirits

75
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,990
into the Netherworld.

76
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,570
As a mortal,

77
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,950
you could actually become the master of the Primordial-Spirit-Initiating Moon-Chasing Bow?

78
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:29,350
Tianhe.

79
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,580
That's unexpected.

80
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,420
It's a wound caused by the divine dragon.

81
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,740
How can a mortal's magic heal it?

82
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,580
If you want something,

83
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,900
you have to pay the price.

84
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:43,780
Is this so-called trial

85
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,330
to help Tianhe

86
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,590
or do you have other intentions?

87
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,590
Heaven's secrets cannot be divulged.

88
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,590
Yun Tianhe.

89
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,490
The Hou Yi's Sun-Shooting Bow in the Divine Mausoleum

90
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:55,050
makes a pair with the Primordial-Spirit-Initiating Moon-Chasing Bow.

91
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:58,400
You can only compete with me if you can get it.

92
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,730
Divine Dragon.

93
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,990
So I've passed your test, right?

94
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,580
Can you let us go to the Netherworld now?

95
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,940
I won't break my promise.

96
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,210
No one has ever returned after entering the Netherworld.

97
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,220
You need to figure out a way

98
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,390
to return to the mortal world yourselves.

99
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,580
As long as you don't cause any trouble,

100
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,210
this spell, which lasts for six hours,

101
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,610
will prevent your living spiritual auras

102
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,280
from being noticed by the Netherworld envoy.

103
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,070
Divine Dragon, thank you for protecting us.

104
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:47,870
I, Yun Tianhe,

105
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,030
will definitely repay your kindness today.

106
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:54,740
I have been guarding this place for 9,900 years.

107
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:57,490
I'm about to complete my accumulation of merits.

108
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,810
It's just another good deed.

109
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,310
Yun Tianhe.

110
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,870
I will fulfill your wish today.

111
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:07,770
But one day, when you've experienced all the hardships in the world,

112
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:10,630
you may come to resent such a fate.

113
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,340
I will wait until the end of your life

114
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,030
and see if you would still be

115
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,390
as free-spirited as today.

116
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,010
Divine Dragon said

117
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,060
wounds from the divine dragon can't be healed by mortals.

118
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,990
What should we do about your wound?

119
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,890
It's fine, Lingsha.

120
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,290
I'm not a mortal.

121
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,670
I have boundless spiritual energy.

122
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:40,870
Don't worry about me.

123
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,770
Time is running out.

124
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,630
Let's hurry to the Netherworld.

125
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,330
Let's go.

126
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,370
[Netherworld]

127
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:30,700
Don't look at me. Don't look at me.

128
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,200
Lingsha.

129
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:39,500
You've been looking at that bead.

130
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,900
Did you sense something?

131
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:43,350
I sense my feelings.

132
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,630
I didn't realize it when I was in the mortal world.

133
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:48,430
Only now do I know that so many people die every day.

134
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,560
I feel bad inside.

135
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:54,610
We shouldn't stay here for long.

136
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,460
Let's go find the Barrier-Crossing Branch.

137
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:56,870
Okay.

138
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:00,720
Stop there!

139
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,640
Why do I feel like I smell living beings?

140
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,270
Maybe it's because I just arrived in the Netherworld

141
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,550
and haven't been the Netherworld envoy for long,

142
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,640
so my primordial spirit hasn't been integrated yet.

143
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,440
You're right.

144
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,630
I've been guarding the Barrier-Crossing Branch every day.

145
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,700
It's as if I've forgotten the smell of living beings.

146
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,970
The Barrier-Crossing Branch is rare in the Netherworld,

147
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,580
but as the tool that enables travel through the six realms,

148
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:37,630
if it's stolen by an obsessive primordial spirit,

149
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,550
I'm afraid it'd cause chaos in the mortal world.

150
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:42,190
Then you two should go to guard the Barrier-Crossing Branch now.

151
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:45,120
I still have to go receive other primordial spirits.

152
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,070
Do you still remember me?

153
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,160
I was the faceless woman Wumian in the Tomb of Prince Yunan.

154
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:59,110
Follow me.

155
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,110
Thank you, Sister Wumian.

156
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,520
We'd be in trouble if they find out we're alive.

157
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,600
Since you are alive,

158
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,230
why did you come to the Netherworld?

159
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,560
Do you remember Mengli?

160
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,910
Simply put,

161
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,510
Mengli is in danger.

162
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:24,990
We must come to the Netherworld

163
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,110
to get the Barrier-Crossing Branch to save her.

164
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,960
The Barrier-Crossing Branch grows in the Impermanence Hall.

165
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,070
But we, the Netherworld envoys,

166
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,510
will use it to guide the primordial spirits.

167
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:35,040
I just heard that you are a Netherworld envoy.

168
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,660
May you give me the Barrier-Crossing Branch?

169
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:39,110
I'll be very grateful.

170
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,510
It was all thanks to Benefactor Yun that my primordial spirit was saved.

171
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,990
After that, thanks to Mr. Yun,

172
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:47,070
Miss Han and Miss Liu's prayers,

173
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,140
it was freed.

174
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,790
I'm the one who should be grateful.

175
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,830
Thank you, Miss.

176
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:04,790
Looks like

177
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,850
my fight with that divine dragon wasn't in vain.

178
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,620
Thank you, Sister Wumian.

179
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,030
Sister Wumian.

180
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:13,260
Why did your primordial spirit remain in the Netherworld

181
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,700
instead of dissipating?

182
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,870
I was going to leave.

183
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:21,140
I didn't want to see Benefactor Yun's primordial spirit here.

184
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,400
He has a deep obsession

185
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:25,040
and refuses to leave the Luminous Mirror Platform.

186
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,170
So I stayed here as a Netherworld envoy

187
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,690
to wait for you with him.

188
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:32,760
Why does my father have a deep obsession?

189
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,710
He said he only felt guilt towards you throughout his lifetime.

190
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,970
He wants to apologize to you personally.

191
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:44,410
Can you take me to see him?

192
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:48,270
Although your living spiritual auras are concealed,

193
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,430
keep your voices down

194
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,760
to avoid being noticed.

195
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,430
Thank you for the reminder.

196
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:53,290
Follow me.

197
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,910
Benefactor Yun is at the Luminous Mirror Platform.

198
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:14,670
Go now.

199
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,950
I'll guard outside.

200
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:32,870
Father.

201
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,140
I'm here to see you.

202
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,120
Brat.

203
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,470
Long time no see.

204
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,280
Father.

205
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:06,120
You haven't changed a bit

206
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,350
from when you left me.

207
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,710
What you see now is my primordial spirit.

208
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:11,970
Of course I'm the same.

209
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,030
But you...

210
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,980
you've grown up quite a bit.

211
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:15,940
You no longer have

212
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,670
that fearless expression from when you were young.

213
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,730
You seem to have a lot on your mind now.

214
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:21,950
Father.

215
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,530
I didn't expect...

216
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,580
you to be waiting for me here.

217
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,090
Father.

218
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:36,110
Father.

219
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,740
I...

220
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,460
miss you so much.

221
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:47,860
Have you forgotten?

222
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,150
I hate it when men cry.

223
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:50,910
But...

224
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,070
But I...

225
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,280
I repeatedly told Big Pig Demon to keep an eye on you.

226
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,010
As expected,

227
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,860
you still escaped out of Qingluan Peak.

228
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:04,810
Father.

229
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:06,910
In order to save me,

230
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,950
Big Pig Demon was killed by Xu Zhao.

231
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,070
In order to protect the Wangshu Sword,

232
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:14,400
I had to go down the mountain with my sword.

233
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,640
You know the name of this sword?

234
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,800
It means you have been to Qionghua.

235
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,090
Don't tell me

236
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,070
you've become a disciple of Qionghua?

237
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:23,710
Yes.

238
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,440
I have been to Qionghua.

239
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,270
But everyone in Qionghua

240
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,810
said that you and Mother stole the Wangshu Sword

241
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:31,870
and betrayed your fellow disciples.

242
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,360
But I didn't believe it.

243
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,860
I became a disciple

244
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,260
to clear Mother's and your names.

245
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,070
Tianhe.

246
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,550
I stopped you from leaving the mountain

247
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:44,670
because I didn't want you to get involved in the predicament from 19 years ago.

248
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:45,990
It really is karma

249
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,790
and fate playing tricks on people.

250
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:49,520
Don't tell me

251
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,840
everything I'm doing is wrong?

252
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,280
No.

253
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:58,720
It's fate that's wrong.

254
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,830
Xuan Xiao and I joined Tai Qing's sect together.

255
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:12,190
I was mocked by my peers because of my unruly personality

256
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:16,550
and he was ostracized for being stained with his parents' blood,

257
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,090
until I beat up his peers for him

258
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:23,050
and he took the Ice and Fire Whipping punishment for me.

259
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,190
I was looking for you everywhere.

260
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,070
So you are here.

261
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:30,940
For you,

262
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,900
my face was beaten up to this state.

263
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,630
You should at least show some gratitude.

264
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,050
Thanks.

265
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:42,810
I'll find a chance

266
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,470
to teach that Xuan Ji a lesson.

267
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,000
What's wrong?

268
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:47,770
You're hurt?

269
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:48,370
I'm fine.

270
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:50,760
Let me see.

271
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,630
Ice and Fire Whipping?

272
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:58,980
I was the one who beat up my peers.

273
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,440
Why did Master punish you?

274
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,050
I'll go find him.

275
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:03,360
At worst, he'll give me a beating.

276
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,030
Don't go.

277
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,470
Master gave me the punishment of Ice and Fire Whipping

278
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,130
to see if I have perseverance.

279
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,260
Only those with strong perseverance

280
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,580
can hold the Xihe.

281
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,710
Really?

282
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,070
You have become the host of Xihe?

283
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:20,650
That's great!

284
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:24,480
No one in Qionghua Sect will dare to bully us anymore.

285
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:26,390
You

286
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:27,750
will definitely become

287
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,280
the most powerful Sword Immortal in history.

288
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,640
Tianqing.

289
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:32,960
Do you know what?

290
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,220
I want all the people in Qionghua who look down on us

291
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,930
to see us in a new light.

292
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,230
Based on what you just said,

293
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:44,620
I will treat you as my best friend forever.

294
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,520
Although my spiritual cultivation is average,

295
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,180
if someone dares to bully you,

296
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:51,210
I'll make him suffer all the same.

297
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:02,650
It is said that Master

298
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:05,849
is going to host the Divine Sword Recognition Ceremony.

299
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:07,050
We will soon get

300
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,329
Xihe and Wangshu soon.

301
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:11,890
Senior.

302
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,819
I was looking for you in Zuihuayin

303
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:16,650
but didn't see you.

304
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,910
So you two are practicing here in secret.

305
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:20,510
Xuan Xiao.

306
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,510
Master said

307
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:24,510
we need to cultivate the two swords together to connect our minds

308
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,510
in order to prevent the backfiring of the sword auras.

309
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:29,110
Don’t be held back by others.

310
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:29,990
Yun Tianqing.

311
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,990
You just idle around all day.

312
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,920
Don’t disturb our sword training.

313
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:37,580
Tianqing.

314
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,900
You are talented and smart.

315
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,700
You should study and train hard.

316
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:44,150
Don't be looked down upon by others.

317
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,020
Senior Su Yao.

318
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,220
Senior Xuan Xiao.

319
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,220
Junior Tianqing.

320
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,350
This is Junior Su Yu, an apprentice who just came up the mountain.

321
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,360
She is now a disciple under Grandmaster.

322
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,950
Senior Xuan Zhen asked me to bring her here

323
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:10,950
to meet everyone.

324
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,520
Greetings, Senior.

325
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,320
Greetings, seniors.

326
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,160
What are you looking at?

327
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,230
Aren't you going to greet her back as a senior?

328
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:39,510
Greetings, Junior.

329
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,070
This Senior Xuan Xiao

330
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:44,320
is the golden child of Qionghua Sect.

331
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:44,960
And I,

332
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,890
Yun Tianqing...

333
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:52,630
am an ignorant troublemaker.

334
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:54,670
Junior.

335
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,710
Why are you here for immortal cultivation?

336
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,740
You are already

337
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,810
as beautiful as a fairy.

338
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:01,830
Tianqing.

339
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,630
Stop talking nonsense.

340
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:05,630
Beauty

341
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,580
is only skin deep.

342
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:10,800
A true immortal cultivates their character.

343
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:12,750
From that day on,

344
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:15,950
the three of us became inseparable friends.

345
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,670
But it was at that time

346
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,450
that Xihe Sword and Wangshu Sword were forged

347
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,190
and ruined everything.

348
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:27,010
Hundreds of years ago, the Dream Tapir Demon Clan

349
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:31,350
stole a lot of spiritual purple crystals

350
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,590
and built the Huanming Demon Realm.

351
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,640
They hid in the horizon

352
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:38,230
and often caused disaster to the people.

353
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:41,470
But all the immortal sects did not know how to track them down.

354
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:45,070
The 20th grandmaster of our sect, Immortal Dao Yin,

355
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,830
observed the stars at night

356
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:50,790
and found that Huanming Realm moves like a heavenly trail.

357
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,160
Every 19 years, they approach the skylight region of Kunxu.

358
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:59,020
So he planned a strategy to exterminate this demon clan.

359
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,440
Zong Lian.

360
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,880
Tell the disciples about it.

361
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:06,960
The demon-exterminating strategy is to forge the Yin Yang double swords

362
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,780
and use their immense spiritual power

363
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:11,350
to form the sword pillars that charge straight up into the sky.

364
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,000
When Huanming passes by,

365
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,630
we'll capture them.

366
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,400
After three generations,

367
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:18,660
I've finally

368
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:21,320
forged the divine swords of Xihe and Wangshu.

369
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,530
But the two swords

370
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:36,180
must be awakened by the spiritual aura of the living.

371
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:40,980
Xuantian Goddess once issued a divine decree stating that

372
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,590
if the divine swords were forged,

373
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,750
everyone in the sect

374
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:47,960
can abandon their mortal bodies and become immortal beings.

375
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:50,640
I've chosen the hosts of the double swords.

376
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:53,450
Xihe's host is Xuan Xiao.

377
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,350
Wangshu's host is...

378
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,640
Su Yu.

379
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:19,510
Master.

380
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:20,890
Didn't you say

381
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:22,490
I am the real host of Wangshu?

382
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,130
You have a half Yin body.

383
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,920
Su Yu has the ultimate Yin body.

384
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:30,830
Your qualifications are worlds apart.

385
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,390
But Master,

386
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,820
you promised me.

387
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,340
Please give me another chance.

388
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,790
Is this how a senior should act?

389
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,630
If you dare to mess around again,

390
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:41,640
I'll expel you.

391
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:42,880
Master.

392
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:45,320
Take the swords!

393
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,580
Follow Master's orders.

394
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,910
This is the Spiritual Light Zao Jade.

395
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:37,870
It can open up the forbidden area.

396
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:42,030
From now on, you two will cultivate at the forbidden area.

397
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,390
Zong Lian forging these two swords

398
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,390
also marked the beginning of a huge mistake.

399
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,590
Everyone in Qionghua

400
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,950
became a pawn in Tai Qing's palm.

401
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:00,670
Father.

402
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,840
If you and Mother hadn't taken away the Wangshu Sword,

403
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,970
would Brother Xuan Xiao

404
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,810
not have been driven crazy

405
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:11,100
and not have been sealed in the ice?

406
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:12,950
But

407
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:17,360
you were able to go back to save Xuan Zhen's daughter.

408
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:20,550
You couldn't have abandoned your friends and peers.

409
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:21,710
Father.

410
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:24,210
What exactly happened back then?

411
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,550
I promised Su Yu

412
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:31,870
not to tell you this.

413
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:32,550
Father.

414
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:33,830
But now,

415
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,950
Huanming is about to reach above Qionghua.

416
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:36,830
It's very likely that a war

417
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:39,070
like that of 19 years ago would break out again.

418
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,510
I have to know the truth

419
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,170
before I know what I should do.

420
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,070
So after demons die,

421
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,650
their primordial spirits would also come to the Netherworld.

422
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:14,590
There's no difference between humans and demons here.

423
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,190
One may be a human in this life

424
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,960
and a demon in the next life.

425
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,830
One may be a demon in this life

426
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,790
and a human in the previous life.

427
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:25,550
Then why would humans and demons fight each other?

428
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,460
Then those demons who died by my sword...

429
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:31,240
all died in vain.

430
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:32,990
As for me,

431
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,690
I may be a human in this life

432
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:38,160
but I may become a demon in my next life.

433
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,890
If you've really thought this through,

434
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,510
there will be no estrangement

435
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:04,440
between you and Tianhe and Mengli.

436
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:11,970
Lingsha.

437
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,560
I thought

438
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:16,120
I should just try my best in everything

439
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,720
and to live and die together.

440
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,630
How is that possible?

441
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:32,300
Sister!

442
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:32,840
Lingsha!

443
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,300
Sister!

444
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:33,750
Lingsha!

445
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,270
Sister!

446
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:34,960
Lingsha!

447
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:36,300
-Lingsha!
-Sister!

448
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:38,670
Lingsha.

449
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:39,810
Sister!

450
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,430
-Sister!
-Lingsha!

451
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:43,120
Miss Han.

452
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,590
Among the dead,

453
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,470
there's one who can't let go of their obsession.

454
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:49,870
I asked around and found out she was your sister.

455
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:51,600
So I brought her here to see you.

456
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,340
But you must control your emotions.

457
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:57,920
Otherwise, the immortal master and Mr. Yun will be implicated.

458
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:58,720
Okay.

459
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,390
Seven?

460
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,310
Sister!

461
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,020
Why are you and the immortal master here?

462
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,600
We are not dead.

463
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,930
We just came to the Netherworld to get the Barrier-Crossing Branch.

464
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:22,620
Sister.

465
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,220
Didn't you take the Fuyao Immortal Fruit Pill

466
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,280
and had recovered?

467
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,970
How could you have died?

468
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,270
It's not due to a disease that the Han family members die early.

469
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,660
How can it be cured?

470
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,020
I saw my father's primordial spirit.

471
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,180
He told me

472
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:41,860
the reason the Han family members have short lifespans.

473
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:42,990
Reason?

474
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,250
Father.

475
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:52,550
I know you and Mother are doing this for my own good.

476
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:55,810
But I can't stay out of this anymore.

477
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:59,490
I have someone I want to protect.

478
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,100
You have someone you want to protect?

479
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,380
Okay.

480
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:22,620
I'll tell you.

481
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:26,480
That day,

482
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,510
your mother learned that

483
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:32,270
I offended Grandmaster in order to get the Fuyao Immortal Fruit Pill,

484
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:34,800
so she went to Xuan Zhen to plead for leniency.

485
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,100
But unexpectedly,

486
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:39,130
she found out the real reason of the war.

487
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:42,350
Senior.

488
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:45,270
You’ve always been considerate of us.

489
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:48,210
Did Tianqing really offend Grandmaster

490
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,670
because of me?

491
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:51,010
Senior.

492
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:55,100
Please help Tianqing plead for leniency with the grandmaster.

493
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:57,680
Junior Su Yu.

494
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:58,910
You don't know

495
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,990
I'm no longer that formidable disciple

496
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,910
in Grandmaster's heart.

497
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,560
Why?

498
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,510
Grandmaster is here!

499
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,840
Grandmaster is here.

500
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:10,880
I don't want to implicate you.

501
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,720
Hide now.

502
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:12,710
Hurry!

503
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,250
Greetings, Grandmaster.

504
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:22,320
Xuan Zhen.

505
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:25,590
Make a cup of tea for me.

506
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:26,900
Yes, Master.

507
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:28,800
Master, please.

508
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:40,650
When I brought you up the mountain,

509
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,320
you were only 8 or 9 years old.

510
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:43,910
Do you remember

511
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:47,320
why I named you

512
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,710
Zhen?

513
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,390
It's from the Hexagram Zhen.

514
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,230
Smile

515
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,560
in face of an adversity.

516
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,860
It's a warning to be prepared for danger in times of peace

517
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,340
and to remain calm in times of danger.

518
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:01,220
I regarded you as a role model of Qionghua's disciples.

519
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,350
But you lied to everyone

520
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:05,710
and got into a relationship with the female disciple Jingci

521
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:07,630
and gave birth to a daughter, Xuanye.

522
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:08,830
You should know

523
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:13,430
that people who engage in an illicit relationship will be expelled from the mountain.

524
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:15,410
The child born out of an illicit relationship

525
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:18,010
will be executed according to the rules.

526
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:20,280
Master.

527
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:23,820
Master.

528
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:26,570
Please spare Xuanye's life.

529
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,230
I'll die for her!

530
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,300
I'll die for her!

531
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:31,850
You are my first disciple

532
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,030
and the person I trust the most.

533
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:35,630
Apart from Zong Lian and I,

534
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,390
only you know

535
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,340
what I want to accomplish.

536
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:42,860
I know you

537
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:47,370
want to absorb the power of the purple crystal of Huanming Realm

538
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:48,730
for your ascension.

539
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,690
That's why I lied to the whole sect,

540
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:56,830
saying that we're exterminating demons to protect the people.

541
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:00,710
But you caused such a big trouble at the crucial moment.

542
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:02,220
Master.

543
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:04,910
This is not the right way to become an immortal.

544
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:06,150
You're disregarding countless disciples' lives

545
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:07,870
for your own selfish desire.

546
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:10,700
Besides, the Dream Tapir Demon Clan has never harmed the mortal world.

547
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,510
Must an entire clan be sacrificed

548
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:14,590
for your ascension?

549
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,510
With my ascension,

550
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,750
all my disciples will become immortals.

551
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,450
What do you mean by selfish desire?

552
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,590
Demons can't change their nature. They are harmless now,

553
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,700
but it's inevitable that they will bring disaster to all living beings in the future.

554
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,470
The extermination of a mere demon clan

555
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:28,550
is no big deal.

556
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,350
But you,

557
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,260
what's your decision?

558
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:35,890
I know your intention.

559
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,000
As long as you let Jingci and my daughter live,

560
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:43,350
I'm willing to be the vanguard in the invasion of Huanming Realm

561
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,190
to give my life

562
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:47,320
to you.

563
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:55,310
In order to protect others,

564
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:58,100
Su Yu only told Xuan Xiao and me about this.

565
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,510
Xuan Xiao was the host of Xihe.

566
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,330
His heart was filled with ambition.

567
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:03,790
He chose not to believe it.

568
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:06,950
But I did.

569
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,110
My father told me

570
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,440
the ancestors of the Han family were proficient in feng shui.

571
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,710
They aspired to explore all dangerous places

572
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,930
to search for various rare treasures.

573
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,110
Unexpectedly,

574
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,570
they accidentally entered the divine clan's forbidden area

575
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:27,560
and were infected by the poison of extreme coldness.

576
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,860
As a result, the descendants of the Han family

577
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,250
have short genetic lifespans

578
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:34,250
and do hard labor to relieve the divine punishment...

579
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,140
to atone for our sins.

580
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,300
Then...

581
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,410
what happened to my parents

582
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,930
and uncles?

583
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,270
I didn't see your parents.

584
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:48,010
I think they have no worries anymore.

585
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,630
My father

586
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,470
is in the Netherworld.

587
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:55,470
He willingly became a ferryman who transports primordial spirits

588
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:57,030
and never stops working.

589
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,910
Since it's a divine punishment,

590
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:03,440
is there a way to resolve it?

591
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,040
It's a consequence of a sin

592
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,640
which repeats cyclically.

593
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,110
How can it be resolved?

594
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:14,720
The only way is for my descendants to stay away from the forbidden area.

595
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:15,980
Seven.

596
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,000
You must promise me

597
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,510
not to go to the forbidden area again.

598
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,170
Okay?

599
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:25,550
Sister.

600
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:28,250
You waited for me here

601
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,410
just to tell me the truth?

602
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,440
Master Ziying.

603
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,350
You promised me

604
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,020
to be with Seven to the end of time

605
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,030
and let her

606
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,680
spend the rest of her life happily.

607
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:50,820
Miss Lingxiang.

608
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:53,510
I'm not one to express myself.

609
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,140
But right now,

610
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,190
I can promise you

611
00:33:58,390 --> 00:33:59,720
I can give up everything

612
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:02,210
just to accompany Lingsha

613
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,170
to fulfill her wish.

614
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:11,960
Miss.

615
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:13,750
It's almost time.

616
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,100
You must leave.

617
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,110
Sister!

618
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:20,739
Seven.

619
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,300
I'm leaving.

620
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,600
You must cherish every day

621
00:34:29,389 --> 00:34:32,909
and cherish the people around you.

622
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,550
Sister!

623
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:15,580
Lingsha.

624
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,420
I know you're sad.

625
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,110
You still have us.

626
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,240
Since you trusted my mother,

627
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,200
why didn't you take her away then?

628
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:39,320
At that time,

629
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,830
I was about the same age as you are now.

630
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:43,440
I was full of doubts,

631
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,650
but I didn't know how to resist.

632
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:48,850
Just like you now.

633
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,380
Don't you

634
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,750
also have a lot of doubts

635
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,650
about Xuan Xiao?

636
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,760
But you still helped him break out of the ice

637
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,090
out of your friendship.

638
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:12,160
Tai Qing knew I would risk my life to protect Su Yu,

639
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,640
so he used the Fuyao Immortal Fruit Pill as a condition.

640
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,840
Xuan Zhen and I were ordered to invade the Huanming Realm.

641
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:21,240
So,

642
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:25,040
you invaded Huanming Realm because of my mother.

643
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,240
But I've always believed a saying,

644
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:31,450
that humans and demons are the same.

645
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:33,050
They both have good and evil.

646
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:36,890
You are better than me in this aspect.

647
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:40,640
I couldn't determine if the Dream Tapir Demon Clan was good or evil,

648
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,300
until the day of the great war.

649
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:59,160
Qionghua has set up the trap with the Wangshu and Xihe double swords

650
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,440
and the barrier is about to open!

651
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,110
We must protect the Purple Crystal Mountain to death!

652
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:03,820
Yes!

653
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,490
The human race has broken its defense.

654
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:29,940
Kill!

655
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:35,790
Kill!

656
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:29,360
Master is really doing this to seize the power of the purple crystal.

657
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,090
The Dream Tapir Demon Clan has stayed away from the mortal world

658
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:52,530
and has no intention to harm the human race.

659
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,230
But you took away my Purple Crystal Mountain

660
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,490
and exterminated my clan!

661
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:57,420
Aren't you afraid of retribution?

662
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:05,330
I was wrong.

663
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,580
I did everything wrongly.

664
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:47,250
Qionghua Sect

665
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,600
can't make any more mistakes.

666
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:04,330
The Immortal Sect actually suddenly came here?

667
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:05,700
How is Lady Chan You?

668
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:15,200
The demon chief Chan You couldn't protect herself.

669
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,460
I'm here to get rid of them conclusively!

670
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:56,100
Senior, no!

671
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,170
Senior!

672
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:07,900
It's our fault.

673
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,790
You should be well aware

674
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:11,970
we’re the ones slaughtering the Dream Tapir Demon Clan.

675
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:12,740
Tianqing.

676
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,610
She’s the young chief of Huanming. We can’t keep her.

677
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,100
Senior.

678
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,100
You know all this is wrong.

679
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:42,590
Why are you still doing this?

680
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,940
I just want to go back alive

681
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,870
and see Jingci and my Ye.

682
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,300
This little demon

683
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:01,330
is as big as my Ye.

684
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,370
You must take her back.

685
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:11,780
This will be me accumulating merits for Ye.

686
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,240
Go back alive.

687
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,310
Go...

688
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:50,130
Young Chief.

689
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:53,490
I'll die with you.

690
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:04,350
19 years ago,

691
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:06,790
the humans and demons who participated in that great war

692
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:09,920
were all sacrificed for Tai Qing's own selfish desires.

693
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,560
That

694
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:12,530
includes your mother.

695
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,270
Father.

696
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,360
I know you don't want to talk about it.

697
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:27,790
But I really want to know this.

698
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:30,680
You'd already taken Mother away from Qionghua.

699
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:32,430
So why did she die?

700
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:36,240
She died...

701
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:42,800
because of you.
