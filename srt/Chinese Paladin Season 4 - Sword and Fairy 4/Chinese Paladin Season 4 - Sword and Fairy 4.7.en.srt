[Episode 7]

4
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,509
The place where Uncle Yun saved me

5
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:41,830
wasn't in Shouyang.

6
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,789
Although I was a child,

7
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,710
I clearly remember

8
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,229
someone was trying to kill me.

9
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:50,430
and someone was trying to protect me too.

10
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,950
Only Uncle Yun took me away

11
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,350
without care about his own safety

12
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,710
and brought me to Shouyang

13
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,270
passing me to my parents.

14
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,570
But even if you were gifted with spiritua power,

15
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,750
you were so young back then,

16
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,950
how can you remember clearly?

17
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,080
I don't know either.

18
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,730
But I can remember it.

19
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:05,770
Yes.

20
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,750
Otherwise, how could Mengli

21
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,100
draw my father accurately?

22
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,140
19 years later,

23
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,660
my parents treated me as their own

24
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,170
and loved me so much.

25
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,910
But the mystery of my background

26
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,110
has been pestering me like a nightmare.

27
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:21,930
I dare not tell my parents

28
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,170
about this.

29
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,810
I didn't want to hurt them.

30
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,210
So I had to endure it.

31
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:27,890
But I really want to know

32
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,030
where I came from.

33
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,290
Where are my biological parents?

34
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,350
Why did someone want to kill me?

35
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,079
Only by going

36
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,240
with you to learn about

37
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,829
what Uncle Yun went through,

38
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:40,070
can I find the answer.

39
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,570
I didn't expect you, a lady from a noble family, to be like me.

40
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,070
When I was seven,

41
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,910
my parents passed away too.

42
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,160
Lingsha.

43
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,430
Since

44
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,970
we are all doing this for our parents,

45
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,500
why don't we take Mengli to Qionghua?

46
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,570
The one who takes the sword

47
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:16,490
will die.

48
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:17,910
No, no, no.

49
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,420
The fact that the road to Kunxu Mountain is difficult aside,

50
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,110
Qionghua Sect

51
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,910
is a sinister place.

52
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:24,480
You might lose your life.

53
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,990
We haven't been there, how would you know?

54
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:27,510
I...

55
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,829
Miss Han,

56
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,310
why are you so sure?

57
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,590
Even if I have no spiritual power,

58
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,790
I have more experience

59
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:35,870
in the Martial World as compared to you.

60
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,740
Besides, aren't the cultivators

61
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,440
also here to snatch the swords recently?

62
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,510
We can't even protect ourselves

63
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:41,630
yet we still have to protect you.

64
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,420
If anything happens to you,

65
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,650
how do I explain it to Uncle Liu and Auntie Liu?

66
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,329
Yes.

67
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,390
I want to know my background

68
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,590
to protect them.

69
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,960
I'm afraid those who tried to kill me

70
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,030
would harm them.

71
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,200
Only by solving the mystery

72
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,010
can I ensure their safety.

73
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:57,790
But

74
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,440
your parents won't agree.

75
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,430
Mengli,

76
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,310
I understand you.

77
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:09,790
Just like me,

78
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,150
you want to go to Qionghua

79
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,120
to find out about your parents.

80
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,769
But you are different from me.

81
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:19,630
You have parents.

82
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,959
Although they are not your biological parents,

83
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,110
they have been with you

84
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,190
all these years.

85
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,390
I know you like light food.

86
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,030
This osmanthus soup is specially made for you.

87
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:32,690
Take a look.

88
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,760
Thank you, Mother.

89
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,909
I asked Pei Jian

90
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,240
to buy your favorite walnut pastry

91
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,250
for you from Wang's dessert shop.

92
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,180
Li,

93
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,800
you've never left us in your whole life.

94
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,820
How can you go somewhere so far away?

95
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,540
I beg you.

96
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,630
Isn't it good to stay by our side?

97
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,730
Should we not go and say our goodbyes?

98
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,270
If not Mengli might be in a dilemma again.

99
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,470
It's contradictory.

100
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:20,810
Lingsha.

101
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,450
Are those things...

102
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,510
what Uncle Liu prepared

103
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,430
for us?

104
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,000
No way.

105
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:26,690
That's so much of them.

106
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:27,290
Look.

107
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,590
I asked the servants

108
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,910
to prepare every thing I know

109
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,830
should be prepared.

110
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:34,950
Uncle Liu,

111
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,670
we don't need a blanket.

112
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:37,790
Lingsha and I

113
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,380
are used to camping.

114
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,920
I know you are used to camping.

115
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,930
But it's the first time

116
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,840
my daughter is leaving home.

117
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,370
I'm afraid she won't be used to those outside.

118
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,770
Lord.

119
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:50,870
You agreed?

120
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:54,690
Li,

121
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,880
tell me the truth.

122
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,520
Why do you suddenly want to go to Qionghua?

123
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,480
Did something happen over there?

124
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,420
Actually,

125
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,610
I remember the scene when Uncle Yun saved me.

126
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,830
I remember someone tried to kill me.

127
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,760
I was afraid they would harm you

128
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,940
if they found out I was still alive.

129
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,670
So I want to find out the reason.

130
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:17,230
Li,

131
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,660
what else do you know?

132
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,720
I don't know anything more.

133
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,770
Stop asking.

134
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,020
We won't ask anymore.

135
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:28,670
In this life,

136
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,510
it's enough for us to have a daughter

137
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,730
like you.

138
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:38,810
Li,

139
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,250
even though we can't bear to let you leave,

140
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,420
we can't just think of ourselves

141
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,900
and disregard your feelings.

142
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,990
They often say

143
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:55,840
the best way for parents to fulfill their children's wishes

144
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:00,560
is to help them fulfill it wishes.

145
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,960
Father, Mother,

146
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,330
I'll never forget your

147
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:11,520
kindness...

148
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:12,760
Get up.

149
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,110
Get up.

150
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,480
Li,

151
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,950
this is what parents should do.

152
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,460
If you want to go to Qionghua,

153
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,460
you can go.

154
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:23,760
Mother...

155
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,000
Uncle Liu, Aunt Liu.

156
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,550
I promise

157
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,320
I will take good care of Mengli.

158
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,700
Kid,

159
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,170
I trust you.

160
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,430
Young Miss.

161
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,900
Luckily I'm not late.

162
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,560
The bow you asked for is ready.

163
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:49,760
Mr. Yun,

164
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,030
That day, your bow

165
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,250
was damaged in the illusion formation.

166
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,590
This jade bow,

167
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,130
though it's not as good as

168
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:57,200
Uncle Yun's...

169
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,130
It's excellent.

170
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,570
A bow made from the 1000-year dragon scale.

171
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:03,230
And this bow string is made of Tianshan Ice Silk.

172
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,250
Tianhe, it's a treasure.

173
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,180
It's a treasure.

174
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,060
No... No.

175
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:09,830
This is too precious.

176
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,590
I can't take it, Mengli.

177
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,790
Mengli is giving it to you.

178
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:15,520
Just take it.

179
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,560
Thank you, then.

180
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:21,990
This bow

181
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:24,230
is much prettier than the one my father gave me.

182
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,030
And it fits in my hands so nicely.

183
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,500
Thank you, Mengli.

184
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,500
Give it to her.

185
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:34,549
Mengli,

186
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,830
actually, Lingsha

187
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,630
she also prepared a gift for you.

188
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,270
Here.

189
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:46,110
Handbook for a newbie in the Martial World.

190
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,790
It records how those people in Martial World

191
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,060
survive in it.

192
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,350
It's suitable for someone like you who has never been out before.

193
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:51,960
Yes.

194
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,280
Lingsha has been writing it for several nights.

195
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,860
Thank you, Lingsha.

196
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,560
You're welcome.

197
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,670
Let's go, kids.

198
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:04,260
Let's go.

199
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,120
I wonder why

200
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,040
you changed your mind again?

201
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,150
I suddenly want to see them again.

202
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,910
Why bother asking?

203
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,310
You're finally here.

204
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,870
Elder Qingyang.

205
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,550
How have you been?

206
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,190
Elder Chongguang,

207
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,350
you've lived longer than Zong Lian.

208
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,120
I want to see you

209
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,270
just to remind you

210
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,290
keep your life.

211
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,520
When I break the ice,

212
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,930
it will be your death date.

213
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,340
How dare you!

214
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,030
You haven't changed your evil ways.

215
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,380
If it weren't for you,

216
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:17,290
I wouldn't be suffering from this cold.

217
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,420
Do you want me to be grateful to you?

218
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:21,450
Fine.

219
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,550
I will let your death come first.

220
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,090
Elder Chongguang,

221
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:44,200
your cultivation has not improved at all.

222
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:47,470
How are you still stay at the sixth level, Wu Xiang Realm?

223
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,510
I didn’t expect you're able to reach

224
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,300
seventh level, Tai Qing Realm, while being sealed under the ice.

225
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,230
Don't worry.

226
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,230
When I break the ice,

227
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,770
I will let you die a quick death.

228
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,880
Hurry up.

229
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,550
[Liu Mansion]

230
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,500
One should use less at home but bring more when out.

231
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,300
I will feel more relieved if you bring more things.

232
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:16,990
Father.

233
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:17,740
Mother.

234
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,280
Let's go.

235
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,120
I'm leaving now.

236
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:22,030
Li,

237
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,880
I knew you were leaving,

238
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,470
so I made you

239
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,880
to make you a sachet with lixiang herb.

240
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,110
This lixiang herb

241
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,570
will have a stronger smell the further you leave home.

242
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:33,570
Let it

243
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,160
accompany you on behalf of us.

244
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,510
Also,

245
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,390
if anything happens,

246
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,370
discuss with Tianhe and Lingsha.

247
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:42,470
Mother,

248
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,960
I will remember this.

249
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,600
Lord,

250
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,720
we are going onto the mountain path, we better leave early.

251
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,230
Okay.

252
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:51,420
Kids,

253
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:52,910
set off earlier.

254
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,310
Go.

255
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:56,190
Come back safely.

256
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,000
Father, Mother.

257
00:11:58,830 --> 00:11:59,710
Take care.

258
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,120
I will be back.

259
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,250
We'll wait for you at home.

260
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,080
Pei,

261
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,990
take care of our parents.

262
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,680
Don't worry, Young Miss.

263
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,030
Go ahead.

264
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,240
Go ahead.

265
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,570
We're going!

266
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,200
Li.

267
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:23,110
Lixiang herb in a place away from your home.

268
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:27,500
Don't forget your luggage when you leave.

269
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:31,710
I hope you remember with this fragrance.

270
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:36,350
When the fragrance dissipates, you're back at your hometown.

271
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:40,510
Lixiang herb in a place away from your home.

272
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:52,480
[Chenzhou]

273
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,430
Mengli,

274
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,020
you aren't reading the book I gave you.

275
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,200
You've been reading this all the way.

276
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,400
What are you reading?

277
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,380
This is the Illusory Sound Collection

278
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,170
I told you about that my master gave me.

279
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:02,720
The illusion formation inside is very profound.

280
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,190
Not to mention reading it many times,

281
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:07,850
one might not understand it fully even after reading it for years.

282
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,210
We're in Chenzhou.

283
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,740
It's bustling. Let's go down and have a look.

284
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,030
Take a look.

285
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,550
Rice.

286
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,230
Flour.

287
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,450
Take a look.

288
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,120
Sir.

289
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,140
Lingsha.

290
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,650
Didn't you say this city

291
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,870
is more prosperous than Shouyang City?

292
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:43,270
There are many houses on the street,

293
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,670
but not many people.

294
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,780
This wasn't how it looked when I last came.

295
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,740
That place.

296
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:52,110
That restaurant used to be an long-time restaurant in Chenzhou.

297
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,950
The queue would be so long every day.

298
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,150
This person fainted.

299
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:02,310
Why are there so many people in front of the clinic over there?

300
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,510
Excuse me.

301
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:04,820
You can't go in.

302
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,320
Is there a plague in Chenzhou?

303
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,560
Let's go and ask him.

304
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,290
Just in time,

305
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,630
Lingsha has been feeling dizzy on the journey here.

306
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,340
Let's visit a doctor.

307
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,990
Doctors are not rare.

308
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:15,630
I don't want to visit it.

309
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,110
It's best if I don't visit one for my whole life.

310
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:17,710
No!

311
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,860
I-I've been listening to you on our whole journey.

312
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,720
You have to listen to me this time.

313
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,470
I'm not going. I'm not going. I'm not going. I'm not going. I'm not going. I'm not going. I'll go. I'll go. I'll go. I'll go.

314
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,490
Let's go. Let's go.

315
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:30,290
I'm not going!

316
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:31,860
Here.

317
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:32,520
Put it here.

318
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:42,030
Why don't these people seem to be sick?

319
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,280
They seem to be asleep instead.

320
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:46,760
I don't see a doctor

321
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,720
but I see a nuisance.

322
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,840
Let's go.

323
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:51,830
Senior Ziying.

324
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,040
You are indeed here.

325
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:00,440
Indeed?

326
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,330
What do you mean?

327
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:02,760
You're really waiting for us here?

328
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,610
Chenzhou is the somewhere you have to go past to get to Qionghua.

329
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:05,740
Jixian Garden which

330
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,780
Kunxu eight sects' disciples protect are also here.

331
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,230
So you mean

332
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,850
we met by coincidence?

333
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:13,380
I just didn't expect to meet you at the clinic.

334
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,630
Mr. Murong.

335
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:17,270
Are these people infected with some plague?

336
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,050
These days,

337
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:20,350
many people in Chenzhou have been unconscious.

338
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,350
I'm here to investigate the reason.

339
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,200
Are you here to see a doctor too?

340
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,510
Who is the patient?

341
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:27,520
She's a patient.

342
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:28,840
You?

343
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,140
Miss,

344
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:35,790
are you already getting symptoms of feeling dizzy and sleeping for long hours?

345
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,730
Yes, she always feels dizzy.

346
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,310
But I don't fall asleep.

347
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,580
Looking at your face,

348
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,530
I can tell

349
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,560
you don't have the Sleep Condition.

350
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,960
Sleep Condition?

351
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,880
These people who fell asleep suddenly

352
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,470
all have chaotic vitals.

353
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:53,350
So it's hard to find the root of the illness.

354
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,280
Chaotic vitals?

355
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,830
If tens of people

356
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,430
continue to sleep like this everyday,

357
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,270
the whole Chenzhou City

358
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,800
will become a dead city.

359
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,040
No way...

360
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,839
There's a strange disease that makes people sleep?

361
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:05,640
Maybe

362
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,140
it's not a disease.

363
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:20,520
What a strange symptom.

364
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,680
It's different from normal sleep.

365
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,430

Ice Cube.

367
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,830
Aren't you from Qionghua and knows how to get rid of demons?

368
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,830
Have a look and see these people are possessed with.

369
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:32,990
Something is wrong in Chenzhou.

370
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:33,870
I have to go.

371
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,230
Don't wander around.

372
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,890
Please stay at Jixian Garden.

373
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:38,270
Hey!

374
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,030
You're running away faster than anyone

375
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,140
when you should be helping.

376
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:40,710
You...

377
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,160
All right, Lingsha.

378
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:42,830
I know.

379
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,090
You will definitely say

380
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:46,090
we won't go to Jixian Garden, right?

381
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:50,950
I meant to say, we will be waiting for you at Jixian Garden.

382
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,220
Didn't you hear what he said?

383
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,200
He said those Immortal Sect disciples

384
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,170
are guarding this place.

385
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,250
This is the safest place.

386
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,910
So we're not only going, but also staying there.

387
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:00,820
Really.

388
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,610
[Qianfo Temple]

389
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,570
Look.

390
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,530
Someone is playing the qin.

391
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,040
What a beautiful qin sound.

392
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:42,830
I feel so sad listening to it.

393
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:44,930
I can feel that too.

394
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:46,980
Mengli.

395
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:50,780
Does this qin remind you of your parents?

396
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:54,590
This song contains the meaning of parting.

397
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,130
If you feel sad,

398
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:58,840
it means there is someone you care about in your heart

399
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,640
You don't want to part with them.

400
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,060
Then the three of us will never be apart.

401
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,890
Then we won't suffer anymore.

402
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:13,750
Sir.

403
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,400
Come over.

404
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:16,640
Well,

405
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,110
do you know why

406
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,390
there is a lady who's playing a qin here?

407
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:22,620
This woman the daughter-in-law of the richest family in Chenzhou,

408
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,680
the Qin family, who ran away from home for many years.

409
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,940
She suddenly came back

410
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:28,110
and now plays the qin and sing here every day.

411
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,900
I heard from Qin Family's servants that

412
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,500
she wants to fight for the family inheritance.

413
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,090
She plays so well,

414
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,190
how could she do such a thing?

415
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,450
Enough. Stop playing.

416
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:40,240
Get lost.

417
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,440
I only have one wish.

418
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,830
If you don't let me in,

419
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,240
[Qin Ji]

420
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,920
I will come here every day.

421
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,560
I didn't expect that besides playing the qin,

422
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,180
she's so good at fighting too.

423
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,220
She doesn't look like an ordinary woman.

424
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,110
Her qin music is sad and lingering.

425
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,530
I'm afraid there's something behind it.

426
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:18,660
Who cares who she is?

427
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:20,620
She wouldn't be a good person

428
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,130
if she's fighting for inheritance.

429
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:22,880
Let's go.

430
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:23,980
Wait. Wait.

431
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,300
What does fighting for inheritance mean?

432
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,060
Well,

433
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,910
that means...

434
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:33,530
Like those people who are trying to steal your sword.

435
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:34,930
Do you understand it now?

436
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:35,660
Let's go.

437
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,430
Let's go.

438
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:39,660
Let's go.

439
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:50,040
[Jixian Garden]

440
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,790
This is an important place of the Immortal Alliance.

441
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,630
You can't trespass.

442
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,400
[Huai Xi]

443
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:52,950
Sir,

444
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,540
we're looking for Murong Ziying.

445
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,830
Please inform them.

446
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,310
Uncle Ziying

447
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,640
would not have anything to do with a lady like you.

448
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,320
What do you mean by a lady like us?

449
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,400
Qionghua people are all so rude?

450
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,470
Let me tell you.

451
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,870
not only do we know

452
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:06,530
Ziying,

453
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,510
we are also friends.

454
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,270
Friends?

455
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:10,510
I've never heard that Uncle has friends.

456
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,110
Not to mention a female one.

457
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,950
If you're here to visit Uncle

458
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:14,970
only because you admire him,

459
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,330
I advise you to go back.

460
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:19,610
His father.

461
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:23,280
His father used to be a member of Qionghua Sect.

462
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,540
We can go in now, right?

463
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:25,580
Yes.

464
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,610
What’s your father’s name?

465
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:29,780
My father’s name is Yun Tianqing.

466
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,300
Your father is Yun Tianqing?

467
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,670
Judging from your tone,

468
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:35,200
you must know my father.

469
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:38,020
Everyone knows your father

470
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,510
in Qionghua.

471
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,010
If that's the case,

472
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:42,670
all the more I can't let you in.

473
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,710
Why?

474
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,930
-Because your father...
-Huai Xi.

475
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:48,730
Article 5 of the academy rules.

476
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:51,070
Don't talk too much. Don't break your promise. Don't tell tall tales.

477
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:53,930
We don't speak of what we are unhappy or happy about.

478
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:54,820
Senior,

479
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,110
I said too much.

480
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,710
You should know us.

481
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,240
Please inform him.

482
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,950
We really have something urgent.

483
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:05,590
Everyone,

484
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:08,240
Uncle has something important to do and hasn't come back yet.

485
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,320
But he asked me

486
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:11,080
to prepare a guest room for you.

487
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,080
Please follow me.

488
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:12,940
All right!

489
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,260
Young man,

490
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,670
you should know we are

491
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,480
good friends with Ziying, now.

492
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:22,430
You...

493
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,480
This...

494
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,720
Who are you calling young man?

495
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:28,070
Ziying,

496
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,990
have you found out anything

497
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,590
about those sleeping patients?

498
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,680
There's nothing unusual in their bodies.

499
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,610
But I suspect they are not in a sleep

500
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,030
but have their souls detached.

501
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:39,220
Their primordial spirits may be controlled.

502
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,620
That's why their symptoms are like a sleep.

503
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,640
As to the cause,

504
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,720
I'll try the Spirit Pursuing Skill

505
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,050
to look for suspicious traces of spitirs.

506
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,070
You just got injured.

507
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,390
Your spiritual power is unstable.

508
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:52,790
How can you control such exhausting skill?

509
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,780
This is the solid elixir pill I kept.

510
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:03,180
You can recover in one or two days after taking it.

511
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,110
Thank you, Sect Leader Xu Liang.

512
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:05,910
Ziying,

513
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,440
although your cultivation is high,

514
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,930
don't act tough.

515
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,420
If anything goes wrong,

516
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,120
how can I explain to Grandmaster?

517
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:16,650
In her heart,

518
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,230
you are the only candidate

519
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,690
to take over her position.

520
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:22,800
I don't have any ambitions in this.

521
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,420
It's not up to you.

522
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:38,840
Mengli.

523
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:39,990
You pick first.

524
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,590
Where do you want to sleep?

525
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,390
Lingsha,

526
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,680
can you stop treating me like a Young Miss?

527
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,880
I can sleep anywhere.

528
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:48,410
I'll sleep here then.

529
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,960
I can protect you

530
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:51,720
if there's anything abnormal.

531
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,930
We can finally rest now.

532
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:56,810
Have a good rest.

533
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,070
This is Jixian Garden.

534
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,000
There won't be anything abnormal.

535
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:00,870
Mengli,

536
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,750
don't you think the disciples outside

537
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,950
were very ambiguous when talking about Tianhe's father?

538
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,750
Maybe a lot has happened with

539
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,160
Uncle Yun in Qionghua.

540
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:12,570
We'll know when we get to Qionghua.

541
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,840
Have a good rest first.

542
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,000
I’ll go rest up first.

543
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,050
Thank you, Mr. Huaishuo.

544
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,420
You're welcome, Mr. Yun.

545
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,460
Uncle Ziying said

546
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,580
we should do our best to meet any of your needs.

547
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,220
Thank you.

548
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:43,540
Tianhe.

549
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,310
Mengli?

550
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,530
Where is Lingsha?

551
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:48,820
She hasn't recovered yet

552
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,900
and is tired from the long journey.

553
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,430
She should take a good rest.

554
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,400
Mr. Yun.

555
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,660
Since you choose to stay here,

556
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,620
you can go to the backyard to decoct the medicine.

557
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,150
All right.

558
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:57,790
I got it.

559
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,410
Goodbye.

560
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,120
This is for Lingsha?

561
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,470
Mr. Huaishuo and I went to the pharmacy

562
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,570
to get some herbs to get rid of the coldness in her body.

563
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:09,450
When Lingsha wakes up,

564
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:10,910
the medicine would ready.

565
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,400
Do you know how to concoct medicine?

566
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,160
The doctor said it's similar to making soup.

567
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,310
Let me go with you.

568
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,520
At six o'clock,

569
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,350
I'll meet you at the alley beside Qiandou Winery.

570
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:53,510
Decocting medicine

571
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,590
requires one to be always keeping an eye on

572
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,230
at all times.

573
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,780
Because the fire it should be concocting under every two hours

574
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,580
is different.

575
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:01,780
Mengli.

576
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,960
Go take a rest.

577
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,630
I can keep an eye on it.

578
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:08,370
That's not what I meant.

579
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,910
Then what is it like?

580
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,160
Teach me.

581
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,980
Then I can make medicine for Lingsha in the future.

582
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,310
What is this?

583
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:24,300
This?

584
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:26,640
I heard from the doctor that

585
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,360
this medicine would taste bitter.

586
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,970
So I asked Huaishuo

587
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,490
to get some candied fruits for me.

588
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,010
Like this, Lingsha will get to have something sweet

589
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:35,070
after having the bitter medication.

590
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:38,560
You are bold and ignorant,

591
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,340
but are so thoughtful.

592
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:43,510
Lingsha will be very touched if she hears this.

593
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:45,230
Why?

594
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:48,110
Isn't that how you treat someone you like?

595
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:49,460
If you're sick,

596
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:51,830
I'll make medicine for you like this too.

597
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,090
In this world,

598
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,380
there are many things that can be shared,

599
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,910
except for feelings.

600
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,800
What are you talking about?

601
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,040
Feelings can only be felt

602
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,760
but is hard to express in words.

603
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:22,850
You're late.

604
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:26,260
I went to buy something for you.

605
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,160
Eight-flavor sandalwood powder.

606
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,850
It can moisten your throat

607
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,960
and reduce asthma.

608
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,250
It can mainly treat stuttering

609
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,850
and make one less irritable.

610
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,510
Stutter?

611
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,680
No one told you

612
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,230
that this needs to be cured?

613
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,110
If you are cured,

614
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:44,990
you have to remember my kindness.

615
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,690
Well,

616
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,850
can I ask you,

617
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:51,060
what's going on with the Sleep Condition in Chenzhou?

618
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,640
Move... now.

619
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,230
Otherwise,

620
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,170
don't blame me... for being merciless.

621
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,150
All you do is rush me.

622
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:03,010
A human should have a human touch.

623
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:05,310
Human... touch?

624
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,010
Drum toy!

625
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,200
Drum toy!

626
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:13,860
Wait, wait.

627
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:15,980
-Miss.
-Take it.

628
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:16,730
Buy one.

629
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,360
Take a look.

630
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:20,270
This one.

631
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:22,580
Keep the change.

632
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:23,560
Thank you, Miss.

633
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,910
The medicine

634
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,870
will make you less irritable

635
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,200
and treat your stutter.

636
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,030
This drum toy is for you

637
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:34,200
to be less serious.

638
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,120
Be happy.

639
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,720
Take it if you like it.

640
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,310
We are friends now.

641
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:44,010
That's right.

642
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:47,580
Since we are friends,

643
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,070
you should treat your friends

644
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,670
and the friends of your friends

645
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:53,150
with mercy.

646
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,230
Lord Beike,

647
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:18,610
I just found that

648
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,240
that wild boy...

649
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:22,400
He has arrived in Chenzhou, right?

650
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:23,820
Very good.

651
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:28,850
I must get the Wangshu Sword this time.

652
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,860
But that sword is extremely cold.

653
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,580
What?

654
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,930
Are you afraid I can’t hold it?

655
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:35,810
I said something wrong.

656
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:36,970
Please forgive me.

657
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,820
My plan has started.

658
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:42,460
Soon,

659
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:46,390
the whole Chenzhou will help me destroy the sword.

660
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:58,940
Lingsha.

661
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,740
Where is Lingsha?

662
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:05,980
Did she go out?

663
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:06,730
What?

664
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:09,400
It's so dangerous outside.

665
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,260
No.

666
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,810
I need to go find her.

667
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:17,480
Why did you go out by yourself?

668
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,650
There's the Sleep Condition going around and fights going on out there.

669
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:21,380
What if you are met with danger?

670
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:23,720
I'm someone who travels the Martial World.

671
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,380
There's no need to be worried.

672
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,160
Mr. Yun is more than worried.

673
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,900
He asked Mr. Huaishuo

674
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,970
to buy herbs that get rid of the coldness in your body.

675
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:31,660
He concocted it for hours

676
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,210
staring at the stove.

677
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,580
He's worried and cares a lot about you.

678
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,200
I just felt bored

679
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,560
and I went out for a walk.

680
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:48,280
I didn't expect a wild man like you can make medicine.

681
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:50,370
Mengli taught me.

682
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,440
Mengli has been guarding the medicine pot too.

683
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,350
Thank you.

684
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:56,680
Here.

685
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:57,840
Drink the medicine.

686
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,200
It's so bitter.

687
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,350
So I went to get candied fruits.

688
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,540
Take a sip of medicine

689
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,990
and a bite of candied fruits.

690
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:09,320
Then it won't be bitter.

691
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:10,790
Did Mengli teach you that?

692
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,360
Mr. Yun thought about it himself.

693
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,550
He knows you don't like bitter things

694
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:15,890
so he got the candied fruits.

695
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:19,090
He hopes you can get some sweetness after the bitterness.

696
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,240
You're becoming less like a wild man now.

697
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,160
Mr. Yun?

698
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,190
Drink the medicine.

699
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:46,430
How is it?

700
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,680
Is it sweet?

701
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:10,220
In the future, the three of us will also taste sweetness after the bitterness.

702
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,050
Fortunately, you have a good temper

703
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:23,030
and speak nicely.

704
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:23,980
Otherwise, that merchant

705
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,980
wouldn't have given me these dates.

706
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,810
I haven't had time to ask you.

707
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:30,470
What are you buying these dates and gingkos for?

708
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:33,110
Wasn't the wild man worried for me

709
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,310
and made me medicine?

710
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:35,280
I thought

711
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:36,850
I should make him his favorite

712
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:37,940
ginkgo porridge with dates

713
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:38,860
in return.

714
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,640
Miss Lingsha.

715
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:43,840
Miss Mengli.

716
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:46,880
Uncle Ziying is investigating the cause of Sleep Condition.

717
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,080
He asked me to tell you

718
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,130
not to go out.

719
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,850
Is Yun Tianhe back?

720
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,180
I-Isn't he in his room?

721
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:56,890
He went out early in the morning.

722
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:57,850
He just said

723
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,740
he's going to buy some candied fruits for you.

724
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,400
He's been away for a while now.

725
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,510
Do you know

726
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,870
where Mr. Huaishuo bought the candied fruits

727
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:06,460
he got for Tianhe yesterday?

728
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,260
It should be

729
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:10,340
that candied fruits store near Qianfo Temple.

730
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,940
Move... now.

731
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:13,450
Otherwise,

732
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:16,100
don't blame me... for being merciless.

733
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,040
Did Employer touch wild man?

734
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,710
Let's go find look for Tianhe.

735
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:21,300
Lingsha,

736
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:22,290
don't worry.

737
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,660
Mr. Yun is good at fighting.

738
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,650
He'll be fine.

739
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:25,410
Well,

740
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,640
there are many people better at fighting than he is in the world.

741
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,240
What if...

742
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,380
Whatever.

743
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,260
If you don't go,

744
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,590
I'll go first.

745
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,360
Lingsha!

746
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,230
Wait for me.

747
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,870
Uncle told you not to go out.

748
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:49,260
Senior.

749
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,710
Who would be so bold

750
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,470
to cause trouble in front of us?

751
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,160
Shush.

752
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,470
Uncle is using Spirit Pursuing Skill.

753
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:57,230
One careless move will drive him crazy.

754
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,230
Protect him well.

755
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,530
Didn’t you say you were buying candied fruits for us?

756
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,199
The song today

757
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:29,300
sounds more sad than last time.

758
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:31,179
It feels like

759
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:33,469
my heart is being captured by something.

760
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:50,440
Lingsha.

761
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:52,100
Something is wrong with the qin's sound.

762
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,110
Let's go.

763
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,400
Her back looks so miserable and beautiful.

764
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,760
No wonder the song is so sad.

765
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,520
Let's listen a little longer.

766
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:27,150
Maybe something is wrong with her qin's sound.

767
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,230
Let me test it.

768
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:37,910
This qin sound...

769
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:39,400
Could it be a Mind Control skill

770
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,460
from the Illusory Sound Collection?

771
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,790
Go to Jixian Garden now.

772
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:45,420
-Uncle! -Uncle!

773
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,740
Sect Leader said not to let you act alone.

774
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:47,870
Where are you going?

775
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,370
Miss.

776
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:51,650
Stop playing.
