when Yun Tianhe held the double swords in the forbidden area?

119
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,590
Both swords became very powerful,

120
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,020
and Chongguang was defeated.

121
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,770

124
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,850
He made it clear

125
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:12,100
that when Yin Yang Jade merges with human flesh,

126
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,600

the double swords will get all the power of the purple crystal.

130
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,220
Qionghua will break through the barrier,

131

Yun Tianhe, you're here.

161
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,700
I told you,

162
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,290
maybe after tasting all kinds of pain in the world,

163
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:47,020
you'd resent your fate.

164

Accept my fate?

167
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:55,930
No.

168
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:58,990
This shouldn't be my fate.

You don't have to fight the war that may make you lose those you love.

How can you ask me to abandon them to save my own hide?

178
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:38,500
Both Moon-Chasing Bow and Sun-Shooting Bow accepted me as their master.

179
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,690
Yin Yang Jade, the only thing that can destroy the double swords,

I can't accept this fate.

184
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,140
I don't believe in fate either.

185

Fate can be changed. Well said.

188

The dragon aura that entered your body

189
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:25,650

00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,390
The power of the divine dragon?

194
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,130
I told you

195
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,340
I was curious to know

196
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:42,410
if you could still be kind and caring

197
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,500
when your life ended.

198
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:48,530
The power of the divine dragon can extend your life by 100 years.

199
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:51,780
This is the 100-year deal between us.

200
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,050
See you in 100 years.

201
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:59,210
You are what you think.

202
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,550
Only someone who cares about the world

203
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:06,700
deserves to have the power of the divine dragon.

204
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,350
Elder Qingyang.

205
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,140
Qingyang.

206
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:48,050
You've lost more than half of your spiritual cultivation.

207
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,650
I advise you to find a place to die a quiet death.

208
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:01,980
Tianhe.

209
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,339
Tianhe!

210
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:08,060
Yun Tianhe.

211
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,150
Yun Tianhe.

212
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,900
Your fate

213
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,020
is decided by you!

214
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:41,970
Lingsha.

215
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:30,840
Impossible.

216
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,070
Impossible.

217
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,000
Impossible.

218
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,960
Lingsha, get up.

219
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:17,170
Tianhe, no!

220
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,210
Senior.

221
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,930
Sorry, Lingsha.

222
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:05,170
You gave me your life.

223
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:08,300
How can I leave like that?

224
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,210
Qionghua's main mountain is about to fall.

225
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:03,930
Junior.

226
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,940
Let's leave here.

227
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,210
Fall?

228
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,900
I won't allow Qionghua to fall.

229
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:15,340
I won't allow the ascension to fail.

230
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,890
Yun Tianhe.

231
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:56,720
Xuan Xiao.

232
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:58,810
Give up.

233
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,700
You ruined my lifelong dream.

234
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,940
You and I will be enemies forever.

235
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:05,920
Xuan Xiao.

236
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:07,740
I did six readings today.

237
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,380
In all of those readings,

238
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,950
Xuantian Goddess gave the same warning.

239
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,440
If this war starts again,

240
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,970
the whole world will be doomed.

241
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:17,420
Shut up!

242
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:20,260
If I can't ascend,

243
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,580
all of you

244
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:25,070
will go to hell with me.

245
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,330
Junior, are you crazy?

246
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,220
If the world abandons me,

247
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,740
I'll ruin the world.

248
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:40,110
If gods abandon me,

249
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:42,140
I'll become a demon.

250
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,330
Xuantian Goddess's warning?

251
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,120
I don't give a fig about it!

252
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,960
Junior!

253
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,580
Who stopped me?

254
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:15,130
How dare you try to change what's written in the stars?

255
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:43,710
I'm the Xuantian Goddess, appointed by the Heavenly Emperor

256
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,940
to convey the will of the divine realm.

257
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:55,340
Qionghua Sect has existed for more than 100 years.

258
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,340
In my generation,

259
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:00,080
Xuantian Goddess finally manifested herself.

260
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,340
Goddess, I don't understand.

261
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:09,050
Why did the divine will intend for Qionghua to ascend

262
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,130
but let us end up like this?

263
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,630
It was by the grace of Heavenly Emperor

264
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:15,640
that Qionghua thrived

265
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:18,000
and was given a chance to ascend.

266
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,700
For 100 years, you devoted yourselves to swordsmanship

267
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,730
and saw it as your duty to uphold justice and protect the world.

268
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,850
Heavenly Emperor was touched and asked me to give you the divine revelation

269
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:28,250
that Qionghua could ascend

270
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,610
by forging divine swords.

271
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:31,420
Unfortunately, you failed to forge the swords,

272
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:34,500
killed innocent lives, and brought a disaster upon Huanming.

273
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,020
You also took away the purple crystal for the ascension.

274
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:40,300
You defied the divine will and will be punished.

275
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,620
I've been punished for no reason

276
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,100
since I was born.

277
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:52,140
What did I do wrong?

278
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,720
If I hadn't defied the divine will,

279
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:56,650
I wouldn't still be alive today.

280
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,060
I don't care what the divine will is.

281
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,980
If fate is unfair to me,

282
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,620
I'll change my fate.

283
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:16,250
Xuan Xiao.

284
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,240
At this point, you still don't understand

285
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:21,130
that with mistakes come consequences.

286
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:22,990
Everything happens for a reason.

287
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:25,380
Vicious people will be condemned to hell.

288
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,790
Tyrannical people will go to the cold hell.

289
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:30,590
Cruel people will go to the hot hell.

290
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,690
This is your karma.

291
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,850
Sorry, Goddess.

292
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:41,890
Su Yao!

293
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:43,810
I

294
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,820
will accept any punishment.

295
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,220
Tianhe.

296
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,210
Tianhe. Tianhe.

297
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,580
Xuantian Goddess,

298
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:08,790
please give Xuan Xiao a chance to start over.

299
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:10,550
Cut him some slack.

300
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,740
Brother Xuan Xiao.

301
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,130
Before I die,

302
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,540
I got to hear you call me Brother again.

303
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,860
I can't ask for more.

304
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,800
In my heart,

305
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,210
you're always my brother,

306
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,120
my family.

307
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:09,900
Tianhe.

308
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,960
I was hellbent on changing my fate.

309
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:18,900
The price is too heavy,

310
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,580
and there's no turning back.

311
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:30,470
You're the only good seed Qionghua has ever sown.

312
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:32,700
Only a good seed

313
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,410
can change a bad consequence.

314
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:48,250
Only you can do that.

315
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,330
Senior!

316
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,290
Goddess,

317
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:46,290
there's something I don't understand.

318
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:49,230
Why weren't the mortals punished 19 years ago

319
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:50,850
but punished now?

320
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:52,110
19 years ago,

321
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,220
Yun Tianqing and Su Yu quit fighting

322
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,420
and saved countless people from death.

323
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:57,330
After that,

324
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,760
if Yun Tianqinga had given Yin Yang Jade

325
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,580
to Qionghua for the forging of the swords,

326
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:04,110
this battle wouldn't have been fought today.

327
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:09,860
My parents sealed Yin Yang Jade

328
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:10,810
in my body

329
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,210
to save my life.

330
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:16,350
That was why they both died before their time?

331
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:19,500
That was the seed they sowed.

332
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:21,890
You can only reap the whirlwind now.

333
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:24,460
Qionghua will fall. The world will collapse.

334
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,740
All mortals will die.

335
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,910
There won't be Kunxu anymore.

336
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,900
This place will become an ocean.

337
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:31,730
Because of Qionghua's mistake,

338
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,300
everyone in the mortal world has to die.

339
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,140
It's not fair.

340
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,500
Yun Tianhe.

341
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,890
19 years ago,

342
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,070
to protect you, your father kept Yin Yang Jade to himself,

343
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,640
which caused the disaster today.

344
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,570
You should've accepted your fate,

345
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:47,420
but you destroyed the double swords to protect Huanming.

346
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:50,890
Do you want to defy the divine will like Xuan Xiao?

347
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,700
I don't want to defy the divine will,

348
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,430
but if the divine will is to destroy the mortal world,

349
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:58,560
I'll have to defy it.

350
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,160
Even I have to obey the divine will.

351
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,020
Mortals who go against the divine will

352
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,810
will perish for good.

353
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,830
If you accept your fate

354
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,340
and let nature take its course,

355
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,940
you can ascend

356
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,110
and be spared the suffering in the mortal world.

357
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,640
I don't want to be immortal.

358
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,620
I only want to restore peace in the world.

359
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,480
That's the only fate I believe in.

360
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,890
To ascend at the cost of the lives of one's family and innocent people

361
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:23,550
means to live with a guilty conscience forever.

362
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,210
I'm on Tianhe's side.

363
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:31,010
Qionghua has been protecting the world for 100 years.

364
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:32,210
I'll keep doing that.

365
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:33,290
Yun Tianhe.

366
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,990
Obey the divine will, or defy it.

367
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,110
It's up to you.

368
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,970
Live forever, or perish for good.

369
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,940
Make your choice.

370
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,910
What should we do now?

371
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,650
How can we save everyone?

372
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:57,830
Tianhe.

373
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:58,720
Zhulong and Jumang

374
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,420
both said you have a pure heart.

375
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,170
That's why Moon-Chasing Bow and Sun-Shooting Bow

376
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,660
accepted you as their master.

377
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,790
This is fate.

378
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:08,180
The divine bow is the only way to stop the disaster.

379
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:18,190
The best exit is in Huanming Realm.

380
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,560
Xi Zhong and I will open a portal for you.

381
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:34,550
You…

382
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,060
Get out of here!

383
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,310
Move. Move.

384
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:40,280
Move. Move.

385
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:40,980
Hurry.

386
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:41,740
Hurry.

387
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,560
You two are badly injured.

388
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:53,940
Your magic is fading.

389
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,730
Let me help you.

390
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,460
Elder Qingyang, leave with them.

391
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,260
I'll stay.

392
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,740
I'm old.

393
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:09,970
It's time for me to do what I can

394
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:11,590
to atone for Qionghua's sin.

395
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,430
If Qionghua makes it through,

396
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,610
you will be Qionghua's only hope.

397
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,070
The rebuilding of Qionghua

398
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:24,590
will rest on your shoulders.

399
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,260
Go!

400
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,260
Elder Qingyang!

401
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:30,780
Elder Qingyang!

402
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:31,870
Elder Qingyang!

403
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:33,230
Elder Qingyang!

404
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,530
Hurry!

405
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,440
This way.

406
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:10,460
Tianhe.

407
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,480
Don't be afraid.

408
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:20,910
I'm very good at archery.

409
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,070
Tianhe.

410
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,500
You must make it through.

411
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:18,500
Tianhe, you made it.

412
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,909
Qionghua is falling.

413
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,170
Once it hits the ground, the world will collapse.

414
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,260
Everyone, leave!

415
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,080
Give him to me.

416
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:02,860
Tianhe.

417
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:18,400
Help him.

418
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,550
We have to stop Qionghua from falling.

419
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:21,800
We're willing to try our best

420
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,800
to save the world.

421
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,200
Hurry. Let's go help him.

422
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:34,570
♫Lock a fate that can't be undone even in a dream♫

423
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:38,140
♫We met in the mountains at the peak of our youth♫

424
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:41,290
♫The clouds were like waves♫

425
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:47,560
♫Lock the first sight of the bright full moon♫

426
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:47,890
Go. Go.

427
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:50,340
Mom. Mom.

428
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,710
♫The faces under the lantern, the persistent gaze♫

429
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:55,590
♫What can't be locked is eternality♫

430
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:52,810
Don't cry, kid.

431
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:58,310
♫The sword in the clouds cuts through time♫

432
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:01,720
♫The fabric at one's fingertips, flowing with longing♫

433
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:02,790
♫I only wish for♫

434
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:07,560
♫A lifetime together, under the full moon♫

435
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:11,740
♫So much splendor collapsed in an instant♫

♫The scars left behind by stories♫

437
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,390
♫Just one more drink before letting go♫

438

♫Leave fate unanswered♫

♫I'd forsake my life of splendor♫

♫In exchange for your life♫

441

♫We shall not turn old♫

444
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,260
Greetings, Grandmaster.

445
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:59,730
Today marks 100 years since Qionghua was rebuilt.

446
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:01,990
Grandmaster is now to impart wisdom to the new disciples.

447
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:04,140
We're all ears, Grandmaster.

448
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,570
As humans,

449
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,900
you need to cultivate your humanity within first.

450
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,600
To ascend or fall, to live or die, hinges on just one single thought.

451
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,270
Your fate

452
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,780
is in your own hands.

453
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:21,370
Grandmaster.

454
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:23,010
I heard that Qionghua was rebuilt in Kunxu

455
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,420
100 years ago

456
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,900
after a great disaster.

457
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,010
Was Yun Tianhe,

458
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:28,840
who drew the divine bow 100 years ago,

459
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,100
Qionghua's disciple?

460
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:32,530
Yun Tianhe was not Qionghua's disciple.

461
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,110
He was born to protect the world.

462
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:36,010
Grandmaster.

463
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:37,860
Can I ask you one more question?

464
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:42,260
You're always so cold. Has anyone called you Ice Cube?

465
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,710
In the past 100 years,

466
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:16,260
I've come here every year.

467
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:20,400
The Purple Crystal Mountain is finally back to normal.

468
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:21,630
The Huanming Realm

469
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:24,090
has come back to life.

470
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,690
After you leave today,

471
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,000
will you come back?

472
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:38,560
The four of us made a deal 100 years ago.

473
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,490
Tianhe has Lingsha's company.

474
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:43,420
I'm destined

475
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,560
to spend my whole life protecting Huanming.

476
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,550
Lingsha, look.

477
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,940
The sun is setting.

478
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:19,820
Soon,

479
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:23,630
you can see the Milky Way

480
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:26,000
in the starry sky.

481
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:54,940
Lingsha.

482
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:58,450
Mengli and Ziying are here to see us.

483
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:04,370
Mengli.

484
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,880
How are you? How is Huanming?

485
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,240
The Purple Crystal Mountain has gotten its spiritual power back.

486
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,640
Huanming is prospering.

487
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:31,190
I missed

488
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,090
you guys a lot.

489
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:42,490
How about Ziying?

490
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,220
How have you been?

491
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:48,390
Not good.

492
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:50,780
Not bad.

493
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:54,830
Life is like a dream.

494
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:56,460
Young people get old

495
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:58,910
in the blink of an eye.

496
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:04,730
Only the way of the world never changes.

497
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,710
The cycle of life goes on and on.

498
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,220
It never stops.

499
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:13,580
The way of the world never changes.

500
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:16,260
It's been 100 years.

501
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:18,870
We haven't changed a bit.

502
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:23,010
Lingsha.

503
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:25,470
Look at Ziying.

504
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:31,050
Does his cold face have wrinkles now?

505
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:40,770
Tianhe.

506
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,040
In this life,

507
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:47,970
we didn't fail the world,

508
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:50,060
ourselves,

509
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:53,210
or each other.

510
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,480
The divine dragon

511
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,990
has helped me protect the mortal world for 100 years.

512
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:15,500
I've

513
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,680
been by Lingsha's side all this time.

514
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:22,670
We've never been apart.

515
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:31,700
Tianhe.

516
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:40,790
Tianhe.

517
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:49,590
I've been waiting for you.

518
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:50,220
Let's go.

519
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:01,810
♫Hearts no longer entwined♫

520
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:05,230
♫No more news from you♫

521
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:10,900
♫Perhaps it's the unspoken understanding between us♫

522
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:15,950
♫I dare not look into your eyes♫

523
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:19,450
♫Because in your eyes, I can see a heart♫

524
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:24,910
♫That is covered in scars♫

525
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:23,650
Lingsha.

526
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:26,130
Back then, if I had

527
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:27,900
made you stay

528
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:30,530
♫I never stop longing♫

529
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:29,850
at Qingluan Peak with me,

530
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:32,460
I could be your wild man forever,

531
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:33,150
♫To be by your side♫

532
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:35,830
♫A gentle breeze brushes through our hair♫

533
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:35,790
and we could live a happy life together.

534
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:40,000
♫You trapped me in your world♫

535
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,120
Tianhe.

536
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:41,640
You're no longer the wild man

537
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:43,340
♫ I sort through countless thoughts♫

538
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:44,210
who knew nothing.

539
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:47,180
♫I plunged into the abyss of your world♫

540
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:46,130
Now, you're Yun Tianhe,

541
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:47,410
who is powerful

542
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,960
♫Memories wouldn't let go of me♫

543
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:50,340
and have the weight of the world on your shoulders.

544
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:53,310
♫I still want to go wherever you go♫

545
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:53,150
I'm just your Yun Tianhe.

546

♫Every time I close my eyes♫

547
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,080
Lingsha.

548
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,350
I just want to be with you forever,

549

♫I see you everywhere♫

550
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:01,770
as my dad did with my mom.

551

♫You walk towards me♫

552
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:06,050
♫And hold me in your arms again♫

553

♫I burst into tears♫

554

♫I dare not open my eyes♫

You're the love of my life.

561
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:47,000
♫Every time I close my eyes♫

562
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:51,060
♫I see you everywhere♫

563
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:53,670
♫You walk towards me♫

564
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,270
♫And hold me in your arms again♫

565
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:57,730
♫I burst into tears♫

566
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,370
♫I dare not open my eyes♫

567
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:05,090
♫I dare not let any light in♫

568
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:07,560
♫I wish these illusions could last forever♫

569
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:09,280
♫I lie to myself♫

570
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:12,060
♫Even if it's just a dream♫

571
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:15,270
♫Whenever I close my eyes♫

572
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:19,130
♫I see you before me♫

573
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:23,340
[Here lies my beloved wife, Han Lingsha]

574
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:21,830
♫Memories with you flash back♫

575
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:23,440
♫You hold me in your arms again♫

576
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:26,010
♫I burst into tears♫

577
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:29,530
♫I don't want to open my eyes♫

578
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:33,190
♫Don't wake me up from this dream♫

579
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:35,690
♫This is the only way♫

580
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:38,300
♫To see you again♫

581
00:47:38,330 --> 00:47:46,450
♫In this world♫
