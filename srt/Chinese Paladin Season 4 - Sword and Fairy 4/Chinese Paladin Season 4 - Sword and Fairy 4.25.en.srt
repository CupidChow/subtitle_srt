[Episode 25]

4
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:41,460
Something bad happened in Jixian Garden.

5
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,630
Recently, the cultivators have been attacked frequently.

6
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:47,090
It seems we need to go back to Chenzhou first.

7
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,640
Senior Mingguang!

8
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:51,780
Senior Mingguang, slow down!

9
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,060
Why didn't you watch him?

10
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,180
-Let’s get down.
-Be careful.

11
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,740
Be careful. Be careful—

12
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:56,650
Go!

13
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,300
Okay, okay.

14
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,759
Come on, let's be careful.

15
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,860
Keep an eye on him!

16
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,050
I want this bag.

17
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,670
Why did you touch my stuff?

18
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:05,780
Be gentle!

19
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,340
What a cute, chubby child.

20
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,380
What's your name?

21
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:10,539
You're the chubby child!

22
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:11,620
Let go!

23
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:12,930
Let go!

24
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,380
Who's this brat?

25
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,550
Let go of me!

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,210
He pulled my hair!

27
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,270
Why does this kid

28
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,100
look familiar?

29
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,260
Uncle Ziying.

30
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,560
You're finally back.

31
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:23,579
Who exactly is he?

32
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,430
He is Mingguang.

33
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,010
Mingguang?

34
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,060
You are Senior Mingguang?

35
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:30,860
You fool.

36
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,700
You are clearly older than me,

37
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,930
yet you're still calling me Senior.

38
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:35,970
Mingguang.

39
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,020
You've been a troublemaker since you were young.

40
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,250
What are you talking about?

41
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:39,980
I'm talking about you.

42
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,900
Take Mingguang back to his room to settle down.

43
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,410
Yes.

44
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,860
Mingguang, let's go.

45
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,630
You have to buy me delicious food and fun toys.

46
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,470
Okay, let's go.

47
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,270
What happened?

48
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,250
Uncle, here's the thing.

49
00:02:58,650 --> 00:02:59,530
I didn't expect

50
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,420
Yan people to be quite generous.

51
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,990
I just gave them a slight hint

52
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,730
and they gave me so much money.

53
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,530
Mingguang.

54
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,570
It's our duty as Qionghua's disciples to exorcise evil spirits.

55
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,230
How could you have asked for money?

56
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,560
Besides, we were dealing with Yan envoys.

57
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:15,810
Wait.

58
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,620
Have you lost your mind forging swords on the mountain?

59
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,250
This is called a deserved reward.

60
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:20,940
Besides,

61
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,829
it's just a tiny state

62
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,300
that has to pay tribute every year.

63
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,560
What's wrong with receiving some money?

64
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,400
You had a long journey too.

65
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,010
Do you want some?

66
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,190
Keep it for yourself.

67
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,340
I'll keep it then.

68
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,290
I'll treat you to a meal some day.

69
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:40,650
Who are you?

70
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,100
Mingguang?

71
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:51,220
Did you see clearly

72
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,970
the person who put a curse on Senior Mingguang?

73
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,430
He was dressed in red.

74
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,590
I didn't see his face clearly.

75
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,960
But I think he is unlikely to be human.

76
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,780
That means he is a demon.

77
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,760
But if he is a demon,

78
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,480
why didn't he just kill you

79
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,980
instead of turning Mingguang into a child?

80
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,900
A few days ago, a few Shushan disciples

81
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,650
were also attacked by a hidden weapon

82
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,210
and turned into seven or eight-year-olds.

83
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,610
I searched everywhere with various sects,

84
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,160
but no trace was found.

85
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,120
What kind of hidden weapon was it?

86
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:19,690
This was given to me by the Shushan disciples

87
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,940
who were attacked.

88
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:22,470
Uncle, take a look.

89
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,720
A sugar pellet?

90
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:29,770
This demon

91
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,330
is actually using sugar pellets as a hidden weapon?

92
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,010
He must like children.

93
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,720
Did you just say

94
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,860
Mingguang took money from Yan envoys?

95
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:44,030
Although Yan envoys are envoys for both states,

96
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,390
I don't know why

97
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,460
they've been staying in Chenzhou for more than half a month.

98
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,500
If he's a demon, we have to catch him quickly.

99
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,250
Otherwise,

100
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,860
he'll turn everyone in Jixian Garden into children.

101
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,260
That'll be troublesome.

102
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:58,900
Let's do what we did during the Sleep Condition outbreak

103
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,420
and ask around one by one

104
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,390
and visit the places one by one.

105
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,020
But there are tens of thousands of people

106
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,220
and thousands of houses in Chenzhou.

107
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,170
If we investigate at this rate,

108
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:08,430
everyone would be turned into children.

109
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,470
The quickest way now is to ask for help.

110
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:13,820
Who can we ask?

111
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,240
Please.

112
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,310
Why didn’t you allow Mengli to come along?

113
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,910
This kind of tavern is not suitable for Mengli.

114
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,340
Aren't you the lady

115
00:05:32,409 --> 00:05:34,670
who paid for her wine with the Emei thorn?

116
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,420
Why?

117
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:36,860
How many jars do you want today?

118
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,090
I don't have time to drink today.

119
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:39,490
I'm looking for someone.

120
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,600
Do you have a regular here

121
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,490
surnamed Luo?

122
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,210
Although my business is good,

123
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,030
we are afraid of trouble.

124
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:48,460
You'd better leave.

125
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,680
Judging from your attitude,

126
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,210
you must know him.

127
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,420
Mister and Miss.

128
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,060
I suggest you go and find out who he is exactly

129
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,900
before you look for him.

130
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,230
You should leave now.

131
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,520
Luo Jiyi!

132
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,610
Who is Luo Jiyi?

133
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,360
Don't shout!

134
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:03,970
Who is Luo Jiyi?

135
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,250
Luo Jiyi!

136
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,700
Are you Luo Jiyi?

137
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:07,880
Luo Jiyi!

138
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,220
-Stop shouting.
-Who is Luo Jiyi?

139
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:09,860
Miss.

140
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,250
Who is Luo Jiyi?

141
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,380
-Luo Jiyi!
-Stop shouting.

142
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,370
Who is Luo Jiyi?

143
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,700
Are you calling out for Luo Jiyi?

144
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,520
Even your emperor

145
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,540
dare not call me by my name.

146
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:23,960
I didn't expect

147
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,180
that in such a small place in Chenzhou,

148
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,310
my name would be recklessly called out

149
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:29,990
by you two foolish kids.

150
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,120
You are Luo Jiyi?

151
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,070
It's just a name.

152
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,200
So what if we utter your name?

153
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,040
It's not a name you can casually utter.

154
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,220
[Luo Jiyi]

155
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,150
There is a price to pay for that.

156
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,180
Wait!

157
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,340
Do you

158
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,780
still remember this?

159
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,010
Back off!

160
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:54,940
He really came to Chenzhou.

161
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,420
Where is the person who owns this token?

162
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:00,980
Hurry.

163
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,740
Take me to him now.

164
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:04,140
Let's go.

165
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,180
Uncle Ziying!

166
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,170
I am Luo Jiyi, the commanding general of the Yan Imperial Palace.

167
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,030
Greetings, Your Royal Highness.

168
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,710
So Uncle Ziying is the Royal Highness.

169
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,350
What is the Royal Highness?

170
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,770
That is... the king's son.

171
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,010
I've long become a cultivator

172
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,940
and am no longer a prince of Yan State.

173
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,330
General Luo, you don't have to bow.

174
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,930
Although I'm a few years older than you,

175
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,570
the scene of when King of Yan and the queen consort

176
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,290
sent you to Qionghua

177
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,140
is still vivid in my mind.

178
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,050
It's been so long since I saw you.

179
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:03,970
You are already...

180
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:04,900
I don't remember

181
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,540
anything from my childhood.

182
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,820
I hope you can stop mentioning it

183
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,660
and stop addressing me as Your Highness.

184
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,420
Yes.

185
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,080
But there is something

186
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,870
I must report to Your Highness.

187
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:25,860
No.

188
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:27,940
Mr. Ziying.

189
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:31,740
Unfortunately, King of Yan and the queen consort fell ill.

190
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,870
So, six years ago...

191
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,130
they've already passed away.

192
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,230
Were they in peace when they passed away?

193
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,290
Before King of Yan and the queen consort passed away,

194
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:55,150
they were most worried about you.

195
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,080
I have buried them

196
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,190
with the little princess.

197
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,410
What is a little princess?

198
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,150
Don't ask so many questions now.

199
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,330
There's one more thing I don't understand.

200
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,460
Even if you are an envoy of both states,

201
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,430
why are you staying in Chenzhou?

202
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,650
To be honest,

203
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,730
King of Yan and the queen consort missed you very much

204
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,100
when they were alive,

205
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,670
but they didn't ask me to look for you.

206
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,880
But half a month ago,

207
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,380
I received an anonymous message

208
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,800
that asked me to wait for you here.

209
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,130
I didn't expect you to come to me in person.

210
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,870
The predictions of the person who left the message are so accurate.

211
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,230
Could it have been the demon who's causing chaos?

212
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:43,980
Chenzhou is the hub between the two states.

213
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,570
I know that Yan State has spies

214
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,100
in Chenzhou all year round.

215
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,780
I have something to show you.

216
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,660
I wonder if you can recognize it.

217
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,220
Okay.

218
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:09,170
I did hear from Chenzhou's subordinates

219
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,060
that a monster in a red robe

220
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,270
is hurting the cultivators with sugar pellets.

221
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,750
I immediately thought of your safety.

222
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,260
So I asked the spies and subordinates to keep a lookout for him.

223
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,530
Have you found his whereabouts?

224
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,710
Not yet.

225
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,780
But it's not a difficult matter.

226
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,150
The spies and subordinates of Yan State

227
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,760
are all over Chenzhou.

228
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,550
I'll order them right away.

229
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,280
I'll report back to you before noon tomorrow.

230
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,230
Thank you, General.

231
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,060
Then I'll take my leave.

232
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:43,820
Uncle Ziying.

233
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,380
You are actually the king's son?

234
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,490
To me, my past

235
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,740
is like someone else's story.

236
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,270
It no longer has anything to do with me.

237
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,180
Go tell Huaixin

238
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,740
that Qionghua's disciples should cooperate with the investigation.

239
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,290
Okay.

240
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,460
Then,

241
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,740
what is the little princess he just mentioned?

242
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,570
You have so many questions.

243
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:10,250
Let’s go.

244
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:23,000
General Luo said he would tell us

245
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,590
the demon's whereabouts before noon tomorrow.

246
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:28,000
Have you gotten the hang of the Four-Direction Consolidation?

247
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,880
Yes, I have.

248
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,810
I just don't know if Lingsha's making progress.

249
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,940
I've mastered it even better than you.

250
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:35,340
That's good.

251
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,820
With the Four-Direction Consolidation,

252
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,010
we can resist

253
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:40,140
a hidden weapon like the sugar pellet.

254
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:41,740
Uncle.

255
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,510
You are all here.

256
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,020
If General Luo locates the demon tomorrow,

257
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:51,380
you must guard against his hidden weapon while you catch him.

258
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,780
Don't worry, Uncle Ziying.

259
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,440
We were just talking about it.

260
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,720
Lingsha, Mengli, and I

261
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,880
have mastered the Four-Direction Consolidation.

262
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:02,960
You've mastered it... so quickly?

263
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,930
Master Su Shen was originally from the Heart Division.

264
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,660
So I led Tianhe and Lingsha

265
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:11,490
to cultivate the Heart Division's Four-Direction Consolidation.

266
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:12,940
I see.

267
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:13,660
Uncle.

268
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:16,180
You were also Master Su Shen’s disciple.

269
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,170
Then you should be the most proficient in

270
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,570
the Four-Direction Consolidation.

271
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:19,740
We're going to fight the demon tomorrow.

272
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,270
How about

273
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,540
you give us some pointers?

274
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,050
No need.

275
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,570
Since you've already mastered the Four-Direction Consolidation,

276
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,100
you don't need my guidance.

277
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:28,260
Rest early.

278
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,380
What's wrong with Uncle Ziying?

279
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,050
This sword technique doesn't seem that impressive.

280
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,270
What's the use of learning it?

281
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,110
You brat.

282
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,520
Let me tell you.

283
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,260
Only by mastering this sword technique

284
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,700
can you protect yourself

285
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,180
and the people around you.

286
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,610
Is there someone in your heart whom you want to protect?

287
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,410
I want to protect you, my master.

288
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,170
Good.

289
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,660
Think about the person you want to protect.

290
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,570
You’ll gradually learn it.

291
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:53,780
General Luo.

292
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:54,940
Have you found

293
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,470
the monster in the red robe?

294
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:57,290
Yes.

295
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:58,590
Once I got the news,

296
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,590
I came to report to His Highness immediately.

297
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,200
No.

298
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,320
I meant Mr. Ziying.

299
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,680
General Luo, please wait.

300
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,810
Senior Huaixin has gone to find Uncle.

301
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:06,500
Okay.

302
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,230
I didn't expect there'd be a day when Uncle would oversleep.

303
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:14,380
What's there to tease about when this is the first time he has overslept?

304
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:15,880
How is it?

305
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:16,670
General Luo.

306
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,840
I’ve found where he's staying at.

307
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,580
He's staying

308
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:28,140
in this room of Qunying Inn.

309
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,500
I have already asked the innkeeper

310
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,340
to secretly get the other guests to leave.

311
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,470
If he runs away, are there other exits?

312
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,060
I've arranged

313
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,500
my men to guard these two exits.

314
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:38,950
Okay.

315
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,960
I'll inform the other disciples right away.

316
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,890
Send the disciples of the Heart Division there.

317
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,730
This demon's spell can only be broken by the Four-Direction Consolidation.

318
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:46,160
Yes.

319
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,270
The four of us all know the Four-Direction Consolidation.

320
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,010
Then we can

321
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,160
block the two exits.

322
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,080
What's wrong, Uncle Ziying?

323
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,230
What's the problem?

324
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:00,770
Nothing.

325
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,230
General, you don't know magic.

326
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:05,830
Once the battle breaks out, be sure to avoid it.

327
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:06,980
I understand.

328
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:09,860
Tianhe and Lingsha will attack from the front door.

329
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,990
Uncle Ziying and I will intercept him at the rear window.

330
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,560
You darn demon, is it fun?

331
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,130
Let's play together.

332
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,580
He walked into our trap on his own accord.

333
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:04,800
Demon!

334
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,080
You cursed the cultivators.

335
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,290
Surrender now!

336
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,930
Who are you? I'm scared.

337
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,530
Don't be afraid.

338
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,250
Sorry, Mengli.

339
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:56,540
She...

340
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,280
She is Mengli?

341
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,730
Wait, doesn't Mengli know the Four-Direction Consolidation?

342
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:03,330
How could she be attacked by the hidden weapon?

343
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,310
It's all my fault.

344
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,260
It's not my big brother's fault.

345
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,990
He was the one who protected me.

346
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:32,220
You used to take care of me.

347
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,930
Now it's my turn to take care of you.

348
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:34,930
Give me your hand.

349
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,570
-Little Mengli.
-That hand.

350
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,910
Don't you recognize me?

351
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,760
I'm Tianhe.

352
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:45,900
What about me?

353
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,120
Do you remember me?

354
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,820
You just turned into a child now.

355
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,150
We all used to be adults.

356
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,680
We used to be close.

357
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,360
I don't remember the past.

358
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,560
But we can still be close now.

359
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,460
Mengli.

360
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,860
Whether you're a child or an adult,

361
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,190
you are always so sweet.

362
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,380
Unlike that Mingguang who is so immature.

363
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,380
What about the big brother who protected me?

364
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,520
Why isn't he here?

365
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,900
Are you talking about Uncle Ziying?

366
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,460
He's in the next room.

367
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,590
I'll take you to him.

368
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:20,530
Uncle Ziying?

369
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,030
Why didn't you come in when you're at the door?

370
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,940
Little Mengli just said she wanted to see you.

371
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,300
Come in, Big Brother.

372
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:27,930
I have something to tell you.

373
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:38,850
I'm sorry.

374
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:40,990
It's my fault.

375
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:43,660
What I want to tell you is

376
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,340
to stop saying sorry all the time.

377
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,550
I saw you trying to protect me.

378
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:48,910
Little Mengli.

379
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,560
You were the one who protected me,

380
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,220
instead of me protecting you.

381
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,500
Big Brother.

382
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:58,130
You have too many things weighing on your mind.

383
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:14,250
Can you...

384
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:18,170
call me Big Brother again?

385
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:21,320
You're my big brother.

386
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,220
I can call you that as many times as you want.

387
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,130
Big Brother! Big Brother! Big Brother!

388
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:29,640
Brother!

389
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,540
From the moment I met you,

390
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,620
you have had only a few expressions.

391
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,080
A cold expression,

392
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:00,660
a frown,

393
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,300
a smile where the corners of your mouth are barely lifted,

394
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,870
and an angry expression.

395
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,180
But it feels like you have various expressions of sadness

396
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,590
on your face today.

397
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,380
Are you hiding a lot of things in your heart?

398
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,130
According to Rule No. 420 of Qionghua Sect,

399
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:18,580
we shouldn't attack someone when they're unprepared, talk about others' private matter,

400
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,060
or discuss others' right and wrong.

401
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:20,940
This again?

402
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,350
But you lied to me.

403
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,940
You should explain to me.

404
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,210
You told me

405
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,500
that when you went home to visit your parents,

406
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,230
they were already dead.

407
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,140
But according to what General Luo said,

408
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,340
your parents passed away six years ago.

409
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,310
Besides, you don't lie easily.

410
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:39,490
Do you have any unspeakable troubles in your heart?

411
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:42,340
I...

412
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:45,180
I just think you seem so sad.

413
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:47,370
Little Ziying.

414
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,300
You haven't become an immortal yet.

415
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,260
You are an ordinary person

416
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,460
just like me.

417
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:54,950
If you keep all the pain in your heart,

418
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,710
then... your heart...

419
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,770
It is just this big.

420
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:00,930
How can it bear so much pain?

421
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,240
How about this?

422
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,380
Give me some.

423
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,380
I'm not even afraid of death.

424
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,920
Naturally, my heart is bigger than yours.

425
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,470
All these years, I've never went back home.

426
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,100
It's not because I didn't miss them,

427
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,230
but because I didn't dare to face them.

428
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:20,350
When I was at the age of Little Mengli,

429
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:25,580
I started learning the Four-Direction Consolidation from Master Su Shen.

430
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,420
Master said

431
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,590
I only need to think of the person I want to protect

432
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,590
and I'll learn it.

433
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,230
But I couldn't learn it no matter what.

434
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,000
Maybe...

435
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:38,420
it's really like what Little Mengli said,

436
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:40,110
that you're thinking too much.

437
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,250
When Little Mengli called you Big Brother just now,

438
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,580
your eyes turned red.

439
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,500
Could it be that

440
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:49,100
the little princess buried with your parents

441
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,470
is your sister?

442
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,520
Brother! Brother!

443
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,340
That butterfly is so pretty.

444
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,220
But I can't catch it.

445
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,130
Come here.

446
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:07,570
Hold this for me.

447
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:09,430
I'll catch the butterfly for you.

448
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:17,630
Brother!

449
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,560
Don't talk.

450
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,740
Sister, I caught the butterfly!

451
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:36,660
Sister!

452
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,460
Sister!

453
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:43,340
Sister!

454
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:58,860
Since then,

455
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:02,640
my mother had been sick for many years.

456
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,520
I was also depressed because I didn't

457
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,110
protect my sister well.

458
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,780
I knew my existence

459
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:12,060
would remind my parents of my sister

460
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,450
and make them relive their suffering.

461
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:14,140
So...

462
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:17,190
I left for Qionghua early.

463
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,200
I thought

464
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:22,580
that being with each other is not as good as reminiscing.

465
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,440
I didn't expect

466
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,060
that my farewell

467
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,900
would be forever.

468
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:31,880
Ziying.

469
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,920
I've lost more family members than you.

470
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,960
But I have a way to alleviate my pain.

471
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,140
I put all the words I want to say

472
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:46,210
in the talisman,

473
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,620
and then let it fly.

474
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,170
Then I'll feel much better.

475
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,550
Try it.

476
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:53,980
Try it.

477
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,730
Father. Mother.

478
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,380
Sister.

479
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,140
I really miss you.

480
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,600
How is it?

481
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:51,660
Do you feel better after flying it?

482
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,000
Now that it's over, don't think about it anymore.

483
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,320
Thank you, Lingsha.

484
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,600
Look.

485
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,650
You're not sad anymore.

486
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:59,130
You look better when you smile.

487
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,390
How about another one?

488
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,940
I'll fly another one too.

489
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,220
Uncle Ziying. Lingsha.

490
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,420
Who are you flying talismans for?

491
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:21,660
We're just doing it for fun.

492
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:24,590
I'm going back to rest.

493
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:27,590
We need to discuss about finding the demon tomorrow.

494
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,240
Don't stay up too late.

495
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,810
We shouldn't stay up too late.

496
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:42,840
Lingsha.

497
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,740
Who flies talismans for fun?

498
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,900
I clearly saw you two

499
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,270
talking here.

500
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,700
Is something wrong?

501
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,660
You've been asking too many questions these days.

502
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:57,060
But I can't answer every question of yours.

503
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:57,840
Besides,

504
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:00,010
this is Ziying's secret.

505
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,830
It's like I'm keeping something for Ziying.

506
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,380
I shouldn't give it to you, right?

507
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:05,860
Wait.

508
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:08,750
You're keeping Ziying's secret for him,

509
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:10,220
but I don't know about it.

510
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,680
Then aren't I an outsider?

511
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,400
You're being unreasonable.

512
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,340
Whatever.

513
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,310
I'm going to find Mengli.

514
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,020
Rest early.

515
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:42,840
Junior.

516
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:45,460
What's wrong?

517
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,110
She...

518
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,840
Forget it. It's nothing.

519
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,260
General Luo and I searched all over for traces of that demon

520
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,300
but found nothing.

521
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,820
We need to discuss with Uncle

522
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,080
and see what to do next.

523
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,960
I'll leave it to you guys then.

524
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,200
Where are you going?

525
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:02,730
This is my secret.

526
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,460
How can I tell you?

527
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:10,710
[Jixian Garden]

528
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,650
When Lingsha was sad,

529
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,810
she also drank here.

530
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,860
I'm not feeling good, so I can drink too.

531
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,410
Next time, you must try Chenzhou's tofu.

532
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:27,250
It's a delicacy of Chenzhou.

533
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:27,740
Okay.

534
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:28,820
Thank you, boss.

535
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,660
Aren't you the man who was

536
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:33,550
acquainted with General Luo last time?

537
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:34,150
Sir.

538
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,940
Please take a seat.

539
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:39,310
I will bring you the best wine right away.

540
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:42,760
Forget it.

541
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:45,280
Lingsha will be mad if she finds out.

542
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,340
I shouldn't drink.

543
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:52,180
You obviously want to drink,

544
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:54,240
but you're hindered by your worries.

545
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:55,830
Why torture yourself?

546
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,930
This jar of wine is on me.

547
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:01,090
As the saying goes, drinking can drown one's sorrows.

548
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,100
You're right.

549
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,930
Some drink to drown their sorrows,

550
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:28,380
some drink to boost their mood,

551
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,910
and some drink to escape.

552
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,130
Bro.

553
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,060
You look angry.

554
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,230
Are you trying to get drunk so you can be crazy?

555
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,240
You can tell?

556
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,930
My master wouldn't be so obvious.

557
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,590
He always has a poker face.

558
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,230
But I can't do it.

559
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,490
Your master looks calm,

560
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,090
but he's full of worries inside.

561
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,630
You can even guess this when you haven't seen him?

562
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,770
Could you be the half-immortal fortune teller

563
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:05,440
whom Lingsha mentioned?

564
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:09,420
I've just been through a lot,

565
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,190
so I can see through people better than you.

566
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:17,570
Uncle.

567
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:20,100
How is it?

568
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,620
General Luo and I

569
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,700
have searched the entire Chenzhou,

570
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,180
but we didn't find any trace of that demon.

571
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,110
He's not a demon.

572
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,450
He's a dummy created by the Illusion Puppet technique.

573
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:29,650
We must find the person who created him.

574
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,720
Lingsha, go get Tianhe.

575
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,030
Let's discuss it together.

576
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,230
I saw Tianhe just now.

577
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:36,580
Did anyone piss him off?

578
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,360
He left angrily.

579
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,780
He left?

580
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,420
Where did he go?

581
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,340
I don't know.

582
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,250
He said that was his secret.

583
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:45,420
Secret?

584
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,380
Darn you, Yun Tianhe.

585
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:51,080
You've learned to be petty.

586
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,180
Uncle.

587
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,660
You don't have to worry or bother about him.

588
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,660
He will come back.

589
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,210
Half-Immortal Sister.

590
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,500
Here's the thing.

591
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:07,140
I have a...

592
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,740
very important friend.

593
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,310
Her name is Lingsha.

594
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:13,360
We share near-death experiences

595
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,420
and face hardships together.

596
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,980
We shouldn't hide anything from each other.

597
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,400
But now,

598
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:21,130
she has someone else's secret in her heart.

599
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:21,930
Someone else?

600
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,220
Actually he's not just someone else.

601
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:29,810
He's our master!

602
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,240
Let me ask you first.

603
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:35,020
What kind of person do you think your master is?

604
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,420
My master?

605
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:41,460
My master is an extremely good person.

606
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,120
He's about the same age as us,

607
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,160
but his swordsmanship is superb.

608
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,440
Every time we encountered difficulties,

609
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,800
he always shielded me

610
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,100
like an older brother.

611
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,430
I've never seen him timid

612
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,410
or weak.

613
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,220
But after we arrived in Chenzhou,

614
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,930
I've always been sensing that he is troubled

615
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:02,590
like there's a huge stone weighing on his heart.

616
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,180
He has his own secret,

617
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,620
but he didn't tell me about it.

618
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,020
He told Lingsha instead.

619
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:07,940
I'm just like an outsider

620
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,100
in front of them!

621
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:12,140
Let me tell you.

622
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:14,010
There are two kinds of secrets.

623
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:16,600
One is about shameful things

624
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:19,820
and the other is about unspeakable pain.

625
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:22,000
Based on your master's nature,

626
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,700
it should be the second type.

627
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,950
He doesn't want you to be burdened

628
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,210
by his pain.

629
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,220
But he could tell Lingsha?

630
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:32,340
I'm a man after all.

631
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,420
I think I can bear it.

632
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,280
Yun Tianhe.

633
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,800
Sometimes, there are some things

634
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,600
that can't...

635
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,570
You're not a half-immortal.

636
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:43,100
You're an immortal, right?

637
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:44,620
You could even figure out

638
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,540
my name?

639
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,700
I've read countless men.

640
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,500
But it's rare for someone to be

641
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,680
as innocent as you.

642
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:56,400
Actually,

643
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:59,120
your frustration doesn't stem from the secret,

644
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,600
but from jealousy.

645
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,020
Not only are you jealous that Ziying

646
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,900
could tell Lingsha what's on his mind,

647
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,690
but you are also jealous that Lingsha

648
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,510
can actually keep another man's secrets in her heart,

649
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,110
right?

650
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:16,450
You...

651
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:19,810
You make it sound like I'm in the wrong.

652
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:23,080
But I also think I'm right.

653
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,090
Listen.

654
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:30,900
There are only a few kinds of relationships between people.

655
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,460
Kinship,

656
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,120
friendship,

657
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,130
and love between lovers.

658
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,260
You haven't figured out what relationship

659
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,490
you two have,

660
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,940
and you're already greedy and jealous.

661
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,670
It's like sprinkling salt

662
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,120
in this cup of wine;

663
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,240
it would be wasted.

664
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:58,340
Thank you, Half-Immortal Sister.

665
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:03,610
I feel more clear-minded now.

666
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,360
If one hasn't personally experienced the pain of separation,

667
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,760
one wouldn't believe in infinite longing.

668
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:12,540
One should be carefree as long as one can.

669
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:15,060
Yes.

670
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:17,720
I'll be carefree as long as I can.

671
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,200
Let's drink.

672
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:19,660
Here.

673
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:44,600
Miss.

674
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:47,710
You really look like Lingsha.

675
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:50,230
What are you on about?

676
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:51,220
I'm Lingsha.

677
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,950
Now you've even learned to sneak out to drink.

678
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:55,730
You...

679
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,180
Your face is red.

680
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:03,610
I didn't sneak out to drink.

681
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,180
I came out openly.

682
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:09,590
Since you can drink when you're unhappy,

683
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,659
I can drink when I'm unhappy too.

684
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,820
Why are you so petty when you're an adult man?

685
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,010
Who is petty?

686
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:16,420
You...

687
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,650
Let me tell you.

688
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,670
After that half-immortal sister just now

689
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:21,469
talked to me,

690
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,900
I've gotten rid of the huge stone on my heart.

691
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:27,260
Half-immortal?

692
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:29,600
You're even calling her a sister?

693
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:33,500
That half-immortal sister's predictions were so accurate.

694
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,290
I didn't drink ten jars of wine for nothing.

695
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,870
Half-Immortal Sister?

696
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:41,010
Ten jars of wine?

697
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:46,420
I have a huge stone weighing on my heart now.

698
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,389
L-Lingsha, what's wrong with you?

699
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:50,370
I know.

700
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,179
You're jealous.

701
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:52,929
You...

702
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,590
learned fortune-telling?

703
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,260
Are you jealous

704
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,060
that I drank ten jars of wine

705
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,260
without telling you?

706
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:07,060
Well,

707
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:08,380
do you think

708
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:11,390
that half-immortal sister is pretty?

709
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,510
She...

710
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:19,480
I didn't think so when I was sober.

711
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,220
After drinking...

712
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,680
She's pretty.

713
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,560
I think you're completely drunk.

714
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,590
Hurry and move along.

715
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:36,390
Uncle Ziying is waiting for you to discuss about fighting the demon.

716
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,280
I remember now.

717
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,500
That half-immortal sister was even able to tell

718
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,980
where the demon that turned Mengli into a child

719
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:43,610
is at.

720
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:49,050
[Jixian Garden]

721
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:55,860
After drinking so many bowls,

722
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,190
you should be sober now.

723
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,160
Yes.

724
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,870
Then hurry and tell Ziying

725
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,180
what that half-immortal told you.

726
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:10,710
Ziying.

727
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,930
That half-immortal sister said

728
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:16,320
if one hasn't personally experienced the pain of separation,

729
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,730
one wouldn't believe in infinite longing.

730
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:21,340
One should be carefree as long as one can.

731
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:23,140
Who asked you to talk about that?

732
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,470
Tell him where the demon in the red robe is.

733
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,740
That half-immortal sister said

734
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,100
the demon in the red robe

735
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,410
will go to the forest outside the east of the city

736
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,580
every fifth of the month at 11 a.m.

737
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,820
The forest outside the east of the city?

738
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,690
Why would he go there?

739
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,170
Half-Immortal Sister.

740
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,410
Since your psychic powers are this great,

741
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:49,910
why don't you help me see

742
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,340
where of the city is the demon

743
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,460
in the red robe at?

744
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,540
I got it.

745
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:03,740
Where is he?

746
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,900
Do you really trust me?

747
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,340
Yes.

748
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:13,520
He's sunbathing in the forest outside the east of the city.

749
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,100
Believe it or not, it's up to you.

750
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:22,260
-Sunbathing?
-Sunbathing?
-Sunbathing?

751
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,060
Senior Huaixin.

752
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:27,900
Keep giving him more water.

753
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:28,210
Okay.

754
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:29,610
I think he's still drunk.

755
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,320
I can't drink anymore.

756
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:31,840
Wait.

757
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:34,250
I'm not lying!

758
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:35,720
What half-immortal sister?

759
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,250
I think she just wanted to trick you into buying her drinks.

760
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:38,460
Tomorrow is the fifth of the month.

761
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,900
General Luo and the prefectural governor's men will be searching throughout the city.

762
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,990
How could he audaciously

763
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:43,320
sunbathe in the forest?

764
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,730
Anyway, she told me repeatedly.

765
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,050
I believe her.

766
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:49,460
Uncle.

767
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:50,650
Do you believe it?

768
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,740
I don't believe it.

769
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,340
If we go there with great fanfare

770
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:55,820
and

771
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:56,980
end up with nothing,

772
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:59,520
the reputation of Jixian Garden will be ruined.

773
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,510
Just take it as drunken talk.

774
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:06,930
Believe it or not, it's up to you.

775
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:09,820
I'll go by myself tomorrow anyway.

776
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,890
Big Brother, I want to go with Tianhe.

777
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:16,020
Why do you want to go?

778
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,850
Shouldn't good friends trust each other?

779
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:20,440
If he goes alone,

780
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:21,440
he'll be lonely.

781
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:23,520
Little...

782
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:25,900
Little Mengli.

783
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,340
I knew

784
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,860
that regardless if you're Little Mengli or the adult Mengli,

785
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,180
you would believe me.

786
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,700
Little Mengli, don't be afraid.

787
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,020
I will protect you.

788
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:06,090
When we catch that demon,

789
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:08,220
you can return to your original form.

790
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,710
Let's wait a little more.

791
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,660
I know what you're thinking.

792
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,880
Even if Uncle Ziying and Lingsha won't go,

793
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,930
I won't be angry.

794
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,870
At worst, there are no demons in the forest.

795
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:21,600
I'll be embarrassed by myself.

796
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,190
Wait!

797
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,030
We'll catch the demon together...

798
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,370
or we'll be embarrassed together.

799
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,290
Lingsha.

800
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,730
I'm very happy

801
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:37,260
that you believe me.

802
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,180
I am...

803
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:42,060
just worried about Little Mengli.

804
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:45,160
What about Big Brother?

805
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,430
Let's not let him go.

806
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,900
If there really is a demon,

807
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,650
it'll be dangerous for him.

808
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,380
Dangerous?

809
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:52,830
Why?

810
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,870
I... I just think

811
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,100
that if he fails,

812
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,540
his reputation will be ruined.

813
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,720
Let's go then.

814
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:05,100
Let's go.

815
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:17,250
[Jixian Garden]

816
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:16,930
Uncle Ziying?

817
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:18,440
Big Brother.

818
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,390
I knew you would come with us.

819
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:22,070
Uncle Ziying.

820
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:23,980
Are you here to stop us

821
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,380
or to go with us?

822
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,520
No matter what happens,

823
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,060
we should be together.

824
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:31,810
It's almost noon.

825
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:32,870
Let's hurry and go.

826
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:34,220
Okay.

827
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,100
Do you sense a murderous aura?

828
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:50,910
No.

829
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:55,240
But I don't think Half-Immortal Sister would have lied to us.

830
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,380
Big Brother, look.

831
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:06,790
Master!

832
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,110
Master!

833
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:17,360
If you have a grudge against me,

834
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,160
just hurt me and let my master go.

835
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,630
Little Mengli!

836
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:43,480
Sister Shen?

837
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:45,710
So you are controlling that dummy?

838
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:52,810
Master.

839
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,040
You saved me.

840
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:55,180
Mengli.

841
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:56,730
I was using you.

842
00:41:58,050 --> 00:41:59,170
Half-Immortal Sister.

843
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:00,980
Why did you use that dummy

844
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:02,650
to hurt your disciple?

845
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:04,550
I did it for Ziying.

846
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,400
Ziying.

847
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,000
You've finally learned the Four-Direction Consolidation.

848
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,330
It's worth my effort

849
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:15,310
setting this up.

850
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,200
Little Mengli.

851
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,650
Your character and spiritual cultivation have lived up to my expectations.

852
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:34,840
But I didn't expect

853
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:37,220
you to become Ziying's disciple.

854
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:40,480
Maybe this is fate.

855
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:44,260
Master, you turned Mengli into a little girl

856
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,010
and it reminded me of my little sister.

857
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:49,010
Saving Little Mengli was like saving my sister again.

858
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:52,480
Thank you for helping me loosen my emotional knot.

859
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:55,340
I set this up not only for Ziying,

860
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:57,570
but also as a trial for you all.

861
00:42:59,090 --> 00:42:59,860
All these years,

862
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,860
I've been watching Qionghua and all of you

863
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:02,740
the whole time.

864
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,240
When I got the news that

865
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:05,940
Senior Su Yao wanted to send you down the mountain

866
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,380
to look for the cold weapons,

867
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:08,840
I came up with this method.

868
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:11,450
Not only can I help Ziying loosen his emotional knot

869
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:12,980
and learn the Four-Direction Consolidation,

870
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:14,910
but I can also test if the four of you

871
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:16,820
are mentally connected.

872
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,960
When you appeared in the forest,

873
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,880
I finally felt relieved.

874
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:24,700
Master.

875
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:28,050
The Suoluo Fruit, one of the three cold weapons, is already at Qionghua.

876
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:31,210
Do you know where the Guangji Cold Painting and the Kun Scale are?

877
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:33,170
On the map of my family's treasure hunting journal,

878
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:35,840
it says the Guangji Cold Painting is by the sea.

879
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:37,620
Do you know which sea it is by?

880
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:38,620
My master Zong Lian

881
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:40,650
once asked me to look for the Guangji Cold Painting,

882
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:42,320
but I only found out that a century ago,

883
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,290
the scene of stars descending to the mortal world and the Milky Way hanging upside down

884
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:46,660
appeared at Jimo Beach.

885
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:47,530
Jimo?

886
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:48,460
Okay.

887
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,650
We'll depart for Jimo Beach tomorrow.

888
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:52,720
Okay.

889
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:55,580
Since you are leaving tomorrow,

890
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:58,490
why don't you drink with me today?

891
00:43:58,970 --> 00:43:59,660
Sure.

892
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:03,020
Here.

893
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:03,600
Here.

894
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:12,500
Master.

895
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:14,190
How did you come up with

896
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:15,610
the idea of using a dummy?

897
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:17,470
A few months ago,

898
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,870
I saw a kind demon saving an evil man.

899
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:20,660
But that evil man

900
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:22,950
was ungrateful and killed this kind demon.

901
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:24,680
At that time, I felt very upset.

902
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:26,760
So I used the dummy-creation technique

903
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,490
to infuse this kind demon's spirit into the dummy

904
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,560
and even gave him a handsome face.

905
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,340
I named him Leng Yi.

906
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:35,840
All right.

907
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:38,690
You're leaving for Jimo Beach tomorrow.

908
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:40,100
Go back and have a good rest,

909
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:40,630
okay?

910
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:41,170
Okay.

911
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,790
We'll get going, Sister Shen.

912
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:43,260
Okay.

913
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,910
Sister Shen, take care.

914
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:46,460
Okay.

915
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:58,430
Well,

916
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:00,470
you don't have to stay so far away from me.

917
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:02,400
Grandmaster gave me the spiritual pill to protect me.

918
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,810
So I'm very warm now.

919
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:09,950
It's okay.

920
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:13,500
I think

921
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,510
Sister Shen is the most magnificent woman

922
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:17,430
I’ve ever seen.

923
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:19,710
She can see through the mortal world

924
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:21,110
and live a carefree life.

925
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,230
She can even create a handsome man who is loyal to her

926
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:24,190
for herself.

927
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:25,580
She's so impressive.

928
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:26,680
Lingsha.

929
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:28,860
You must really want to learn the dummy-creation technique

930
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,130
and create a person now.

931
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:30,860
Little Mengli.

932
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:32,320
Why are you teasing me now?

933
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,850
If I learn the dummy-creation technique,

934
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:36,710
I'll make you a big brother first.

935
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:41,290
Thank you, Mengli.

936
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:44,630
Why are you thanking me?

937
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:46,420
When you turned into a child,

938
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:48,850
you kept calling Ziying Big Brother.

939
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:50,980
So he regarded you like his own sister.

940
00:45:58,530 --> 00:45:59,730
So this was the secret

941
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:02,900
Lingsha was keeping for you?

942
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:04,710
It's not a secret anymore.

943
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:07,300
It feels so good to let go

944
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:09,080
of the past.

945
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:15,380
Lingsha. Uncle Ziying.

946
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,480
I want to apologize to you.

947
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:20,950
I promise

948
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,720
no matter what you say to her

949
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,470
or how much you talk to her,

950
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:26,870
I won't be jealous of you.

951
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:29,700
Tianhe.

952
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:31,420
You even get jealous

953
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,480
when Big Brother and Lingsha talk?

954
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:36,790
Tianhe, listen up.

955
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:38,650
Now that we've been through this,

956
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:40,250
Ziying is our older brother.

957
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,720
There can't be suspicion among siblings,

958
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:43,850
let alone jealousy.

959
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:45,560
Am I right, Big Brother?

960
00:46:57,170 --> 00:46:57,760
Uncle.

961
00:46:58,050 --> 00:47:00,660
Why don't I see Huaixin and Senior Mingguang around?

962
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:01,740
The antidote given by Master

963
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:03,470
has lifted Mingguang's curse.

964
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:05,430
He has returned to Qionghua with Huaixin

965
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:07,560
to meet Grandmaster and plead guilty.

966
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:12,690
We'll ride on our swords to Jimo Beach first thing in the morning tomorrow.

967
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:14,290
You've all never been there.

968
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:17,920
You must be cautious when you encounter someone or something.

969
00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:20,940
Then I'll be able to see the sea tomorrow?

970
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:25,380
That's great!
