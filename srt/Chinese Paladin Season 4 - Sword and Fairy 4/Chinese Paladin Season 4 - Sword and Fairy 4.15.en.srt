[Episode 15]

4
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,830
What did you put in?

5
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:42,720
Try it.

6
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:46,229
Here.

7
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,520
Here.

8
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,680
It should be good.

9
00:01:57,509 --> 00:01:58,190
Lingsha.

10
00:01:58,490 --> 00:01:59,550
It's so delicious!

11
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:00,870
You don't know.

12
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,820
I've been eating vegetarian food in Qionghua these days.

13
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,170
I almost became a sheep.

14
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,010
You're quite supportive.

15
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,889
I've been studying medicinal soup for decades.

16
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,230
I always pinched my nose when I drank it.

17
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,430
It turns out that medicinal soup can be so delicious.

18
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,070
Elder Qingyang, you know

19
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,190
that medicinal soup

20
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,390
should have both delicious taste and pharmacological effects.

21
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,550
What you made...

22
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:22,870
You put diverse things in it.

23
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:23,750
You know what?

24
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,350
Our Lingsha is the heroine

25
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,950
with the best cooking skills in Martial World.

26
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,790
You can make all kinds of medicinal soup?

27
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:30,750
Of course.

28
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,750
You're an elder in Qionghua.

29
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,430
But I'm an expert

30
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,950
at making all kinds noodles, snacks,

31
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,079
and medicinal soup.

32
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,030
Little Master Lingsha.

33
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,800
Please teach me.

34
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,120
-Don't do that.
-I'm begging you.

35
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,390
You made me feel so guilty.

36
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,250
What if others see it? Don't do it.

37
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,600
If you don't teach me how to make medicinal soup,

38
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,100
when Old Chongguang comes back

39
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:50,860
and sees me kneeling here,

40
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,520
you two will be in big trouble.

41
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,630
-Listen.
-It's none of my business.

42
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,510
Elder Qingyang.

43
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,910
Well... Get up first.

44
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:58,990
-Get up.
-Get up.

45
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,330
Get up. Get up. Get up.

46
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,660
Sit down.

47
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:04,450
Actually, I can not only teach you how to make it

48
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,830
but also come here to cook for you from time to time.

49
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,600
But there's a condition.

50
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:09,870
Say it.

51
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:11,840
Tell Tianhe

52
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,580
what you know about his father.

53
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,990
I can make many kinds of medicinal soup.

54
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,980
Think about it.

55
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,990
I'll come back when you're done.

56
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,400
Let's go, Tianhe.

57
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,710
Little Master. Little Master. Little Master.

58
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,070
Please sit down.

59
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,320
For medicinal soup,

60
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,750
I'll think about it.

61
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,510
Think about it.

62
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,290
Back then, in terms of seniority,

63
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,990
your father had to call me Uncle.

64
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,190
I was young back then.

65
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,820
I was so handsome.

66
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,880
Your father and I had a lot in common

67
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,920
and became very good friends soon.

68
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,670
My father was your good friend?

69
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:05,990
Of course.

70
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,890
Uncle Ziying once said

71
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,710
the elders and the sect leaders of Qionghua

72
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,550
all fought in the war 19 years ago.

73
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,410
Then you must know what happened.

74
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,250
Not only that.

75
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,480
It's like it was yesterday.

76
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,150
The blades flashed at that time.

77
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:28,990
I passed out.

78
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,550
When I woke up, there was blood everywhere.

79
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,880
I didn't know anything.

80
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,870
Then I want to ask you

81
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,830
why you and my father were good friends

82
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,110
while that Chongguang

83
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,440
hated my father so much.

84
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,790
Old Chongguang only does one thing in his life.

85
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,790
Cultivation.

86
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:50,350
He didn't know your father.

87
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:53,350
In the Qionghua Sect, the one who knew your father best

88
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:54,880
wasn't me.

89
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,909
It was your father's senior.

90
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,020
His name is Xuan...

91
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,270
Xuan...

92
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:01,380
Xuan...

93
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,370
I have a headache again.

94
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,110
Please don't force me.

95
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,830
Just thinking about what happened 19 years ago

96
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,750
gives me a splitting headache.

97
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,350
It's okay. Anyway,

98
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,880
I know you were my father's good friend.

99
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,130
I feel good.

100
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,960
When you don't have a headache

101
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:23,550
and

102
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,280
remember something next time,

103
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:28,030
I'll teach you how to make delicious

104
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,990
A Hundred Treasure Medicinal Soup

105
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,800
which can truly improve qi.

106
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,440
Is it delicious?

107
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,900
Yes, it is. It's very delicious.

108
00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:40,310
Little Master. Little Master. Little Master.

109
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:43,270
For the medicinal soup you mentioned,

110
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,650
I'll think again.

111
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,690
You can remember something again?

112
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,860
Think hard.

113
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,190
You can remember something again.

114
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:52,790
Right.

115
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,310
If you want to know what happened 19 years ago,

116
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,230
you can go

117
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:59,680
and find it in the books in Qionghua's Yunjing Pavilion.

118
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,220
Library Pavilion?

119
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,220
Yunjing Pavilion.

120
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,550
Library Pavilion.

121
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,720
Yunjing Pavilion.

122
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,980
It's where the books are placed.

123
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:09,490
Kid.

124
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,430
I have to find it from books?

125
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:14,460
Look.

126
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,630
When I stop thinking about the past,

127
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,430
my headache is cured right away.

128
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,790
Look at the medicinal soup.

129
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,820
I finally found the second volume.

130
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,600
Really? I've also been looking for it for a long time.

131
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,830
Let's exchange our books later.

132
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,830
Yes. Many things are recorded in it.

133
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,840
Why are there so many books here?

134
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,620
How long do we have to read?

135
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,550
Senior Xuanye.

136
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,490
Senior, you're here to read too?

137
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,290
The history of the first generation and the history of the second generation.

138
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,909
How many generations do they have?

139
00:06:56,909 --> 00:06:57,670
I read fast.

140
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,630
I'll start with the history of the first generation.

141
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,040
You can read other things first.

142
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,600
Okay.

143
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,910
Why did Senior Xuanye read this?

144
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,470
Xuan Zhen was the first disciple of Tai Qing.

145
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:31,560
He took the disciples to attack Demon Realm during the demonic rebellion.

146
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,290
He was betrayed by Yun Tianqing

147
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:35,060
and died in Demon Region.

148
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:41,120
Xuan Zhen's wife died in childbirth after giving birth to a daughter

149
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,470
on the eve of the war.

150
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,750
The baby girl was entrusted to a disciple named Jingci.

151
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:49,550
During the war, in order to protect the baby girl, Jingci was killed.

152
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,680
The baby girl lost her soul.

153
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:54,040
The evil disciple abducted the daughter.

154
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,040
But 19 years ago,

155
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,400
Master and Mrs. Su Yu brought a baby.

156
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:03,270
Get Princess Jade. Hurry up.

157
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,360
The baby girl lost her soul?

158
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,040
Why didn't they let her take it off?

159
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,520
Could it be...

160
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,430
Lingsha.

161
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,300
What's wrong?

162
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:14,510
Nothing.

163
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,710
I just read a book which talks about demons.

164
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:17,910
I was scared to death.

165
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,490
Let me read it.

166
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,220
Well...

167
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,910
Senior Huaiyan.

168
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,570
Senior Huaiyan.

169
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,070
Mengli wants to know

170
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,200
what happened between the Qionghua Sect and the demon clan 19 years ago.

171
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,220
But there're too many books here.

172
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,110
We don't know where they are.

173
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,470
The books of Qionghua's history were arranged according to years.

174
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,460
They should be over there.

175
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,450
Let me take you there.

176
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:35,950
-Thank you, Senior.
-Thank you, Senior.

177
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:36,429
Come.

178
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,820
-Let's go.
-Okay.

179
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,790
Could it really be that Tianhe's father

180
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,300
killed Mengli's parents

181
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,520
and abducted her?

182
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,290
Senior Xuanye.

183
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,050
I'm going back to my room to meditate.

184
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,090
Why are you alone?

185
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,050
Where is Lingsha?

186
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:02,420
Lingsha is feeling unwell and is resting in the room.

187
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,730
Although I was an infant at that time,

188
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,070
I clearly remember

189
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,990
that only Uncle Yun risked his life

190
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:54,830
to take me away

191
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:56,250
and gave me to my parents.

192
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:59,420
During the war, in order to protect the baby girl, Jingci was killed.

193
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,150
The evil disciple took the daughter and ran away.

194
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,400
Could it be that Tianhe's father gave Mengli Princess Jade to wear

195
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,200
in order to strengthen her soul?

196
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,900
But why did he abduct Mengli?

197
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:49,460
Lingsha.

198
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,270
What's wrong?

199
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:50,870
Nothing.

200
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,860
Why did Lingsha secretly hide that book

201
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,610
without telling me?

202
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,270
Who is it?

203
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,990
Uncle Ziying, it's me.

204
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,510
Open the door.

205
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:20,730
You know me.

206
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,200
If you don't open it,

207
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,920
I'll break in myself.

208
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,270
What do you want to ask?

209
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,150
I want to know

210
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,710
whether it's possible

211
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:33,350
that Qionghua History Book was faldified

212
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,750
or has fallacies?

213
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,530
Since the Qionghua Sect was founded,

214
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,080
there has been a position of note-taker.

215
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,710
Even the mistakes of previous grandmasters

216
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,910
were also recorded in the history book.

217
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:44,960
You went to the Library Room of Yunjing Pavilion?

218
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,750
Mengli and I went to Yunjing Pavilion today

219
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,550
to help Tianhe check the records of the war 19 years ago.

220
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,230
I read in a book

221
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,510
that the wife of Xuan Zhen, the first disciple of Tai Qing,

222
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,230
gave birth to a baby girl and died in childbirth

223
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,360
on the eve of the war.

224
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:59,070
Then this baby girl was given to

225
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:01,430
Xuan Zhen's disciple Jingci to raise.

226
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,540
During the demonic rebellion,

227
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:09,130
in order to protect the baby girl, Jingci was killed.

228
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,660
The baby girl lost her soul.

229
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:12,670
Someone saw

230
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,070
the traitor take the daughter and run away.

231
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,490
I know what you want to ask.

232
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,480
The traitor recorded in the history book

233
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,330
was Yun Tianqing.

234
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,030
But why did he

235
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,690
only take away a baby girl?

236
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:33,750
I don't know.

237
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:36,020
Just like you,

238
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:38,740
I also saw the records in the history book.

239
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,350
But what I want to know is,

240
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,890
did Tianhe ask you to ask me?

241
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,370
No. He doesn't know.

242
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,510
Don't tell them,

243
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,820
especially Mengli.

244
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:48,760
Mengli?

245
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,070
Mengli

246
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,830
isn't the biological daughter of the Liu family in Shouyang.

247
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:58,960
Nineteen years ago,

248
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,590
Tianhe's father brought her from Qionghua to Shouyang

249
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,430
and gave her to Mr. and Mrs. Liu.

250
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:05,460
So

251
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,270
you suspect

252
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:10,750
that the baby girl recorded in the history book was Mengli?

253
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,690
Do you think this is a coincidence?

254
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,830
I hope it's not true.

255
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,520
I...

256
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:21,710
I feel bad

257
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,570
and don't know what to do.

258
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,700
If I have to,

259
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,370
I'll take Tianhe and Mengli away.

260
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,260
Don't worry.

261
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,340
I'll try to verify it tomorrow.

262
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:32,890
Don't let them know

263
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,560
before we get the results.

264
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:35,520
I know.

265
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,120
If this is true,

266
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,070
it'll hurt two people.

267
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,270
Uncle Ziying.

268
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,930
In Qionghua, besides Tianhe and Mengli,

269
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,610
I trust you the most.

270
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:56,740
Mengli.

271
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,030
Why are you still up?

272
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,000
Are you waiting for me?

273
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,420
I'm so stupid. Why didn't I hide it well?

274
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,150
Lingsha.

275
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:17,850
You started to be distracted when you were in Yunjing Pavilion.

276
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,450
Then you pretended to sleep.

277
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,490
I found you were hiding something from me.

278
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:23,920
Mengli.

279
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,310
Don't believe what's written in this book.

280
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:28,310
It may not be true.

281
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,250
But this is Qionghua History Book.

282
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,340
How could it be false?

283
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,760
But we can't be sure whether people who wrote it

284
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,510
made it up as they pleased.

285
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:36,290
I went to ask Uncle Ziying.

286
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:39,260
He said he'll verify the things written in that book.

287
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,230
I was born 19 years ago.

288
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,280
Uncle Yun took me away after a fight.

289
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,560
And this Princess Jade.

290
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,530
Feng Er from Boxian Town also said

291
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,120
it was because my primordial spirit was unstable that night

292
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,580
that I was given it to wear.

293
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,260
Can this be made up too?

294
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:03,750
But...

295
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,940
I was the frightened baby.

296
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:10,950
Mengli.

297
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:12,610
I know you're sad.

298
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:13,400
Tomorrow...

299
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:15,370
I'll go ask Senior Xuanye tomorrow.

300
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,300
I'll ask Xuanji.

301
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:18,490
I'll ask Grandmaster if I have to.

302
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,400
Asking them

303
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,790
will only make Tianhe know

304
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:25,050
Uncle Yun killed my biological parents.

305
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:27,860
How should Tianhe face it then?

306
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,840
How should I face Tianhe?

307
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:34,350
The mystery of my birth

308
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:38,110
has been puzzling me since I was little.

309
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:41,150
The only support in my heart

310
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,600
was to meet Uncle Yun one day.

311
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,370
But during these years,

312
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,510
my savior became my enemy.

313
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,690
Mengli.

314
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,150
It's really hard. I know.

315
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,390
Lingsha.

316
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,450
I finally knew what "something wretched at one's heart" meant.

317
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:04,040
One side

318
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,420
was an enemy who killed my biological parents.

319
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:09,390
The other side

320
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:13,060
is a friend who stayed with me through thick and thin.

321
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,420
Lingsha.

322
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:18,870
What should I do?

323
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,590
Maybe...

324
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:24,050
Maybe it's best if I leave

325
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,200
with this matter.

326
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,310
If you want to leave,

327
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,000
let's leave together.

328
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,280
We'll take you home.

329
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:33,270
We'll take you to Mr. and Mrs. Liu.

330
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,040
You're also their daughter.

331
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:38,410
All right.

332
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:41,830
All right.

333
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,430
Don't be sad.

334
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,090
You'll get better.

335
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:49,910
We won't be apart.

336
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,150
All right. It's okay.

337
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:05,450
I see.

338
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:06,780
Okay.

339
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,030
Lingsha. Mengli.

340
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,450
What took you so long?

341
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:15,750
Mengli.

342
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:19,040
You don't look well.

343
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:21,210
Did you not sleep well last night?

344
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:22,750
I'm fine.

345
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:25,710
Mengli.

346
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,720
Why does the smell

347
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,720
of lixiang herb on your body so strong today?

348
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,670
Are you homesick and in a bad mood?

349
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,390
No.

350
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:39,750
Uncle Ziying.

351
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,040
Why are you here?

352
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,440
I heard that you haven't been

353
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,940
concentrating on your studies these days.

354
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,540
Huaixin.

355
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,340
Be responsible for supervising Yun Tianhe these days.

356
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,740
Don't let him run around.

357
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,350
After the sword training class,

358
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,610
he can only sit cross-legged in the room.

359
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,830
Take him back to his room first.

360
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,350
Yes.

361
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,320
Uncle Ziying.

362
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,980
I'm not distracted.

363
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,070
I don't even doze off in class now.

364
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,410
Tianhe.

365
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,290
You just need to do as Master says.

366
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:09,670
Yes.

367
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,020
Uncle Ziying.

368
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,490
I know you did this

369
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,920
because you're afraid Tianhe will inquire about my parents.

370
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,050
Since you already know it,

371
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,510
how will you face Tianhe?

372
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:33,390
Don't worry.

373
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,840
I'll try my best to verify it

374
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,400
and solve your problem.

375
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,690
Thank you, Uncle.

376
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,200
Give me the book.

377
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,570
Give me the book.

378
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,590
I'll return it to Aunt Su Xi personally

379
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:09,850
in case you get into trouble again when you return the book.

380
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:13,210
Thank you for protecting me, Uncle.

381
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:19,260
Mengli.

382
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,190
When the training is over,

383
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:22,980
how about I take you to Qingfeng Valley for a walk?

384
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,260
It's beautiful there.

385
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,240
No.

386
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:27,380
I'm going to Yunjing Pavilion.

387
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,460
[Yunjing Pavilion]

388
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:15,510
Mengli, do you need to take a rest?

389
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,370
Take a rest.

390
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:19,710
You've read so much.

391
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,800
I must find evidence.

392
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,060
I must find evidence.

393
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:28,920
Good Mengli.

394
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,770
You were the most rational.

395
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,370
But you became like this.

396
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,430
How can I help you?

397
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,500
It's already 5 p.m.

398
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,030
It's time for you to leave.

399
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,430
Senior.

400
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,000
Can I stay here and read?

401
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,430
I really have something important

402
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:48,750
to find out in books.

403
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,030
If you're blamed,

404
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,070
I'm willing to take the consequences.

405
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:53,000
You're welcome.

406
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,060
Just read here.

407
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:56,130
Remember, at dawn every day,

408
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:58,310
Sect Leader Su Xi comes to open the door personally.

409
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,770
Please leave before dawn.

410
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,960
Thank you, Senior.

411
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,300
I'll read with you.

412
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,420
I asked you to investigate Han Lingsha and Liu Mengli.

413
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,330
How is it going?

414
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:27,680
I found out

415
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,180
that Liu Mengli was the baby girl who Yun Tianqing brought

416
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,700
from Qionghua to Liu Mansion in Shouyang.

417
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:33,770
These days,

418
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,450
she's been investigating the war 19 years ago

419
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:40,200
from the books in Yunjing Pavilion's Library Pavilion.

420
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,120
The war 19 years ago?

421
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:53,900
There was only one baby girl born

422
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,030
during the war of Qionghua.

423
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,320
Is she...

424
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,480
Elder, you're wise.

425
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:02,300
If Yun Tianhe knows his father

426
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,080
killed Liu Mengli's parents,

427
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:06,060
they'll fight among themselves first.

428
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,820
He'll be embarrassed to stay in Qionghua.

429
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:12,220
Don't worry, Elder.

430
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,650
I've already set a trap.

431
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:16,240
We won't be involved.

432
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:50,640
Senior.

433
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:55,270
Senior Xuanye.

434
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:57,640
Have you seen Lingsha and Mengli?

435
00:22:58,130 --> 00:22:59,560
I was gonna ask you the same.

436
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,100
They didn't come back last night.

437
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,200
And they didn't come to practice swordsmanship at Sword Ground today.

438
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,860
If they don't show up in class,

439
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,470
they'll be punished.

440
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,310
I got it.

441
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,590
They must have gone to Yunjing Pavilion

442
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,430
to find information about my father.

443
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:14,630
I'll go find them now.

444
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,330
Wait.

445
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:21,130
Today's class is very important.

446
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,110
Don't be absent.

447
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,910
Sect Leader is here.

448
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,490
Sect Leader Xu Zhao.

449
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,450
Sect Leader.

450
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,010
Sect Leader Xu Liang was supposed to

451
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,150
give you a lecture today.

452
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:36,040
But he suddenly had a headache.

453
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,280
I'll teach you for him.

454
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:39,270
Xuanye.

455
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,310
Take the disciples there first.

456
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,130
Yes.

457
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:44,760
Come.

458
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,070
He'll teach?

459
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,440
I'd rather be absent and be punished.

460
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,760
You can be absent,

461
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:55,030
but I won't punish you.

462
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,040
You hate my father so much.

463
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:59,690
How could you protect me?

464
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,520
You're not

465
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,870
your father.

466
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,250
Although I'm a cultivator,

467
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,480
I'm a mortal.

468
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,590
After all, the lesson today

469
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:14,260
is about the secret history of Qionghua 19 years ago.

470
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,720
It concerns Yun Tianqing.

471
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,540
I'm afraid you'll suffer.

472
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,780
You can really understand me?

473
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,450
Then tell me

474
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,480
who my father killed.

475
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:26,870
And what's the first name

476
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:29,130
of his best senior whose surname is Xuan?

477
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,630
Back then, Yun Tianqing

478
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,470
advocated that humans and demons

479
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:38,110
have good and evil qualities in common.

480
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,870
It angered Grandmaster, Immortal Tai Qing.

481
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,910
He was punished with Ice and Fire Whipping.

482
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:45,700
Senior Xuan Zhen

483
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,430
was afraid that he wouldn't be able to bear it,

484
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:49,520
so he took the punishment for him.

485
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,180
Xuan Zhen?

486
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:54,790
In the Qionghua Sect, the one who knew your father best

487
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,390
wasn't me.

488
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,250
It was your father's senior.

489
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,420
His name is Xuan...

490
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,070
Xuan...

491
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:05,130
He took the punishment for my father.

492
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:06,960
He must be close to my father.

493
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,310
Where is he now?

494
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:10,690
It's not appropriate

495
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:12,700
to talk about these things in private.

496
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,160
If you really want to know,

497
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,030
why don't you come to the class?

498
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,840
Why did I fall asleep?

499
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:37,630
Mengli.

500
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:40,210
You didn't read here all night, did you?

501
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:41,930
I have one more volume.

502
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:46,070
Oh, no.

503
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,470
It's time. Let's go.

504
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:48,450
Let's go.

505
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,070
Let's go.

506
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,050
Nephew Ziying.

507
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,880
Why did you come to Yunjing Pavilion so early?

508
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:56,680
Aunt.

509
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:03,550
[Qionghua History Book]

510
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,250
If I'm not mistaken,

511
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,060
this should be the book

512
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,030
that your two female disciples secretly took away.

513
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,750
Are you here to return it for them?

514
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,310
I came here to return the book

515
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,710
because I also have doubts about this book.

516
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:16,170
I want to ask you.

517
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:17,350
Say it.

518
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,370
I heard that when Yun Tianqing ran away that year,

519
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:23,400
he abducted Master Xuan Zhen's daughter.

520
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:24,810
Did you see it?

521
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:29,990
The secret history of Yun Tianqing's betrayal

522
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,990
is used to remind all the disciples

523
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:33,630
to learn from history

524
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,290
and not to go astray.

525
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:41,110
Yun Tianqing had been the greatest traitor

526
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:42,990
since the Qionghua Sect was founded.

527
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:44,450
He committed many crimes.

528
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,910
First,

529
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,590
he was easy to attract and hard to control.

530
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:51,790
He seduced Junior Su Yu and stole Wangshu Sword.

531
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:53,010
He was unclean.

532
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,430
Second,

533
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:55,800
he turned against us

534
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:59,190
and caused Master Tai Qing's death.

535
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,000
He was disloyal.

536
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,260
Third,

537
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:04,200
he colluded with the demon clan

538
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,530
and tricked people from the same sect into entering the Demon Realm.

539
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:07,730
They were ambushed.

540
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,090
He was immoral.

541
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,590
Fourth,

542
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,050
due to the fear of retaliation,

543
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:14,110
he abducted the child of his fellow disciple.

544
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:14,910
He was unkind.

545
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,420
I don't believe what you said.

546
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,880
What evidence do you have?

547
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:22,490
Tianhe.

548
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:25,510
It seems that you still can't bear this.

549
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:26,690
It's fine.

550
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,780
Go back and rest.

551
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:31,540
Tell me.

552
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,050
Where is Uncle Xuan Zhen?

553
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,440
I'll go ask him.

554
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,070
Xuan Zhen was my master.

555
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:41,230
Nineteen years ago, your father lured him into Demon Region.

556
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:42,720
He already died.

557
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,590
I know

558
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:49,020
you and my master Su Shen were best friends.

559
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,760
I remember Master once told me

560
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,970
you experienced this together.

561
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:58,590
Please

562
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,230
tell me what happened at that time.

563
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,670
It's true.

564
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,040
When we arrived at Xuan Zhen's house...

565
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,640
Tianqing.

566
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:17,550
We're from the same sect. Don't force me to fight.

567
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,350
Senior.

568
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:27,350
Is this Senior Xuan Zhen's child?

569
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,360
Jingci

570
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,470
already died.

571
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,590
Senior!

572
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,900
I still don't understand

573
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:51,940
when Senior Tianqing ran away,

574
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,370
why he abducted Senior Xuan Zhen's child.

575
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:56,780
Who is it?

576
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:57,470
Aunt.

577
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:01,880
Come out.

578
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,500
When Yun Tianqing ran away,

579
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:08,500
due to the fear of retaliation,

580
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,220
he rushed into Xuan Zhen's house

581
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,300
and took the newborn baby away.

582
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:15,510
In order to protect the baby girl, my Junior Jingci

583
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:18,020
was killed by Yun Tianqing.

584
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,320
And the baby girl also lost her soul.

585
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,140
It's impossible.

586
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,040
It's impossible.

587
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,070
I know my father.

588
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,700
He was not that kind of person.

589
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:35,630
You can go ask your Uncle Ziying if you don't believe me.

590
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,030
We now

591
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,860
know your father, Yun Tianqing.

592
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,980
He was a villain.

593
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,600
We only knew before

594
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:45,670
that Yun Tianqing colluded with the demon clan and betrayed the sect

595
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:46,830
for Wangshu Sword.

596
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,510
It turns out that he even killed his senior

597
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,580
and took his child.

598
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,540
But Tianhe didn't know it.

599
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,660
Who knows if he really didn't know it

600
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,060
or pretended not to know?

601
00:29:59,110 --> 00:29:59,990
Get lost!

602
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:00,740
Right.

603
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,520
Get out! Right.

604
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,160
Get out! Get out!

605
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,070
You're not welcome here.

606
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,770
Right. You're not welcome here. Get out!

607
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,470
Get out!

608
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:07,900
Leave!

609
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:11,050
You're not welcome here. Get out!

610
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:11,840
Get out!

611
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,410
Get lost!

612
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:13,090
Get lost!

613
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,240
You're not welcome here. Get out!

614
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:16,930
Get out! Get out!

615
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,560
It's not open yet.

616
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,030
Why are you here?

617
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:27,160
It was me.

618
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,730
I made them read here all night long yesterday as a punishment.

619
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:32,230
I did it without permission.

620
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,270
So I waited here

621
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,310
to confess.

622
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:38,310
Since your master said so,

623
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,340
it's not appropriate for me to interfere.

624
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,350
But remember,

625
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:44,830
what you saw and heard just now is a secret of Qionghua.

626
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:46,100
Don't tell anyone.

627
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,130
-Mengli.
-Well...

628
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,160
Don't worry, Uncle.

629
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,760
We'll go get punishment now.

630
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:54,920
Thank you, Aunt.

631
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:57,710
Leave now.

632
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:12,240
[Male Disciples' Academy]

633
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:16,990
Father.

634
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,500
They said

635
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:22,640
you killed Xuan Zhen

636
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,910
and took his daughter away.

637
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,010
Is this true?

638
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,240
No.

639
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,080
Father.

640
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:44,110
I know it's not true.

641
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,270
You wouldn't do such a thing.

642
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,230
It's not true.

643
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:51,550
It's not true.

644
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,000
Junior Lingsha.

645
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,020
If others

646
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,140
talked about his father like this before,

647
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,270
he would be furious.

648
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:02,990
But Tianhe's mood is different this time.

649
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:03,870
I'm worried.

650
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:05,610
So I asked you to come and see.

651
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,630
Uncle Xu Zhao must have deliberately

652
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,030
given him such a lecture.

653
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,180
Tianhe.

654
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,940
Tianhe, open the door.

655
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:14,560
Lingsha.

656
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:16,150
Don't listen to their nonsense.

657
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:17,430
Open the door first.

658
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:18,840
Don't make me worry.

659
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,060
We now

660
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,880
know your father, Yun Tianqing.

661
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,000
He was a villain.

662
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,490
It turns out that he even killed his senior

663
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,480
and took his child.

664
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,530
Father.

665
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,770
What can I do to make people believe me?

666
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:36,250
Wild man, I'm ordering you

667
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,770
to open the door now!

668
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:40,990
Tianhe.

669
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,990
Open the door.

670
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,180
Mengli already worried me.

671
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,000
Stop making me worry about you.

672
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:48,240
Tianhe.

673
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:50,110
Mengli?

674
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,500
When Yun Tianqing ran away,

675
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,590
he rushed into Xuan Zhen's house

676
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:56,620
and took the newborn baby away.

677
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:59,690
In order to protect the baby girl, my Junior Jingci

678
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:02,370
was killed by Yun Tianqing.

679
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,940
And the baby girl also lost her soul.

680
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,950
She put the Princess Jade

681
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:08,810
on the baby.

682
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:11,890
But why didn't they let her take it off?

683
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,270
Maybe

684
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:15,070
the baby was haunted by evil spirits at that time.

685
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,870
It can also strengthen her soul.

686
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:31,230
The man I want to marry

687
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:34,430
should be as chivalrous and soft-hearted as Uncle Yun

688
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:35,590
and be well-read.

689
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:37,830
The only support in my heart

690
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,390
was to meet Uncle Yun one day.

691
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,630
But during these years,

692
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,700
my savior became my enemy.

693
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,720
Why does the smell

694
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,370
of lixiang herb on your body so strong today?

695
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:53,770
Are you homesick and in a bad mood?

696
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:54,800
No.

697
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,130
Tianhe.

698
00:33:58,390 --> 00:33:59,560
Tianhe, open the...

699
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,050
Senior Huaixin.

700
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,230
Why don't you go back to class first

701
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:06,490
in case you get punished?

702
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:07,750
I'll keep an eye on him.

703
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:08,980
Okay.

704
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,500
Yun Tianhe.

705
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,730
If you don't open the door,

706
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,480
I'll...

707
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:26,850
Did you know it before?

708
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:28,500
Xuan Zhen

709
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,600
was Mengli's father, right?

710
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:45,510
So my father

711
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,409
was the person who killed Mengli's parents,

712
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,150
right?

713
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,219
Tianhe, listen to me.

714
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,739
Actually, this matter...

715
00:34:55,989 --> 00:34:56,639
Tianhe.

716
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:30,980
Uncle.

717
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,860
Is this the song you composed?

718
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:34,740
Uncle.

719
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,670
How do you know?

720
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:37,470
Because Master Su Shen

721
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,830
never played such a sad song.

722
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,720
She didn't teach you that.

723
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,270
If Master were here,

724
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,960
she would tell me what to do.

725
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,570
Before Master left Qionghua,

726
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,040
she was abnormal for a while.

727
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:58,190
She always looked troubled.

728
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,810
So I asked her

729
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,630
what happened.

730
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,430
Master didn't answer.

731
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:05,280
She just

732
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,030
told me a story.

733
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,100
What is it?

734
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,280
Once upon a time, there was a venerable saint.

735
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,430
When his student was making porridge,

736
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:18,460
he found there was dust falling into the porridge.

737
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,060
He quickly took a spoon

738
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,540
and wanted to pour it away.

739
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,440
But after thinking about it,

740
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:26,590
he thought it was hard to have food.

741
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:27,680
So

742
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,510
he ate the porridge with the dust.

743
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,130
But unexpectedly,

744
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,300
the saint happened to pass by.

745
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,630
He thought his student was stealing food.

746
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:39,480
So he reprimanded him.

747
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,280
He was so pitiful.

748
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:42,710
And then?

749
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:46,510
Then the saint found out the truth.

750
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:47,640
He self-reflected.

751
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:48,730
He said

752
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:53,400
that what people see with their own eyes may not be true,

753
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:55,380
let alone hearsay.

754
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:00,490
Little Ziying.

755
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,520
You must remember

756
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,480
that everything shouldn't be judged only by appearances.

757
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,740
If you have any doubts,

758
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:07,460
you must find out the truth.

759
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:10,540
You've always been highly intelligent.

760
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,710
You should be able to understand what Master meant.

761
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:13,370
Then you'll

762
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,030
be able to be as carefree as Master.

763
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,070
No matter what the truth is,

764
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:19,270
hatred

765
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,880
will only hurt others and yourself.

766
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:23,670
Uncle Ziying.

767
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,120
Mengli, something happened.

768
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,080
How could my father hurt his senior?

769
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,430
Why did he take Mengli away

770
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,980
and entrust Mengli to me?

771
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:40,860
It's impossible.

772
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,350
Father.

773
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:46,500
Tell me.

774
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,100
Father. What happened?

775
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:50,620
Tell me.

776
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,600
♫A dream in a bamboo forest under the moon♫

777
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:52,590
It's impossible.

778
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:57,160
♫Withered grass invited Awakening of Insects♫

779
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:00,540
♫I happen to have good alcohol of the world♫

780
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,060
It's impossible.

781
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:04,120
♫Can I reach the stars?♫

782
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,390
♫I should be blamed for the departure♫

783
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:13,190
♫Give me a lifetime of smiles and sorrow♫

784
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,390
Tianhe.

785
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:20,160
♫The shadows of old friends fill my heart for a moment♫

786
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:24,590
♫Gaze at the Milky Way from afar♫

787
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:29,060
♫I don't regret♫

788
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:32,550
♫It's hard to turn everything♫

789
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:36,390
♫Into bones♫

790
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:41,050
♫Frivolous like a young man♫

791
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,270
♫How have you been?♫

792
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:52,950
♫I had gray hair before I notice it♫

793
00:38:53,410 --> 00:39:00,230
♫My thought affected my whole life♫

794
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:08,340
♫The destiny is boiling, and we'll finally be apart♫

795
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:13,050
♫It's not in vain, so don't worry about it♫

796
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:17,260
♫The future is bright♫

797
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:25,710
♫Step on the sword, and I'll return to chop the peach blossom in the next life♫
