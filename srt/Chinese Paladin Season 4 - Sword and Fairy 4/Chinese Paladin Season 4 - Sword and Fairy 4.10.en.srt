[Episode 10]

4
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:40,990
Mr. Yun,

5
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,070
I am dressed in the way I like.

6
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,060
I hope Miss Lingsha won't mind.

7
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:45,930
She won't.

8
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:47,670
I just think

9
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:51,400
Lingsha also looks nice when she dresses like this.

10
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,950
The Chenzhou city in my dream and the one in reality

11
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,170
seem to be different.

12
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,170
It appears to be more prosperous here.

13
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,440
The Chenzhou city in your dream

14
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,990
was what it looked like nine years ago.

15
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,530
Now, after nine years, Chenzhou has taken on a new look.

16
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:04,290
But

17
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,580
this street was on my everyday route to Qianfo Temple

18
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,440
and the place I bought sour dates.

19
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,400
Miss Mingzhu,

20
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,030
here are your sour dates.

21
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,080
Uncle Tanba, thank you.

22
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,640
Thank you.

23
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,870
Kind and generous people will be blessed

24
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,130
with infinite happiness and longevity!

25
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,460
Young Miss,

26
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,900
I bought you plum blossoms, your favorite.

27
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,780
These sour dates are for you to share.

28
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,040
Thank you, Young Miss.

29
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,110
There are no plum blossoms in this season at all.

30
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,270
Plus, as a food enthusiast,

31
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,110
I can't find

32
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,270
the sour date seller

33
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,710
called Uncle Tanba.

34
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,110
Kind and generous people will be blessed...

35
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:47,240
-With infinite happiness and longevity!
-Uncle Tanba?

36
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:52,690
Uncle Tanba.

37
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,300
When did you become so old?

38
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,870
I'm nearly 70.

39
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,590
Of course I'm old.

40
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,620
70?

41
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,900
Didn't you just turn 60?

42
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:07,500
Yesterday you weren't like this when I saw you.

43
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,600
Where are your sour dates?

44
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,550
Every day I would stop by to buy some.

45
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,390
Miss,

46
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,180
I did sell sour dates

47
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,540
but that was eight or nine years ago.

48
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,490
How old could you be at that time?

49
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,710
There's no way you would buy sour dates from me every day.

50
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,710
Now you have Lingsha's appearance.

51
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,320
He can't recognize you.

52
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:26,910
Uncle Tanba,

53
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,430
do you remember Ouyang Mingzhu?

54
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,210
Miss Mingzhu?

55
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,079
Miss Mingzhu was really kind.

56
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,140
It's a shame that...

57
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,340
Shame?

58
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,350
What happened to her?

59
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,430
Many years ago,

60
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,610
there was a terrible change in Ouyang family.

61
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,829
Mr. and Mrs. Ouyang got a strange disease

62
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:49,190
and suddenly died.

63
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,740
Miss Ouyang was brokenhearted.

64
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,370
She went into a coma eight or nine years ago

65
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,730
and now she still hasn't come to.

66
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:58,850
That can't be true.

67
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,840
I'm sorry for your loss.

68
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:10,800
Thank you!

69
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:11,710
Thank you!

70
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,330
Thank you!

71
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,399
Mr. Huaishuo told me

72
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,440
that I could ask him for help anytime.

73
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,149
So,

74
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,630
when I found the Young Miss was sick,

75
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,420
I hurried to Jixian Garden.

76
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,390
Miss Ouyang has been asleep for nine years.

77
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,140
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

78
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,190
I'm sorry.

79
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:33,700
Truth to be told,

80
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,350
I was afraid that you would harm the Young Miss

81
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,590
like that hateful warlock did.

82
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,390
Was it a warlock named Jingxin?

83
00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:41,900
Yes, it's him.

84
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,710
The Young Miss's illness

85
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:46,310
was worsened by that ungrateful punk Jingxin.

86
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,240
I'm old now.

87
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,470
My days are numbered.

88
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,870
What worries me the most is

89
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,230
that the Young Miss will be left unattended.

90
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,360
Relax, Uncle Zhong.

91
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,790
Please show me where Miss Ouyang is.

92
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:56,470
Sure.

93
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:21,320
Sir,

94
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,280
how is the Young Miss?

95
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,930
Her primordial spirit is weak.

96
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:28,880
Sir!

97
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,250
I beg you to help the Young Miss!

98
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,780
Please save her life!

99
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,950
Uncle Zhong, no need for this.

100
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:37,150
As a Qionghua disciple, it's my duty to help those in need.

101
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,990
But Miss Ouyang has quite an unusual condition.

102
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,909
I'll use spiritual power to stabilize her primordial spirit first.

103
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:47,340
Then I need to wait for another person to arrive.

104
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,300
When will that person be here?

105
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,490
Soon, I suppose.

106
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:51,909
You may wait outside.

107
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,070
Please help Miss Ouyang.

108
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:53,909
Please.

109
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,450
There should be a tea house.

110
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,080
It used to be my father's favorite place to drink tea.

111
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,050
How come it's all changed?

112
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:17,020
I must still be in the dream.

113
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,490
You've woken up.

114
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,390
You are?

115
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,550
Han Lingsha.

116
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,900
I am Han Lingsha.

117
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,100
But it's also fair to say I'm not.

118
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:32,710
Now

119
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,200
take Yun Tianhe

120
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,380
to Qionghua.

121
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,840
Then I'll give you

122
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,110
the thing you want

123
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,080
right away.

124
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,440
But he won't go to Qionghua with me.

125
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:43,430
Does he

126
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,760
already know

127
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:46,960
you're lying to him?

128
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,460
I'm lying to him?

129
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,290
Lingsha is lying to him.

130
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,110
Today,

131
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,830
you seem different.

132
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,150
I've got your message.

133
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,270
That would be

134
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:02,930
the best.

135
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,940
Has Miss Lingsha

136
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,930
been lying to Mr. Yun?

137
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:14,310
Did this man in black come for Lingsha

138
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,060
or Mingzhu?

139
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,270
Miss Ouyang,

140
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,550
were you waiting for a friend?

141
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,790
I was visiting my father's favorite tea house,

142
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,750
but that man showed up

143
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:30,910
and told me...

144
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,030
He told Lingsha to take Mr. Yun to Qionghua

145
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:37,310
and asked if Mr. Yun realized he had been deceived.

146
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:38,950
Deceived?

147
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,620
That's impossible.

148
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,550
Lingsha would never lie to Mr. Yun.

149
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,390
There you are!

150
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,240
I was looking for you.

151
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,270
What are you chatting about?

152
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,070
Nothing.

153
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,800
Miss Ouyang,

154
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,530
would you like to go home and take a look?

155
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:53,280
No.

156
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,310
Ziying has sent a talisman over,

157
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,190
asking to meet us now

158
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,430
in Miss Mingzhu's caregiver's house, who is called Uncle Zhong.

159
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:58,960
Let's go.

160
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,260
Miss Ouyang.

161
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:12,540
Anything wrong?

162
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:14,090
Nothing.

163
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,270
Let's go.

164
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,860
This is Uncle Zhong's old house.

165
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,510
I came here once in my childhood.

166
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,950
Why did you bring me here?

167
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:32,650
Senior Ziying!

168
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,309
Haven't you met Uncle Zhong?

169
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:42,850
Not yet.

170
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,740
How is Miss Ouyang doing?

171
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,780
Her primordial spirit is weak.

172
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,310
But I've stabilized it with spiritual power.

173
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,840
Lingsha, what's going on with you?

174
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,360
No!

175
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,200
Miss Ouyang,

176
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,740
is there anything wrong?

177
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,710
This is indeed a Rosary Formation.

178
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,110
Can we break it?

179
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:15,840
No.

180
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,950
The rosaries have interlinking spiritual veins.

181
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,330
Miss Han is still trapped in the formation.

182
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,660
If we forcibly break it,

183
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,290
her primordial spirit will be destroyed.

184
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,600
-Miss Ouyang!
-Lingsha!

185
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,110
Lingsha,

186
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,070
can you hear me?

187
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:45,990
Ziying,

188
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,970
what can we do to swap them back?

189
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:48,650
Tianhe,

190
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,440
given that Mr. Murong has asked us to come,

191
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,740
he must have come up with a plan.

192
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,740
Uncle Zhong told me

193
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,270
that the warlock named Jingxin

194
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,200
had killed Miss Ouyang's parents.

195
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,820
That means it was Jingxin who cast the spell.

196
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,020
We need to find Jingxin as soon as possible

197
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,400
so as to swap the girls back.

198
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,600
He cast the spell and created the dream.

199
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:08,590
He's able to travel back and forth between the dream and the reality.

200
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:10,470
It's not that easy to catch him.

201
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,750
Now Miss Ouyang's primordial spirit is weak.

202
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,480
I must enter her dream right now

203
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:15,630
to wake Miss Han up

204
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,780
and see if I can find

205
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,390
the person who cast the spell.

206
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:18,870
No.

207
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:19,860
Ziying,

208
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,420
Mengli and I will get in her dream.

209
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,330
You should stay outside

210
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,460
so you can stabilize

211
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:26,460
the auras and spirits of Lingsha and Miss Ouyang.

212
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,730
Tianhe is right.

213
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,460
Staying outside, you can not only

214
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,390
protect Lingsha and Miss Ouyang

215
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,700
but also supply us with spiritual power.

216
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,040
Sounds good.

217
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,570
At this moment, we must be in

218
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,230
Miss Ouyang's dream.

219
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,840
The location isn't changed

220
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,190
but the interior is completely different.

221
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,900
I'm glad that Lingsha is still here.

222
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,620
Tianhe!

223
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,970
Tianhe, don't die!

224
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:35,270
Lingsha.

225
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:35,860
Tianhe!

226
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:36,660
Wake up!

227
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,680
I'm Tianhe.

228
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:38,700
I'm right here.

229
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,560
You're fine?

230
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,470
You're fine!

231
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,150
Are you really fine?

232
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,920
Are you really Lingsha?

233
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,930
You haven't turned into Mingzhu

234
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,450
or another girl again, have you?

235
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,710
You wild man! What girl?

236
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:59,670
You're talking pure nonsense!

237
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,870
Who else could I be if I weren't Lingsha?

238
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,930
Only Lingsha would hit me like this.

239
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:05,890
Lingsha,

240
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,520
you're finally back!

241
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,480
What do you mean I'm back?

242
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,700
The fact that we could get Lingsha back

243
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,050
proves that the person who cast the spell also created the dream.

244
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:12,800
Dream?

245
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,960
Shouldn't I be sleeping in Jixian Garden?

246
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,590
Where am I?

247
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:20,020
Simply put,

248
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,640
the primordial spirit of a lady named Mingzhu

249
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,270
has entered your body.

250
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,390
The three of us are now

251
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:28,120
in Miss Mingzhu's dream.

252
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,000
Stop. Stop. Stop.

253
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,660
You lost me there.

254
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,730
Mengli, tell me the story.

255
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,350
We need to find Miss Ming Zhu as soon as possible

256
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,380
and wake her up from her dream.

257
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,230
Otherwise, the primordial spirits of Lingsha and Miss Mingzhu

258
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,460
can't be switched back.

259
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,790
That's right. Let's go.

260
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,230
Where are we going?

261
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,580
As I recall, Miss Mingzhu said

262
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,030
she would pray at Qianfo Temple every day.

263
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:44,510
Yes!

264
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,860
We'll wait for her somewhere on her route.

265
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:47,590
Let's go.

266
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:48,300
Go!

267
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:56,630
Many years ago, there was a terrible change in Ouyang family.

268
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,990
Mr. and Mrs. Ouyang got a strange disease

269
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,590
and suddenly died.

270
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,940
Miss Ouyang was brokenhearted.

271
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,310
She went into a coma eight or nine years ago

272
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:07,790
and now she still hasn't come to.

273
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,590
You must have been living in your dream the whole time

274
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:13,450
without knowing that the reality has changed a lot.

275
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,810
You had a weird dream again, right?

276
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,830
Word has it that there is a peculiar tree in Wanqiu Mountain.

277
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,150
It grows what seems to be plum blossoms.

278
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,640
My wife, I'm sure you'll like it.

279
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,600
In the afternoon,

280
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,800
shall we drive there to see the flowers?

281
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:47,880
At noon,

282
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:50,050
I'll pick you up from Qianfo Temple

283
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:53,450
and take you out for a boat trip to see lotus flowers, alright?

284
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:56,030
Yesterday we rowed a boat to see lotus flowers.

285
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:58,830
Today we'll drive to see flowers again. Am I right?

286
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,730
I'll go prepare for the outing.

287
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:04,440
Young Miss,

288
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,530
you finally got up.

289
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,820
We've heated your breakfast three times.

290
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,520
Tomorrow is the Lord's birthday.

291
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,790
Young Miss, these days you must have worn yourself out

292
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,120
by preparing a present.

293
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,180
Young Miss,

294
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:18,240
we've heated your breakfast three times.

295
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,950
Tomorrow is the Lord's birthday.

296
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:22,000
Young Miss, these days you must have worn yourself out

297
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,330
by preparing a present.

298
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,280
It seems it's time for me to say,

299
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:29,090
"I'm thinking about the dream I had."

300
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:32,020
Then she'd tell me Uncle Zhong is waiting at the door.

301
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,440
What if I don't say that?

302
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:34,990
Young Miss,

303
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,810
Uncle Zhong is waiting outside.

304
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:37,970
After breakfast,

305
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,800
we'll go to Qianfo Temple to pray.

306
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,130
Then you won't have weird dreams anymore.

307
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,190
When did I say I dreamt again?

308
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,440
Why should I go to Qianfo Temple?

309
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,750
Do you

310
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,420
do the same thing

311
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,110
and say the same thing to me every day?

312
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:53,870
Young Miss.

313
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,730
Uncle Zhong is waiting outside.

314
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:56,750
After breakfast,

315
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,500
we'll go to Qianfo Temple to pray.

316
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,830
Then you won't have weird dreams anymore.

317
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,070
All right.

318
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,090
You may leave.

319
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,160
Why was my dream so real

320
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,710
and I feel like I'm dreaming now?

321
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:27,350
Is there something wrong with this divination stick?

322
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:34,590
Jingxin!

323
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,510
Jingxin!

324
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,510
Miss.

325
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,590
Have you ever seen

326
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,680
Master Jingxin who does divination at Qianfo Temple?

327
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,150
Jinghua.

328
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,000
Have you ever seen Master Jingxin who gave me that divination stick?

329
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,840
Young Miss.

330
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,300
You haven't prayed yet.

331
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,610
What about you?

332
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:58,910
Have you ever seen him?

333
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,630
He doesn't come here every day.

334
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:01,150
Young Miss.

335
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,460
Let's pray first.

336
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,950
Young Master is coming to pick us up at noon.

337
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,030
Jingxin

338
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:24,380
is him.

339
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,230
Sour jujubes for sale!

340
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:45,710
Over there.

341
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,740
Sour jujubes for sale!

342
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,460
Sour jujubes for sale!

343
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,140
Over there.

344
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:54,930
Miss.

345
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,650
Do you want some sour jujubes?

346
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,020
This isn't right.

347
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,640
We ran so far.

348
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,820
Why are we back here again?

349
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,339
You're right.

350
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:09,470
These people

351
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:10,819
are still here.

352
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:14,609
We've been waiting for you for a long time.

353
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:18,520
We've been waiting for you for a long time.

354
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:23,310
We've been waiting for you for a long time.

355
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,570
If you're capable,

356
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,820
don't cast a spell in the shadows.

357
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,620
Come out!

358
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,580
Why did their spiritual power

359
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,180
suddenly become so chaotic?

360
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,930
I can't drag them out of the dream.

361
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,320
Savior.

362
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,370
What's going on?

363
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,090
They're trapped in a dream.

364
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:03,710
I'm sending spiritual power to them.

365
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:04,970
It can't be stopped during this time.

366
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:05,700
Uncle Zhong,

367
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:06,930
please stay outside.

368
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,560
Don't let anyone disturb me.

369
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,340
Yes.

370
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:13,230
You...

371
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,490
You're Miss Ouyang's husband in her dream?

372
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:22,610
Yes.

373
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,930
I once heard your voice.

374
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,530
You're the one who conspired with Beike

375
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,660
to cause Sleep Condition in Chenzhou.

376
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,710
Your primordial spirit

377
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:34,200
can stay inside and outside of the illusion at the same time?

378
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,470
In this illusion,

379
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,520
everyone's mouth is my mouth.

380
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,240
Everyone's ears are my ears.

381
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,290
Jingxin?

382
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,830
Seventy percent of my spiritual power and primordial spirit

383
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,070
are supporting the illusion inside,

384
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,760
while 30% of them are dealing with you outside.

385
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,020
But you're different.

386
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:51,930
If you want to deal with me,

387
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,720
you have to stop

388
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,500
sending spiritual power to your three friends

389
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,550
before dealing with me.

390
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,210
Then they'll never come back.

391
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,150
What will you choose?

392
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,700
You warlock!

393
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,950
Don't think I'm afraid of you because you're dressed like this.

394
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:16,410
I'm not Jingxin.

395
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:19,160
Jingxin is just my puppet.

396
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,740
As the person my wife trusted the most nine years ago,

397
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,290
his only use was to cast a spell on a blank divination stick

398
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:26,470
and erase my wife's unnecessary memories.

399
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:27,870
But if it weren't for him,

400
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,950
how could you have been brought here?

401
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,010
Why did you trick us

402
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,070
into coming here?

403
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:34,240
My wife and I used to live happily

404
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,240
in this dream.

405
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,840
But the loser, Beike, lost the battle

406
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,350
and caused my wife's primordial spirit to fall into someone else's body.

407
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,850
In order to ensure that my wife's memories won't be awakened

408
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,160
and that her primordial spirit will stay in the dream forever,

409
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,470
I can only invite you here

410
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,930
and destroy the chaotic primordial spirit.

411
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,230
Everyone's primordial spirit

412
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,510
should belong to themselves.

413
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,440
Since you like Miss Ouyang so much,

414
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,160
why don't you live happily with her in reality?

415
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,920
In reality, there're only pecking order, deception, and killings.

416
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,400
But in this paradise,

417
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:04,270
my wife and I love each other.

418
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,300
If she wants to see snow, it'll snow in June.

419
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:10,510
If she wants to see plum blossom, there will be plum blossom every day.

420
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,750
I'll give her

421
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:12,940
whatever she wants.

422
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,610
You're lying to yourself.

423
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,010
You're also lying to her.

424
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,110
If one day you have to do something

425
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,640
because of your own desires

426
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:20,920
and your confession

427
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,560
will make the person you love leave you,

428
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,960
what will you choose?

429
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,600
You'll choose to conceal it and lie to him

430
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,080
like me.

431
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,400
Am I right?

432
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,310
Even if a kind person has no choice

433
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,260
but to lie to people and conceal things,

434
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,330
it's for protection instead of harm.

435
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,190
You tried so hard to create a dream

436
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,090
and erase Miss Ouyang's memories.

437
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:48,460
Are you doing this to cover up

438
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,310
that you killed her parents?

439
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,620
They deserved to die!

440
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,800
Back then, I was hunted by my enemies

441
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,440
and hid at a shabby temple. No one showed mercy.

442
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,910
Only Mingzhu risked her life to treat me.

443
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:09,620
At that moment, I decided to marry her.

444
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:12,220
I worked hard to save money to propose marriage.

445
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,280
But her father wanted to marry Mingzhu to someone else.

446
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,250
The reason was

447
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:21,310
that Mingzhu couldn't marry insects like me who were inferior to pigs or dogs.

448
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,110
So

449
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:24,540
I killed them

450
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,190
like insects.

451
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,490
How dare you!

452
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,520
I'll never let Mingzhu

453
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:33,500
be with a scumbag like you.

454
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,230
Uncle Tanba?

455
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,320
This is an illusion.

456
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,630
Don't be fooled by him.

457
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,560
Here,

458
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,000
I'm God

459
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:04,570
Since you already know everything,

460
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,750
then die with the person outside

461
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,220
together.

462
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:11,860
Soul-Taking Magic!

463
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:17,840
Tianhe!

464
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:20,890
Tianhe!

465
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,480
Mr. Yun.

466
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,600
Mr. Yun.

467
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,170
Tianhe.

468
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:37,400
Leave now.

469
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,320
Okay.

470
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,880
Then die with them.

471
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,310
Stop!

472
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,680
Miss Mingzhu.

473
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,850
You woke up from your dream?

474
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,800
Mingzhu.

475
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:26,970
They're the demons who came through dreams.

476
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,280
I learnt some magic in Chijiang.

477
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:28,760
So I...

478
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:29,520
Li Jiangliu.

479
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,640
How long do you want to lie to me?

480
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,950
You used this divination stick to erase my memories.

481
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:37,210
You made every day of my life repetitive.

482
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,500
You treat me

483
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,430
as your favorite plaything.

484
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:42,110
Mingzhu.

485
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:43,370
No.

486
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,750
I do what you like every day.

487
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,590
I just want to live with you

488
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:49,060
in peace in this dream.

489
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:52,290
I hope you can forget these unimportant things.

490
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,780
I just want to be with you.

491
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:56,990
My family were killed.

492
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:58,910
It's unimportant to you?

493
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,790
I remember everything.

494
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,640
It was you who blinded Jingxin.

495
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,340
It was also you who cast a spell on my parents

496
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,460
and killed them.

497
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,640
And you tricked me into sleeping with my enemy

498
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,370
who killed my family for nine years in this dream.

499
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:14,760
Enemy?

500
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,730
You said I'm your enemy?

501
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,320
It's all your fault.

502
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:48,600
It's your fault for ruining the dream of me and Mingzhu.

503
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:52,510
Uncle! Uncle!

504
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,990
Mingzhu already knows everything.

505
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:34,410
This dream

506
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:38,150
is about to break.

507
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:06,910
Mingzhu.

508
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,350
You're the only person I love.

509
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:12,120
Aren't you happy

510
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,470
these nine years?

511
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,460
Since some things can't be fixed,

512
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:19,070
why

513
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,210
can't we

514
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,360
keep our happiness?

515
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:31,750
Mingzhu!

516
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:33,020
Miss Mingzhu.

517
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:34,710
Send us out of the dream

518
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:36,460
or I'll die here.

519
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,840
Are you really not willing

520
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,760
to give me a chance?

521
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,630
You'd rather die

522
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,870
than be with me.

523
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:20,540
Tianhe.

524
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:21,640
Mengli.

525
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:24,750
How are you?

526
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,110
I'm fine.

527
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:29,990
Lingsha?

528
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,130
You're back, Lingsha.

529
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:32,990
Yes.

530
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:36,310
Mengli.

531
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,150
Lingsha.

532
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,870
How did you get hurt?

533
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,030
I'm fine.

534
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:43,520
Where is Ziying?

535
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:53,950
Ziying.

536
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,880
Mr. Murong.

537
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:03,910
Miss Han.

538
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,080
Yun Tianhe.

539
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,010
You're hurt?

540
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:10,660
I'm fine.

541
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:14,220
But you seem to be seriously injured.

542
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:15,410
I...

543
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,790
In order to protect your bodies

544
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,030
and deal with Li Jiangliu,

545
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,630
Uncle exhausted his energy.

546
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:20,250
Huaishuo.

547
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,770
Luckily, you and Xuanji came in time.

548
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:26,550
Thanks to Miss Liu's prediction.

549
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:27,620
Mengli?

550
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,580
I'll go with Uncle Zhong to see Miss Ouyang.

551
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,590
Go and check

552
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:38,210
if there's a master named Jingxin in Chenzhou.

553
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:40,590
Xuanji.

554
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:44,060
Sister Meng, what's wrong?

555
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,790
If the person who cast the spell

556
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:48,350
did it to help Miss Ouyang forget her pain,

557
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:51,400
then the person who took care of her outside the illusion...

558
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,880
Sister Meng, you mean

559
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:55,870
Uncle Zhong might be the one who cast the spell?

560
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:57,310
I'm just guessing.

561
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:58,870
Please

562
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,430
go find Uncle Zhong's family or friends

563
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:02,390
and ask them about his situation.

564
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,200
OK.

565
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,950
Senior Huaishuo and I will go investigate it now.

566
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:12,890
Xuanji and I went down the mountain by sword

567
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:14,320
and found Uncle Zhong's distant relative.

568
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,840
He took us to his grave.

569
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:18,070
When the Ouyang family were killed nine years ago,

570
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,000
he already died.

571
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,710
Mengli.

572
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,910
You expected these things before.

573
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:25,190
You're amazing.

574
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,850
Stop praising me.

575
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:29,200
If Mr. Murong hadn't tried his best,

576
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,390
we wouldn't have been able to get out.

577
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,050
I'm fine.

578
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,220
Go out and watch Li Jiangliu.

579
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:35,630
Don't let him escape.

580
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:36,090
Yes.

581
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,770
He's outside. I'll go now.

582
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,320
I want to go too.

583
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:39,950
I want to see

584
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,150
what Li Jiangliu looks like.

585
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:41,990
I'll go too.

586
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,510
I'll knock him out again.

587
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:45,350
Knock him out. Hit him.

588
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:46,160
Let's go.

589
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:49,590
Miss Mengli.

590
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:52,350
Li Jiangliu transformed into Uncle Zhong and suddenly attacked me.

591
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,260
Thanks to you.

592
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,840
Didn't you also risk your life

593
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,700
to sending spiritual power to us?

594
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,560
We're out of danger now.

595
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,040
I wonder how Miss Ouyang will face it

596
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,230
when she comes back to reality.

597
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,040
That's also what I'm worried about.

598
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:13,110
If she wakes up,

599
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:14,480
please comfort her.

600
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,250
I'll go check on her.

601
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,870
It turns out that Li Jiangliu

602
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:30,620
could not only be with Miss Ouyang in the dream

603
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,790
but also turned into Uncle Zhong

604
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,600
and took care of Miss Ouyang in reality.

605
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,510
Sister Meng saw through it right away.

606
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:37,910
She's the most beautiful and smartest woman

607
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:39,110
I've ever seen.

608
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,340
But we came late.

609
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:44,230
Otherwise, Uncle Ziying wouldn't have been hurt.

610
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:46,560
But he's an ordinary person.

611
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:48,720
How does he have such a powerful spell?

612
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:50,690
Mingzhu.

613
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,710
Mingzhu.

614
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:55,260
Mingzhu.

615
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,340
-Where is Mingzhu?
-Don't move.

616
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,550
Without the help of a master,

617
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:02,030
how could you travel back and forth between the dream and reality?

618
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:02,950
Who is it?

619
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:04,230
Mingzhu.

620
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:05,070
Mingzhu.

621
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:06,800
Give Mingzhu back to me.

622
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:09,990
Mingzhu.

623
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,080
Mingzhu.

624
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:15,290
Mingzhu.

625
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,000
Miss Han.

626
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,980
I borrowed your body.

627
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,000
I envy you

628
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,960
having Mr. Yun with you in reality.

629
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,560
Don't lie to him.

630
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,890
Be honest with each other.

631
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,470
Why did you say that?

632
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,710
Miss Ouyang is praising me.

633
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:58,350
Li Jiangliu.

634
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,960
In the dream, you asked me

635
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:03,130
if I can give you another chance.

636
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:04,600
OK.

637
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:07,220
I'll give you a chance to tell the truth.

638
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,670
Did you collude with the demon clan

639
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:12,480
to cause the people of Chenzhou Sleep Condition?

640
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,260
I supported the dream for nine years.

641
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:24,880
When my spiritual power was unable to support it,

642
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,350
Beike found me.

643
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:30,190
He exchanged the purple crystal for my two rosaries.

644
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:33,880
The spiritual power of the purple crystal could help me.

645
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,490
So I agreed.

646
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,090
What about Jingxin?

647
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,640
What did you do to him?

648
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,960
I know Jingxin protects you like a brother.

649
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,900
I destroyed one of his eyes

650
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,750
out of jealousy and hatred.

651
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:47,720
I felt guilty.

652
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,540
I wouldn't kill him.

653
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,200
I just knocked him out

654
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,400
and hid him in the shabby Ouyang Mansion.

655
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:58,910
In the past nine years,

656
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,360
I turned into Uncle Zhong

657
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:05,510
to take care of you in reality

658
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,850
and accompanied you

659
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,250
as your Li in the dream.

660
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,990
I only want you.

661
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,240
My saviors.

662
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,410
This disaster was caused

663
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:23,900
by the grudge between me and him.

664
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,490
Leave him to me to deal with.

665
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:28,160
I think so too.

666
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,440
Although he's hateful,

667
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:33,890
he loves Miss Ouyang.

668
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:36,310
Let's give them a minute.

669
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,650
Let them say goodbye for the last time.

670
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,290
Let's go.

671
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,280
Mingzhu.

672
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,160
I know you hate me so much.

673
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,410
But please promise me

674
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:02,760
that you won't leave me.

675
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:07,840
I won't leave you.

676
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:10,510
But Li,

677
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:15,440
the ill-fated relationship between us

678
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:17,630
should end.

679
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,260
This cut

680
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:29,960
is for my parents

681
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,030
and those who died from it.

682
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:36,580
I must avenge

683
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,949
my parents' deaths.

684
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,159
Mingzhu.

685
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:54,940
Why are you doing this?

686
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,160
You know

687
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,620
I'll give you whatever you want,

688
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,410
even if it's my life.

689
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:07,590
What a pity.

690
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:12,060
I've prepared a gift for you.

691
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,870
But you don't want to see it.

692
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,410
Li.

693
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,060
This was the last time I called you

694
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,630
in this world.

695
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,810
The love you gave me in these nine years

696
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,500
in my dream

697
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:49,530
has already won my heart.

698
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:53,610
What a pity.

699
00:35:58,130 --> 00:35:59,660
We can't grow old together.

700
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:06,790
Mingzhu!

701
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,940
Mingzhu. Mingzhu.

702
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:09,990
Mingzhu.

703
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,480
I...

704
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,260
I promise you

705
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,340
that I won't leave you.

706
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:20,810
No.

707
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,480
From now on,

708
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:27,800
there will be no Li and Mingzhu in this world.

709
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,210
Mingzhu.

710
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,150
Mingzhu.

711
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,000
Mingzhu.

712
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,400
Mingzhu!

713
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:49,040
Mingzhu!
