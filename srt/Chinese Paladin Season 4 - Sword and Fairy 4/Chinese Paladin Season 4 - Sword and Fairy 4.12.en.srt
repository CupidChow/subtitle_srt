they're wearing costumes.

8
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,090
Not everyone is human here.

00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,289
There are demons too.

10
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,070
But it's quite rare

11
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,500
to have a place where humans and demons coexist peacefully

12
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,560
in the human world.

13
00:01:57,789 --> 00:01:58,670
I used to think

14
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,570
Qingluan Peak was the only place

15
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,020
where humans and demons could live together.

16
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,590
I didn’t expect there’s Boxian Town too.

If my father knew about Boxian Town,

18

he would be very happy.

Don't be happy too soon.

you got the wrong person.

Why are you dressed like this?

28
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,910
I've become the most handsome Sword Immortal.

Do I not look like Murong Ziying?

Yes.

32

I'll give you five taels of silver.

80
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,300
No way.

81
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,510

Our charms

95
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,520
are drawn by the hall's boss.

96
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,630
They're invincible.

97
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,630
I used to think

98
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,159
my boss

99
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,590
was the most beautiful girl in Boxian Town.

100

This is our boss.

104
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,940

105
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,960
What do you think?

106
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,090

but this is how women are.

110
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,410
No matter how beautiful she is, she's not satisfied with herself in the mirror.

111
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:27,010
I have charms for fair skin,

112
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,120
long legs,

113
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,470
and balance between fat and thin.

114
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,930
Recite the spell once and you'll be good for a day.

115
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,030
However, there's one more thing.

116
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:33,920
If you want to change yourself

117
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,950
to satisfy men's taste,

118
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,700
forgive me for not hosting you.

119
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:39,909
We share the same view with you.

120
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,770
We won't ingratiate ourselves

121
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,640
just because we're a woman.

122
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:44,460
That's right.

123
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,580
I'm a heroine in the Martial World.

124
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,960
I like girls like you.

125
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:53,409
Then, I'll give you

126
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,970
a submissive charm.

127
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,990
Put it on the stinky man who you want to submit to you

128
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,350
and he'll immediately become submissive.

129
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,230
No need.

130
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,350
He's already a good boy now.

131
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,310
We're here to ask you

132
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,430
about something.

133
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:09,190
There's a beauty that I can't forget.

134
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,890
One day without seeing her,

135
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,820
I'm filled with yearning.

136
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,510
Do you want to die?

137
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,850
Can't you see I'm talking to friends?

138
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,950
You can be friends with these two girls,

139
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:27,610
but why are you friends with this bratty boy too?

140
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,210
You can call me a boy,

141
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,920
but can you not call me a brat?

142
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,250
If you make any more trouble,

143
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,490
I'll ask someone to

144
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,250
sweep you out with the flowers.

145
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,310
What did you two want to know?

146
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,290
Just ask me.

147
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:41,670
I'll answer if I know.

148
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,110
We want to ask you

149
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,909
about this jade on Mengli.

150
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,590
Do you know about it?

151
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:49,930
Miss,

152
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,510
where did you get this jade?

153
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,790
I've been wearing it since I was young.

154
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,560
Sir,

155
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,650
do you know the origin of this jade?

156
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,200
I really...

157
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:03,080
Miss, don’t listen to him.

158
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,020
Feng Changge is an expert in eating and playing.

159
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:08,140
What else does he know?

160
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:11,540
I saw this item in an ancient book

161
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,830
from the Qingfeng Sect's Treasure Pavilion.

162
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,670
Really?

163
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,190
Don't lie to us.

164
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:16,870
Yes.

165
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,340
Even the Kunxu eight sects have to

166
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,110
respect the Qingfeng Sect.

167
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,550
How could they let you go to the Treasure Pavilion so easily?

168
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,950
My name is Feng Changge.

169
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,310
Naturally, I have some connections to the Qingfeng Sect.

170
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,430
That's all I will say.

171
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:31,870
Sir,

172
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,270
can you take us to the Qingfeng Pavilion?

173
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,270
Impossible.

174
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:40,850
How about this?

175
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,240
Take them to the Qingfeng Pavilion

176
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,240
and I promise to have a meal with you.

177
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,909
If I can have a date with Dili,

178
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,150
I'll make an exception.

179
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:54,140
Look.

180
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,110
Are we a great match?

181
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:00,500
Yes.

182
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,660
Mr. Feng Changge,

183
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,340
what do you have to do with the Qingfeng Sect?

184
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,630
I've been in Boxian Town for three years.

185
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,420
The world might not know Boxian Town,

186
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:16,430
but everyone knows the Qingfeng Sect.

187
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:17,760
I heard

188
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:21,540
that the master of the Qingfeng Sect is called Feng Er.

189
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,680
Miss, you are knowledgeable,

190
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,040
but you can't call him by his name.

191
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,610
You must call him Lord Feng Er.

192
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,940
In this city,

193
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,770
Lord Feng Er is extremely powerful.

194
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:33,919
He has two brothers

195
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,720
known as the Black and White Evils.

196
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,450
-They help manage the entire Boxian Town.
-Stop.

197
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,120
I don't want to hear this.

198
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,039
Just tell me

199
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,679
if we have to

200
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,990
go through some ritual

201
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,710
in order to meet Lord Feng Er.

202
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:48,230
Lord Feng Er is very mysterious

203
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,390
and hard to find.

204
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,570
I heard that no one has seen him,

205
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,760
other than the Black and White Evils.

206
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,500
Some even said his spiritual power

207
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,370
has far surpassed the Xianshan eight sects

208
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,690
and he's traveling the world already.

209
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:59,550
Anyway,

210
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,760
Lord Feng Er is my idol

211
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,960
and the Qingfeng Sect

212
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,890
is the biggest sect in the Martial World.

213
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:09,610
It's also the intelligence center of the Martial World.

214
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:10,450
Here,

215
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,910
there's nothing and no one

216
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,590
who can't be found.

217
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:14,890
Lingsha,

218
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,830
do your fists also feel itchy,

219
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,650
like you want to hit someone?

220
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,110
Mr. Feng,

221
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,320
would you be able to

222
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:27,680
take us to the Qingfeng Pavilion if Lord Feng Er isn't there?

223
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,150
I...

224
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,290
This is the Qingfeng Pavilion.

225
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,960
Have fun.

226
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,560
I’m leaving.

227
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,820
Put your foot down.

228
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,830
If you do this, you'll lose your head in the Qingfeng Pavilion.

229
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,090
Didn't you promise Dilibai'er

230
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,270
to take us into the Qingfeng Pavilion?

231
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:52,790
Yes.

232
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,030
I brought you here.

233
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,560
I didn’t say I’d take you in.

234
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,150
Mr. Feng,

235
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,690
if what you said is true,

236
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,280
can you tell us how we can see

237
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,710
the books of the Qingfeng Sect?

238
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,790
This would reveal the Qingfeng Sect's secret.

239
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,860
I can't tell you,

240
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,500
but the Martial World has its rules.

241
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,610
This girl knows the rules.

242
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,570
The Qingfeng Pavilion has two floors.

243
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:22,730
The first floor

244
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,090
is for guests and those staying at the inn.

245
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,830
The second floor is the most important.

246
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,720
The second floor

247
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,380
is divided into the Library Pavilion and the Treasure Pavilion.

248
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,870
Ordinary people can't enter. That's a forbidden area.

249
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,270
Back then, I was lucky

250
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,500
to see a picture

251
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,710
of this jade in the Library Pavilion.

252
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,790
Today is the full moon.

253
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:55,080
There happens to be a way to enter the Qingfeng Pavilion,

254
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,210
but I can't tell you.

255
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,550
Stop digging.

256
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,030
I can't tell you even if you give me money.

257
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,830
If I continue,

258
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,390
all three of you will die.

259
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,320
You're not going to tell me the most important thing after you scammed me?

260
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,510
Do you want to get hit?

261
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:07,950
Listen.

262
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,620
Don’t make trouble in front of the Qingfeng Pavilion.

263
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,680
The Black and White Evils will hit you

264
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,450
and you.

265
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,390
Don't go.

266
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,710
Come.

267
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,160
Hurry up.

268
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,280
Come.

269
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:19,630
Don't go.

270
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,430
Gentlemen,

271
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:21,580
please spare me.

272
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,080
Come in and play.

273
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,600
I'm not feeling well today.

274
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,800
I'm not feeling well.

275
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,410
What do you mean?

276
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,170
You just don't dare to enter on the full moon.

277
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:28,970
Goodbye.

278
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:29,610
Move.

279
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,750
Come on.

280
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:33,960
They don't dare to enter the Qingfeng Pavilion today.

281
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,060
Why don't we leave first?

282
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,470
Yes, this lady is right.

283
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,190
This jade is not as important as your lives.

284
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,510
Hurry and go.

285
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,790
Hurry.

286
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:44,430
Come and find me.

287
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,560
I'm waiting for you here.

288
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,040
What's wrong, Mengli?

289
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,530
Your jade lit up.

290
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,920
I heard that voice again.

291
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,100
He said he's here

292
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,200
and asked me to find him.

293
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,390
Then...

294
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,810
It seems that the secret of this jade

295
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,320
is indeed in the Qingfeng Pavilion.

296
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,120
Let's talk about it another day.

297
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:09,970
They...

298
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,960
Lord Qiang San, Lord Ming Si.

299
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,790
Greetings from Feng.

300
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:16,690
Greetings.

301
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,860
These three look unfamiliar.

302
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:21,310
These three are foreigners who passed by.

303
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,290
Foreigners?

304
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:25,040
Foreigners.

305
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,840
We want to enter the Qingfeng Pavilion.

306
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,890
What a coincidence.

307
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:31,430
Today is a good day for outsiders to enter the Qingfeng Pavilion.

308
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,960
It's a full moon.

309
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,370
If we can go in today,

310
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,150
why did those people avoid it?

311
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:39,750
Qingfeng Pavilion is a place where humans and demons coexist.

312
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,220
There is a celestial beast called Five-Poison Beast.

313
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,300
It likes to play games with people.

314
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,750
What games?

315
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:49,070
Wrestling with best out of five rounds.

316
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,760
That's it?

317
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:51,950
That's it.

318
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:55,290
At most, we'll just place bets and cheer you on.

319
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,200
It's for fun.

320
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,190
Yes, don't worry.

321
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,710
The Five-Poison Beast's name sounds scary,

322
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:01,960
but it's very cute.

323
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:02,790
Cute.

324
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,070
I'm good at playing games.

325
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:05,870
Don't try to be brave.

326
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,510
We don't know what's going on inside.

327
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,230
Tianhe,

328
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,190
let's get things clear before we go in.

329
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:10,900
Don't worry.

330
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,140
It's just a game.

331
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,550
Whoever sprawls on the ground will lose.

332
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,080
Your life won't be in danger.

333
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,190
We won't go to the extreme.

334
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:16,720
Yes.

335
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,760
Okay.

336
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,110
I'll play with it,

337
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,560
but I have a request.

338
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,180
I want to bring my friends in.

339
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,570
No problem.

340
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:24,730
Mr. Changge,

341
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,820
do you want to go in together?

342
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:26,690
Come place a bet.

343
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:27,550
How about this?

344
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,680
I brought him here

345
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,690
and this money was given by them,

346
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,840
so I'll bet on this guy.

347
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,040
Okay.

348
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,630
Prepare the money that you'll lose.

349
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,620
Let's go then.

350
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,660
Let's go.

351
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,480
Hurry.

352
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:39,940
You...

353
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,520
Keep up.

354
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,150
Come in, please.

355
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,570
Keep up.

356
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,540
Let's go.

357
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,100
That ugly artist looks much better here.

358
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,670
These people all look weird.

359
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,110
Miss, watch your mouth.

360
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:05,910
Demons have higher status than humans here.

361
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,690
Sir,

362
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,670
the game has begun.

363
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,510
Let's go.

364
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,750
Let's go.

365
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:13,900
Together.

366
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,510
Everyone,

367
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:29,220
we'll have an interesting show today.

368
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:32,960
This Mr. Yun wants to play with the Five-Poison Beast.

369
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,830
It's him.

370
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:37,720
Five-Poison, Five-Poison.

371
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,420
Everyone,

372
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,660
please place your bets.

373
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,350
I'll go get the Five-Poison Beast.

374
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,000
This guy looks weak.

375
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,350
I'll definitely bet on Five-Poison.

376
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,190
No matter who comes, I'll bet on Five-Poison.

377
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,310
Yes, Five-Poison will definitely win.

378
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:56,620
-Five-Poison will definitely win.
-Will you be okay?

379
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,310
Tianhe,

380
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,320
let's go.

381
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,990
I don't feel any murderous auras here.

382
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:01,590
It's fine.

383
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,470
When I go up to fight the Five-Poison Beast,

384
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,400
you two slip away to find the books.

385
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,560
Five-Poison.

386
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:14,760
What are they chanting?

387
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:34,720
Five-Poison.

388
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,510
You lied.

389
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,050
How is this cute?

390
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,670
Tianhe, let's not play this.

391
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,740
If you break your promise,

392
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,260
we won't hold back anymore.

393
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,390
You...

394
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,670
I thought it was going to be a big demon,

395
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,730
but it's just a strange little thing.

396
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,540
Remember what I said.

397
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:54,240
Let's go.

398
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:54,770
Go.

399
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,160
Come on.

400
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:02,270
Whoever gets down first will lose.

401
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:03,430
Yes.

402
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,590
The bets are all placed.

403
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:09,390
We will begin now.

404
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,100
Five-Poison,

405
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,020
teach him a lesson.

406
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,970
I thought I was the most deeply in love.

407
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,670
I didn't expect this guy

408
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,360
would risk his life for a girl.

409
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,120
Tianhe is fighting with the Five-Poison Beast

410
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,310
so we can look for the book.

411
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:03,710
The faster we do it, the less he will suffer.

412
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,640
Five-Poison.

413
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:22,109
Five-Poison.

414
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,910
Well done!

415
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,340
Knock him down!

416
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,230
There are games downstairs.

417
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,900
There are games upstairs too,

418
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,680
so let them play for longer.

419
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:51,950
Lingsha.

420
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:58,910
Who are you?

421
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:05,520
This is the Qingfeng Pavilion's important area. Leave now.

422
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,180
Is she pretty?

423
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,190
You...

424
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,070
Idiots.

425
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:13,670
Let's go.

426
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,290
The Qingfeng Sect really deserves its reputation.

427
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:27,380
I wonder who the master is.

428
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,720
He has so many treasures.

429
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,780
I've never seen so many books before.

430
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,680
Lingsha, look at this poem.

431
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:37,350
The person who can write this poem

432
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:40,020
must be a willful wanderer.

433
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,070
I saw poems by Tianhe's father

434
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,690
[I break the clouds and meet the stars with my sword. I raise my cup and sing to make the phoenix fly.]

435
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,890
on the walls of Shichengxi Cave.

436
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,280
His style and writing

437
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,890
is exactly the same as this.

438
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,120
If Uncle Yun had been here,

439
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:51,020
there must be a book

440
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,570
with recordings about the Princess Jade.

441
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,290
Why is there a barrier here?

442
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,370
Who dares to break into the Treasure Pavilion?

443
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,350
Who are you?

444
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,470
Little Pig Demon.

445
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,820
Stinky woman, why is it you again?

446
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,750
Why is there another stinky woman?

447
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,600
You stinky pig! Mind your words!

448
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,000
Her name is Mengli.

449
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,820
She is my and Tianhe's best friend.

450
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,420
Well,

451
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,840
we're looking for a book.

452
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,980
Tianhe is fighting with the Five-Poison Beast,

453
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,300
so if you keep talking,

454
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,390
we'll all be dead meat.

455
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:26,150
What?

456
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,190
Brat is here too?

457
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,480
No one can walk away from

458
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:32,240
wrestling with the Five-Poison Beast standing.

459
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,700
They're here.

460
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,360
-Hurry and leave.
-Come on.

461
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,260
Let's go.

462
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:37,690
Okay.

463
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,620
Form a prison on the ground.

464
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,540
Ladies,

465
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,060
do you know that trespassing the Treasure Pavilion

466
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:51,440
will get you beheaded?

467
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:52,830
What do you want?

468
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:58,110
Someone will ask you this soon.

469
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,230
Ladies,

470
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,270
that silly boy risked his life

471
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,680
to fight the Five-Poison Beast

472
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,990
so you could come here.

473
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,790
Is it just for a book?

474
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,910
What exactly do you want?

475
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,270
From luring us to Qingfeng Pavilion

476
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,400
to having Tianhe fight the Five-Poison Beast

477
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,800
was all your plan, right?

478
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:18,950
Feng Changge,

479
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,510
you're full of lies!

480
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,110
No, no, no.

481
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,220
My admiration for Dilibai'er

482
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,990
is real.

483
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,420
The way Five-Poison Beast looked at you was also real.

484
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,590
The only person that it would look at so respectfully

485
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,990
would be the master of Qingfeng Pavilion, Feng Er.

486
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:34,740
How dare you

487
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,640
call Master by his name?

488
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,980
Are you really Feng Er?

489
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:41,630
You have so many treasures, but you still wanted my money?

490
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:44,560
Otherwise, how could you come in and get caught by me?

491
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,410
All three of you have spiritual power.

492
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,960
[Feng Er, Master of the Qingfeng Sect]

493
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,020
You're not ordinary people.

494
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,220
The Qingfeng Sect can tolerate demons,

495
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,900
but not people with evil intentions.

496
00:20:58,670 --> 00:20:59,530
Take them away.

497
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,270
How dare you be rude to me?

498
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,110
Let's go.

499
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:05,700
Let's go.

500
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:17,870
Tianhe.

501
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,250
Hit him!

502
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,050
Five-Poison.

503
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,230
Didn't you say it wouldn't go to the extremes?

504
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:30,560
How can the Qingfeng Sect break promises?

505
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,840
Tied two to two.

506
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:40,530
Great!

507
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:44,690
Feng Changge,

508
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:48,250
why are they taking Lingsha and Mengli away?

509
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:48,930
Tianhe,

510
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:51,420
he is Feng Er, Master of the Qingfeng Sect.

511
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,070
Feng Er?

512
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,100
You're the master?

513
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,120
Then can you release

514
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,280
Lingsha and Mengli?

515
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:09,870
We...

516
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:11,660
We really just want to check

517
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,350
the ancient book about Mengli's jade.

518
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,320
I told you before

519
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:18,820
you would die if you broke into the Qingfeng Pavilion's forbidden area,

520
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,080
but you didn't listen and still broke in.

521
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:24,020
Did you really sacrifice your life for a book?

522
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,520
Impossible.

523
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:34,870
Fine.

524
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,460
Kill me

525
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:39,800
and let them go.

526
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,110
It's too boring to let you die so easily.

527
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,440
How about this?

528
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,520
Fight against the Five-Poison Beast for another round.

529
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,080
Again?

530
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:50,800
But

531
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:53,090
it won't be a game. It'll be life or death.

532
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,550
You can use your weapon.

533
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,890
If you die, you pay with your life.

534
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:56,650
If you win,

535
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,450
I'll give you the book.

536
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,140
Sure.

537
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:02,900
Deal.

538
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:16,830
Hit him!

539
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,610
Hit him!

540
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:38,050
Five-Poison.

541
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:40,480
The celestial beast is about to kill again.

542
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:50,380
It's not fair for a celestial beast to attack

543
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,430
a regular person with a spell.

544
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,320
I know spells.

545
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:53,320
Let me fight.

546
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,080
Mengi.

547
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,690
You know magic?

548
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:58,130
Sure.

549
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,940
Let us see it.

550
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,000
Mengli, don't come over.

551
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,290
It will absorb your spiritual power.

552
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,380
I'm right beside you.

553
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,560
Why won't you come find me?

554
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,960
Come find me!

555
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:34,390
Mengli!

556
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:35,950
Mengli!

557
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,300
Mengli, are you alright?

558
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:54,590
This is...

559
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,320
Tianhe.

560
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,840
Why are you so stupid?

561
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:19,300
Get down from there.

562
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:24,280
Tianhe, be careful.

563
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,340
Lingsha.

564
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,060
Lingsha.

565
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,010
Sir.

566
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,430
What happened?

567
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:34,560
Sir,

568
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:36,180
let's stop here.

569
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,110
You two,

570
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,670
take the girls inside for medical treatment.

571
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:40,150
Okay.

572
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,520
Don't touch her.

573
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,200
Sir,

574
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:45,780
please trust me.

575
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:08,120
How is Lingsha?

576
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,950
Didn't you give her the Spirit-Reinforcement Elixir

577
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:11,880
and the Spirit-Returning Elixir?

578
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,740
Strange.

579
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:16,110
Logically, these two elixirs

580
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:17,690
should be effective immediately,

581
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:19,550
but why is it ineffective for her?

582
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:21,350
Her pulse is extremely weak.

583
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:23,830
Her cold is uncommon too.

584
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:25,410
Well,

585
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:26,950
do you have any...

586
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:28,740
Any uncommon elixirs for her?

587
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:32,220
I only have one acupuncture method left.

588
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,680
If she can't wake up within two hours,

589
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,480
I'm afraid...

590
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:38,720
I'll do my best.

591
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:40,880
If you have a way, then try it.

592
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,280
Stop talking about stuff.

593
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,720
Alright, calm down.

594
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,940
I was just saying.

595
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,180
Pricking the acupoints in her arm

596
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,150
should work.

597
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:49,860
Undo her sleeves.

598
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,740
Tianhe, let him try.

599
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:57,650
Lingsha, don't worry.

600
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,170
Loosen your grip first.

601
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,280
I'll keep an eye on your Qiankun bag.

602
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,040
What is this?

603
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:13,370
Fuyao Immortal Fruit Elixir?

604
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:14,630
Why does she have this?

605
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:16,900
This is a priceless elixir.

606
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,510
Then, can this priceless elixir

607
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,270
cure Lingsha's cold physique?

608
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,000
I'd spent fortunes to find this elixir to no avail before.

609
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,240
I heard it can cure all diseases.

610
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,200
This girl is so weak,

611
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,260
but she's still clutching this bag tightly.

612
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,000
It means she knows this elixir can save her.

613
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,440
But she wants to cure her sister,

614
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:38,590
not herself.

615
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,040
We can't worry about that.

616
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,970
Lingsha's life is more important.

617
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,670
Lingsha, here.

618
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:00,430
Hurry and look.

619
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:01,960
Here.

620
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,310
It really is a magical elixir.

621
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:10,170
Her pulse is instantly stabilized

622
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:11,580
and the cold is mostly gone too.

623
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,440
She's fine now.

624
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,390
Great.

625
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,650
Lingsha, lie down for a while.

626
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:22,220
But Tianhe,

627
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,400
how should we explain to Lingsha tomorrow

628
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,800
that we gave her the elixir?

629
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,400
It's okay.

630
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,290
I've made up my mind.

631
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:30,170
Since her employer gave her the elixir,

632
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:31,680
it means they're a good person too.

633
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,870
Worst case scenario, I can ask him for another one

634
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:34,130
after I go to Qionghua.

635
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,520
Can you get me one too?

636
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,070
I'll pay as much as you want.

637
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,690
It's all because of you.

638
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,010
If it weren't for you,

639
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:41,940
Lingsha wouldn't be in this state.

640
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:43,070
Also,

641
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,910
you must keep your promise.

642
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,940
I defeated the Five-Poison Beast.

643
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:47,940
You have to give me

644
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:50,750
the ancient book that contains Mengli's jade.

645
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:51,310
Okay.

646
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:53,360
And let the Little Pig Demon go.

647
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,110
The Little Pig Demon is also here?

648
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,050
Please don't be angry.

649
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:58,010
The Little Pig Demon is fine.

650
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:58,830
Tomorrow,

651
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:00,270
I will seriously tell you

652
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:02,270
everything behind this.

653
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,660
I've sent someone to tidy up the master's room.

654
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,190
Sir, please go to rest.

655
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,790
We are just outside guests.

656
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:12,630
How can Tianhe stay in the master's room?

657
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,430
Of the entire Qingfeng Sect,

658
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:17,180
only he can stay in the master's room.

659
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:19,660
I see.

660
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:22,110
It must be because I defeated

661
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:23,230
the most powerful demon here,

662
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:23,710
right?

663
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,020
By the way, how is the Five-Poison Beast?

664
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:33,370
Ming and Qiang are taking care of it.

665
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:36,030
You absorbed all of its spiritual power.

666
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,980
It probably won't survive the night.

667
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:40,240
What?

668
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:00,220
If you have the Five-Poison Beast's spiritual power,

669
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,500
your power will increase exponentially.

670
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,330
Ordinary people would do anything for this.

671
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:05,270
I won't steal anything from others,

672
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,530
let alone their lives.

673
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,700
Plus, it's not an evil demon.

674
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:14,000
Five-Poison Beast,

675
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,510
will you trust me?

676
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:30,870
I'll return your spiritual power to you.

677
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:54,880
How dare you trick the Five-Poison Beast?

678
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,810
I didn't mean it.

679
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,630
Should I try again?

680
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,550
But

681
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,550
what if I mess up again

682
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,830
and you shrink to the size of an egg?

683
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:05,700
Five-Poison,

684
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:08,560
this young man hasn't learned how to transfer spiritual power yet.

685
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,840
He can't transmit all the spiritual power to you,

686
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,990
but this is enough to keep you alive.

687
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:14,900
Don't worry.

688
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,570
After I learn magic on the mountain,

689
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:18,660
I'll return the spiritual power to you.

690
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,910
I don’t believe you’ll return and give it back.

691
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:21,580
I do.

692
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,220
Then I believe you too,

693
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,360
but tomorrow,

694
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,760
we must see the book

695
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:29,220
and the Little Pig Demon.

696
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:29,950
Don't worry.

697
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,640
I will tell you everything I know.

698
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,190
Tianhe.

699
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,370
When did you wash Lingsha's clothes?

700
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:01,680
Last night.

701
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,360
I slept after drying them.

702
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,140
Lingsha slept well last night.

703
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,180
When did you make the porridge?

704
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,940
I cooked it this morning,

705
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,650
but the porridge is too hot.

706
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,190
I'm letting it cool down now.

707
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:16,320
Lingsha can drink it after she gets up.

708
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:19,200
Hey,

709
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:21,450
can you two stop being so nice to me?

710
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:22,910
Lingsha.

711
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,150
You're awake.

712
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,450
How do you feel?

713
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,670
I'm totally fine.

714
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:33,600
I even feel very energetic.

715
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,280
That's great.

716
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:37,750
Didn't I faint due to cold a few days ago?

717
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:38,810
Ziying took days to heal me.

718
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:40,000
How did you heal me?

719
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:52,370
Why don't you eat the porridge first?

720
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,710
Otherwise, if you get angry later,

721
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:55,110
you might not be able to stomach the porridge.

722
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,790
Angry? Why should I be angry?

723
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:13,710
Where's my elixir?

724
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:18,760
Did...

725
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:20,190
You...

726
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,620
If you're angry,

727
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:22,969
just hit and scold me.

728
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:26,550
My employer

729
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,480
got it from his master with so much difficulty.

730
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,050
Now, you gave it to me.

731
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,389
What about my sister?

732
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:33,590
Lingsha,

733
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:35,830
you were unconscious and your life was at stake yesterday.

734
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:37,560
Feng Er and I couldn't cure you,

735
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:39,989
so we had to give you the elixir.

736
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:41,719
That Feng Er is a liar.

737
00:34:41,969 --> 00:34:43,880
If he hadn't asked Tianhe to fight the Five-Poison Beast,

738
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,340
this elixir wouldn't have been wasted on me.

739
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:49,429
Mengli,

740
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:50,400
how are you?

741
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:52,590
I saw you lost your spiritual power yesterday.

742
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,389
You couldn't even use your harp.

743
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:55,750
I heard that person's voice

744
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,110
twice in a row.

745
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,420
He kept telling me

746
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:59,180
he was here

747
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,530
and asked me to find him.

748
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:03,050
Every time I hear that voice,

749
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,230
I become very weak

750
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:05,220
and unwell.

751
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:07,720
I seriously suspect that

752
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,750
he's trapped in the Qingfeng Pavilion

753
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:10,050
like the Little Pig Demon.

754
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,370
You're all here?

755
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:14,910
Miss Lingsha, you...

756
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,740
It seems that you're fine.

757
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:20,330
Lord Feng Er asked me to inform you

758
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:22,160
that if you have finished your meal,

759
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,800
please come to the hall.

760
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:24,570
You may leave.

761
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:25,220
Okay.

762
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:25,810
Okay.

763
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:27,660
Okay.

764
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:29,490
He went out just like that?

765
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:31,820
Is this the Lord Qiang San I saw yesterday?

766
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:33,500
How did he become

767
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,400
so obedient suddenly?

768
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:37,190
This is strange too.

769
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:38,330
It's not only him.

770
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,980
Lord Feng Er is also extremely respectful to us,

771
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,240
especially to Tianhe.

772
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,280
Anyway, Feng Er is a hypocrite.

773
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,120
There must be something amiss.

774
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,040
We can't go.

775
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,120
We have to go.

776
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,300
This might be the only chance

777
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,500
to find that book.

778
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,080
Plus, I want to see the Little Pig Demon.

779
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:02,670
Got it?

780
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:03,950
Yes.

781
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:13,160
You liar Feng Er.

782
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,460
What are you trying to do with so many people here?

783
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,020
Miss Han,

784
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,130
we didn't know each other yesterday,

785
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,890
so it caused a misunderstanding,

786
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:19,920
but when I saw

787
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,950
the Zao jade on Mr. Yun's neck,

788
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,000
I realized that

789
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:25,430
I almost caused a disaster.

790
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:26,250
Sir,

791
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:29,550
who are Yun Tianqing and Su Yu to you?

792
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,240
They are my parents.

793
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:33,970
You know them?

794
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,040
Brothers.

795
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:38,990
Young Master,

796
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:40,370
please accept our bow.

797
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,610
Please accept our bow.

798
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:45,140
Sir,

799
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:46,570
the Qingfeng Sect

800
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:48,750
was founded by Brother Yun Tianqing,

801
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,080
so you are

802
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,380
the young master of the Qingfeng Sect.

803
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,560
My father created the Qingfeng Sect?

804
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,860
But he never told me.

805
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,520
Master Feng Er,

806
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:04,870
what's going on?

807
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,190
Let them get up first.

808
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:10,510
I've never been a young master.

809
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,620
Please get up.

810
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,160
Thank you, Young Master.

811
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:17,320
Get up.

812
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:17,880
Stand up.

813
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:18,690
Young Master,

814
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,040
just call me Feng Er.

815
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:21,600
Nineteen years ago,

816
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,560
Brother Yun Tianqing saved us humans and demons

817
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,290
who were struggling to survive.

818
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:26,950
After that,

819
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:28,570
he founded the Qingfeng Sect.

820
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:29,380
Qing

821
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,720
naturally stands for

822
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,980
Brother Yun Tianqing.

823
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:32,780
Feng

824
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,480
is me, Feng Er.

825
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:36,390
Feng Er,

826
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,550
are you making up stories again?

827
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:39,130
No, no.

828
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:39,870
Lingsha,

829
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,020
I think it's true.

830
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,920
Not many people in the world

831
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:45,480
pity demons like Uncle Yun.

832
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:48,940
Tianhe,

833
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:50,460
invite your father out.

834
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:53,410
Their reaction will show if they're telling the truth or not.

835
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:55,070
Is Brother Tianqing back too?

836
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:56,990
I haven’t seen him for ten years.

837
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:58,190
We all miss him.

838
00:37:58,490 --> 00:37:59,680
Yes.

839
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:00,830
My father is here.

840
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:06,210
Father.

841
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,470
[Yun Tianqing]

842
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:17,980
Brother Tianqing has passed away.

843
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,060
Brother Tianqing!

844
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,600
Brother Tianqing!

845
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,610
It should be true.

846
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:40,670
I feel people would only cry like this

847
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:41,930
if their fathers died.

848
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,470
With their fierce looks, I didn't expect them

849
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,530
to be so sincere and loyal.

850
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:58,710
It seems that

851
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,440
everyone really loved my father deeply.

852
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:12,640
Let's burn incense together for my father.

853
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,160
Okay.

854
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:15,210
Young Master, this way.

855
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:40,950
Father,

856
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:44,360
I just learned that you founded the Qingfeng Sect.

857
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:47,130
You saved so many people and demons.

858
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:51,490
I finally understand your long-cherished wish.

859
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:53,670
Don't worry, Father.

860
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,200
I will make the Qingfeng Pavilion

861
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:58,360
be a place where humans and demons

862
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,560
can coexist, like Qingluan Peak.

863
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:39,790
Please get up.

864
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:41,430
Thank you, Young Master.

865
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,470
Since I'm the young master,

866
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:48,780
I will tell you

867
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,890
that my father's biggest wish

868
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:53,190
was for humans and demons

869
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,050
to coexist peacefully.

870
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:56,660
From now on,

871
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,070
demons aren't allowed to bully humans

872
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:00,530
by playing games anymore.

873
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,600
Young Master,

874
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:06,470
the Qingfeng Sect took in many demon clans

875
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,960
who were killed by humans.

876
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:11,220
This game was so demons could vent their anger.

877
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:14,070
It was mismanagement on my part.

878
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,110
From now on,

879
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:21,770
what the Qingfeng Sect should do

880
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:25,190
is to resolve the disputes between humans and demons.

881
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:29,100
We need to truly live in peace.

882
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:37,370
We will follow the Young Master's orders.

883
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,080
Get up.

884
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,810
Let them get up.

885
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,230
Get up.

886
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,760
From now on,

887
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,630
don't kneel like this anymore.

888
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:52,840
My father didn't have

889
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,290
so many hierarchical rules on Qingluan Peak.

890
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:58,350
I could call my father by his full name when I was little.

891
00:41:59,020 --> 00:41:59,830
Yes, Young Master.
