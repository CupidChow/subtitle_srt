[Episode 17]

4
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,060
Father,

5
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,509
Elder Qingyang said you would come here

6
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,430
when you were frustrated.

7
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,420
You must be very sad today too.

8
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,550
In my heart,

9
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,120
[Yun Tianqing]

10
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:56,680
you're missing a piece, just like this memorial tablet.

11
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,460
I want to know how to mend it.

12
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,850
Maybe your true best friend Xuan Xiao

13
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,000
can tell me the truth.

14
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,350
Tianhe.

15
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,660
I couldn't sleep so I came out for a walk.

16
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,660
I wandered here without realizing.

17
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,490
I didn't expect you to be here too.

18
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:30,490
The smell of lixiang herbs on you has gotten stronger.

19
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:33,950
Tianhe,

20
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,900
let's look for the missing corner

21
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,620
of Uncle Yun's memorial tablet together.

22
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,710
Before we find the truth,

23
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,990
my father will be missing a piece

24
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,710
in both of our hearts.

25
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:52,490
We can't find it back.

26
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,150
It's been accompanying me

27
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,390
since my father passed away.

28
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,840
Whenever I have something to say,

29
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,590
I would say it to the tablet.

30
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,450
I'm handing it to you now.

31
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,600
If...

32
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,420
I mean, if this is all true,

33
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,100
just break it.

34
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,430
You can hate me too,

35
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,079
just like them.

36
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,050
But if it's not true,

37
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,280
I'll mend this corner.

38
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,070
Tianhe,

39
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,270
you know

40
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,210
that no matter if it's true or not,

41
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,450
I won't hate you.

42
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,329
Okay.

43
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,430
Let's mend this corner together

44
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,210
with the truth.

45
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,830
After the demonic rebellion,

46
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,290
Xuan Zhen only had two disciples remaining.

47
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,810
Xu Zhao was the leader of the Sword Sect.

48
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,910
Xu Liang was the leader of the Aura Sect.

49
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,790
Xu Zhao.

50
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,149
Xu Liang.

51
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,690
I want to see the 396th scroll

52
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,490
of the Qionghua Chronicle's history of the 24th generation.

53
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:28,370
Senior Xuanye,

54
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:30,270
someone has borrowed this book.

55
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,470
Senior Xuanye, you want to read this book too?

56
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,270
Go ahead.

57
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,600
You can read it first.

58
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,360
I'm just curious

59
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,670
Why you are so interested

60
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,800
in the 396th scroll?

61
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:54,760
I just feel

62
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,909
that we can only know how to face the present

63
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:59,630
by knowing the past.

64
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:01,590
Senior,

65
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,500
why do you want to read this history book too?

66
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,380
People read about the past

67
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,330
to find themselves.

68
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,260
Do you have an emotional knot too?

69
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,410
Is the answer in this book too?

70
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,050
Since you can feel others' feelings,

71
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,440
I'll be honest with you.

72
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,320
When I was born,

73
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:34,190
my mother died in this fierce battle.

74
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:38,020
I want to search through the lines of this book

75
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,210
for information about my mother.

76
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:42,850
Actually,

77
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,860
I'm also looking for my background in this book.

78
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:50,370
My foster parents doted on me,

79
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,590
but it's still hard to end

80
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,170
my pursuit of my biological parents.

81
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:58,060
I only know that they were also in Qionghua.

82
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:02,020
I can only find a few words in this book as well.

83
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,710
It turns out

84
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,900
that our births and mindsets are very similar.

85
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,840
But I don't hate Tianhe.

86
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,820
In the end, hatred will only hurt myself.

87
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,430
I also believe

88
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,170
that the deceased family

89
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,820
don't want the survivors

90
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:22,970
to live in hatred.

91
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,160
Mengli,

92
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,960
if possible,

93
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,220
it's better for you to stay away from this conflict.

94
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:35,730
Senior,

95
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,090
I understand how you feel.

96
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,310
When we first met,

97
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,870
I felt that you were kind.

98
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,310
But the battle19 years ago

99
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,070
was not as simple as what the history book says.

100
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,470
We must find out the truth

101
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,590
before we can know how to face it.

102
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,659
If I can't find any answers,

103
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,950
I will leave with Tianhe.

104
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,070
Leave?

105
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:58,220
Yes.

106
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,560
Only by leaving,

107
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,160
will the hatred not hurt him

108
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,110
or more people.

109
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,490
Mengli,

110
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,850
you are kinder than me.

112
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:36,920
Junior Ziying,

113
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:38,640
you're injured.

114
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,070
Why are you still standing here?

115
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,830
Have a seat.

116
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,510
I have something to tell you.

117
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,970
I'll leave after I finish.

118
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,750
What is it?

119
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,350
I discovered

120
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,470
that disciples of your Aura Sect

121
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,800
led people to smash Yun Tianqing's memorial tablet.

122
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,250
The person who instigated it

123
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,780
was also from the Aura Sect.

124
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,960
I was just instructing my disciples

125
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,600
to not get involved in this.

126
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:04,590
Junior Ziying, did you report this to Grandmaster?

127
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:07,980
Not yet.

128
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:11,910
If

129
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,590
it was indeed done by one of my disciples,

130
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,660
please give me a chance to make up for my mistake.

131
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,980
I will keep a close eye on my disciples.

132
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,960
I won't let anything happen to Yun Tianhe.

133
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:25,850

135
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,710
greet your Uncle Ziying.

136
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:36,200
Father,

137
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:39,860
I came back because Huaixi said your headache relapsed.

138
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:41,679
Since Uncle is here,

139
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,880
I'll take a leave first.

140
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,520
No need.

141
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,630
I've said what I should.

142
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,270
Sect Leader Xu Liang, I hope you know what's best for yourself.

143
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:51,870
Goodbye.

144
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,270
Father,

145
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,150
is your headache

146
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,080
because he gave you a hard time?

147
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,350
Ziying has found out

148
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,870
that the Aura Sect disciples instigated people

149
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,200
to smash Yun Tianqing’s memorial tablet.

150
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:20,550
Ye,

151
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,010
don't get involved.

152
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,310
Don't get yourself into trouble.

153
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:24,110
Will we really

154
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,340
let Yun Tianhe go so easily?

155
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,430
Yun Tianqing killed your biological father, Xuan Zhen,

156
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,310
and your mother.

157
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,510
I can't forgive that,

158
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,120
but what can I do?

159
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,760
Whenever I think of

160
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,190
Yun Tianhe, I...

161
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,730
Lingsha, sit.

162
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,640
What's wrong?

163
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,300
I suddenly felt a horrible cold aura.

164
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,200
Lingsha,

165
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:34,830
are you having a cold again?

166
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,370
I'll give you spiritual power.

167
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,020
Wait.

168
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,640
It seems to have disappeared again.

169
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:43,480
Mengli,

170
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,150
go investigate your parents' matters first.

171
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,830
I have my own things to do.

172
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,810
Where are you going?

173
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:01,450
I didn't summon you.

174
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:04,350
How dare you come here without permission?

175
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,310
Master,

176
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,260
I beg you.

177
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,390
Are you worried about me?

178
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,540
I didn't expect

179
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,950
that the only person who cared about me

180
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,690
would be you.

181
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,020
Master, I...

182
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,830
I know your thoughts,

183
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,990
but even if I have to risk my life,

184
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:35,980
I will never give up on cultivating this sword.

185
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:38,250
Master,

186
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:43,750
I want to ask for the elixir.

187
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,600
What did you say?

188
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,310
You came to me

189
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,570
just to help Han Lingsha ask for the elixir?

190
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:00,990
Friends

191
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,560
don't lie.

192
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:03,370
Please...

193
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,560
You're just like Xuan Xiao,

194
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,760
No matter how much effort I put in, I'm no match for others.

195
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,150
Do you know

196
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,990
that I'm willing to give up my life

197
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,330
in order to help you break through the ice

198
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,850
and for me to be with you?

199
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,710
Without me,

200
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,790
you'd be the one to be blamed.

201
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,500
It's you, Xuan Xiao.

202
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:31,740
But you...

203
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,580
You all betrayed me.

204
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,590
Why?

205
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,040
Why?

206
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,810
Why can't my efforts

207
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,600
win me a shred of your concern?

208
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,800
The guards of the Elixir Pharmacy change every four hours.

209
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,420
Four guards change shifts.

210
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,870
This means there are more guards inside the room where the elixir is stored.

211
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,780
In two hours when they change shifts

212
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,310
should be the best time.

213
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,790
Someone stole the elixir.

214
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,330
The thief should be nearby. Hurry!

215
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:37,800
Yes.

216
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:38,560
No way!

217
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:41,310
Someone stole the elixir before I took action?

218
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,660
Employer?

219
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:51,840
Xuan Xiao was my parents' best friend.

220
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:53,720
If I find him,

221
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,760
won't I know everything?

222
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,510
Who are you?

223
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:55,790
Employer,

224
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:58,060
did you steal from the Elixir Pharmacy

225
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,660
because your master won't give you the elixir?

226
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,790
I'm scared

227
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:05,080
you're in a hurry.

228
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,190
You can tell me if you have any difficulties.

229
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,230
I can wait.

230
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:10,620
You can't take the risk.

231
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,320
Elixirs. A lot.

232
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,300
Take it.

233
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,920
I don't mean to hurt you,

234
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,900
but these are regular Spirit-Reinforcement Elixirs.

235
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,960
They're not the ones I'm looking for.

236
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,690
Take it.

237
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,910
Good health.

238
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,110
I'll look for more.

239
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,970
You can't go again.

240
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,690
What if your master gives you a hard time?

241
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,870
Are you hurt?

242
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,170
You have to take one first.

243
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:59,630
I'll only rest assured if you take it. Hurry.

244
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,070
Take it.

245
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,849
This is my first time seeing you smile.

246
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:12,680
Thank you.

247
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:15,290
We're friends. Don't mention it.

248
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,500
Also,

249
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,910
do you know someone named Xuan Xiao in Qionghua?

250
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:24,180
He...

251
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:25,960
He's possessed.

252
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,250
You know him?

253
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,350
Where is he?

254
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,440
What if Xuan Xiao is possessed?

255
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,220
I have to tell Tianhe.

256
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,400
What happened?

257
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,440
Where are you going?

258
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:58,910
Junior.

259
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,510
-Stop.
-Tianhe.

260
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,790
What's going on?

261
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,150
Lingsha, why are you here?

262
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:04,750
That's...

263
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,060
There was an assassin just now.

264
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,110
He came for Tianhe.

265
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,260
His swordsmanship was better than mine

266
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,710
and his moves were ruthless.

267
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,610
It's obvious that he was here for the kill.

268
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:12,600
You're hurt.

269
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,300
I'm fine. It's just a scratch.

270
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,900
-I’ll get the medicine for you.
-You...

271
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,440
It seems that we must leave Qionghua.

272
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,230
Can we leave tomorrow?

273
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,030
No.

274
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:24,410
If I leave,

275
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:25,990
it'll seem like I'm afraid of them.

276
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:26,900
I'm afraid.

277
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,840
You're afraid?

278
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,100
I just don’t want you and Mengli

279
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,520
to investigate anymore.

280
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:34,630
Besides,

281
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,930
I'm here to tell you that—

282
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,500
Junior,

283
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,880
I think you should go back.

284
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,390
It won't be good if other seniors

285
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,030
see you.

286
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,950
Lingsha, go back and rest.

287
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,070
It's okay.

288
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,350
Let’s talk tomorrow.

289
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:50,780
Senior Huaixin,

290
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,470
take good care of Tianhe.

291
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:01,990
Tianhe,

292
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,840
did you see the assassin's facial features?

293
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,070
The man covered his face last night,

294
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,150
but I remember

295
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,000
all his moves.

296
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:12,060
I'm sure this person is in Qionghua.

297
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,300
You remember all of his moves?

298
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,220
I didn't expect

299
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:17,950
that Qionghua would have

300
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:20,390
such a sinister and despicable person.

301
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,090
Junior Tianhe,

302
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:25,230
did you get hurt when you from the assassination attempt last night?

303
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,750
I'm fine. It's just a scratch.

304
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,250
That's good.

305
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,750
Senior Xuanye, thank you for your concern.

306
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,390
Tianhe.

307
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,270
Uncle Ziying.

308
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,900
I didn't get there in time last night

309
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,710
because I was dealing with the theft in the Elixir Pharmacy.

310
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:47,940
I've informed Grandmaster about the assassination attempt on Yun Tianhe.

311
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,270
Next, I will investigate every disciple.

312
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,160
Every suspect

313
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,350
will be dealt with strictly.

314
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:56,780
In that case,

315
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:59,500
won't all of us who don't get along with Yun Tianhe

316
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,660
become suspects?

317
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:10,350
Father, why are you here?

318
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,400
I heard about the incident last night,

319
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,930
so I came to check on Tianhe.

320
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,290
How are your injuries?

321
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,360
I’ll ask Huaishuo to send you the medicine.

322
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,010
Sect Leader,

323
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,270
don't worry. I'm fine.

324
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:23,220
Disciples of the Aura Sect were involved

325
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,990
in the trouble the day before yesterday.

326
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,990
I felt guilty and feared there would be trouble again,

327
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:30,620
so I specially ordered Huaishuo to check every day.

328
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,830
Huaishuo, how’s the investigation going?

329
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,560
Master, after investigating,

330
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:38,080
I found that none of the Aura Sect disciples left without permission last night.

331
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:38,670
Father.

332
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:41,990
Ye,

333
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,750
greet your Uncle Ziying.

334
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,040
Where was Xuanye?

335
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,590
Where was she last night?

336
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:50,110
She is with me every day,

337
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,790
other than when she cultivates.

338
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,190
I had a serious headache,

339
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,340
so she was accompanying me.

340
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:01,110
Sect Leader, you don't need to worry about it.

341
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:01,740
Okay.

342
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,890
I have my own judgment.

343
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,480
Father, let me take you back.

344
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:19,790
Senior,

345
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,430
my father also has headaches,

346
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:24,670
so I know a little about how to treat headaches.

347
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:25,270
Really?

348
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,010
That's great.

349
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:28,270
Master's headache

350
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,710
has relapsed a lot recently.

351
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:32,130
But I need to know the reason

352
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:33,630
for Sect Leader Xu Liang's headaches,

353
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:35,090
so I can treat it properly.

354
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,720
Master worked as the note-taker

355
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:40,630
after the demonic rebellion.

356
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,650
His words needed to be neutral,

357
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:44,740
without praising or criticizing.

358
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,910
There were mountains of documents.

359
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,350
His headache formed

360
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,440
from looking at them for so long.

361
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:53,700
Turns out that writing the history book is so exhausting.

362
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:26,050
Ziying,

363
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,720
you've just suffered from the Ice and Fire Whipping.

364
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,520
You should rest and recuperate.

365
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,570
What's the matter?

366
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:34,880
I have a question.

367
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:36,870
Elder,

368
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,910
did the assassin last night

369
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,660
have anything to do with you?

370
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:42,710
Ridiculous.

371
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,430
As an Elder of Qionghua,

372
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,630
why would I do lowly things at night?

373
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:47,550
Besides,

374
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,920
I never thought of killing Yun Tianhe.

375
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,950
Please forgive me

376
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,160
for my offensive question.

377
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,660
If you know that it's offensive

378
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,030
and you still regard me as your elder,

379
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:02,030
why do you repeatedly defend Yun Tianhe and his group?

380
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,350
Do you know the origin of this divine sword?

381
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:09,920
To forge a divine sword with the secret sword-forging technique

382
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,880
of our sect,

383
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,450
one must obtain the Pure Wave Stone from the bottom of the East Sea,

384
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:15,410
the Moonlight Jade from under the Heavenly Mountain Ice Pool,

385
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:17,960
and combine it with ancient spiritual wood

386
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:19,660
from the northwestern wilderness.

387
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,660
Then, the divine sword will be made.

388
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,950
The two divine swords of Wangshu and Xihe

389
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:28,470
began with Dao Yin and were completed by Zong Lian.

390
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:30,590
We spent three generations of manpower and resources.

391
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,370
After the sword is completed, it still needs to acknowledge its host.

392
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,610
Doing so releases its powerful force.

393
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,320
Nineteen years ago,

394
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:38,700
it was the combination of the two swords

395
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,340
that caused war to erupt.

396
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:41,850
Now,

397
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,530
the Wangshu Sword has returned,

398
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:46,720
but the host is the son of this traitor.

399
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:48,270
I'd rather let Wang Shu

400
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:50,640
become a useless sword without a host.

401
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,790
I will never allow

402
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,590
the war to happen again.

403
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:55,220
But Yun Tianhe is innocent.

404
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,570
Look up.

405
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,390
How many of the ones in the Thousand-man Tomb

406
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:05,660
were seniors of our sect who died in that war?

407
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,720
Look at Yun Tianqing's kneeling statue.

408
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,850
He will forever be Qionghua's sinner.

409
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,450
Yet,

410
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,140
you took his son as your disciple now.

411
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,050
You are disregarding Qionghua

412
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:18,190
and human morality

413
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:19,810
to collude with evil forces.

414
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,670
I am following the way of the heavens.

415
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:26,610
Since the heavens chose Yun Tianhe as Wangshu's host,

416
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:28,540
he should be Qionghua's disciple.

417
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,260
Also, he is pure and honest.

418
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,950
If we continue to force old hatred

419
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:32,910
onto him,

420
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,480
then it's no different from

421
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,140
turning him into a person full of hatred as well.

422
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,790
Is this doing good

423
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,290
or evil?

424
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,190
I am also following your teachings

425
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:49,970
to obey the heavens without destroying human desires.

426
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,940
Have you made up your mind?

427
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,740
You're Su Yao's candidate for the future Grandmaster.

428
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,800
If this continues,

429
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:03,180
you will be criticized

430
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,580
because of him.

431
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:06,160
This will ruin your future.

432
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,740
I know Grandmaster thinks highly of me

433
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,670
and I know your prestige even more.

434
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,550
You are not within Qionghua,

435
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:16,920
but there are many people

436
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,780
within the sect

437
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,580
who are willing to submit to you.

438
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,790
What do you mean?

439
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,360
I've been protected

440
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:26,300
and taught by you and Elder Qingyang since I was young.

441
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,500
To avoid the Grandmaster and the others

442
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:30,480
suspecting that Yun Tianhe's assassination attempt

443
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,480
is related to you,

444
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,700
I have informed Grandmaster

445
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:36,770
that Elder Chongguang will help me

446
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:39,250
protect Yun Tianhe's safety.

447
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:39,690
You...

448
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:58,960
Okay, I can promise you,

449
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,800
but you have to promise me as well

450
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,150
that you will never teach Yun Tianhe

451
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:05,120
any of Qionghua's aura-controlling techniques.

452
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,730
But Yun Tianhe indeed has potential.

453
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,530
The war from 19 years ago will repeat itself soon.

454
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:10,930
Are you going to create a risk for Qionghua?

455
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:18,630
Fine,

456
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:21,800
I promise you.

457
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:30,770
Mengli,

458
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,280
have you found any clues

459
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,400
related to Xuan Xiao in the Yunjing Pavilion these days?

460
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,330
The books don't mention Xuan Xiao,

461
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,770
but I found out that Xuan Zhen and Uncle Yun

462
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,780
were both disciples of Immortal Tai Qing.

463
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,210
Xuan Zhen was the first disciple

464
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,320
and had two students,

465
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,750
Xu Zhao and Xu Liang.

466
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:48,330
Sect Leader Xu Liang was the one who recorded this history.

467
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:53,200
Are you suspecting that his records are biased?

468
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,960
Senior Huaishuo said

469
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,690
that Sect Leader Xu Liang's headache

470
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:58,690
began while recording the history.

471
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,150
I think

472
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:02,200
I can treat him.

473
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:03,990
If he's up to something,

474
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,120
you'll be in danger.

475
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:06,740
I have to find out the truth.

476
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,640
After all, this is the only clue.

477
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:10,280
Elder Qingyang said

478
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,080
that Xuan Xiao was my parents' best friend.

479
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,620
He couldn't have just vanished.

480
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,740
He didn't vanish.

481
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,950
He got possessed.

482
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:21,430
Possessed?

483
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:23,990
I wanted to tell you this last night.

484
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,100
My employer told me

485
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:28,190
that Xuan Xiao is possessed and can't be mentioned.

486
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:29,150
So,

487
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,460
we'd better not look for Xuan Xiao anymore.

488
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,260
What if he really became a demon?

489
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:37,350
No, since it's said that he's possessed and can't be mentioned,

490
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:39,290
then

491
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,750
Xuan Xiao might really be in Qionghua.

492
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:02,210
Tianhe,

493
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:05,310
your mother's Zao jade lit up.

494
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,560
I've never seen it

495
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,760
light up before.

496
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,300
In Boxian Town, my Princess Jade

497
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,740
also lit up when it felt a summoning.

498
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,340
Is yours also the same?

499
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,120
But besides Tianhe's mother,

500
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:25,610
who else would summon it?

501
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,460
Su Yu,

502
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:43,420
I finally sense your Zao jade.

503
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,370
Tianhe,

504
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,270
if our guess is true,

505
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,410
then your Zao jade has awakened.

506
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:00,610
It will show its spiritual power again.

507
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,860
It seems that my mother

508
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,000
doesn't want me to leave here.

509
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:16,400
[Male Disciples' Academy]

510
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,040
Senior is here.

511
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:19,650
Senior.

512
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:22,370
Juniors, are you waiting for me?

513
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,830
Are you going to meet Sect Leader Xu Liang?

514
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:26,790
Senior,

515
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:28,950
you seem to be in a bad mood today.

516
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:29,990
Are you worried

517
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:32,190
about Sect Leader Xu Liang's headache?

518
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:35,270
Mengli's father also has headaches,

519
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,540
so she's skilled at treating headaches.

520
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,020
Can you really cure my father?

521
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,480
Senior,

522
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,450
the lixiang herb is a specialty

523
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,350
of Nyuluo Cliff from my hometown, Shouyang.

524
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,770
I've already ground it for you.

525
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:49,110
You just need to add water and drink it

526
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,960
to relieve the headache temporarily.

527
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,890
Please bring it to the Sect Leader.

528
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:55,330
But I have something important to do today.

529
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,460
I'm not going to see my father.

530
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,030
If you're okay with it,

531
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,080
I can treat Sect Leader Xu Liang.

532
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,200
Consider it as

533
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,950
thanking the Sect Leader for protecting Tianhe.

534
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:06,760
In that case,

535
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:08,950
Junior Mengli,

536
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:10,910
please go alone.

537
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:11,730
Okay.

538
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:21,080
Mother,

539
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:23,740
when can you

540
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,520
guide me again?

541
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:36,620
Go to the Thousand-man Tomb in the back hill if you wish to see Xuan Xiao.

542
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,660
Xuan Xiao?

543
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,210
[Heming Hall]

544
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:54,470
Did Ye ask you to come? Yes.

545
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:58,710
Speaking of which,

546
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,560
Ye's mother was the only one

547
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:03,070
who could treat my headache.

548
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,450
Unfortunately,

549
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:07,310
she passed away early.

550
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:09,100
When I was born,

551
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,370
my mother died in this fierce battle.

552
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:13,780
I want to find my mother's information

553
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:15,310
from the book.

554
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,320
Sect Leader,

555
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,610
does Senior Xuanye hate Tianhe

556
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:21,610
because her mother

557
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,820
also died in the battle 19 years ago?

558
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,880
It's just Ye's reaction to reading the history book,

559
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,760
like the other disciples.

560
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,750
Could the history book

561
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,420
have errors?

562
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:36,670
I wrote the history book myself.

563
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,500
How could there be errors?

564
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:41,570
Master worked as the note-taker

565
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,610
after the demonic rebellion. There were mountains of documents.

566
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:45,890
His headache formed

567
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,870
from looking at them for so long.

568
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:49,190
Senior Huaishuo said

569
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:51,800
your headache was caused by the fatigue from note-taking,

570
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,770
but Senior Xuanye's mother had already passed away.

571
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,850
How could she have treated you?

572
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:58,630
What are you trying to say?

573
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,920
I am just confused.

574
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,760
There's no clear record in the history book

575
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,770
of who killed Jingci.

576
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:09,640
The person who abducted the female infant was only described as an evildoer.

577
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,170
Yun Tianqing wasn't named,

578
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:14,440
but everyone in Qionghua thinks it was Yun Tianqing.

579
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:15,340
Sect Leader,

580
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,990
do you know the whole story?

581
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,290
How dare you!

582
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,260
I don't care what you know.

583
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,160
Leave here immediately.

584
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:24,990
Sect Leader,

585
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,310
from my reasoning,

586
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:28,190
Yun Tianqing didn’t take the female infant

587
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:29,470
to kill her,

588
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:30,870
but to save her, right?

589
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,310
In that case,

590
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,210
why did you record that

591
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,420
he abducted the female infant?

592
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,060
Shut up!

593
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,900
If you don't leave, I won't go easy on you.

594
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,040
As the note-taker,

595
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:42,420
you once swore to the Xuantian Goddess

596
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,240
that you'd have no biases or personal feelings,

597
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,950
but you disregarded the truth.

598
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:47,810
This is the root of your headache.

599
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,150
Since you want to kill me,

600
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,800
it means I'm right.

601
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:59,440
Why did you change the history book?

602
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,680
What is the truth?

603
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,250
Sect Leader.

604
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,550
This Thousand-Man Tomb is so strange.

605
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,620
They're either nameless tablets

606
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:29,850
or

607
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,070
headless statues.

608
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:36,720
Who is it?

609
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,780
Is it Xuan Xiao?

610
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,500
Man in black, it's you again.

611
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,280
Why did you trick me here?

612
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,800
This is your place to atone for your sins with your death.

613
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,360
If you are willing to kneel before the Thousand-Man Tomb

614
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,750
and apologize in place of Yun Tianqing to the disciples

615
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:02,610
who died tragically 19 years ago,

616
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,410
perhaps

617
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,940
I'll consider letting you die comfortably.

618
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:13,960
If my father really killed them,

619
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,510
I can kneel and die,

620
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:17,870
but not now.

621
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,400
I need to find out the truth.

622
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,530
Do you see the brethren

623
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,880
killed by Yun Tianqing?

624
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:40,320
You should be shredded into pieces

625
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:42,400
for your father, Yun Tianqing.

626
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,760
Senior Xuanye?

627
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:42,010
Senior Xuanye,

628
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,880
you're the one who wants to kill me?

629
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:47,520
But you were the first person

630
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:48,920
who helped me

631
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:52,330
and treated me well after I came to Qionghua.

632
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,480
Help you?

633
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:07,380
I feared you couldn't endure the hardships and would sneak down the mountain.

634
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,660
I wanted to kill you,

635
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,690
so I had to keep you here.

636
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:12,930
Every day, I thought about

637
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:15,620
how to kill Yun Tianqing.

638
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,660
Too bad he died.

639
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,170
You should pay with your life in your father's place.

640
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:24,950
Senior Xuanye,

641
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,760
give me some more time.

642
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,610
I will find out the truth

643
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,690
and give everyone an explanation.

644
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,420
I won't let you live past today.

645
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:35,230
Yun Tianhe, look carefully.

646
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:37,330
The headless stone statue in front of you

647
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:38,990
is your father, Yun Tianqing.

648
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:06,480
[Yun Tianqing]

649
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,010
Impossible.

650
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,120
Impossible.

651
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,120
Impossible!

652
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:40,550
Smash it!

653
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,360
After you smash it,

654
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:45,050
you and your father will both die in pieces here.

655
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,370
If I want to smash it,

656
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,920
I want to smash it fair and square.

657
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,540
One day,

658
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,890
I will let everyone in Qionghua

659
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,280
know that my father was not a traitor.

660
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,750
I want my father's memorial tablet

661
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:08,690
to stand upright before the Thousand-Man Tomb.

662
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:10,510
You won't get this day.

663
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:11,790
Die!
