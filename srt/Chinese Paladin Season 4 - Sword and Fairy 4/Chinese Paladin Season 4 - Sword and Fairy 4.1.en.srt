00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,800
You stupid wild man!

191
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,180
I'm a young and beautiful girl after all.

192
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:24,380
When did I become pork tenderloin and liver for you to eat?

193
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,240
A young girl?

194
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:29,220
A young girl means you're young and a woman.

195
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,570
You're a woman?

196
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,290
Don't tell me you haven't seen a woman before?

197
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,600
Then you're not just a shapeshifted form of Big Pig Demon?

198
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,190
I get it now.

199
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,480
When we were on the cliff,

200
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,690
you thought I was a shapeshifted form of Big Pig Demon.

201
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:48,610
That's why you rubbed my face.

202
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,720
You're such a fool. You're the mountain peak's wild man indeed.

203
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,590
I didn't do it.

204
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:03,160
I've been hurt since I met you.

205
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,800
What are you waiting for? Give me a hand.

206
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,670
No, I can't touch you.

207
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,190
My father said men and women shouldn't touch each other.

208
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:16,230
Women's skin can't be touched.

209
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:18,490
You know that now?

210
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,540
But I meant to give me a hand.

211
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,070
I didn't ask you to touch me.

212
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,190
Help me.

213
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:30,190
Then, I'm just helping you.

214
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,190
Even if men and women shouldn't touch each other,

215
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:48,120
you don't have to go to this extent.

216
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,260
Your father must have been

217
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,200
a shabby and dense scholar to have taught you like that.

218
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,800
I don't understand what you're saying,

219
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,250
but I suppose you aren't saying anything nice.

220
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,110
Let me tell you.

221
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,670
Don't talk nonsense about my father.

222
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:01,900
My father was very powerful.

223
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,900
Without him, there wouldn't have been Qingluan Peak.

224
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:05,950
Then...

225
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,190
is your father the Sword Immortal I'm looking for?

226
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:10,440
Sword Immortal?

227
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,080
Sword Immortal should be a compliment.

228
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,370
Are you praising my father?

229
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,100
My father said

230
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,500
people aren't allowed to enter Shichengxi Cave casually.

231
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,710
What are you doing here?

232
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:27,270
Tell me.

233
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:28,880
No way.

234
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,630
You change your mind faster than lightning.

235
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:31,640
I can tell you,

236
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,870
but it's hard to explain.

237
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,400
I've to enter anyway.

238
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,440
Don't stop me.

239
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:39,000
I'll beat you up if you stop me. Be careful.

240
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:40,220
You...

241
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:41,780
No.

242
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,110
You can't go in.

243
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,950
Why can't I go in?

244
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:56,810
Is he...

245
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:00,050
Is he the stupid pig demon you mentioned?

246
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:01,670
Big Pig Demon.

247
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,490
Let us go now!

248
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:08,950
There's a murderous aura.

249
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,820
How dare a mortal like you barge into Qingluan Peak?

250
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,350
You even have accomplices?

251
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,300
I'll eat you all later.

252
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,170
Big Pig Demon, don't go!

253
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,290
Big Pig Demon!

254
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,520
This rope...

255
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:43,770
D-Don't move.

256
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,890
The more you move, the tighter it gets.

257
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,140
Then what should we do with this rope?

258
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,240
Don't move.

259
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:55,680
I...

260
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:01,120
You...

261
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,920
-You smell...
-You…

262
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,180
W-Wait, didn't you say

263
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,410
y-your father said

264
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
it's improper for men and women to touch each other?

265
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,150
What are you doing?

266
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,190
I remember it now!

267
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:15,150
You...

268
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,590
You smell

269
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,070
just like my mother.

270
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,590
You haven't learned the principles of ethics but you've learned how to lie.

271
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,950
You said you've never met a woman.

272
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:24,630
Yes.

273
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,310
My mother died as soon as I was born.

274
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,880
When I was young,

275
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,090
my father gave me a piece of my mother's clothing.

276
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,490
But when he passed away,

277
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,910
he took the clothing too.

278
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:34,960
You really smell

279
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,510
exactly like my mother.

280
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,230
I have a mother too.

281
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,760
I know how you feel.

282
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:46,590
Your mother passed away soon after

283
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:47,990
you were born too?

284
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,300
It's none of your business.

285
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,190
Anyway, now's not the time to reminisce about loved ones.

286
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:55,620
We have to untie the rope now.

287
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,950
Otherwise, Big Pig Demon will come again.

288
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,070
I...

289
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:02,790
Help me.

290
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,030
Take something out for me.

291
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,290
It's in my Qiankun bag.

292
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,000
Don't touch my hand.

293
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,070
How is it?

294
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:15,640
-This one?
-Yes.

295
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:16,430
This is it.

296
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,080
Open the lid.

297
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:26,000
Learn from me.

298
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,230
Blow it.

299
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,410
What is this? It can even light a fire?

300
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:33,560
It's a flame stick.

301
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,090
Hurry up.

302
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:35,730
Burn the rope.

303
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,660
Y-You're quite smart.

304
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,350
When you smile...

305
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,840
you look really pretty.

306
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,900
Why does it sound like a pig is being killed?

307
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,700
Big Pig Demon?

308
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:13,650
Big Pig Demon!

309
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,460
Big Pig Demon!

310
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:23,950
Hang in there! I'll save you!

311
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:25,350
Brat, don't come near me!

312
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,870
Exhalations like clouds and rain.

313
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:36,200
Laughter like thunder.

314
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,170
Up to heaven and down to earth,

315
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:39,760
across the yin and yang realms.

316
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,560
Changing into a myriad of forms,

317
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,460
which is not me?

318
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,580
Oh no. There's a yin spirit here.

319
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,390
Big Pig Demon!

320
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:58,240
That yin spirit is very fierce!

321
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,720
It's more important to save your own life. Let's go.

322
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,190
No.

323
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,230
My father said

324
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,760
that in Qingluan Peak, humans and demons are equal.

325
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,630
I'm going to save Big Pig Demon.

326
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:06,690
You just said you wanted to roast him.

327
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,130
Those who come here

328
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,920
will be killed on the spot.

329
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,400
Killed on the spot?

330
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,570
I can only use the amulet given by my employer.

331
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:20,990
What is this?

332
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:22,040
Stop asking.

333
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:22,550
My spiritual power is weak.

334
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,660
Try it with me.

335
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,470
A last-minute effort

336
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:27,710
is still better than waiting for death.

337
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,510
Taoism consists of heaven, earth, and man in one breath.

338
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,750
Heaven operates through aura.

339
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,750
The flames of fire burn everything.

340
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:34,650
The thunder's solemn force is invincible.

341
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:36,290
The unstoppable wind penetrates everything.

342
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:39,090
The earth's nourishment integrates everything.

343
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:53,400
Have you practiced spells before?

344
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:54,910
No.

345
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:55,790
When I was young,

346
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,590
my father used to babble these words by my side.

347
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,830
I didn't think it'd really work.

348
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,230
You're quite something.

349
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,910
We're going to die.

350
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,520
I still have an unfulfilled wish.

351
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,790
Me too.

352
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,680
I haven't seen my mother yet.

353
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:13,180
Woman, run!

354
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:18,870
Wild man!

355
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,270
Wild man!

356
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,970
This sword is quite powerful.

357
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,050
Are you okay?

358
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:12,670
So it's the master who came to visit.

359
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:16,180
-You are its master?
-You are its master?

360
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,660
I sensed the Wangshu aura and woke up.

361
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,860
At first, I thought it was a mistake.

362
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,740
That's why I offended you. Please forgive me.

363
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:27,640
I'll take my leave.

364
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:31,540
You... Wait a minute...

365
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:37,870
This...

366
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,810
So he's not some yin spirit.

367
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:48,150
It's a talisman spirit driven by magic.

368
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,320
He seemed to be afraid of the sword in your hand.

369
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,150
But...

370
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:55,430
this just looks like a broken sword.

371
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:56,770
This is a sword.

372
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,710
How could I not know it's a sword?

373
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:02,480
You...

374
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:09,790
Why isn't the sword glowing anymore?

375
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:22,370
There's a talisman spirit and a secret room.

376
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:23,990
There must be treasure.

377
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,310
You really can't go in there.

378
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,640
If you go in again,

379
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:32,040
my father will really be angry.

380
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,590
Then just be good and wait here.

381
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:39,520
I'll see if your father will be angry.

382
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:44,890
Father.

383
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,350
I-I don't want to go in.

384
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,160
But I...

385
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,910
I have to get her out.

386
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:57,430
It's so cold.

387
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,920
Zao jade?

388
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,950
The employer said the one who possesses that treasured sword

389
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:19,830
has a Zao jade with him.

390
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,590
Could this be it?

391
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:23,240
Woman!

392
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:26,160
Let me tell you.

393
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:28,030
The person who built the tomb

394
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,920
must be an amateur.

395
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:30,890
The outside...

396
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,840
The waterfall and rivers outside.

397
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,070
They say

398
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:36,310
it's taboo to have flowing water in front.

399
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,290
As the saying goes,

400
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:41,220
flowing water that doesn't converge in front means aura will leak out.

401
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,100
Father, Mother.

402
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,180
I didn't mean to disturb you.

403
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,230
I didn't expect

404
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:02,160
them to be this wild man's parents.

405
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:05,040
Then isn't this sword...

406
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:11,760
Let's leave now.

407
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:14,240
If not, my father will really get angry.

408
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:17,000
Don't leave just yet.

409
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,110
Don't you want to see your mother?

410
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:19,590
But...

411
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,280
But my father doesn't allow me to see my mother.

412
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,480
If I see her, my father will be angry.

413
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,520
But she's right in front of you.

414
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:38,150
Then I'll...

415
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,960
just take a look.

416
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,180
Father.

417
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:09,870
Mother.

418
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,280
You can cry if you feel sad.

419
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,310
I won't watch you.

420
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:23,270
My father said

421
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,820
everyone dies.

422
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,260
There's nothing to cry about.

423
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:33,470
You're right.

424
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,820
We all die eventually.

425
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:39,640
But even if the result is the same,

426
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:41,810
our lives are different.

427
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,500
There's a poem up there.

428
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:00,390
In pursuit of immortality, Qin Shi Huang's fleet was impeded by storms.

429
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:03,110
Likewise, Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty built a sculpture
of an immortal holding a golden plate, but to no avail.

430
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:05,310
Health fades with time, and death is inevitable.

431
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:07,080
Might as well roam the martial world,
as Yi River turns cold and fills one with poignancy.

432
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,560
This is my father's handwriting.

433
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,420
Health fades with time, and death is inevitable...

434
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,160
Health?

435
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,870
Health fades with time, and death is inevitable?

436
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:21,150
I didn't expect that Sword Immortal would die at such a young age.

437
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:27,380
Look at this.

438
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:29,800
Your sword...

439
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:35,390
Was it like this when your father was alive?

440
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,560
No.

441
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:38,370
I...

442
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:41,230
I've never seen it like this.

443
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,690
I know.

444
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,270
What my father left me

445
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:45,840
is not an ordinary sword.

446
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,800
It can also be used as a lamp.

447
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,190
Let me check out your lamp.

448
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,110
How can it be colder than ice?

449
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:58,090
Why do I feel so hot?

450
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,490
[Feng Xie, Dream Tapir Demon of Huanming Realm]

451
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:30,130
Lord Beike suspects the sword has appeared.

452
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,990
To prevent the Huanming tragedy from 19 years ago

453
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:37,100
from happening again,

454
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:39,200
he's sending me to investigate it.

455
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,660
If it's really that sword,

456
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,240
I must destroy it

457
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,890
[Wen Yao, Dream Tapir Demon of Huanming Realm]

458
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:43,990
at all costs.

459
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,710
I'll go with you.

460
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,080
What a powerful sword aura!

461
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,140
This roaring sound

462
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,370
is definitely not that of an ordinary sword.

463
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:04,670
It's in the direction of the forbidden area.

464
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:05,550
Is that man...

465
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:09,790
Grandmaster is here.

466
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:11,550
Greetings, Grandmaster.

467
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:13,010
Greetings, Grandmaster.

468
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,250
[Su Yao, Grandmaster of Qionghua Sect]

469
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,120
For Xihe to react like this,

470
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:39,150
Wangshu must have appeared.

471
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,600
What's wrong with it?

472
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,929
Why can't we put it down?

473
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,600
Oh no.

474
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:45,949
My father is really angry.

475
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,520
He even poked a hole in the tomb.

476
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,520
How is this just a hole?

477
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,699
The tomb's tunnel is collapsing.

478
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,030
Run!

479
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,070
Let's go.

480
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:21,590
Su Yu.

481
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:25,150
Are you here?

482
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,110
You finally came to see me.

483
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,320
[Yun Xiao]

484
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:40,810
You're finally awake.

485
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,000
Why is it you?

486
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,420
It's me.

487
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:50,630
Su Yao.

488
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,080
I come to see you every day.

489
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:59,690
You don't deserve this Zao jade.

490
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,350
Oh no.

491
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,250
I destroyed my parents' tomb.

492
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:45,670
Are you okay?

493
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:52,910
What should I do? What should I do? What should I do?

494
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:53,950
What should I do?

495
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:58,170
Will my dad come to my dreams to beat me up?

496
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,160
Gosh. Calm down.

497
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,070
I promised my father

498
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:05,790
to protect Shichengxi Cave.

499
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,560
If you hadn't barged in,

500
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,730
I wouldn't have gone in to get you out.

501
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:17,390
I...

502
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,200
My father wouldn't have destroyed

503
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,060
Shichengxi Cave in a fit of anger.

504
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:22,990
You wild man!

505
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:23,510
I...

506
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,320
I just held the sword

507
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,190
and it collapsed.

508
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,670
It's not my fault. Get it?

509
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:28,480
Impossible.

510
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,760
My father is so magnanimous.

511
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,620
How could it be possible

512
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:32,750
that he got angry just because

513
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,510
you touched my sword?

514
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:34,530
My father was angry

515
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:35,630
because you broke in.

516
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:36,240
You...

517
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,030
You are unreasonable!

518
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,570
My father built Qingluan Peak.

519
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,870
This is my territory.

520
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,240
My word is law.

521
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,670
You realize you're being unreasonable?

522
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:49,510
Fine.

523
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:51,460
Apologize to your parents properly.

524
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,390
I'm leaving.

525
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:53,960
Woman!

526
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:58,350
Give it back to me.

527
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:02,560
What? I don't know what you're talking about.

528
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:04,390
My parents' thing.

529
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,310
The tomb was collapsing.

530
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:15,280
Your parents' thing?

531
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,210
How would I have had time to take your parents' thing?

532
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,670
In the entire Qingluan Peak,

533
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:23,550
be it the number of leaves growing on each tree,

534
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,070
the number of fruits that are gone,

535
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,670
or the number of eggs Dajiu laid,

536
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,670
nothing escapes my eyes.

537
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:32,970
If you don't give it back to me,

538
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,240
then even if it's improper for men and women to touch each other,

539
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,040
don't blame me for touching you.

540
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:40,720
I'll get it.

541
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,910
I'll give it to you.

542
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:53,550
Well...

543
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,870
I can explain.

544
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:56,440
It's...

545
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:57,830
It's because you have no parents now,

546
00:38:57,830 --> 00:38:58,910
so I risked my life to retrieve it

547
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:00,110
as a keepsake for you.

548
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:01,520
A keepsake?

549
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:05,090
It can accompany you in your parents' stead.

550
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,000
You don't believe me?

551
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:12,970
I... Then...

552
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,080
I misunderstood you.

553
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:20,140
Since my father passed away,

554
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:22,840
you're the first person to be so nice to me.

555
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:24,560
Don't worry.

556
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,940
I'll repay you.

557
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,470
My father told me

558
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:28,930
that kindness received

559
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:30,810
should be repaid tenfold.

560
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:33,470
How about this?

561
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,610
Wait for me here.

562
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:37,390
I'll catch some fish and roast them for you.

563
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:41,030
Then I'll help you hold onto your sword.

564
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:42,290
You can go and catch fish.

565
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:44,440
How can I catch fish without my sword?

566
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,750
But I just want your sword.

567
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:04,390
The forbidden area is full of sunshine.

568
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,830
I'm afraid the Wangshu Sword is not safe.

569
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,360
What should we do?

570
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:17,160
Wangshu Sword's aura is extremely cold.

571
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,230
Other than the host, no one else can hold it.

572
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:23,350
This scabbard is made of rare warm jade.

573
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:26,970
Back then, Xihe Sword was partially made with this too.

574
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,370
It can withstand Wangshu's cold aura.

575
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:32,750
Take this with you to Mount Kong's Qingluan Peak

576
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:34,530
to retrieve the sword.

577
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,680
No room for error.

578
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:40,310
Yes, sir.
