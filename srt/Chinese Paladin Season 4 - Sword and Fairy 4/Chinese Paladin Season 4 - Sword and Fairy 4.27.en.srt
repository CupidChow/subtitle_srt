00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,030
to find out where the Huanming young master is.

191
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,460
Any progress?

192
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,070
I dare not forget

193
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,950
the task you've entrusted to me.

194
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,180
But Young Master...

195
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,160
I couldn't find her anywhere.

196
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:10,230
You’ve been in Boxian Town for so long.

197
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,990
But the information you gave me is useless.

198
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,780
Then why should I keep you?

199
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,390
I'm still useful.

200
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,710
Please calm down.

201
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,190
I'm really still useful.

202
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:20,870
Dili.

203
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,690
Listen to me.

204
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:22,770
Stop following me.

205
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,300
Take you two ugly monsters

206
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:25,430
and these things.

207
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:26,160
Get lost!

208
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:26,860
No.

209
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,210
You told me we were just shopping.

210
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,940
How did it become my betrothal gift instead?

211
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,280
Little Dili.

212
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,100
You turned down all my

213
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,350
proposal attempts.

214
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,350
I had no choice.

215
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:39,140
Dili.

216
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,700
Please marry me.

217
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,900
I really...

218
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,120
I can support myself.

219
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,950
Why should I marry a man like you?

220
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,490
Dili,

221
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:55,190
you look especially beautiful when you lose your temper.

222
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,510
Get lost!

223
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,010
Young Master Tianhe.

224
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,150
Young Master.

225
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,310
You're back.

226
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:06,080
I was going to Qingfeng Pavilion to find you.

227
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,700
Fortunately, Lingsha is smart.

228
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,420
She said Feng Er must be here.

229
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,930
We heard you and Dili from afar.

230
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,290
Did your proposal fail

231
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,850
and you got beaten instead?

232
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:17,330
Ouch!

233
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,320
It hurts.

234
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,350
It's been a long time. I miss you ladies so much.

235
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,040
Let's go.

236
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,370
I'll treat you to a meal.

237
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:24,990
Who is that?

238
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,880
You hit me so hard.

239
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,390
My lord,

240
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:39,130
that boy is Yun Tianhe.

241
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,960
Strangely,

242
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,800
he can also wield the Wangshu Sword.

243
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,490
I mean the girl beside him

244
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:46,930
who looks delicate.

245
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,710
Her name is Liu Mengli.

246
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,560
I believe she's going to Qionghua

247
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,090
with Yun Tianhe to learn skills.

248
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,170
But apart from her natural beauty,

249
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,770
she's nothing special.

250
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,470
I think she's very special.

251
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,410
Boss Dili, sorry.

252
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,950
We have something urgent to tend to.

253
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,610
Feng Er needs to go to Qingfeng Pavilion with us.

254
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:15,910
Now?

255
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:16,730
Now.

256
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:18,040
Right now!

257
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,740
Young Master.

258
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,460
I was hurt here and it hurts.

259
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,540
It hurts.

260
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,090
I can't take it anymore.

261
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:24,650
Let's go.

262
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,230
We're going.

263
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:27,750
Wait for me.

264
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,010
-Wait for me.
-We'll see you later, Dili.

265
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,830
Find out who this woman is.

266
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,340
Yes.

267
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,690
[Qingfeng Pavilion]

268
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,340
Feng Er.

269
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:40,730
We're here

270
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,230
for two things.

271
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,150
First,

272
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:46,080
we're in a hurry to find clues to the Kun Scale.

273
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,670
You're well-informed.

274
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,630
Is it possible that the clues to the Kun Scale

275
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,360
are here in Qingfeng Pavilion?

276
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,060
I've heard about the war

277
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,490
from 19 years ago.

278
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,940
Once Xuan Xiao breaks the ice,

279
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,150
the war between Qionghua

280
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:01,750
and the Demon Clan will surely break out again.

281
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,690
This will also affect Boxian Town.

282
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:06,360
Don't worry.

283
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,580
We will protect

284
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,340
the good demons in Boxian Town.

285
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,080
But I really don't know where the Kun Scale is.

286
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:18,200
What's the second thing you need help for?

287
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:20,620
Mengli.

288
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,070
Whenever she comes to Boxian Town,

289
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,720
she would hear a strange voice.

290
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,180
So we want to find out more.

291
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:30,000
Miss Liu, where do you want to start?

292
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,790
The purple crystal gives you power.

293
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,950
You can find me if you find it.

294
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,270
Miss Liu.

295
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,110
What's wrong?

296
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:38,830
Miss Liu.

297
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,550
I'm fine.

298
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:44,200
I want to know about the purple crystal.

299
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,330
The purple crystal?

300
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,690
It's said that the purple crystal is from the Huanming Realm.

301
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,210
It's indeed recorded in the books.

302
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,400
But there are so many books.

303
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:56,350
We...

304
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,230
This...

305
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,040
How about this?

306
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,160
Tianhe, Lingsha,

307
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:02,790
didn't you want to see the Five-Poison Beast and the others?

308
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:05,110
Let Master Feng Er take you to them.

309
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:08,440
I can concentrate better if I check the books myself.

310
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:10,670
Sure.

311
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,310
Tianher and I get dizzy

312
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:13,750
when we read the book anyway.

313
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,150
We'll trouble you with it, then.

314
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,380
I can go and coax my Dili as well.

315
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,210
We'll trouble you with it.

316
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:21,900
Let's go.

317
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,160
Let's go.

318
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,460
You're finally here.

319
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,270
I'm right beside you.

320
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:54,990
Who are you?

321
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,190
Where are you?

322
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,620
The person who wears this

323
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:36,060
has sufficient spiritual power to repel all evils.

324
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,140
The demon who wears this

325
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,100
can suppress its demonic aura

326
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,620
and be indistinguishable from humans.

327
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,360
Could it be that...

328
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,190
I'm not a human,

329
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,010
but a demon?

330
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:58,980
Don't leave me alone

331
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:01,390
in this moonlit sleepless place.

332
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,349
Moonlit sleepless place...

333
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,099
People yearn for moonlit sleepless places,

334
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:29,130
paintings capture the wind, but not within its ink.

335
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,500
I can feel you.

336
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:35,750
Get me out of here!

337
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,750
Who are you?

338
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,830
Tell me, who are you?

339
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,300
My lord.

340
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,920
The crystal stone is sensing the aura of a fellow clan member.

341
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:21,870
Young Master.

342
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,320
I'll die with you.

343
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,270
Oh no.

344
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,030
The demon's primordial spirit has entered the baby's body.

345
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,040
It must be...

346
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,720
Uncle Yun was afraid that I would be possessed by the demon...

347
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,760
That's why he put this jade on me.

348
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,350
I'm not a demon.

349
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,340
I'm not a demon.

350
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:17,770
My lord,

351
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,750
why did the purple crystal suddenly...

352
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:22,380
There's indeed the aura of my clan in this city.

353
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,650
And it's in Qingfeng Pavilion.

354
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:26,630
My lord,

355
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,260
you must not break into Qingfeng Pavilion.

356
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,190
There are so many people in the Pavilion,

357
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:33,950
armed with divine weapons and magical instruments.

358
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:36,400
Now, Yun Tianhe, who killed Beike,

359
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,100
is also there.

360
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,760
I'm afraid the two of us...

361
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,290
A bunch of scumbags is nothing to be afraid of.

362
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,060
Wait, my lord.

363
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,190
My lord.

364
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,950
I have an idea

365
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,750
to ensure

366
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,690
your entry into Qingfeng Pavilion.

367
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,880
Miss Liu is fine.

368
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,630
So how did she...

369
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,840
Why don't we replenish her spiritual power first?

370
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,690
You're awake, Mengli.

371
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,520
Luckily I brought you food yesterday.

372
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,120
Otherwise, I wouldn't have known you fainted.

373
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,130
Lingsha.

374
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,580
That book...

375
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:55,100
The book with only half a page left?

376
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,370
Missing half a page?

377
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,570
What you see was also missing half a page?

378
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,310
Yes.

379
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,120
If you like it,

380
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:04,280
let Feng Er give it to you.

381
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,480
But the most important thing for you now

382
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,940
is to eat something first.

383
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,340
I'll get it for you.

384
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,270
No need.

385
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,460
Tianhe, Lingsha.

386
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,260
Let's go back to Qionghua.

387
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,690
Now?

388
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,040
What about your investigation?

389
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:22,870
My matter is not as important as delivering the Cold Painting.

390
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,010
Besides, Uncle Ziying

391
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:25,790
has been waiting outside the city all night.

392
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,060
If we don't go back soon,

393
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,120
he will be worried.

394
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,830
The longer we delay,

395
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:32,180
the more Senior Xuan Xiao will suffer.

396
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,250
Mengli.

397
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:35,940
If you're fine,

398
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,890
let's go back to Qionghua now.

399
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,470
Junior.

400
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,430
I received Ziying's letter.

401
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:49,170
They found the Guangji Cold Painting.

402
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,100
They will send it to Qionghua soon.

403
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:55,230
I knew it, Yun Tianhe wouldn't let me down.

404
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,310
Yun Tianhe?

405
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:06,350
I told Yun Tianhe

406
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:09,510
to find the cold weapon to break the ice for you.

407
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:12,240
I don't need you to thank me.

408
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:13,990
I just hope

409
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:16,010
you can look at me.

410
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,860
Thank you?

411
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,990
Why would I thank you?

412
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:25,190
If not for your Grandmaster title,

413
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,720
you would have been worthless.

414
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:33,970
Why?

415
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,310
I, Su Yao, command

416
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,110
the admiration and respect of all the disciples of Qionghua.

417
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,910
But you wouldn't even look at me!

418
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:44,750
The Su Yu you love so much

419
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,430
disregarded your life

420
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:48,520
and eloped with Yun Tianqing 19 years ago!

421
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,410
Only I!

422
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,950
Only I would sacrifice my life for you!

423
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,220
Senior,

424
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,390
did we make the right choice?

425
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:15,900
Victory is in sight.

426
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:17,750
Don't be distracted.

427
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,990
Is this war

428
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:23,030
really dictated by the Heavenly Path?

429
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:23,620
Su Yu,

430
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,640
no matter what the Heavenly Path dictates,

431
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,970
we must win this battle.

432
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:47,890
Tianqing.

433
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,070
Xuan Xiao, Su Yu.

434
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,090
Stop it.

435
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,280
This battle is against the heavens.

436
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:54,830
Nonsense!

437
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,710
For the 3,000 disciples of Qionghua,

438
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,910
withdraw your sword.

439
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:00,150
So what if it's against the heavens?

440
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,470
Have you forgotten our vows?

441
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,310
Do you want to abandon me?

442
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,990
Then let me...

443
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,500
Let me...

444
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:26,260
Su Yu!

445
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:29,670
Su Yu.

446
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:36,250
Let's go.

447
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,720
Xuan Xiao, remember,

448
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,670
I will die for you today.

449
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,000
You owe me one.

450
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:05,080
If Su Yu hadn't

451
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,430
taken Wangshu and left with Yun Tianqing,

452
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,510
we wouldn't have ended up like this.

453
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,470
Qionghua Sect wouldn't have ended up like this.

454
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:13,910
Su Yu was bewitched by Yun Tianqing!

455
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:15,100
Come to your senses!

456
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,220
The one Su Yu loved was not you,

457
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,100
but Yun Tianqing.

458
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:35,660
Only I

459
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:39,000
would dare to die for you!

460
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,600
Shut up!

461
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:45,350
If you dare to mention this matter to Yun Tianhe,

462
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:49,720
I will let you die again.

463
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:29,660
Master Dili.

464
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:36,060
I'm here for Feng Er.

465
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,790
You're here for the master?

466
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,830
He'd be so happy if he knew.

467
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:43,330
But he went to send Young Master Tianhe

468
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,880
and the others to Qionghua.

469
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,090
Why don't you...

470
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,470
Didn't he say I could go in and out

471
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:49,130
of Qingfeng Pavilion at will?

472
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,580
Did he lie to me again?

473
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,460
No, no.

474
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:53,840
Have a seat.

475
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:54,910
I'll get you a cup of tea.

476
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:55,520
No need.

477
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:57,130
You may leave.

478
00:26:59,190 --> 00:26:59,830
Okay.

479
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:01,360
Help yourself.

480
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:19,730
There is indeed a Dream Tapir clan member here.

481
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:51,990
General Si Jia!

482
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:53,910
Jing Chen?

483
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,990
We all thought

484
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:58,200
you died in battle to protect the young master.

485
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,870
I didn't expect you to be hiding in this painting.

486
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:01,780
A painting?

487
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,100
I'm in a painting?

488
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:06,550
Why?

489
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:08,190
What?

490
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,030
You don't even notice?

491
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,070
I only know that I'm trapped here.

492
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,830
I can't get out no matter what.

493
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,750
Guixie, the young master is not dead.

494
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:18,610
She's not dead!

495
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,530
It's been 19 years.

496
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:24,430
Now you tell me the young master is not dead.

497
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,710
How can I trust you?

498
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,790
I'm not lying.

499
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,030
I can summon her.

500
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,030
A few months ago,

501
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:32,710
I suddenly sensed Young Master's aura.

502
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,260
But for some reason, it suddenly disappeared.

503
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,460
But since yesterday,

504
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:38,400
I could sense her aura again.

505
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,270
Around two hours ago,

506
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,530
I could sense that she was right here.

507
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,940
Is it really her?

508
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:45,930
Little Dili.

509
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:48,040
Guixie!

510
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:51,510
Dili.

511
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,620
I didn't expect you to come here.

512
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:55,780
What? Am I not welcome here?

513
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,190
That depends on

514
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,750
who you really are.

515
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:07,340
I knew it was weird for Boss Dili

516
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,670
to visit out of the blue.

517
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:09,510
It's indeed a fake.

518
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,350
A fake!

519
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,200
So you're a distinguished guest of the Dream Tapir Clan.

520
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,880
Are you here to visit

521
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,370
or make friends?

522
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:20,550
Where did you get this painting?

523
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:25,130
There are too many treasures in Qingfeng Pavilion.

524
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,670
I believe...

525
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:30,230
I won this from a gamble somewhere.

526
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:33,950
Why are you interested in this painting?

527
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,150
How much is it?

528
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:36,160
I want it.

529
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:37,870
Sorry.

530
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,620
According to the rules of the Qingfeng Pavilion,

531
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,750
no collection can leave the pavilion.

532
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,220
If you decide to visit again,

533
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:51,620
there's no need to get the painter to change your appearance.

534
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:56,080
I hope the next time I visit,

535
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,320
Boxian Town will still be here.

536
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,870
War is coming after all.

537
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,490
Check our inventory immediately.

538
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:11,310
Qingfeng Pavilion must move out of Boxian Town as soon as possible.

539
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:11,860
Let's go.

540
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:24,790
Grandmaster,

541
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:25,920
Mengli is not feeling well.

542
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,850
She went to rest.

543
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:28,170
We're here to report.

544
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:29,050
Tianhe.

545
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,160
Grandmaster,

546
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:33,140
this is the Guangji Cold Painting.

547
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:41,290
You actually found the Guangji Cold Painting

548
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:42,650
in such a short time.

549
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,350
Are you okay?

550
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:57,110
We have two cold weapons now.

551
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:59,310
There's hope of Xuan Xiao breaking the ice.

552
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:01,830
It can guarantee our victory in the war.

553
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,750
Xu Zhao has been expelled from the sect.

554
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,730
Ziying has done a great job retrieving the treasure.

555
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:11,260
I've decided to let you be the sect leader of the Sword Division.

556
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,390
Great!

557
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,300
Congratulations, Uncle Ziying.

558
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:19,270
Greetings, Sect Leader Ziying.

559
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,150
Grandmaster,

560
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,440
I'm not good at managing personnel affairs.

561
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,960
I can't be the sect leader.

562
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,410
I know you don't like fame and fortune.

563
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,460
I'll allow you to think about it.

564
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,090
But as the Grandmaster,

565
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:35,590
I have to issue rewards and punishments accordingly.

566
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:37,590
Don't make things difficult for me.

567
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,080
Thank you for your understanding.

568
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:40,830
But...

569
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:41,650
Grandmaster,

570
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:47,450
since you said we've done a great job retrieving the treasure,

571
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,400
may I ask for a...

572
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,310
I know.

573
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,830
You want to help Lingsha

574
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:54,120
ask for another Fuyao Immortal Fruit Pill.

575
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,190
But, Lingsha,

576
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,260
you have a cold yin physique.

577
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:59,420
Even with the Fuyao Immortal Fruit Pill,

578
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:02,140
it's inevitable for you to get hurt by the cold aura.

579
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:02,810
But

580
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,620
I've found a way

581
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,680
to cure your cold disease.

582
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:09,070
Really?

583
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,600
Why would the Grandmaster lie to a disciple?

584
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,790
That's great, Lingsha.

585
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:18,670
Grandmaster,

586
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,960
I don't think you're like a grandmaster anymore.

587
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,510
You treat me like family.

588
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:26,550
Rest well.

589
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,980
I'll treat you

590
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:30,140
once I settle everything else.

591
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,950
Thank you, Grandmaster.

592
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:34,790
Grandmaster,

593
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:35,990
can I send the

594
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:37,910
Guangji Cold Painting

595
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:40,380
to Senior Xuan Xiao in the forbidden area?

596
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:41,580
I want to see him too.

597
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:42,760
Okay.

598
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,350
We'll excuse ourselves.

599
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:49,180
Let's go.

600
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,720
Senior Xuan Xiao,

601
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:07,070
you must have not seen stars for a long time.

602
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,280
When you open the Guangji Cold Painting,

603
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,220
you can see the stars descending to the mortal world

604
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,990
and the Milky Way flowing upside down.

605
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:14,230
It's been 19 years

606
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,510
since I last saw the sunrise, sunset,

607
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:19,780
and the twinkling of starlight.

608
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:36,460
When I find the last cold weapon for you

609
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,750
and help you break the ice,

610
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:40,260
I'll accompany you to see the Phoenix Flower Tree every day.

611
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,720
We'll admire the Milky Way

612
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,530
and the shining stars.

613
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,540
Looking into your eyes,

614
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,860
I already see the Milky Way

615
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,730
and the shining stars.

616
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:02,950
Senior Xuan Xiao,

617
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:05,840
you should absorb the Guangji Cold Painting.

618
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:07,460
It can reduce your pain.

619
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:36,790
Tianhe,

620
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:39,330
I don't need to ask

621
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:43,550
to know that you put yourselves through a lot of danger

622
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:45,270
for the Guangji Cold Painting.

623
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:47,949
I'm sure there will be more difficulties and obstacles

624
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:50,010
on your journey to find the Kun Scale.

625
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:53,010
Have you really decided to find it for me?

626
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:56,100
Saving you was my parents' wish.

627
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,340
I must fulfill it.

628
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:00,350
Besides,

629
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,720
in my heart,

630
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:04,770
you are also my family.

631
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,900
Everyone abandoned

632
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:14,860
and betrayed me.

633
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:18,420
But you're the only one who never left me

634
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,160
and never gave up on me.

635
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:27,210
Yun Tianhe.

636
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:31,040
From now on,

637
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:34,790
you and I will live and die together as sworn brothers.

638
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:36,570
This...

639
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,880
It's not appropriate.

640
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:41,920
My...

641
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:44,030
My father was your sworn brother too.

642
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:45,940
How can I also call you brother?

643
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:47,930
Silly kid.

644
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:51,710
How can seniority define friendship?

645
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:55,520
In the first half of my life, I only had one good brother,

646
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,920
Yun Tianqing.

647
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,740
But he left me.

648
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:02,000
He made me no longer believe

649
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,300
in true brotherhood.

650
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,700
But your appearance

651
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,860
made me believe again that

652
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:12,470
there are true friends in this world.

653
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:15,870
Fine.

654
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:18,240
I'll be your true friend

655
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:20,560
for my father.

656
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,620
Call me brother.

657
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,080
In this life,

658
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:26,640
we will be brothers

659
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,380
and never betray each other.

660
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:31,620
Brother.

661
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:10,070
Where am I?

662
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,040
You're here.

663
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,220
Who are you?

664
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,080
It doesn't matter who I am.

665
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:26,030
Do you know who you are?

666
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:27,160
I...

667
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:30,690
I'm Liu Shifeng and his wife's daughter.

668
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:32,500
I'm Master Su Shen's disciple.

669
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,540
I'm good friends with Tianhe, Lingsha,

670
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,820
and Uncle Ziying.

671
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,470
I'm also Uncle Ziying's disciple.

672
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:41,280
This is not you.

673
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:45,220
I...

674
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,480
I'm also...

675
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:49,710
Also...

676
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:54,580
Why am I here?

677
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:56,030
Where am I?

678
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:22,950
Who are you?

679
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,380
Brothers,

680
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:40,630
you've sensed Young Master's aura too, right?

681
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,860
Calm down.

682
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:45,730
I'll show you my skills tonight.

683
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,860
Who are you? How dare you break into our sect?

684
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,440
I must break into

685
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:11,950
Qionghua today!

686
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,230
Demon, die!

687
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:33,400
You think you can stop me?
