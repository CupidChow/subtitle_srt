[Episode 32]

4
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,800
I know you don't want to mention it.

5
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:41,630
But I really want to know.

6
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,920
You had already taken Mother away from Qionghua.

7
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,590
Then why did she die?

8
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:47,990
She died

9
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,880
because of you.

10
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,640
I took your mother

11
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,790
to Qingluan Peak near Taiping Village

12
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,320
and placed a barrier there.

13
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,150
To make up for our guilt,

14
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,660
we made Qingluan Peak a place where humans and demons could live together.

15
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,520
It also became my home away from the world with Su Yu.

16
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,110
Those times were

17
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,030
when I saw her smile the most.

18
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,640
We decided

19
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,240
to become husband and wife.

20
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,550
If we weren't destined in our previous life...

21
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:36,329
We won't let each other down in our current life.

22
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,280
In the next life, may we reunite again.

23
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,990
This is the best news

24
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,290
I've heard recently.

25
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,150
Congratulations.

26
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,100
Uncle.

27
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,350
You came a long way.

28
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,480
What can I do for you?

29
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:56,960
After you took away the Wangshu Sword,

30
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:00,750
Xihe backfired on Xuan Xiao and turned him demonic.

31
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,140
Chongguang, Qingyang, and I

32
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,550
had no choice but to seal him in ice.

33
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,150
Master once told me

34
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,070
that the person sealed in ice

35
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,590
would endure freezing pain.

36
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,010
We had no choice but to freeze Xuan Xiao.

37
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,560
What a pity.

38
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,070
I only wanted to make two divine sword

39
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,500
and failed to see the big picture.

40
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,070
Actually, these two swords haven't been fully forged.

41
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:47,670
Both Xihe and WangShu swords

42
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,670
are still missing two pieces of precious ores,

43
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:52,350
called the Yin Yang Jade.

44
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,810
But the grandmaster was eager to achieve his ascension.

45
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,750
To absorb the power of the Huanming Realm's purple crystal,

46
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,910
he needed to find

47
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:03,870
two individuals with ultimate Yin and Yang constitutions as hosts for the swords

48
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:07,540
to substitute for the Yin Yang Jade.

49
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,590
So,

50
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,570
Su Yu's constitution was damaged

51
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,920
because the swords were lacking the Yin Yang Jade?

52
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,840
Su Yu,

53
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,390
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,670
The cold aura in your body

55
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,269
can only be cured

56
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,030
by the Yin Yang Jade.

57
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,510
Uncle,

58
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,690
where can we find the Yin Yang Jade?

59
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,350
I have recorded clues to the Jade's whereabouts,

60
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,950
how the Wangshu Sword and Xihe Sword were forged,

61
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,830
and how to destroy them

62
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,310
all in my manuscript.

63
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,409
If this manuscript is kept in Qionghua,

64
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,240
it might cause trouble.

65
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,220
I'll give it to you.

66
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,590
Tianqing.

67
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,680
Su Yu.

68
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,680
What I'm talking about

69
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,570
is Qionghua's last secret.

70
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,150
The decision

71
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,910
is also up to you.

72
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,390
When I went to the Tomb of Prince Yunan,

73
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,790
there was a pair of toads.

74
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,800
Lingsha said that was the Yin Yang Jade.

75
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,400
That was just an empty shell.

76
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,190
Finally,

77
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,750
when I sealed the primordial spirit of Prince Yunan,

78
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,300
I found the Yin Yang Jade.

79
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,240
But I didn't expect that

80
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,970
when I returned to Qingluan Peak,

81
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,100
two people were waiting for me.

82
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,590
You were not born then.

83
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,420
I could only choose one between you and her.

84
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,159
So,

85
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:40,110
Mother saved the Yin Yang Jade

86
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,100
for me.

87
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,560
Su Yu was the most important person in my life.

88
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,200
I just wanted her to live.

89
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:50,450
So,

90
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:56,190
I chose to abandon my son to protect my wife.

91
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,280
But she said

92
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,360
when she became the host

93
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,190
of Wangshu at the Great Hall,

94
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,590
her fate was already sealed.

95
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,270
In the end,

96
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,150
I helped her

97
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,560
transfer the spiritual power of the Yin Yang Jade

98
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,960
into your body.

99
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,480
The last thing I could do for her

100
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,080
was to put the Kun Scale in the Shichenxi Cave

101
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,150
so that her body wouldn't rot.

102
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,710
Now that you have taken the Kun Scale,

103
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:44,510
both of us

104
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,150
can return to ashes

105
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,730
and never be separated.

106
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,130
Now I understand

107
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,000
why you were always so angry

108
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,110
when I asked about my mother.

109
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,130
So she sacrificed her life

110
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,860
to protect me.

111
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,480
Tianhe,

112
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,350
I'm sorry.

113
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,880
When you were young,

114
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,440
whenever I saw you being so lively,

115
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,470
it seemed to

116
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,020
remind me of

117
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,290
why Su Yu died.

118
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,130
So I was cold and strict with you.

119
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,490
But from beginning to end,

120
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,890
I neglected one thing.

121
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,190
Compared to me,

122
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,680
you needed her more.

123
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,470
Kid,

124
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:51,870
forgive me.

125
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,260
Father.

126
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,100
There's one more thing.

127
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:18,720
There's no time.

128
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,820
I must tell you something.

129
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,950
The host of the Wangshu Sword is someone else.

130
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,710
And the biggest secret of Yin Yang Jade is...

131
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,500
What did you say, Father?

132
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:38,030
I... I can't hear you.

133
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:40,740
Father.

134
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,750
What's going on?

135
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,120
Father!

136
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:47,940
What's going on?

137
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,380
Father!

138
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,240
Mr. Yun.

139
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:02,580
Mr. Yun.

140
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,830
I'm afraid Benefactor Yun tried to leak a heavenly secret

141
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:05,970
and alarmed the Netherworld.

142
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:06,700
Let's go.

143
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,430
Lingsha.

144
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,990
I don't believe there's a spell that can't be broken.

145
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,220
I will find a way.

146
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,150
You promised my sister to make me happy.

147
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,310
So first,

148
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,800
you can't turn into a sour face.

149
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,390
You...

150
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,500
Smile.

151
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,110
That’s right.

152
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,070
This way, Tianhe wouldn't notice.

153
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,220
Mr. Yun, this way.

154
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:46,950
Tianhe.

155
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,590
You've been there for so long.

156
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,550
Your father must have told you

157
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,390
everything.

158
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,830
We need to get out of here first.

159
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,430
Mr. Yun has been discovered by the guards.

160
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,630
I've arranged for a ferryman

161
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,440
to send you out via a ferry.

162
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:57,280
Let's go.

163
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:58,330
Let's talk outside.

164
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:58,860
Let's go.

165
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,630
Mengli!

166
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,830
No matter if you're a human or a demon.

167
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,360
you'll always be the sister

168
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,100
I swore to protect.

169
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:23,710
Go!

170
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,360
Uncle, Auntie, don't worry.

171
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,160
We will take good care of Mengli.

172
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,510
What are you talking about?

173
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,590
We won’t be apart.

174
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,430
Luo,

175
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,370
you’ve been in a coma for days.

176
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,110
You're finally awake.

177
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,550
Young Chief.

178
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:01,760
She is your mother,

179
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,990
Lady Chan You.

180
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,630
Mother.

181
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,150
When I left you,

182
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,180
you were so small.

183
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,120
You've become a fine lady now.

184
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,500
My daughter is finally back.

185
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:35,010
Luo,

186
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,110
are you looking for this?

187
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,580
After you were injured and unconscious,

188
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:46,310
you were holding this thing tightly in your hands.

189
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,310
This is Tianhe's beast fang button.

190
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,490
It's very important to me.

191
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,920
Xi Zhong has told me everything.

192
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,220
Your best friends

193
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:56,900
knew your identity.

194
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,760
But they still stood up to protect you.

195
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,580
I understand.

196
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,820
They must be worried about me.

197
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,830
But there's no news about me.

198
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,690
I'm afraid they'll risk their lives to save me.

199
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:09,310
Can you...

200
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,600
Xi Zhong.

201
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:13,170
Go to them now

202
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,020
and tell them that Luo is safe.

203
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,380
Yes.

204
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:21,870
Thank you.

205
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,150
Mother.

206
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,720
We were apart for 19 years.

207
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,390
It's natural that you

208
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,010
don't feel close to me.

209
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:05,900
Luo,

210
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,840
you are always

211
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,440
on my mind.

212
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,690
As long as you don't leave,

213
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,260
you can tell me

214
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,550
any request you have.

215
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:21,690
Can you

216
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,590
please call me Mengli?

217
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,280
No matter what your name is,

218
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,130
you're still my daughter.

219
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:38,670
Mengli.

220
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,160
Can you call me mom?

221
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,830
Mom.

222
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,900
I cannot accept this.

223
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,250
If Grandmaster knew the truth,

224
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,060
why would she decide to do what Tai Qing did

225
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,720
and lie to everyone to ascend?

226
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,790
Young Master.

227
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,510
Murong Ziying?

228
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,830
It's really you!

229
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,230
Hero Murong Ziying,

230
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,890
I finally see you in person.

231
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:29,840
You know me?

232
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:30,820
Well,

233
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,150
there is a Charm Disguise Hall in Boxian Town.

234
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:33,870
This ugly artist

235
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,600
specializes in disguising people.

236
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,280
Your face is the most handsome one he has ever sold.

237
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,310
I drew many of your portraits.

238
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:43,950
I didn't expect you to be more handsome in person.

239
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,320
Ziying.

240
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:52,370
Are you going back to Qionghua to help them?

241
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:55,550
After Master Zong Lian and Master Su Shen left,

242
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,880
Grandmaster personally taught me.

243
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:01,870
Unless she tells me in person,

244
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,340
I won't be able to believe it.

245
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,900
Are you talking about

246
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,390
Grandmaster Su Yao of Qionghua?

247
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,200
That vicious woman.

248
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:12,430
What right does she have to teach others?

249
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:12,950
What did you say?

250
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,270
Please calm down, Mr. Murong.

251
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:16,530
The ugly Artist had dealings with Su Yao.

252
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,180
He's speaking the truth.

253
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,040
Disciples of Qionghua.

254
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,430
In less than ten days, the Huanming Realm

255
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,760
will appear above Qionghua's territory.

256
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,270
The war is coming.

257
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:34,830
We must defend Qionghua to the death

258
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,090
and protect the people.

259
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,390
We must win this battle!

260
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,050
Defend Qionghua

261
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,860
and protect the people.

262
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,390
We must win this battle!

263
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,620
Why do we fight?

264
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:08,980
Ziying,

265
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,340
you're finally back.

266
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:12,430
Ziying.

267
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,800
Stop!

268
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,010
Who let this traitor in?

269
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,270
Sect Leader,

270
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:24,830
Senior Xuan Xiao said

271
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,170
if Yun Tianhe returns,

272
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,680
we cannot deny him entry.

273
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,180
Ziying.

274
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,310
Yun Tianhe.

275
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:41,230
You are back.

276
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,670
Are you returning to our sect?

277
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,390
Why isn't Han Lingsha here?

278
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,410
Lingsha and I

279
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,620
will never be Qionghua's disciples again.

280
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:50,830
I came back this time

281
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,830
because I was worried about Ziying.

282
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:55,530
That, and I want to see Senior Xuan Xiao again.

283
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:57,460
Ziying is coming back to his own sect.

284
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,700
Why are you worried?

285
00:16:59,150 --> 00:16:59,950
Grandmaster.

286
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,870
Today, our disciples are preparing to deploy the formation.

287
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:05,400
Yun Tianhe is close to that Dream Tapir Demon.

288
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:08,930
I'm afraid it's inappropriate for him to be here right now.

289
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:09,839
Yun Tianhe.

290
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,859
It's indeed inappropriate for you to be here.

291
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:14,490
Since you want to see my junior,

292
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:15,410
go find him.

293
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:18,589
Grandmaster,

294
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,640
Ziying will ask you some questions later.

295
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:23,750
But

296
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:27,050
don't make things difficult for him.

297
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,610
I'm going to find Senior Xuan Xiao now.

298
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,180
Nephew Ziying.

299
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,580
What did Yun Tianhe mean by that?

300
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:45,630
Why would Grandmaster make things difficult for you?

301
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:46,430
Grandmaster,

302
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,680
I want to talk to you in private.

303
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,630
Uncle Ziying.

304
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,110
Grandmaster and you have always been fair and transparent.

305
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,500
If you talk in private,

306
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:01,330
it will make people more suspicious of the matter.

307
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,590
Ziying.

308
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,960
Let's talk here.

309
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:16,730
Grandmaster,

310
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:18,460
are you sure?

311
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,380
As the grandmaster,

312
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,550
I have to be selfless and without desire.

313
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,950
There's nothing to hide.

314
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,130
Fine.

315
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,380
Let me ask you.

316
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,760
19 years ago,

317
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,280
the battle between Qionghua and Huanming Realm

318
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,230
was not because the Dream Tapir Demon Clan was terrorizing the mortal world.

319
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,960
Instead, the former Grandmaster, Tai Qing,

320
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,250
wanted to ascend into an immortal.

321
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,190
So he used Xihe and Wangshu to absorb

322
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,450
the spiritual power of Huanming's purple crystal mountain,

323
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:49,180
which resulted in the death of Qionghua seniors as they fought in the Huanming Realm.

324
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:54,540
Right?

325
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:58,780
Ziying.

326
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,080
Where did you hear such nonsense?

327
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,930
At the Netherworld,

328
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:04,780
spoken by Yun Tianqing.

329
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,750
In order to reveal the truth,

330
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,080
his primordial spirit stood waiting in the Netherworld.

331
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:11,550
Junior Ziying.

332
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,920
The former Grandmaster

333
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,340
didn't do it for himself.

334
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,430
He did it for all of us to ascend.

335
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:18,760
You planned to massacre the entire

336
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,500
Dream Tapir Demon Clan just to ascend?

337
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,120
The Dream Tapir Demons are not evil.

338
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,850
They are all innocent lives!

339
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,370
The former Grandmaster was my master.

340
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,890
I can't comment on his merits and wrongs.

341
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,580
But while the Dream Tapir Demons had countless casualties,

342
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,140
Qionghua has the Thousand-Man Tomb as well.

343
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:36,810
We are already enemies with them.

344
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:39,700
Does it still matter whether they are good or evil?

345
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,830
Grandmaster is right.

346
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:48,020
Grandmaster is right.

347
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:05,910
Are you done?

348
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,740
Actually, you should know

349
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,400
what my father said.

350
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,860
I just don't want you to make more mistakes.

351
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,310
Yun Tianqing only said one thing right.

352
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,510
The only thing we have in common

353
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:25,230
is the vow under the Phoenix Flower Tree.

354
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:27,820
Brother.

355
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:29,980
How much damage

356
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,680
will a war leave behind?

357
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,670
How many people will die in vain?

358
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,660
You were frozen for 19 years because of it.

359
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,990
Why do you have to repeat the same mistake?

360
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:40,550
Why don't you ask me

361
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,440
why I want to ascend?

362
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,470
When I was eight,

363
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,490
the village where I lived with my parents

364
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:50,200
suffered years of drought.

365
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,980
A fortune-teller came and said

366
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:56,450
I was the reincarnation of the demon of drought.

367
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,270
He must kill me

368
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,930
to save the lives of others.

369
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:03,350
But that night,

370
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,090
due to the drought,

371
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,480
a fire started

372
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,500
and reduced most of

373
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,250
the village to ashes.

374
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:15,490
But all the villagers

375
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,760
thought I set the fire.

376
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,220
They forced my father

377
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,850
to bury me alive.

378
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,910
I treated them as my family.

379
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,160
But no one protected me.

380
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,960
In the end, my father had no choice.

381
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:41,500
He personally hammered the nails into my coffin.

382
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,670
Even now, I could hear

383
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:50,300
the sound of my father nailing the coffin.

384
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,220
Seven iron nails in a row.

385
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,240
But I was only eight years old.

386
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,070
I didn't mean to harm anyone.

387
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:12,030
But everyone, including my parents,

388
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,500
wanted me to die.

389
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:20,740
So,

390
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:25,070
you don't trust people anymore.

391
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,400
No.

392
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,080
I also trusted your parents.

393
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,800
But they also abandoned me because of the demons.

394
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:42,930
The more I remember the vow under the Phoenix Flower Tree,

395
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,370
the more I am aware.

396
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,870
I'd rather betray others

397
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:51,680
than let others betray me.

398
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,350
Now I finally understand

399
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:59,180
why Elder Chongguang

400
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:02,570
wanted to drive Tianhe out of Qionghua.

401
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:06,470
He didn't want the host to merge with the WangShu Sword.

402
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,580
Because he knew

403
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:10,400
you and Xuan Xiao were still following Tai Qing's footsteps.

404
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,160
You want to continue using Xihe and Wangshu

405
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,920
to open the passageway of the Huanming Realm
and absorb the spiritual power of the purple crystal!

406
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,750
You plan to let these innocent disciples

407
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,300
die for your ascension.

408
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,250
Murong Ziying!

409
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,880
How dare you talk so rudely to me?

410
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,730
I'm the Grandmaster

411
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:25,600
and your master!

412
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:26,810
Yes.

413
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,230
You taught me

414
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,930
to be humble and always deliver.

415
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,230
You taught me

416
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:36,600
that people can't stand in the world without loyalty.

417
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,130
That we must protect the people with justice.

418
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,240
Have you done

419
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,510
as you preached?

420
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,440
I've never been unfaithful to Qionghua.

421
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,150
And I've never hurt the innocent.

422
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,580
What about Xuan Ying?

423
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,170
What about Elder Chongguang?

424
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,350
Xuan Ying was

425
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,220
created by you with forbidden magic.

426
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,150
To extend his life,

427
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,960
you bought the primordial spirits of the living.

428
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,820
Isn't that hurting the innocent?

429
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,020
In order to cover this up,

430
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,290
you framed Elder Chongguang

431
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:13,510
and got him badly injured.

432
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:15,920
Isn't this considered being disloyal to Qionghua?

433
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,720
Ziying,

434
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,060
don't listen to the others.

435
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:21,790
Grandmaster has no reason to create a shadow man.

436
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,380
You ordered Xuan Ying

437
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,110
to hire Lingsha.

438
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,400
You tempted her with the Fuyao Immortal Fruit Pill

439
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,740
and forced her to lure Tianhe

440
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,770
to Qionghua with the Wangshu Sword.

441
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,590
You created Xuan Ying

442
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,750
to obtain WangShu

443
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,820
and use us to break the ice for Xuan Xiao.

444
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:41,940
In this way,

445
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,210
you and him can use Xihe and Wangshu to ascend, right?

446
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,140
Murong Ziying.

447
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,860
You've let me down.

448
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,880
I don't want to explain anything to you.

449
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,860
You'd rather believe the demons in Boxian Town

450
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,470
than me.

451
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,400
What I said just now

452
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:11,590
didn't mention anything

453
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,220
about the demons in Boxian Town.

454
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:18,810
Grandmaster,

455
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,640
you have told me the answer.

456
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:24,870
Uncle Ziying,

457
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,040
do you have any evidence to support your words?

458
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,110
Evidence?

459
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,580
I'm not trying to convict anyone,

460
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,840
but to tell all of you that

461
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,680
Qionghua is not Qionghua.

462
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,500
We're not fighting for justice,

463
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,580
but for our own desires.

464
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:50,950
Shut up!

465
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,560
Murong Ziying.

466
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,750
Listen carefully.

467
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,680
Even if I created Xuan Ying,

468
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:01,400
I did it so that Wangshu could return to Qionghua.

469
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,020
Now,

470
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:07,100
the Dream Tapir Demons are the ones who won't let Qionghua go.

471
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,560
Disregarding Zong Lian's tragic death,

472
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,100
the demonic rebellion in Chenzhou

473
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,480
made 3,000 people lose their bearing.

474
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,580
Guixie broke into Qionghua at night

475
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:19,260
and hurt dozens of disciples.

476
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,120
How can you say they are innocent?

477
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:23,130
Do you want me

478
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:25,520
to surrender

479
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,400
because of past grudges

480
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,620
and abandon the lives of our current disciples?

481
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:32,760
I, Su Yao,

482
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,840
can resign from my position

483
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,890
because of violating the sect rules.

484
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:38,340
But I won't allow you

485
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,290
to stir up people's hearts at this moment.

486
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,300
Murong Ziying.

487
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,730
Grandmaster has always been nice to you.

488
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:50,190
But you keep siding with the demons

489
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:51,260
and spreading lies.

490
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,340
What do you want?

491
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:54,990
If you hadn't protected the demon, Liu Mengli,

492
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,280
she would have died by Qionghua's sword.

493
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,280
Uncle Ziying.

494
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:01,190
The Dream Tapir Demons are the ones who want to kill us.

495
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:02,920
You have to be clear about that.

496
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,840
I made a big mistake because I was

497
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:09,710
too eager to return Wangshu to Qionghua.

498
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,590
But I did it to protect Qionghua.

499
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,490
I have no selfish motive.

500
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,730
I can die fighting

501
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,430
for Qionghua!

502
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,260
I will never trust Murong Ziying.

503
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,110
I'm willing to go to the battlefield with you.

504
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:39,340
To the battlefield!

505
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:50,140
Ziying,

506
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:54,630
you are my favorite disciple.

507
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:58,790
If you tell them now

508
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,470
you're wrong,

509
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,720
I can forgive you.

510
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,690
If you admit your mistake,

511
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,350
you're still my Ziying.

512
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,260
Grandmaster,

513
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,610
you're the one who should be admitting your mistake.

514
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:23,280
Ziying,

515
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,200
put the big picture first.

516
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,130
The big picture?

517
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,050
The big picture is to avoid the war!

518
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,160
Ziying,

519
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,460
don't you

520
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:35,760
care about

521
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,850
our master-disciple relationship?

522
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,990
But you can't let innocent Qionghua disciples

523
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,650
and the Dream Tapir Demon Clan

524
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:03,900
die for your own anger and hatred.

525
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,050
Let me tell you.

526
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:07,750
There is no innocent person in this world.

527
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,610
Only the survival of the fittest.

528
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,140
Even if you know the truth,

529
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:14,030
if you're not strong enough,

530
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:16,740
the truth would just be a story.

531
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,490
I don't know if I'm strong enough,

532
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,080
but I will do my best

533
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,510
to stop this war.

534
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:30,670
Yun Tianhe,

535
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,650
you are the second person I can be truthful to,

536
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,000
right after Yun Tianqing.

537
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,200
We have the same nature.

538
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,360
But we need different things.

539
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,880
Let's say goodbye.

540
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:45,750
I don't want

541
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:48,720
to see you again when I'm at war

542
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,380
with the Dream Tapir Demon Clan.

543
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,700
Senior Xuan Xiao.

544
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:56,390
Senior.

545
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:58,320
Aunt Su Xi.

546
00:29:58,570 --> 00:29:59,770
Is Ziying in trouble?

547
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,890
Ziying questioned Grandmaster

548
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:04,420
about the truth 19 years ago

549
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,010
and the matter with Xuan Ying.

550
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,560
The sect leaders and the disciples

551
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,700
all asked Grandmaster to punish Ziying.

552
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,950
But if we do,

553
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:12,850
Ziying will be crippled.

554
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,160
Murong Ziying,

555
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:28,170
for the sake of our relationship,

556
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:29,300
if you plead guilty,

557
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,070
I'll let you stay in Qionghua.

558
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,600
But you're not fit to be

559
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,230
the sect leader of the Sword Division.

560
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,200
Guards!

561
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:41,210
Remove his headpiece.

562
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,500
No need.

563
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:15,810
Ziying.

564
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,430
Su Yao.

565
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:23,570
Your disciple has more integrity than you.

566
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:31,810
Ziying is telling the truth.

567
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,180
Why did you punish him like this?

568
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,610
Does it matter if it's true or not?

569
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,880
Now in Qionghua,

570
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:50,300
I'm the only one calling the shots.

571
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:51,540
That's the truth.

572
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,460
In that case,

573
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:57,390
I have no regrets

574
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,680
cutting my hair and removing my headpiece.

575
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:04,430
Considering Murong Ziying's contribution to finding the cold weapon for me,

576
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:06,230
I hereby expel him from the sect.

577
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:10,300
Haven't you always wanted to protect people?

578
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,440
Go to Jixian Garden

579
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,100
and do some cleaning.

580
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:14,850
That is a sound decision.

581
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:15,930
I'll feel better

582
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:19,970
being a cleaner than being here.

583
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,190
Uncle Ziying...

584
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:23,240
[Qingfeng Pavilion]

585
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,400
Miss Han.

586
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,570
What are you looking at?

587
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:23,700
You look so serious.

588
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,270
I'm looking at how to treat a mortal

589
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:27,530
who has been wounded by a mythical beast.

590
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:28,970
Feng Er.

591
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:31,660
Do you know about Hou Yi's Sun-Shooting Bow?

592
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:35,190
I heard that the Primordial-Spirit-Initiating Moon-Chasing Bow and Hou Yi's Sun-Shooting Bow

593
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:36,650
were a pair of divine bows.

594
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:38,790
If someone merges the two bows,

595
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,000
then he's a god.

596
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:43,230
It's nothing to be hurt by the mythical beast.

597
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,370
[Ziying is in trouble. Go back to Jixian Garden now.]

598
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,920
I have to go back to the Jixian Garden to find them.

599
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,960
I'll take this book.

600
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,230
I don't care how many books you take.

601
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:54,950
You have to tell me

602
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:55,730
if Tianhe is okay.

603
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:57,290
Tianhe is fine. Ziying is not.

604
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:58,020
I'm leaving.

605
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:04,830
Mengli,

606
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:06,790
you've told me so much.

607
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,850
about your experience in the mortal world.

608
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:09,909
I really don’t know

609
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:12,449
whether I should thank Yun Tianqing

610
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,219
or hate him for saving you.

611
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:16,139
I'm grateful to Uncle Yun.

612
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:18,790
He not only let me live

613
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,920
but also made me feel the love of my parents.

614
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:24,350
I also met great friends like Tianhe,

615
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:25,060
Lingsha,

616
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:27,949
and Uncle Ziying.

617
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,159
Mengli,

618
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,130
tell me the truth.

619
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,060
About the human named Tianhe,

620
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,770
do you love him as a friend

621
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,250
or romantically?

622
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,139
I...

623
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:51,980
I have never romantically loved a man.

624
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:54,530
But ever since we separated,

625
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,760
he often appeared in front of me.

626
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:00,300
I really want to know

627
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,720
how he is now.

628
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,220
It seems that he has grown roots in my daughter's heart.

629
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:10,310
But Li,

630
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:12,370
if you really love him

631
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,370
and want to protect him,

632
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,020
you must remember that

633
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:19,210
humans and demons have different paths.

634
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:20,840
Humans and demons coming together

635
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,770
will only bring bad consequences.

636
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:25,470
Mother.

637
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:28,230
I said this just to tell you that

638
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,520
humans and demons can live in peace.

639
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:33,590
Otherwise, how could there be the Qingluan Peak,

640
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,550
Qingfeng Pavilion,

641
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,850
and Boxian Town in the mortal world?

642
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:37,840
I don't hate all humans either.

643
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:39,910
But as long as Qionghua

644
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:41,750
has Xihe and WangShu,

645
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:44,840
they won't give up on invading the Huanming Realm

646
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,710
to satisfy their greed for ascension.

647
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:49,040
How can I not protect my home and my family?

648
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:52,590
Follow me.

649
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:54,170
Where are we going?

650
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:55,710
You are the young chief of Dream Tapir Demons

651
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,170
and the future commander.

652
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,460
As long as you see your people,

653
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,140
you will understand me.

654
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,010
Don't you feel anything

655
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:12,220
after all that I've said?

656
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,770
At least give me an expression.

657
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,440
Right and wrong

658
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,190
can be reversed.

659
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,100
What else is there to hope for?

660
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,100
What you said is nonsense.

661
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,460
Right or wrong is determined by our hearts, not what others say.

662
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,320
Murong Ziying.

663
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:36,790
You cut your hair off and removed your headpiece.

664
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:38,290
But did you also remove

665
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,790
your vows and responsibilities?

666
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,800
Tianhe is injured by the Torch Dragon,

667
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,930
but he still insists on what he thinks.

668
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,900
We don't know how Mengli is doing in the Huanming Realm.

669
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:50,740
And you?

670
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,560
Just because you're

671
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,410
not a disciple of the Qionghua Sect anymore,

672
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:55,810
you've lost your spirit.

673
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:58,910
You care about your dignity the most.

674
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:03,090
The headpiece you wore

675
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,840
was never for us.

676
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:08,580
You're a hypocrite.

677
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:10,660
You're a coward.

678
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:13,510
You're just a weak coward.

679
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:23,900
Ziying,

680
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,470
look at me.

681
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,910
You have to pull yourself together.

682
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:34,250
Didn't we say

683
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:37,780
as long as our hearts are together, we are not afraid of anything?

684
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,630
But how can your heart

685
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:40,040
be so easily broken

686
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,990
by Su Yao and the others?

687
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,300
You still have a long life ahead.

688
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,960
Nothing can't be changed.

689
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:54,040
Do you remember

690
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:57,650
what you promised my sister in the Netherworld?

691
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,470
You said you would do your best

692
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:04,810
to protect me till your last moment.

693
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,910
But look at you now.

694
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,780
Do you want me to protect you instead?

695
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:17,130
Alright, Ziying.

696
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,480
I've said everything I can say.

697
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,670
I just want to see the old Murong Ziying return.
