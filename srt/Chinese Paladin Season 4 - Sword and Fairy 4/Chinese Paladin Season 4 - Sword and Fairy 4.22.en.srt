[Episode 22]

4
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,370
Master.

5
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,009
Let me die.

6
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,150
Su Yao.

7
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,430
As the grandmaster,

8
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,500
you do have the air of a leader.

9
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,680
But unfortunately,

10
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:02,290
you're too soft, just like any other woman.

11
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:14,830
Uncle.

12
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,990
It was all my fault. I wasn't thinking straight.

13
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,750
If you forgive me this time,

14
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,300
I'll be at your service.

15
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:28,560
Okay.

16
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,300
Where's Xuan Xiao's Spiritual Light Zao Jade?

17
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,030
Give it to me.

18
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,000
Do you want the Zao jade

19
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,230
because you want to go to the forbidden area?

20
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:39,740
Yes.

21
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,000
I've made a breakthrough in the realm.

22
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,300
I'm going to the forbidden area to kill Xuan Xiao now

23
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,510
to prevent further trouble.

24
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,910
As long as Xuan Xiao dies,

25
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,710
the war 19 years ago

26
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,780
will not happen again.

27
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,470
It's not that I don't want to help you.

28
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,010
I can't.

29
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:57,940
The Zao jade

30
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,490
has been taken back by Xuan Xiao.

31
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,880
I dare not lie to you.

32
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,040
Elder.

33
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,810
Yun Tianhe

34
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,060
has the Zao jade Su Yu left.

35
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,830
Take this puppet away first.

36
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:12,660
Yes.

37
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,790
Su Yao.

38
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,930
I know you love Xuan Xiao.

39
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,750
But Xuan Xiao is

40
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,230
a crazy and heartless man.

41
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,170
It's not worth it to lose your reason

42
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,170
and become a wreck

43
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,230
for him.

44
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,000
Wise up.

45
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:46,850
Liu Mengli.

46
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,130
If it weren't for you, a hypocrite

47
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,750
who sneaked into Master's mind,

48
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,630
Master wouldn't have ended up like this.

49
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,430
You and Yun Tianhe

50
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,160
caused Senior Xuanye's death.

51
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,560
How dare you come here?

52
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,650
I can understand that you and Sect Leader hate me.

53
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,620
But today, I'm here to see Sect Leader for Senior Xuanye.

54
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,340
I won't believe

55
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,710
anything you say.

56
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,320
How about this?

57
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,950
Please give this to Sect Leader.

58
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,270
Senior Xuanye?

59
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,590
You drew this portrait?

60
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,850
I'll forever remember

61
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,170
Senior Xuanye's smile and voice.

62
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,159
I know you care about Senior Xuanye very much.

63
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:39,220
But think about it.

64
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,710
She always hated Yun Tianhe

65
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,280
but never acted rashly.

66
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,630
Why did she suddenly try to kill Tianhe?

67
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,710
You should know who she was in close contact with

68
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:49,909
before she died,

69
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,070
and who fueled her anger

70
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,730
and intensified her hatred.

71
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,590
You should also know

72
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,520
whose fault it was that Sect Leader

73
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,220
got grounded today.

74
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:00,420
Senior.

75
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,670
Senior Xuanye has passed away.

76
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,600
If you want to protect Sect Leader,

77
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,340
you should honestly tell him the truth

78
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,920
and your doubts.

79
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,050
Sorry, Senior.

80
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:00,170
It's okay.

81
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:01,920
Take your time.

82
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,210
Master said

83
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,790
the wielders of Xihe and Wangshu

84
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,510
need to feel a connection

85
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,700
to combine the power of the two swords.

86
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,500
As long as we focus on each other…

87
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,270
But Senior,

88
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,260
if we don't deeply love each other,

89
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,960
how can we have a connection?

90
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:28,960
Senior.

91
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,520
Have you ever loved someone

92
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,430
in a way that you never did before?

93
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,050
What is love?

94
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,470
It makes death an easy choice.

95
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,280
So when you're willing to die for someone,

96
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,710
it means you're deeply in love with her.

97
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,770
It seems that's what's happening

98
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:53,100
between Lingsha and me.

99
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,860
During the Sword Riding test,

100
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:55,740
to protect me,

101
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,470
-she fell off the sword.
-Lingsha.

102
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:59,720
At that moment, I felt that her life

103
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,650
was much more important than mine.

104
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,130
But when you can't be with the one you love,

105
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,550
your heart will always be as cold

106
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,390
as this ice.

107
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,260
I don't know what you're talking about,

108
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,560
but I really want to fulfill

109
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,850
Lingsha's every wish.

110
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:27,550
Senior.

111
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,810
If you can get a pill

112
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,960
for Lingsha,

113
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,010
I'll be very grateful.

114
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,950
It's just an elixir.

115
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,890
After I break free from the ice

116
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:36,970
and you help me fulfill

117
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,900
all my wishes in the past 19 years,

118
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:42,190
I'll give you whatever you want.

119
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,110
Deal.

120
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,430
By the way,

121
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,630
before I came here,

122
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,740
I went to Zuihuayin and picked some Phoenix Flowers.

123
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,310
I think you'll like them.

124
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,080
This Phoenix Flower Tree

125
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,650
blooms every night at nine.

126
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:30,510
I feel very happy when I look at it.

127
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,250
I'll come here with you to see it every day.

128
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,010
You're so stubborn.

129
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,710
What if I still refused to see you?

130
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,070
Then I'll come here

131
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,960
and wait for you every day

132
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,790
until you agree to meet me.

133
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,230
Huaixi,

134
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:09,750
Leave us.

135
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,760
I need to talk to Liu Mengli alone.

136
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:14,430
Okay.

137
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,440
The portrait of Ye you drew

138
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,660
is lifelike.

139
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,810
When Senior Xuanye was alive,

140
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,510
she was in as much pain as I am.

141
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,590
So since she passed away,

142
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,070
I've always felt that I want to live for her.

143
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,950
Naturally, I want to do things for her.

144
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:38,870
How can you compare yourself with Ye?

145
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,590
Ye.

146
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:18,590
Dad.

147
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,040
Ye.

148
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:29,630
What I regret the most

149
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,060
is that I failed to make you let go of your hatred.

150
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,030
It was my fault that you died.

151
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,800
How was it your fault?

152
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,710
In my heart,

153
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,770
you're the best father in the world.

154
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:44,190
Ye,

155
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,400
I have a lot to tell you.

156
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,980
Liu Mengli.

157
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:13,390
That illusion can't change the fact

158
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,690
that Ye is dead.

159
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,820
I just want to fulfill a father's wish

160
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,730
to see his daughter.

161
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,650
Besides, in that illusion,

162
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,270
I didn't create her.

163
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,200
You imagined her.

164
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,040
Sect Leader.

165
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,010
Your biggest regret

166
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:31,600
is that you didn't help Senior Xuanye let go of hatred.

167
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,300
Then why are you torturing yourself

168
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,580
with that hatred?

169
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,670
Just like Senior Mengli,

170
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,340
I hope you can tell right from wrong

171
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,180
and be careful not to be used.

172
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:42,850
I'll take my leave.

173
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:48,310
If I want to see Ye again,

174
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,700
can you do that magic trick again?

175
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,660
I'll come

176
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,270
whenever you want to see her.

177
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,550
Senior Xuan Xiao.

178
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:34,370
I think my mom

179
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,350
was also the person

180
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,640
you cared for the most.

181
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,120
Murderous aura.

182
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,200
Elder Chongguang?

183
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,330
You saved me once.

184
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,270
Why do you want to kill me now?

185
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:59,180
I saved you last time for Ziying.

186
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,460
I don't have to kill you this time.

187
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,730
Give me the Zao jade.

188
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,130
You want to use the Zao jade

189
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,950
to kill Senior Xuan Xiao?

190
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:16,610
You said my dad killed his fellow disciples.

191
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,260
If you go in and kill Senior Xuan Xiao,

192
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,380
will you be any different from him?

193
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,380
You know nothing.

194
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,960
I need to kill Xuan Xiao to prevent a disaster

195
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,020
and save Qionghua.

196
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,250
If you get in my way,

197
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,970
you'll become a traitor

198
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,780
like your father.

199
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,310
Yun Tianhe.

200
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,880
Consider this my trial for you.

201
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,000
If you open the door,

202
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,600
you'll betray me.

203
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:50,990
Elder Qingyang.

204
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:51,590
Come here.

205
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,960
-Turn my right.…
-What's wrong with you?

206
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,520
Turn my right hand toward me.

207
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,350
Now.

208
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,790
Elder Chongguang has ended his seclusion?

209
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,750
Not only that. He's made a breakthrough in the realm.

210
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,550
He cast this spell on me just now.

211
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,130
Oh no, something bad is going to happen.

212
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:12,930
What's wrong?

213
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,320
Just now, Old Chongguang

214
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,830
received a message like this.

215
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,520
I don't know what's written on it,

216
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,310
but he said he'd teach Su Yao a lesson

217
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:20,230
and kill Xuan Xiao.

218
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,050
I tried to stop him.

219
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,680
But he cast a spell on me.

220
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,790
To be honest, after he made a breakthrough in the realm, his spell was…

221
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,120
Elder, get to the point.

222
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,110
Okay.

223
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:29,240
The point is that

224
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,880
Su Yao sent me a message

225
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,420
that Chongguang went to Tianhe

226
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,470
to get his Zao jade,

227
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,270
and he planned to kill Xuan Xiao.

228
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,380
I know Tianhe.

229
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,740
He won't give him the Zao jade.

230
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,030
Wait for me.

231
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,950
I don't know what kind of disaster

232
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,550
Senior Xuan Xiao will bring.

233
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,810
He's sealed in ice now.

234
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,050
It's dishonorable of you

235
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:54,760
to go in and kill him now.

236
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,600
It's only fair

237
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,830
that you have a duel with him

238
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,030
after he breaks free.

239
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,390
I don't want to hurt you.

240
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,490
Give me the Zao jade.

241
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,240
No way.

242
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:16,500
Yun Tianhe.

243
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,110
I'll say it one last time.

244
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,580
Give me the Zao jade.

245
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,760
If you insist on protecting Xuan Xiao,

246
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,250
don't blame me for being hard on you.

247
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,250
I can't wait to see

248
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,990
how many times you'll hit me.

249
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:45,990
Yun Tianhe.

250
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,980
You're as rebellious as your father.

251
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:53,240
Take my advice. Know your place.

252
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,770
Give me the Zao jade.

253
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:56,600
Don't force me

254
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,510
to put an end to your life now.

255
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:26,870
Mom.

256
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:31,390
Dad.

257
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:39,710
Senior Xuan Xiao.

258
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,180
Sorry.

259
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,990
Dad. Mom.

260
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,180
Senior Xuan Xiao.

261
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,079
Sorry.

262
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,610
Tianhe.

263
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,400
You ruined my plan.

264
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,070
I shouldn't have spared your life.

265
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:43,790
Chongguang!

266
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,410
Elder Chongguang.

267
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:50,790
You promised me

268
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,370
to keep Tianhe safe.

269
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:54,050
What about your promise to me?

270
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,440
I broke my promise. You can punish me.

271
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,290
But if you want to hurt Tianhe,

272
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,520
you have to fight with me first.

273
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,680
Uncle Ziying.

274
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:05,730
Old Chongguang.

275
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,010
You've gone too far!

276
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:07,710
Qingyang.

277
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,250
I'm fine with you being timid

278
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,350
and playing dumb.

279
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,350
But don't you understand

280
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,730
why I'm doing this?

281
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:15,340
Yes.

282
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,510
I've been playing dumb. I'm timid.

283
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:20,020
But I don't want you to start bloodshed in Qionghua.

284
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:20,770
Listen.

285
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:23,300
If you insist on starting a killing spree,

286
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,560
Ziying and I won't stand by.

287
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,180
Kill the two of us too if you dare.

288
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:28,840
You…

289
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:38,740
Tianhe.

290
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:39,990
Tianhe.

291
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:40,660
Tianhe.

292
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,730
Elder Qingyang.

293
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:33,970
Is Tianhe alright?

294
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:35,960
He's absolutely fine.

295
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,750
The strong spiritual power inside him has been protecting him.

296
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:39,750
Anyone else

297
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,180
who got beaten like that by Chongguang

298
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,550
would have died.

299
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,680
I promise

300
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,900
he'll be right as rain in just a few days.

301
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,350
It seems that Tianhe's spiritual power

302
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,810
is always protecting him.

303
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,980
Elder Qingyang, you must be tired from healing Tianhe.

304
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,510
Let me send you back to rest.

305
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,550
To be honest, I'm really tired.

306
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,070
If it weren't for him,

307
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,020
I wouldn't have spent so much of my spiritual power.

308
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,960
Little Master, you know what I mean.

309
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,920
I do.

310
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,290
As long as Tianhe can be all right,

311
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,660
I'll make all the medicinal soups I know

312
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,700
for you.

313
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,830
It's a deal.

314
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:13,680
I'll count on them to make me look even younger than Chongguang.

315
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:14,950
Don't walk me out.

316
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,830
Chongguang may give you a hard time again.

317
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,960
I can handle that old guy. I'm leaving.

318
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,290
Go in and take a look.

319
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,680
I've been wanting to go in.

320
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,280
Without you in my way, I'd have already gone in.

321
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,810
Mengli, why don't you come in with me?

322
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,480
I'll stay here.

323
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,720
I have something to say to Uncle Ziying.

324
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,320
Don't stay inside for too long.

325
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,250
Senior Huaixin may come back soon.

326
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,510
Okay. I'll go in and check on Tianhe.

327
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,200
Uncle Ziying, I…

328
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:54,280
It's fine if you don't have anything to say.

329
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,050
Tianhe.

330
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:16,270
You asked me to rest assured and wait for you.

331
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:16,870
But you…

332
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,640
Every time you put your life at risk for me,

333
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:23,730
I was so worried that I'd rather I were the one in danger.

334
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,470
Your life is very important

335
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,630
to me as well.

336
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,140
Do you know that?

337
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,430
I know.

338
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,590
You woke up.

339
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:45,650
Be careful.

340
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:46,860
Be careful.

341
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,560
How are you?

342
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:50,990
Are you hungry? Are you thirsty?

343
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:51,680
I'm fine.

344
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:57,780
Where is my Zao jade?

345
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,510
Don't worry.

346
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,300
It's here.

347
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,590
When Ziying and Elder Qingyang brought you back,

348
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:03,060
you held it tightly in your hands.

349
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:03,700
But...

350
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,890
You smashed the jade in order to save Xuan Xiao.

351
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,970
I believe your parents must know it.

352
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:26,530
They must still be in the jade.

353
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,280
Let me try.

00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:56,590

found a place where I could see you

00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:04,220
♫My thought affected my whole life♫

377
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,820
But I can't do it anymore.

378

♫The destiny is boiling, and we'll finally be apart♫

379

380

382
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:25,250
Lingsha.

383
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:30,220
My parents are missing.

384
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:34,440
Don't worry.

385
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:35,300
Don't worry.

386
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,110
Don't worry. Relax.

387
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,080
Have you forgotten what I do?

388
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,130
I can hunt for treasure and repair antiques.

389
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:43,450
I've repaired much ancient jade like this.

390
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,220
Although

391
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,930
your mother's Zao jade is indeed special,

392
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,940
repair technique

393
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:50,220
is a unique skill of our Han family.

394
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:51,270
Believe me.

395
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,950
I'll try my best to repair it.

396
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,310
Whether you can repair it or not,

397
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,320
I believe you.

398
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:03,990
Lie down and rest.

399
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,000
Get well soon.

400
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,370
Otherwise,

401
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:07,870
I won't repair it for you.

402
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:08,670
Okay.

403
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:10,760
I promise.

404
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,670
I'll take a good rest now.

405
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,710
Lie down.

406
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:39,890
You're so worried about Tianhe.

407
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:41,750
Why didn't you go in with Lingsha?

408
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,400
You're also worried about him.

409
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,670
But you're still standing here with me.

410
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,200
Sometimes, it's not a good thing

411
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,960
to know other people's thoughts.

412
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,580
Because you'll be likely to hide your own thoughts.

413
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,380
It'll be hard.

414
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,260
Lingsha, how is Tianhe?

415
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,520
He looked fine.

416
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:09,660
He's asleep.

417
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,230
Uncle, please

418
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,790
find some elixirs to strengthen his body.

419
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:15,190
Don't worry. I've already thought of that.

420
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,370
This is the Zao jade that Tianhe smashed?

421
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,790
I've repaired so many jade stones and antiques.

422
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,420
I want to try to repair it too.

423
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,480
The Zao jade isn't an ordinary magical instrument.

424
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,360
It's not easy to repair it.

425
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,900
But this is the only thing I can do for Tianhe.

426
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,870
I'm thinking

427
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,990
if it can restore its spiritual power

428
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:38,350
and let Tianhe see his parents again, it'll be good.

429
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,730
Anyway, I think it belongs

430
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:40,610
to cold jade.

431
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,270
Should I find a cold place?

432
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,950
Spiritual Light Zao Jade belongs to Qionghua.

433
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:48,140
Maybe it's recorded in the Qionghua magical instrument record.

434
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,760
I'll go to Yunjing Pavilion tomorrow.

435
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,150
Okay.

436
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,950
That's great, Mengli.

437
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,880
You read fast. I'm counting on you.

438
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:56,550
I'll take you to a place tomorrow.

439
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,790
Maybe it'll help.

440
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,010
Okay.

441
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:21,290
The place where Qionghua's swords are made is similar to the forbidden area.

442
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:23,990
The technique of sword-making needs to cooperate with the geographical location.

443
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:26,840
Chengtian Sword Platform takes the form of Tai Chi.

444
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,240
It's divided into extreme cold and extreme hot.

445
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,570
One is used to melt iron,

446
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,270
while the other is used to temper swords.

447
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,980
This place is also full of spiritual energy.

448
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:36,110
So it's the best place to forge swords.

449
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,550
These are the disciples of the Xing Division, right?

450
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:41,610
Why do I feel like they don't know you?

451
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,060
Forging swords requires no distractions.

452
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:48,060
If they're distracted, their efforts will be in vain.

453
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,670
This is the coldest place here.

454
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,630
Is this stone platform okay?

455
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:06,830
No problem.

456
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,900
I need at least one day.

457
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:11,830
Go back first.

458
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,700
It's extremely cold here.

459
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:15,030
I'm worried that after a long time,

460
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,240
the cold aura will go into your body.

461
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,170
I know what to do.

462
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,870
I'll go over there

463
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:21,550
about every two hours.

464
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,990
I'll go to that hot place.

465
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:24,750
Anyway, don't worry.

466
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:26,760
Okay.

467
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:03,730
[Yunjing Pavilion]

468
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,410
Uncle,

469
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,800
that's all I know.

470
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,960
I asked you to keep an eye on Yun Tianhe and his two friends.

471
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,730
That's all?

472
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:16,420
Yes, that's all.

473
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:18,370
Uncle.

474
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,690
This is also the last time I help you.

475
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:21,620
What do you mean?

476
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:22,490
You said before

477
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,160
that everything you did

478
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,190
was to take rvenge for Senior Xuanye.

479
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,920
I helped you because of Senior,

480
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,560
but I killed Senior.

481
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,850
Ye was killed by Yun Tianhe and his two friends.

482
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:34,460
If you really want to avenge Ye's death,

483
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,210
you should join me.

484
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:42,570
Didn't you say there's no one else here?

485
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:43,790
I'll go take a look.

486
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:51,930
Who is it?

487
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:54,680
Nothing.

488
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,190
A book fell down.

489
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:08,780
Huaixi.

490
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,560
I'll ask you one last time.

491
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,790
Are you willing to continue to help me?

492
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:16,790
I'm sorry, Uncle.

493
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,320
I don't want to get involved anymore.

494
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:32,910
Senior.

495
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,200
I happened to come across you when I was looking for books here.

496
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,050
May I ask you

497
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:39,910
what Sect Leader Xu Zhao asked you to do for him?

498
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:40,640
You heard it.

499
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,950
This is the last time I help Sect Leader.

500
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:43,990
I can't answer that.

501
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:46,850
Please don't tell anyone about what happened just now.

502
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:48,050
You self-reflected.

503
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,230
I'm relieved.

504
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:51,230
I won't make trouble for you.

505
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:52,590
But I won't help you.

506
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:53,630
Senior.

507
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,420
If you regret

508
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,500
that you didn't protect Senior well,

509
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:59,550
please protect Sect Leader Xu Liang

510
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,700
and don't let him be deceived again.

511
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,330
If you're looking for

512
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:09,110
the Qionghua magical instrument record,

513
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:10,470
it should be in the 396th volume

514
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:13,870
of the history of the 24th generation in Qionghua Chronicle.

515
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:15,530
Thank you for your guidance.

516
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,830
I finally understand why Su Yao

517
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,680
created you as a shadow man.

518
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,920
If you tell me

519
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:27,550
what Su Yao told you

520
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,060
and work for me,

521
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,140
I'll spare you.

522
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:35,130
I won't betray my master.

523
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,090
Elder.

524
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:46,890
I admire

525
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:49,190
your loyalty.

526
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:50,920
Unfortunately,

527
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,990
you're a fake.

528
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:57,810
It's not up to you whether you'll betray your master or not.

529
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,340
Something happened in Mount Kong.

530
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,080
It must be caused by Wangshu Sword.

531
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,210
Set out immediately

532
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:05,660
to get Wangshu Sword.

533
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,130
I

534
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,980
can't betray my master.

535
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:20,730
Xu Zhao.

536
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:23,140
Your two disciples

537
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,770
didn't deserve to die.

538
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:28,140
Elder, if he hadn't tried to kill,

539
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,840
-I wouldn't have...
-Enough.

540
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,600
I'll destroy this memory myself.

541
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:39,750
Think about how to be a person and a teacher

542
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:41,720
in the future.

543
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:45,790
I feel guilty. Thank you, Elder.

544
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,710
Ziying's two female disciples,

545
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:51,280
Liu Mengli and Han Lingsha,

546
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,280
are trying to repair the Zao jade.

547
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,910
How dare you look at me like that?

548
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,860
If it weren't for the purpose of controlling Su Yao,

549
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,290
I would grind your bones to dust

550
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:07,490
to vent my hatred

551
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:12,410
and avenge my two disciples' deaths.

552
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:14,750
I...

553
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,140
He's still useful.

554
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:27,930
Why are you angry?

555
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,690
The stagnation of my spiritual cultivation

556
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:32,130
and the pain in my heart

557
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,680
are all caused by Su Yao and him.

558
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,080
Elder, please help me restore my power.

559
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,650
I can do my best

560
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:43,440
to help you get rid of Xuan Xiao.

561
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,850
This is the Fuyao Immortal Fruit Elixir.

562
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:51,620
As long as you bring the Zao jade back,

563
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,820
with my current power

564
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,310
and the Fuyao Immortal Fruit Elixir,

565
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:56,520
I'll cure your heart disease.

566
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:58,790
Thank you, Elder.

567
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,260
Zao jade.

568
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:04,460
I'll take it.

569
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,380
The elixir.

570
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:06,910
Give it to me.

571
00:34:09,219 --> 00:34:10,790
I only give you half a day.

572
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:11,650
Elder.

573
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:13,489
Don't believe him.

574
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,440
This shadow man hasn't learnt to lie yet.

575
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,250
What do you think?

576
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:31,460
Elder.

577
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,480
He's loyal to Su Yao.

578
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:34,679
You just let him go like this.

579
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:35,420
He and Su Yao...

580
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,270
Don't worry.

581
00:34:36,489 --> 00:34:39,020
No matter how loyal this shadow man is, he understands

582
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,550
that if he goes to Su Yao now,

583
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:42,000
he'll be killed.

584
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:44,949
Besides, I put a charm on him.

585
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:47,270
He'll come back on time.

586
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:50,590
With him and his divine consciousness,

587
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:54,150
it's time for the Qionghua Sect to change its grandmaster.

588
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:01,150
Xuan Ying is in Chongguang's hands.

589
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,680
It's like a blade hanging above my head.

590
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,750
I have to find a way.

591
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:08,960
Who is it?

592
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:26,630
Are you alright?

593
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,470
I'm fine.

594
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,890
Thank you for your concern.

595
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:36,150
Elder Chongguang has made a breakthrough in the realm.

596
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:39,010
It's impossible for you to escape with your skills.

597
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,070
Did you conspire with him?

598
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:44,390
Tell me.

599
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,450
I don't want to betray you.

600
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:53,080
But I had no choice.

601
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,490
Chongguang

602
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:01,950
extracted the memories from your divine consciousness?

603
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:04,040
Master.

604
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,260
I promised Chongguang

605
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,040
that I'll give him

606
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:09,210
the Zao jade.

607
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:11,330
He'll give me

608
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,680
the elixir.

609
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:16,980
You're still doing this for that Han Lingsha?

610
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:18,650
Then why did you come back to me?

611
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:20,850
Aren't you afraid of being killed by me?

612
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:22,030
Master.

613
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,460
After I take back the elixir,

614
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,940
kill me.

615
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:00,770
Lingsha.

616
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:06,140
Uncle Ziying, you're here.

617
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,610
How is Tianhe?

618
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:09,010
Huaixin is taking care of him.

619
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:10,140
Everything is fine.

620
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,590
But you can't repair it anymore.

621
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:12,720
Go back and rest now.

622
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:15,110
I'm fine.

623
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,470
The cold aura is in your body.

624
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:20,840
If I hadn't arrived in time,

625
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,150
you would have been in a coma again.

626
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:25,810
But this jade instrument needs to be repaired as soon as possible.

627
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,080
This cold aura is nothing.

628
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:28,910
I can hold on.

629
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,760
The instruments are far less important than people.

630
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,300
Come with me.

631
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:31,900
But

632
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,500
Tianhe's parents are in the Zao jade.

633
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,240
I want Tianhe to see his mother as soon as possible.

634
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:38,870
Uncle.

635
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,080
Since I knew Tianhe,

636
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,340
I've lied to him and hurt him.

637
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:45,520
But he always protects me.

638
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:47,540
I just want to do something for him.

639
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,450
I can even stand your cold face.

640
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,270
This cold stone is nothing.

641
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:09,040
Uncle.

642
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,150
I'm here.

643
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:13,050
I'll help you drive the cold away every hour

644
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:15,720
until you finish repairing it.

645
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,160
Thank you, Uncle.

646
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:44,130
I think I've repaired it.

647
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:46,170
Ziying, look.

648
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,760
Did I call your name directly?

649
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,540
It doesn't matter.

650
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:52,650
Let me see.

651
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,200
Look.

652
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,610
How is it?

653
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:00,090
Ziying.

654
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,430
Do you also feel

655
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:05,880
that although the Zao jade has been repaired,

656
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:08,160
it doesn't have any spiritual energy?

657
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:14,370
Yes.

658
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:17,500
Are you tired?

659
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,930
Uncle Ziying. Lingsha.

660
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,080
I've found a way

661
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,400
to send spiritual light into the Zao jade.

662
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,890
Really? What is it?

663
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,700
But we can't complete it.

664
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:31,860
We need Tianhe's spiritual power.

665
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,720
Let's go to Tianhe now.

666
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,360
You go.

667
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,240
I'm a little tired.

668
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:37,040
Lingsha.

669
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,630
What you want the most is

670
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,810
that Tianhe can see his mother in the Zao jade.

671
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:43,930
Go now.

672
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:46,550
Have a good rest.

673
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:48,990
Let's go.

674
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:50,400
Lingsha.

675
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:52,910
I stayed up all night to look for information.

676
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:53,770
I'm also tired.

677
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:54,640
You go.

678
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,910
You two have a good rest.

679
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:00,740
I'm leaving.

680
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:53,430
Mother.

681
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:56,710
You're finally back.

682
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:08,590
Lingsha.

683
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,150
I saw my mother.

684
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:12,470
That's great.

685
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:14,570
It means the Zao jade is as good as new.

686
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:21,830
Xuan Ying?
