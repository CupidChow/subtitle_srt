Babe, it hurts Ow, it hurts

00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:25,776
Wait

4
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:27,236
Ow, it hurts

5
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,196
- Hold on
- Not there

00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:31,990
- Here?
- A little bit deeper

7
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:44,169
Thank goodness
These are my favorite earrings

8
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:47,756
Be more careful

9
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:52,219
Then...

10
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,139
Since you found my earring,

11
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:58,642
- why don't we...
- Wait, Mina

12
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:01,562
We're outside

13
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,522
Don't make me upset

14
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:04,815
Hold still

15
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:12,739
Again?

16
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:15,784
Sorry

Don't you find me sexy anymore?

19
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,960
It's not that, Mina

20
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:26,336
- We're outside and...
- Whatever

21
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:27,796
Mina!

22
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,173
Mina, wait...

Mina!

with this thing?

"Yu Jingu Counseling Center"
The doctor said I was perfectly healthy,

27
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:33,987
but it goes down whenever I try
to do it with my girlfriend

28
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:38,325
When did this problem begin?

29
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:40,619
Um...

30
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:43,372
We've been dating for about a year

31
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:48,585
and the problem started
about three months ago

32
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:53,131
Did something happen?

33
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,884
No, nothing happened,

34
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,804
but that's around the time we got engaged

35
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,018
Hey

36
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,856
- Sorry, sorry
- Come on

I'm here for counseling

38
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,777
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

Hey, that's marriage blues

40
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:20,742
Marry... What?

41
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:22,494
Marriage blues

42
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:25,831
As the unavoidable day approaches

43
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:29,126
when you'll become a married man,

44
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:32,879
your visceral fear kicked in

45
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:36,049
What? No way

46
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:37,050
Hey

47
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:39,845
A lot of people experience that

48
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:43,056
Why decide you marry her?

49
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,769
You know She wanted it

50
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,980
and I'm at that age

51
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:52,482
It happened naturally

52
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:55,610
That's the problem

53
00:03:55,652 --> 00:04:01,241
You're not sure about this marriage

54
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:02,552
because you're half-pushed into it

55
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,494
That's not what this is about

56
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:10,500
If you're getting married anyway,
you're lucky she has the good qualities

57
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:13,503
You got married for qualities,
and how did it turn out?

58
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,298
Why are you bringing that up?

59
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,924
I was scammed

60
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,968
Anyway, what I'm saying is,

61
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,771
is it right to get married because
everyone else is, because it's time

62
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,932
and because she's okay enough?

63
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,518
Then what kind of woman
do you want to marry?

64
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:33,899
Someone who makes my heart race
just thinking about her

65
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:38,153
Someone who smiles at me

66
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,489
Someone who makes my heart...

67
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,328
You're nuts

68
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:51,792
Stop chasing rainbows

69
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,961
Things that you're talking about,
having butterflies and stuff

70
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,672
It will go away in a few months,
no, a few weeks

71
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,258
If I had to live with someone
for the rest of my life,

72
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,385
I'd want that kind of love

73
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,305
Hey, are you thinking about Han Jane?

74
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:08,934
Wow

75
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:12,229
Hey, you're over-assessing the opportunity

76
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,648
You're obsessing about the goal
you never achieved

77
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:15,565
What goal?

78
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,901
You never got to bump uglies with Jane

79
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,487
- What the hell!
- Hey!

80
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:21,863
That's not the reason!

81
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:24,866
That's disgusting

82
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:27,202
Do you remember my first crush?

83
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:31,790
- Mijin?
- Yeah, that sexy college girl

84
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:34,543
I ran into her last year

85
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,712
Fuck, it was horrifying

86
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,216
Yu Jingu?

87
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:46,054
It's me, Mijin!

88
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:47,556
Mijin?

89
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:50,058
You haven't changed a bit

90
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,104
All the good memories of her

91
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,273
vanished that day

92
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:59,359
You used to follow her around

93
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:01,820
Hey, we're not the only ones
that got old

94
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,030
Han Jane? She could have sagging skin

95
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,324
and three kids Who knows?

96
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,868
That doesn't matter

97
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:13,164
In my memory, she'll always be 21

98
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,208
Hey, you should meet her

99
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:16,792
What?

100
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,089
The Han Jane in her 30s

101
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,260
"Hodol Agency"?

102
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,275
First love? First love...

103
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,571
You're starved, huh?

104
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:47,324
He's starved

105

Excuse me?

You're not getting any, are you?

107

What?

for their first love

109
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,339
have one reason

110
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,051

I can tell right away

112
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,471

113
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,975
You're about to get married, right?

00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,018
Yes

115
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,354
You're not sure if you should marry her?

116
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:18,897
No

117
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,732
And you didn't sleep with your first love

118
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:22,484
- No
- Yeah

119
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:25,862
I mean...

120
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:30,325
We're the best

121
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:33,995

122
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,664
in this country

123
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:40,835
I could tell as soon as I saw you

124
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,005
Tell me about her

125
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,465
What?

126
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,343
You're a bit slow, huh?

127
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,638
Jeez, so frustrating

128
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,724
Tell me about your first love

129
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:57,560
Oh, my first love?

130
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,063
She was...

131
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,983
Well...

132
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:06,152
It was a bright sunny day

133
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,863
I had only started teaching,

134
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,282
so every day was nerve-racking

135
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:17,497
But after that day, I looked forward
to class every day

136
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,126
You're the Photography professor, right?

137
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:26,172
- I'm in your class, I'm Han Jane
- The two hours with her

138
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:30,301
were like finding an oasis
in the middle of the desert

139
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,220
Stop!

140
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:35,348
I didn't ask for a love story

141
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,726
I meant her personal information!

142
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,353
Give me her name, date of birth,
and things like that

143
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,064
so I can find her

144
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,524

Her blood type is AB

152

I just want to see how she's doing

00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,491
Would you like to purchase it?

190
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,285
The full N.E. package?

191
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:05,248
Natural encounter

192
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:10,128
We'll arrange the most natural encounter
with your first love

193
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,881
It's an excellent service!

194
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,094
I don't know about this

195
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:20,346
Can't I just run into her on the street?

196
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,558
You know nothing

197
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,019
Let go of my leg

198
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:30,565
Let's say you run into her, but what next?

199
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:32,901
I can ask her if she's free to grab
a cup of coffee

200
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,527
What if she says, "I don't have time"?

201
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:36,446
I'll ask for her number

202
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,573
What if she says,
"I don't own a cell phone"?

203
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,116
Well, that's...

204
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:44,204
90% of success or failure depends
on the first encounter

205
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,998
If the first encounter isn't impressive,

206
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,793
you can't make love, okay?

207
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,420
- Okay
- Where is it?

208
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,047
Here, this will make you calm down

209
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:55,965
How much is this?

210
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:57,050
It's on the house

211
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,468
Thank you

212
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,932
Okay, she's coming?

213
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,392
Movie, go!

214
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:20,823
A thief!

215
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,793
Excuse me

216
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,969
Thank you

217
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,810
Professor Kim Hongki?

218
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:51,229
Professor

219
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,730
Professor?

220
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,192
Oh, sorry

221
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,320
I can't believe we're meeting
again like this

222
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,781
It's unbelievable

223
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:04,826
Yes, has it been ten years?

224
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,539
Time flies

225
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,877
How have you been?

226
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,130
Well...

227
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,258
I've been well

228
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:23,469
What about you?

229
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,180
How have you been?

230
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,893
Same old, same old You know me

231
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:35,023
You still like to take photos, huh?

232
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,775
Now I take photos to make a living

233
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,654
"Jane Studio"

234
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:45,283
That's awesome

235
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,660
"Han Jane"

236
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:51,831
What about you?

237
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,083
Do you still teach?

238
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,085
No

239
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,087
I started

240
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,506
my own company

241
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,679
A CEO? It doesn't suit you

242
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,140
Right?

243
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:22,570
I see you got married

244
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,447
Oh, no

245
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,825
Not yet
I'm getting married in three months

246
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,285
Really?

247
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:34,832
Congratulations

248
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,542
What about you?

249
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:37,960
Are you married?

250
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,256
No, not yet

251
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:54,227
Thank you for your help, Professor

252
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,813
Don't mention it

253
00:14:57,271 --> 00:15:00,233
It's good to see you

254
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,735
It's good to see you too

255
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:08,699
Good luck with the wedding

256
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:27,927
All right

257
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:29,846
One more time

258
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:34,267
Breath in and lower your head

259
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:37,019
Good and exhale

260
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,105
Lift your hips

261
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,274
Two

262
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:44,610
Three

263
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,530
Okay, the other leg

264
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,741
Change your position

265
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:56,581
Look up to the ceiling and one

266
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,749
All right, two

267
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,793
Three

268
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:18,019
You feel refreshed, right?

269
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,980
It's harder than I thought

270
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:22,273
I told you

271
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,568
It's different from running

272
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:29,864
You should take my classes once in a while
instead of playing soccer

273
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,117
- All right
- Can you zip me up?

274
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,556
What are you doing?

275
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:57,725
Oops

276
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,520
Whoa

277
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:03,606
What is this?

278
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,443
Did you see my naked back
and get a boner?

279
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:30,466
Kim Hongki, you're crazy
You're a trash

280
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:31,717
Seriously...

281
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,387
Man!

282
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,824
J-J-Jane

283
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:57,743
Jane, what's wrong?

284
00:17:57,994 --> 00:17:59,412
I don't want to do it here

285
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,831
You said you didn't mind where we went,
so...

286
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:02,957
I...

287
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,669
I've never done it before

288
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:07,712
What?

289
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,881
Jane

290
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,091
What?

291
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:16,679
Do you...

292
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,474
want to go see the ocean?

293
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,643
The ocean?

294
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:24,437
Yeah

295
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:16,030
So annoying

296
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:22,953
It's driving me crazy

297
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:27,875
Before I met her, she was
a black and white photo

298
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:31,671
but after meeting her,
she follows me around like a 3D hologram

299
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,255
She hasn't changed at all?

300
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,425
No, she got prettier

301
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,761
She was innocent and sexy

302
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:41,305
but now she's innocent, sexy,

303
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:42,973
and ripen

304
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:46,686
"Ripen"?

305
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,604
Fruits ripen

306
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:50,481
It's "mature," you idiot, "mature"!

307
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:51,982
Mature

308
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,361
I'm screwed

309
00:19:56,904 --> 00:20:00,908
You're not screwed, you hit the jackpot

310
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:02,242
What?

311
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:06,997
Hongki, people become guarded as they age

312
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,084
But you knew each other

313
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:12,503
You even dated

314
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,255
You were her professor

315
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:18,300
Dude, if you bring up the old days,

316
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:21,011
her heart will warm up
and her body will warm up

317
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,680
And then, you're doing it

318
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:25,391
Jeez, don't embarrass me

319
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:30,229
Anyway, you want closure, right?

320
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:39,196
I can't do that to Mina

321
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:44,160
Wouldn't it be better to get closure
before the wedding

322
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:47,163
than cheating on your wife?

323
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,248
You're married and cheating on your wife

324
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:53,127
Hey, people will think I'm cheating!

325
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:54,920
Shut up

326
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:57,882
Are you that scared of your father-in-law?

327
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:01,469
You came to my wedding, right?

328
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:06,307
I was shocked when I saw his guests

329
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:09,518
It felt like I was in a zoo

330
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:13,355
They had dragons and tigers on their bodies

331
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:17,693
I thought my wife just had a rich dad
Not a gangster dad

332
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:20,112
It's karma, dude

333
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:21,739
Shut up

334
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,242
- Huh?
- I'm quick

335
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:33,459
Anyway, in the long run,
it could be good for Mina too

336
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,066
Professor?

337
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,860
Hi, Jane

338
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:01,821
What are you doing here?

339
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,449
I live nearby

340
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:07,576
Oh, really?

341
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,997
What brings you here?

342
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:17,586
Oh, I had a meeting nearby
I'm heading home now

343
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,590
Okay, then

344
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:25,094
Wait, Jane

345
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:30,933
I'm going to get a drink

346
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:33,769
Do you want to join me?

347
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,646
Would you like to order?

348
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:40,860
I'll have a glass of your house wine

349
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,863
No, we'll take a bottle of Royal Salute

350
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:47,074
Oh, Royal Salute!
Yes, sir

351
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,535
A whole bottle?

352
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,538
That's a lot for just two people

353
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:56,417
I'm happy to see my old student

354
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,669
and you saved me from drinking alone

355
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,046
This is the least I can do

356
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:06,010
Thank you, Professor

357
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:22,985
You don't have to call me "Professor"
anymore

358
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:24,820
But still...

359
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:28,699
You'll always be a professor to me

360
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,744
That's all I am to you?

361
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,248
Oh...

362
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:40,210
It's Friday night, don't you have a date?

363
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:42,463
No

364
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:46,133
Whenever we meet these days,
we only talk about the wedding

365
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:49,595
It's three months away, right?

366
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:52,014
You must be really busy

367
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:53,724
Yeah

368
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:05,736
What about you?
Are you seeing anyone?

369
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,656
I haven't dated in a while

370
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,988
Why doesn't a pretty girl like you
have a boyfriend?

371
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,118
Well...

372
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,331
There's nobody that I want to date

373
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:37,267
Slow down
I know you're not a big drinker

374
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,603
No, no, it's okay

375
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,356
I'm not the old me

376
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,402
Still

377
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:53,158
I told you to slow down

378
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:55,828
I don't know what's wrong with me

379
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,621
I normally don't get drunk

380
00:24:57,955 --> 00:24:59,915
I'll call you a cab

381
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,543
Be careful, be careful

382
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,423
Jane

383
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:16,682
Professor!

384
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:20,894
Jane, wait

385
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:24,940
Hey...

386
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:27,151
I never want to see you again!

387
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:30,279
Jane!

388
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,531
J-Jane!

389
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:42,541
Hey, did you do it with Jane?

390
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:48,130
It's written on your face that you didn't

391
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,880
She slapped me in the face

392
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:52,092
Why?

393
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:53,469
I don't know

394
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,637
We drank in a bar

395
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,306
And?

396
00:25:57,848 --> 00:26:00,392
I tried to kiss her on the staircase

397
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:03,979
It feels like there's a step missing

398
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:06,273
You told me to create a sexy mood

399
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:08,609
Dude, you call that sexy?

400
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,360
Huh? You call that sexy?

401
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:14,156
Your hearts have to connect first
for your bodies to connect

402
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:17,201
What you did was molestation

403
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,660
"Han Jane"

404
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,079
Damn it

405
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,042
Damn it

406
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:45,437
He's seriously not going to call?

407
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,653
"Professor Hongki"

408
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:03,372
Hello?

409
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:14,258
We could've gone somewhere nice

410
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,678
I wanted to come here

411
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,263
Okay

412
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:25,769
Jane, about the other day...

413
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,230
I'm sorry

414
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:31,775
I made a mistake...

415
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:34,319
I know it was a mistake

416
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,947
I know that's not who you are

417
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:55,048
Anyway, I didn't know this place
was still here

418
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:57,885
I haven't been here since I graduated

419
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:00,637
Do you remember?

420
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,265
This is where I had my first pork rind

421
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:05,934
Of course, I remember

422
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:07,978
You insisted you wouldn't try it,

423
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,564
but once you had that first bite,
you ordered two more

424
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:12,691
That's right

425
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:15,861
After that first bite,
I ate until my jaw hurt

426
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:22,492
How's your friend doing?

427
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:24,536
Was it Nari?

428
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:26,663
Oh, Nahee?

429
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:30,083
Yes, we drank together once

430
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:34,588
She quit photography
and opened a coffee shop nearby

431
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:35,839
Oh

432
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:39,009
We haven't seen each other in a while
because we've been so busy

433
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:41,261
We should get together someday

434
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:44,765
Oh, right

435
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:48,310
You used to play the guitar

436
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:50,020
Do you still play?

437
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:53,732
No, I've been busy

438
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,323
This reminds me of the college days

439
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:04,368
I was really pretty back then

440
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:07,204
You're still pretty

441
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:09,498
You haven't changed

442
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,793
You haven't changed either

443
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:24,221
It was really fun

444
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:26,056
It reminded me of the old days

445
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:28,767
I had fun too

446
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:33,146
Then, goodbye

447
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:35,899
Jane

448
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,320
Let's get one more drink

449
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:47,744
I was surprised when I ran into you

450
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:51,206
I thought I'd never be able
to see you again

451
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:54,751
Me too

452
00:29:56,837 --> 00:30:00,007
Honestly, I thought about you a lot

453
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:16,732
I missed you, Jane

454
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:38,855
Babe, look over here

455
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,024
- Babe!
- Huh?

456
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:42,192
- Look over here
- Okay

457
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:44,403
One, two, three!

458
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,781
Let's drink Cheers!

459
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:53,745
Mm, so refreshing

460
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:57,040
Babe, look I saw this

461
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:59,143
and changed my mind about
the photo shoot in a studio

462
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,545
How about an outdoor photoshoot?
Take a look

463
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,880
Something like this
I love this sunlight

464
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,048
What do you think?

465
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:06,716
- Babe?
- Huh?

466
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,635
What are you thinking about?
Look

467
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:23,817
"First Love Analysis Report"

468
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:28,989
Babe, isn't this dress pretty?

469
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,908
Should I wear this
for our wedding photoshoot?

470
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:37,456
- Babe
- Huh? Oh

471
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,416
I was thinking about something

472
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:42,085
Come on
I'm not getting married alone

473
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,028
Is this dress nice?

474
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,505
Yes

475
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:47,924
We're out of beer

476
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,342
I'll go grab some more

477
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,178
Okay

478
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,555
Get me some ice cream

479
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:12,949
"To: Han Jane"
"Jane, about that night..."

480
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:17,537
"Jane..."

481
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:20,290
"Can we..."

482
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,651
"Revisit and receive a 20% discount"
Moon Dongbae, Hodol Agency"

483
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,010
Jeez

484
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:54,699
Whoa!

485
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:55,992
- Babe
- Huh?

486
00:33:57,661 --> 00:33:59,204
What is this?

487
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,831
Oh, that's...

488
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:05,835
The thing is...

489
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:06,962
When did you find her?

490
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:07,837
Huh?

491
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,839
I thought you weren't interested

492
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:13,468
When did you find a photographer?

493
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:16,012
I'm touched

494
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:20,475
I did some research,
and she isn't that great

495
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:22,769
What are you talking about?

496
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:24,563
She's the best one I've seen so far

497
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,650
I don't like her

498
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:30,777
I'll find a better photographer

499
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:33,113
Why? She's the best one I've seen

500
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,907
Especially the Gangneung beach photos

501
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:38,618
You know I love it, right?

502
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,036
The ocean view!

503
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:42,414
I really want to go for it

504
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:45,500
What about the South Coast?

505
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,712
No, I want to take photos
at Anmok Beach

506
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:51,673
The color of the ocean is different there

507
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:55,635
It's not just blue, it's cobalt blue
You know?

508
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:59,681
Then, I'll find another photographer
in the East Coast

509
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:01,266
What's gotten into you?

510
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:02,934
You told me I could do whatever I wanted

511
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,020
And there's no need

512
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,689
I already booked her

513
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:08,815
What?

514
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:12,402
Why? I contacted her while you were out

515
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:16,072
Luckily, she's free next week

516
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,408
N-N-Next week?
That soon?

517
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:22,037
We'll take pictures at sunset
and spend the night there

518
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:24,664
We'll book a car and a room for her

519
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,916
Isn't it so perfect?

520
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:29,336
What?

521
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:33,340
But... how...

522
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:36,176
There's nothing we can do
It's already done

523
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:39,012
She paid a deposit

524
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:41,640
I can't cancel it now

525
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,433
But still...

526
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:46,019
You can't shoot my pre-wedding photos...

527
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:47,479
Why not?

528
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:52,067
Nothing's going on between us

529
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:57,822
Yes, but...

530
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:01,034
It'll be my wedding gift to you

531
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,161
It's just work

532
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:10,001
I'm begging you, please

533
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:13,046
Dude, I told you to stop meeting her

534
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:14,589
It's gotten out of hand

535
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:16,549
I didn't know this would happen

536
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:17,801
It's driving me crazy!

537
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,969
You should've stopped at some point!

538
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,596
You didn't see the look on Mina's face

539
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:25,392
And even Jane said okay
My hands were tied

540
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,477
I'm not going!

541
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:30,689
Please come with me
If I go alone, I'll...

542
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,315
I will crumble

543
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:34,275
But I have no reason to go with you

544
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,152
There's no reason

545
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,445
A couples' trip

546
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:40,240
We went to Anmyeondo Island together,
remember?

547
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:43,326
Wow, don't be a smartass

548
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:46,579
And did you say "couples' trip"?

549
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,123
Huh?

550
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,809
Do you not know
what a "couples' trip" means?

551
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:54,671
I'll have to serve my wife
for 24 hours, nonstop

552
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:56,631
How can you call yourself my friend?

553
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:03,263
The PXG golf club set

554
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:05,014
You can have it

555
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,227
The whole thing?

556
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:11,855
The whole thing

557
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:16,776
Okay! Okay, okay!

558
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:17,861
Ha! Let's go!

559
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:18,737
- We can do this!
- We can do this!

560
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:20,530
We can do this!
Say it, say it!

561
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:22,115
We can do this! We can do this!

562
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:24,367
Let's go! Cheers!

563
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,786
Let's go, let's go!

564
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:38,256
Thank you so much

565
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:41,926
I was struggling to find a photographer
that I liked

566
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:44,179
I'll do my best

567
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,973
You are the best!

568
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,402
What?

569
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:01,904
Huh?

570
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:06,659
Water

571
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,294
Here you go

572
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,673
I can't drink it like this

573
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,091
Straw

574
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:29,349
Here you go

575
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:40,902
You can have this unit to yourself

576
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:45,073
We have two rooms,
so you can take one of them

577
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,368
We'll start shooting at 4 PM

578
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:51,496
Let's get some rest before the shoot

579
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,582
- Let's go
- Okay

580
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:11,307
Groom, give us a smile

581
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:14,978
One more

582
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,689
One more, but can you look at each other?

583
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:29,242
Groom, smile more

584
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:30,827
Okay

585
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:42,463
Decaf

586
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,759
- Are you sure?
- Decaf

587
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:53,933
Can you stand?

588
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,750
Hey, come and join us

589
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,550
That looks good

590
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:31,471
The doenjang-jjigae looks good

591
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,226
Is it almost done?

592
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:39,896
Jingu, come and sit

593
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:44,359
Here you go, here you go

594
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:48,821
Hongki and Mina, thank you
for bringing us on this trip

595
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:50,890
Let's drink up and party

596
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:54,953
First, Jane... Photographer...

597
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,122
Are you okay with soju?

598
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:00,333
Sure

599
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:06,506
Mina

600
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:07,966
Thank you

601
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:10,718
- Hongki
- I'm...

602
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,760
Jeez

603
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,681
Sujin?

604
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:16,975
Sujin

605
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:24,273
Oh, great job on the photos

606
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:27,068
They're not even retouched yet,
but I already love them

607
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:28,987
I'm glad

608
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:35,910
Mina, let her eat
You can eat with me

609
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:37,704
Oh, right

610
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:40,248
I'm sorry

611
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:42,250
No, it's fine

612
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,460
Babe, open wide

613
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,879
I can eat by myself, Mina

614
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,590
What? Come on, open wide

615
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,176
Open your mouth

616
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:27,003
We'll go here too

617
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:29,714
Are you happy?

618
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:32,008
Yes, I'm happy

619
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:36,596
Be careful, girl
Why do you like that old guy?

620
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:30,191
Jane

621
00:43:31,526 --> 00:43:32,610
Professor

622
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:35,863
I couldn't sleep

623
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:38,574
I heard you head out, so I came out too

624
00:43:58,469 --> 00:43:59,720
Do you remember...

625
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,641
planning a trip to Gangneung?

626
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:10,523
It was our first trip together,
so we booked the best hotel

627
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:14,152
and famous restaurants

628
00:44:16,863 --> 00:44:20,324
I regretted not taking the trip

629
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:25,621
Then...

630
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:28,332
why did you cancel it?

631
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:31,169
That's...

632
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,881
There was a reason

633
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:39,677
Of course

634
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:45,516
What about you?

635
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:49,103
Why did you break up with me?

636
00:44:52,565 --> 00:44:54,245
Why are you asking me that
all of a sudden?

637
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:57,612
I want to know

638
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:03,659
I see

639
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:12,960
That's it?

640
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:15,129
"I see," and that's it?

641
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:19,133
Why do you want to know all of a sudden?

642
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:26,390
No

643
00:45:28,017 --> 00:45:29,477
I've always wanted to know

644
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:32,688
ever since you disappeared

645
00:45:33,606 --> 00:45:35,107
ten years ago

646
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:39,028
"Did something happen to her?"

647
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:40,655
"Is she seeing someone else?"

648
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,407
I had all sorts of bizarre thoughts

649
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:46,911
Really?

650
00:45:48,621 --> 00:45:49,956
I'm surprised

651
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:54,335
I thought you'd thank me for disappearing

652
00:45:55,628 --> 00:45:56,712
What?

653
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:00,466
I'm sure you missed me for a while

654
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:05,054
and wondered how I was doing

655
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,976
Then you met me again by chance

656
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:12,770
And...

657
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:17,024
you became curious again

658
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:19,277
So...

659
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:24,323
Just pretend we never met again
and let it go!

660
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:32,039
I thought about you every single day

661
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:42,967
Ten years passed like that

662
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:48,973
When you suddenly disappeared,

663
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:52,310
my time stopped

664
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,607
I didn't date anyone else for years

665
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:28,721
It took me ten years

666
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:35,144
I thought I was finally okay,
so I decided to let you go

667
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:38,564
But I couldn't do it when I saw you again

668
00:47:41,192 --> 00:47:43,736
All the feelings from ten years ago
flooded back

669
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:54,254
- Okay, okay
- How dare you, I'm your professor

670
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:55,506
Professor!

671
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:59,009
Heart, heart, ah!

672
00:53:02,638 --> 00:53:03,722
Say sorry

673
00:53:03,764 --> 00:53:08,727
Professor, you said your time stopped
ten years ago

674
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:12,648
I hope nothing changes

675
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:16,360
I'm not going to date you

676
00:53:16,402 --> 00:53:18,737
I'm not going to ruin your marriage

677
00:53:19,488 --> 00:53:20,739
But...

678
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:24,201
A day for a year

679
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:26,995
Let's be friends for just ten days

680
00:53:30,082 --> 00:53:32,167
After ten years,

681
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:36,088
we'll be done for good

682
00:53:39,258 --> 00:53:41,343
Wait

683
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:43,095
No, wait!

684
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:44,596
Okay, okay

685
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:49,059
"Mina"

686
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:53,188
Here we go

687
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,774
Not!

688
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:35,314
What's with that look?

689
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:37,691
Do you like Jane that much?

690
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:39,359
Jeez

691
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:42,780
We're going to be friends
just for two weeks

692
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:44,823
What kind of friends?
Friends with benefits?

693
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:46,784
Jeez, you and your words...

694
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:53,916
Are you having fun playing "friends"
with her?

695
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:55,417
You're a man now

696
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,506
I haven't felt this way in a while

697
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:03,342
I'm surprised I can feel this way

698
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:06,762
You did as I said,
and things are working out

699
00:55:06,804 --> 00:55:10,307
Now, forget about her and get married

700
00:55:10,766 --> 00:55:13,644
I think I'm going to break up with Mina

701
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:14,770
What?

702
00:55:15,604 --> 00:55:17,564
Are you insane?

703
00:55:17,606 --> 00:55:20,442
You have to send wedding invitations
next week

704
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:23,695
Did Jane tell you to dump Mina
and choose her?

705
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:25,113
No

706
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:27,366
She doesn't want to date me

707
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:29,868
nor stop this marriage

708
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:33,497
Then why would you call it off?
A wedding is not a game

709
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:38,627
I thought I could forget about her
if I could meet her

710
00:55:39,211 --> 00:55:41,421
and do things we never got to do

711
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:42,881
But I can't

712
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:46,218
You're too emotional right now

713
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:50,889
Hongki, if you break up with Mina,
your company is done for

714
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:57,980
You haven't changed at all

715
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:00,107
in ten years

716
00:56:00,566 --> 00:56:02,609
Get a grip

717
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:20,460
Jane

718
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:23,839
Where are you?

719
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:26,485
Damn it

720
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:35,619
"Client request
He wants to do it with his first love"

721
00:57:36,745 --> 00:57:37,746
What?

722
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:39,498
Hey, you're up

723
00:57:39,957 --> 00:57:41,625
Yeah

724
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:43,043
Are you going?

725
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:45,212
I'll take you

726
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:47,339
No, go back to sleep

727
00:57:47,381 --> 00:57:48,674
I'll call you later

728
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:27,629
Hey, it's me

729
00:58:30,132 --> 00:58:32,259
Are you free this evening?

730
00:58:34,136 --> 00:58:36,680
"Client request
He wants to do it with his first love"

731
00:58:42,978 --> 00:58:44,521
I'm sure it's nothing

732
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,530
Did you do it or not?

733
00:58:59,286 --> 00:59:02,372
- I didn't do it
- You did it!

734
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:11,548
What?

735
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:14,593
Are you kidding me?

736
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:18,764
Do you think you can break up with me
that easily?

737
00:59:20,182 --> 00:59:21,975
Marriage isn't a joke

738
00:59:22,434 --> 00:59:24,811
What is the reason? Tell me!

739
00:59:24,853 --> 00:59:26,438
What is the reason?

740
00:59:27,481 --> 00:59:28,648
I'm sorry

741
00:59:56,343 --> 00:59:57,427
Jane

742
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:00,262
Want to drink something?

743
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:02,974
No, I have to go soon

744
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:05,060
Oh, okay

745
01:00:05,894 --> 01:00:07,312
You wanted to see me?

746
01:00:09,106 --> 01:00:14,402
Oh, I have something to tell you

747
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:18,031
I, actually...

748
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:21,201
Mina and I...

749
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:26,873
Where did you find this?

750
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:29,960
This is nothing

751
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:31,419
It wasn't anything serious...

752
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:33,922
I already checked

753
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:39,094
"Client request
He wants to do it with his first love"

754
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:40,595
Listen...

755
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:42,973
The private detective is pretty good

756
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:45,642
Jane, wait

757
01:00:45,684 --> 01:00:47,519
Wait, listen to me

758
01:00:52,232 --> 01:00:55,777
I only wanted to see how you were doing

759
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:57,362
That's why I hired him

760
01:00:57,737 --> 01:01:00,907
Then why did you pay the extra fee?

761
01:01:01,158 --> 01:01:02,409
What was it called?

762
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:04,369
The "N.E. package"?

763
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:07,414
I knew it

764
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:10,500
Bumping into each other like that
is impossible

765
01:01:10,876 --> 01:01:12,544
Jane, it's not like that

766
01:01:12,586 --> 01:01:15,088
Did you have such huge regrets
for not having to sleep with me?

767
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:18,216
So much that you obsessed about it
for ten years

768
01:01:18,258 --> 01:01:21,261
and hired a private detective
to stalk me illegally?

769
01:01:21,303 --> 01:01:22,387
Jane

770
01:01:23,722 --> 01:01:25,348
Try to calm down

771
01:01:25,849 --> 01:01:30,061
I swear I only wanted to know
how you were doing

772
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:33,315
Jingu suggested that I hire
a private detective, so...

773
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:34,691
Again?

774
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:38,486
Yu Jingu again?

775
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:44,326
You must've had a good laugh

776
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:46,244
while making a fool out of me

777
01:01:46,286 --> 01:01:49,080
Jane, it's not like that

778
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:50,207
Professor

779
01:01:51,917 --> 01:01:54,586
You haven't changed at all in ten years

780
01:01:54,628 --> 01:01:55,670
What?

781
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:57,255
You said you wanted to know

782
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:00,491
why I took a leave of absence
during college and disappeared

783
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:04,137
We'll go here too

784
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:11,811
Hello?

785
01:02:14,522 --> 01:02:16,024
Jingu?

786
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:19,527
Here, have this

787
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:22,155
No, I'm fine

788
01:02:22,197 --> 01:02:25,075
Why did you want to see me?

789
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:27,827
I thought a lot about whether I should

790
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:29,579
tell you this or not

791
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:32,415
The thing is...

792
01:02:35,919 --> 01:02:38,213
- What? Jane and Professor Kim...
- Be quiet!

793
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,298
It's shocking, isn't it?

794
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:43,802
- I'm sure it's a misunderstanding
- No

795
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:46,680
Kim Woosong saw them at the motel

796
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:48,098
Wow, that's crazy

797
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:50,892
- Right?
- I can't believe she'd do that for a grade

798
01:02:50,934 --> 01:02:53,395
Exactly, and she acts all innocent

799
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:55,689
Pretty girls act innocent

800
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:57,732
She is pretty, though

801
01:03:01,987 --> 01:03:04,114
Hongki told me it's troubling him

802
01:03:06,074 --> 01:03:08,785
and said he's worried about losing his job,

803
01:03:09,703 --> 01:03:12,706
especially because
it's not a permanent position

804
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:21,298
Don't tell him I told you this, Jane

805
01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:23,591
Okay

806
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:27,512
Don't worry too much

807
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:30,515
If you need someone to talk to,

808
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:32,809
call me anytime

809
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:34,894
Okay?

810
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:57,083
- Hello?
- Jane

811
01:03:57,125 --> 01:03:58,585
Professor, listen

812
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:00,211
The trip to Gangneung...

813
01:04:01,421 --> 01:04:03,965
Can we postpone it?

814
01:04:06,134 --> 01:04:07,177
Sure

815
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:09,763
Let's do that

816
01:04:18,313 --> 01:04:21,858
I was going to talk to you about it

817
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,377
once the situation was settled, but...

818
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:24,944
Stop I know everything

819
01:04:25,779 --> 01:04:27,197
You were in a difficult position

820
01:04:27,906 --> 01:04:31,326
If the school had found out you were dating
a student, you would've gotten in trouble

821
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:35,997
So I disappeared as you wanted

822
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:38,750
As I wanted?
That's...

823
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:40,126
Please!

824
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:43,963
Let's not see each other ever again

825
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:48,301
I'm sick of getting fooled

826
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:50,845
Oh

827
01:04:51,846 --> 01:04:55,058
And I wanted to say this to you
ten years ago

828
01:04:57,977 --> 01:05:00,146
Choose your friends carefully

829
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:54,117
She was so healthy
I can't believe she passed away so suddenly

830
01:05:54,576 --> 01:05:56,202
Exactly

831
01:05:56,411 --> 01:06:00,707
I hope Yunjae is okay

832
01:06:01,249 --> 01:06:04,878
He loved his mom dearly

833
01:06:21,853 --> 01:06:24,355
Pretty girl, how come you're here alone
tonight?

834
01:06:24,898 --> 01:06:26,733
That's easier, you know

835
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:29,068
You're right

836
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:38,703
No need to worry about getting hurt

837
01:06:49,088 --> 01:06:56,095
"Funeral Hall"

838
01:06:59,557 --> 01:07:03,770
I didn't think you could come
because of your class

839
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:06,147
Of course, I have to come

840
01:07:07,398 --> 01:07:09,108
I'm sorry I couldn't come earlier

841
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,111
It's okay

842
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:15,365
It's not like a party

843
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:18,201
Jane

844
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:25,792
You don't have to hold it back

845
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:29,420
When you're with me...

846
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:33,132
you can cry as much as you want

847
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:38,763
And you can lean on me anytime

848
01:07:56,573 --> 01:07:58,324
Professor

849
01:08:00,243 --> 01:08:02,412
What am I going to do?

850
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:07,333
She was my only family

851
01:08:08,585 --> 01:08:12,755
My poor mother

852
01:08:17,135 --> 01:08:18,845
Mom

853
01:08:20,305 --> 01:08:22,056
I'll be here by your side

854
01:08:25,018 --> 01:08:26,227
And...

855
01:08:28,563 --> 01:08:30,106
I'll be your family

856
01:08:57,884 --> 01:08:59,636
Shit

857
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:09,020
Who is it?

858
01:09:09,062 --> 01:09:10,396
It's me, open the door

859
01:09:16,027 --> 01:09:19,030
Do you know what time it is?

860
01:09:19,072 --> 01:09:22,533
- Why are you here?
- You look so unemployed

861
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:24,994
I came to check if you were alive

862
01:09:28,456 --> 01:09:29,832
Let's drink

863
01:09:31,084 --> 01:09:33,419
You know I never drink in the daytime

864
01:09:33,461 --> 01:09:35,922
I'm drinking for you

865
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:39,926
Drink and forget about it

866
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:43,513
My arm hurts!

867
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:58,444
A month is enough for you to
do nothing like this, don't you think?

868
01:09:58,486 --> 01:10:01,572
Go get interviews!
You can't stay unemployed forever

869
01:10:01,614 --> 01:10:04,742
Why did you tell me to find my first love?

870
01:10:06,411 --> 01:10:08,538
Don't get mad at me

871
01:10:08,579 --> 01:10:11,666
You told me you wanted to find
your first love

872
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:13,459
So I helped you

873
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:15,002
Jeez

874
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:18,548
You should've told me about
the conversation with Jane

875
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:21,718
I didn't know why she took
a leave of absence and disappeared

876
01:10:21,759 --> 01:10:24,637
That again?

877
01:10:25,263 --> 01:10:27,932
I talked to her for your sake

878
01:10:28,933 --> 01:10:30,977
- Jeez
- All right

879
01:10:31,519 --> 01:10:33,187
It's all my fault

880
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:36,983
I should've told her the truth

881
01:10:37,817 --> 01:10:39,652
That I was going to quit my job

882
01:10:53,291 --> 01:10:55,042
What were you doing?

883
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:57,795
- Were you sleeping again?
- No, I was thinking about something

884
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:01,257
Hold my hand

885
01:11:17,315 --> 01:11:18,399
Honey

886
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:26,050
"Interviewee ID"

887
01:12:36,435 --> 01:12:37,520
Professor Kim Hongki?

888
01:12:37,562 --> 01:12:38,729
Oh?

889
01:12:39,272 --> 01:12:42,441
Nari, right? Lim Nari

890
01:12:43,401 --> 01:12:46,445
It's Nahee Lim Nahee

891
01:12:46,988 --> 01:12:48,281
It's been a while

892
01:12:48,322 --> 01:12:49,448
Yes

893
01:12:50,241 --> 01:12:52,577
I heard you opened a coffee shop

894
01:12:52,618 --> 01:12:55,037
It's great

895
01:12:55,746 --> 01:12:57,498
Did Jane tell you?

896
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:58,332
What?

897
01:12:58,374 --> 01:12:59,834
I saw you two together

898
01:13:00,251 --> 01:13:02,003
a few days ago

899
01:13:03,504 --> 01:13:05,172
Honestly, I was surprised

900
01:13:05,923 --> 01:13:09,677
I thought you'd never see each other again
after that incident

901
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,179
I see

902
01:13:14,181 --> 01:13:17,393
She took a leave of absence
because she's too nice

903
01:13:19,854 --> 01:13:21,105
Exactly

904
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:24,901
I would've stopped her if I had known

905
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:28,696
You tried to abandon her

906
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:30,573
to keep your job

907
01:13:30,865 --> 01:13:32,408
What are you talking about?

908
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:34,744
Your friend told us

909
01:13:34,785 --> 01:13:36,829
You and the school were going to say

910
01:13:36,871 --> 01:13:39,457
that Jane liked you one-sidedly

911
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:40,917
Me?

912
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:51,469
Then were you going to quit your job?

913
01:13:53,137 --> 01:13:54,263
Yes

914
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:59,685
Why would Jingu tell her that?

915
01:13:59,727 --> 01:14:02,480
I heard that your friend, Jingu,

916
01:14:03,397 --> 01:14:06,317
held Jane's hand and came onto her

917
01:14:06,359 --> 01:14:07,568
What?

918
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:10,446
I am sorry for saying this,

919
01:14:10,488 --> 01:14:14,075
but I thought you and Jingu were both
horrible

920
01:14:17,745 --> 01:14:19,664
Choose your friends carefully

921
01:14:59,453 --> 01:15:01,247
You have something to say to me, don't you?

922
01:15:01,539 --> 01:15:03,833
Sir, listen to me

923
01:15:04,291 --> 01:15:08,045
The lady knew everything

924
01:15:08,087 --> 01:15:10,381
She threatened to report us
for illegal stalking

925
01:15:10,423 --> 01:15:15,720
if we didn't tell her what happened

926
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:18,764
We had no choice

927
01:15:18,806 --> 01:15:21,642
"Revisit, get a 20% discount," right?

928
01:15:21,934 --> 01:15:22,727
What?

929
01:15:22,768 --> 01:15:26,772
You did me wrong, so give me a 50% discount

930
01:15:26,814 --> 01:15:28,315
Okay, okay

931
01:15:30,067 --> 01:15:32,236
Have some

932
01:15:32,862 --> 01:15:34,405
My partner...

933
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:09,143
You're so sexy

934
01:18:09,185 --> 01:18:10,352
What?

935
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:28,829
Who do you like better?

936
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:31,207
Do I have to say it?

937
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:16,919
Who is it?

938
01:19:16,961 --> 01:19:18,337
Food delivery

939
01:19:18,379 --> 01:19:20,214
- What?
- Food delivery

940
01:19:20,923 --> 01:19:22,549
We didn't order food

941
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:26,303
Dongbae?

942
01:19:26,345 --> 01:19:27,680
- Open the door
- Dongbae

943
01:19:27,721 --> 01:19:29,306
- Hey
- What are you doing here?

944
01:19:29,348 --> 01:19:32,017
Why? Why do you think I'm here?

945
01:19:32,059 --> 01:19:33,519
Kim Hongki?

946
01:19:33,727 --> 01:19:35,896
What are you doing here?

947
01:19:35,938 --> 01:19:37,273
Hey, what are you doing?

948
01:19:37,314 --> 01:19:39,650
Why are you coming in? Hey!

949
01:19:39,692 --> 01:19:41,944
Nothing is going on
What are you doing?

950
01:19:46,824 --> 01:19:48,701
Oh, Hongki

951
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:51,370
Unbelievable

952
01:19:51,537 --> 01:19:54,081
Listen to me
You've got it all wrong

953
01:19:54,373 --> 01:19:56,166
Jingu and I...

954
01:19:58,961 --> 01:20:01,046
We're just...

955
01:20:03,257 --> 01:20:04,466
Wait

956
01:20:05,426 --> 01:20:07,261
It doesn't matter anymore

957
01:20:07,845 --> 01:20:09,221
We broke up

958
01:20:09,555 --> 01:20:12,099
Yes, we've broken up

959
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:14,518
But we weren't back then

960
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:15,811
Back then?

961
01:20:17,021 --> 01:20:19,106
I knew I recognized the dress

962
01:20:20,274 --> 01:20:21,525
What dress?

963
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:29,116
Oh, that's...

964
01:20:29,742 --> 01:20:31,994
You couldn't do it, so...

965
01:20:32,036 --> 01:20:34,830
I got lonely, and I started talking
to Jingu, and...

966
01:20:36,623 --> 01:20:38,334
How long has this been going on?

967
01:20:40,461 --> 01:20:42,087
Does Sujin know?

968
01:20:43,422 --> 01:20:46,216
Hongki, there's nothing going on between us

969
01:20:46,258 --> 01:20:48,344
We hooked up just a few times

970
01:20:48,635 --> 01:20:50,512
What?

971
01:20:50,554 --> 01:20:53,366
You said you were going to leave your wife
because I broke up with Hongki

972
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:55,017
When did I fucking say that?

973
01:20:55,267 --> 01:20:58,604
Hongki, you and Mina are broken up anyway

974
01:20:58,645 --> 01:21:00,856
What are friends for?

975
01:21:01,106 --> 01:21:02,524
Don't tell Sujin

976
01:21:02,941 --> 01:21:06,362
I'm going to ask you a question

977
01:21:07,321 --> 01:21:08,465
I'll hear your answer and decide

978
01:21:08,489 --> 01:21:10,282
What is it? Tell me

979
01:21:10,824 --> 01:21:12,409
Why did you do that ten years ago?

980
01:21:12,451 --> 01:21:13,535
Ten years ago?

981
01:21:13,952 --> 01:21:16,080
Why did you lie to Jane?

982
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:19,083
When?

983
01:21:19,124 --> 01:21:21,043
Don't act like you don't know

984
01:21:23,128 --> 01:21:25,964
Should I call Sujin right now?

985
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:31,095
Hey, I did it for your sake!

986
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:32,763
You're making me upset

987
01:21:32,805 --> 01:21:34,681
If you're such a good friend,

988
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:38,102
why did you touch my girlfriend's hand
and come onto her?

989
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:40,020
How does that make sense?

990
01:21:40,062 --> 01:21:43,023
It's a misunderstanding
Why would I do that to you?

991
01:21:43,273 --> 01:21:44,775
I thought about it

992
01:21:46,276 --> 01:21:49,530
I thought about who you were
and found the answer

993
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:52,408
You wanted to...

994
01:21:53,117 --> 01:21:54,618
steal my girlfriend, didn't you?

995
01:21:58,497 --> 01:21:59,665
Never mind

996
01:21:59,998 --> 01:22:01,917
I don't need to hear your answer

997
01:22:03,085 --> 01:22:06,046
I was an idiot for keeping you as a friend

998
01:22:08,674 --> 01:22:09,800
Hongki

999
01:22:11,468 --> 01:22:12,428
Please don't tell Sujin

1000
01:22:12,469 --> 01:22:14,638
Talk to her yourself

1001
01:22:17,224 --> 01:22:18,976
She just came up in the elevator

1002
01:22:19,017 --> 01:22:20,185
What?

1003
01:22:20,227 --> 01:22:22,146
Why you...

1004
01:22:22,187 --> 01:22:24,857
Fine, fuck!
I tried so many times,

1005
01:22:24,898 --> 01:22:28,152
but it didn't work with her,
so I got fucking mad

1006
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:30,696
You should thank me for being your friend,
you fucking loser

1007
01:22:33,157 --> 01:22:36,243
- You're the fucking loser
- Honey

1008
01:22:36,285 --> 01:22:38,996
- Where the fuck are you going?
- Honey, babe, wait!

1009
01:22:39,037 --> 01:22:40,247
Honey, honey, wait!

1010
01:22:40,289 --> 01:22:41,248
It hurts!

1011
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:42,207
- You two are so dead!
- It really hurts

1012
01:22:42,249 --> 01:22:44,209
My dad is going to kill you both!

1013
01:22:44,251 --> 01:22:45,836
Film it!

1014
01:22:45,878 --> 01:22:48,130
Dongbae, Dongbae!
Stop filming!

1015
01:22:48,172 --> 01:22:50,591
Dongbae, stop filming!
Dongbae!

1016
01:22:51,175 --> 01:22:52,259
How could you!

1017
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:56,388
Can you hold his arm?

1018
01:22:58,724 --> 01:23:00,434
That's great

1019
01:23:00,851 --> 01:23:02,019
That's beautiful

1020
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:04,396
Look at each other and smile

1021
01:23:09,776 --> 01:23:12,946
It looks beautiful
when you stroke her hair back

1022
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:14,531
Let's try that

1023
01:23:36,970 --> 01:23:38,639
Jane, Jane!

1024
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:41,475
I just need one minute

1025
01:23:42,809 --> 01:23:44,686
I came to clear the air and apologize

1026
01:23:53,278 --> 01:23:58,617
I was going to quit my job ten years ago

1027
01:23:59,159 --> 01:24:00,911
I should've talked to you about it

1028
01:24:02,079 --> 01:24:03,956
I thought I was grown-up back then

1029
01:24:07,376 --> 01:24:09,044
Whatever happened...

1030
01:24:10,337 --> 01:24:11,713
it's too late

1031
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:13,757
I broke off my engagement

1032
01:24:14,841 --> 01:24:16,468
Professor

1033
01:24:16,510 --> 01:24:17,886
It's not your fault

1034
01:24:18,512 --> 01:24:19,721
I just...

1035
01:24:20,764 --> 01:24:23,225
I want to be honest with my feelings

1036
01:24:25,686 --> 01:24:29,356
The person I like, the person I love

1037
01:24:30,524 --> 01:24:34,528
It's always been you for the last ten years

1038
01:24:52,963 --> 01:24:56,341
Jane, can't we start over?

1039
01:25:26,830 --> 01:25:27,956
Jane

1040
01:25:49,227 --> 01:25:56,234
"Goodbye... my first love..."
