00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm sorry.

00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry.

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry.

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm sorry.

00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,780
Please like it if you enjoy the story of Shu Jun.

60
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,740
The Teaching drip soup is so refreshing and delicious.

61
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,540
panelists

62
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,740
Please watch why Shu Jun brother

63
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,300
Children aren't afraid to eat dinner.

64
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:16,140
Mom character

65
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,240
How come you

66
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Miss Song'er is so hard-working.

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
How can I not come?

68
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I want to see Li Shiliu.

69
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Boss has been busy all day.

70
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
She left this to me.

71
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Miss Ting Ting, if you have any request, just ask.

72
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm sure it's also...

73
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You can't call me that.

74
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And,

75
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
stay away from me.

76
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I told you the truth.

77
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Today, only Li Shiliu can take away what I have.

78
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You're being unreasonable.

79
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's the thing of Cang Jiang Yue.

80
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Is it?

81
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The thing of Cang Jiang Yue?

82
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Either,

83
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
let me see Li Shiliu today,

84
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
or,

85
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
the lord of Jingzhao Mansion,

86
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
will want to know

87
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
how did you get the sword in his hand?

88
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I took a bath this morning.

89
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Who knew I would encounter such a dirty thing?

90
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's so disgusting.

91
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I can't bear to do it.

92
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
A lady of the official family

93
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
dares to play dirty with the god of night.

94
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'll go get the sword now,

95
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
if something happens, I'll handle it alone.

96
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Can you calm down?

97
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You think the Song family is a bandit and you can break in?

98
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Let me tell you,

99
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
dealing with officials is still the rule.

100
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
What should I do now?

101
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
If I can't get the sword back,

102
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I can't hide it from boss.

103
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You can't hide it from me.

104
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
But,

105
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I can't hide it from you.

106
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm not afraid of you.

107
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm not afraid of you.

108
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm not afraid of you.

109
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm not afraid of you.

110
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm not afraid of you.

111
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm not afraid of you.

112
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm not afraid of you.

113
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Xiong Yun,

114
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
how can you kill him?

115
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
We can't stop you.

116
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I have already killed him.

117
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
C ===

118
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,700
I will just

119
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
castrate him again.

120
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,300
I'll stab him.

121
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Gabbo!

122
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
rying mix

123
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,760
vegetarian

124
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Thanks a lot

125
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Li Niu.

126
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,340
You don't have to thank me.

127
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Why are you so rude?

128
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Just call me Tingting.

129
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Miss Tingting must...

130
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Don't call me that. Stay away.

131
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
What do you want to do to return the stolen thing to me?

132
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
How can you say that? How bad of you.

133
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I gave you 73 paintings in total.

134
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I only gave you a small gift.

135
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
If you can't bear to leave, why don't you exchange it for something else?

136
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's impossible to marry someone.

137
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
That's why I won't do this kind of business.

138
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You're joking. Why is it so serious?

139
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What I want is only three days.

140
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Three days?

141
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You're mistaken.

142
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You're mistaken. You were right.

143
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I've never experienced anything like this.

144
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You don't know the rules of the world.

145
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Our experiences are different.

146
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
This relationship might not be suitable.

147
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
But if we don't give each other a chance,

148
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
it's impossible to have a result.

149
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Miss, how do you want to try?

150
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
We'll spend three days together to learn about each other's lives.

151
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
If after three days, you still can't fall in love with me,

152
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'll return the knife.

153
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
If you do,

154
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
go and propose to my parents.

155
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Propose?

156
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You're so old.

157
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I've never seen anything like this before.

158
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You're just asking for it.

159
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Are you afraid?

160
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Before making you think about helping me live,

161
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,000
you'd rather take my daughter back and dine with me.

162
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Where did you come from?

163
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I don't care about them.

164
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You should think of me from a distance.

165
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
The real reason why I come here is

166
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
to help you find your parents.

167
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You should do what you can to help 저는.

168
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Then I'll find my parents.

169
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'll answer you.

170
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Still those two words.

171
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Very good.

172
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Nan Heng clearly has the idea of sister-in-law and father-in-law.

173
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Can't get any of the famous scenes in the script?

174
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
This palace is full of people.

175
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You have to be careful everywhere.

176
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You don't harm others, but you have to prevent others from hurting you.

177
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
He may not want to kill me,

178
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
but I will definitely die because of him.

179
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
This is the rule, it is destined.

180
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Then break the rule and destroy the destiny.

181
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
No, I can live to the second season of the countdown.

182
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But Song Yiting is not as good as you.

183
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I have to change my destiny.

184
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Nan Heng, I'm sorry.

185
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Your Highness.

186
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Your Highness, how can you do such a rough job yourself?

187
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Let me do it.

188
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Don't hurt yourself anymore.

189
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Mom, I'm sorry.

190
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm sorry.

191
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm sorry.

192
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Don't hurt yourself anymore.

193
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Meng, I heard that after Mrs. Zhong left,

194
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
you talked a lot with Heng.

195
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Did you change your mind?

196
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Your Highness, I was not sensible before.

197
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I didn't cherish such a good person like the Seventh Prince.

198
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Thanks to you, I didn't abandon him and give up.

199
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I have the chance to marry him.

200
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
But...

201
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
What's wrong?

202
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Did Heng bully you?

203
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Did he bully you?

204
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
No, he didn't bully me.

205
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Your Highness, after seeing those ladies,

206
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
he started to be rude to me.

207
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I gave him those snacks as you ordered.

208
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But after he got them, he left without saying a word.

209
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm worried that he has fallen in love with some lady.

210
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
He wants to marry Consort Li.

211
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
That's impossible.

212
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Those ladies were all scared of Heng.

213
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Only Meng can have such a bold lady in the capital.

214
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

215
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I tried to persuade myself.

216
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
But...

217
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
But I don't want to be with the Seventh Prince.

218
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I can't sleep at night.

219
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm afraid that I'll be late for the wedding.

220
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Meng.

221
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Meng.

222
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Meng.

223
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Meng.

224
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Call the doctor.

225
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Your Highness.

226
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm so sick.

227
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I can't even die.

228
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Your Highness, I beg you.

229
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Let me go to the Imperial Household Department to accompany the Seventh Prince.

230
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Okay?

231
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Good boy.

232
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I promise you.

233
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I promise you everything.

234
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

235
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Miss, you're acting so badly.

236
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Why don't you learn from me?

237
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
How can you say that?

238
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You put a chili sauce in it.

239
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I don't know if you can see it.

240
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Never mind.

241
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You two listen carefully.

242
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
From now on, I'll take care of Nang Heng.

243
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'll take care of him.

244
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You two take care of Song Yating.

245
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm so worried about you.

246
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
In order to go out to see Heng,

247
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
you even used this trick.

248
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Miss Song worked so hard.

249
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It shows that she has a deep love for you.

250
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Deep love?

251
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Flowers bloom and fruit are born.

252
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Children and grandchildren are born.

253
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's a long time.

254
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Your Highness.

255
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So you told me that

256
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
you wanted to come and serve me personally.

257
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Your Highness is so kind.

258
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm going to be your wife.

259
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I need to learn how to serve you.

260
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm so worried.

261
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
From now on,

262
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'll take care of you.

263
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Children and grandchildren are born.

264
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Flowers bloom and fruit are born.

265
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Children and grandchildren are born.

266
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It's a long time.

267
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I know.

268
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You may leave now.

269
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Did I do something wrong?

270
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Or you don't want to see me?

271
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm sorry.

272
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Father, you're a good person.

273
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm sorry.

274
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'll leave now.

275
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I won't disturb you anymore.

276
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm leaving.

277
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm sorry.

278
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You said you cared about me.

279
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You said you'd protect me for the rest of my life.

280
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm so heartbroken.

281
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I feel sorry for my heart.

282
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm a woman now.

283
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Come back.

284
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What's wrong, Your Highness?

285
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'm just acting.

286
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Don't do it again.

287
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
But since you told me,

288
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
you should stay here.

289
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's not peaceful outside.

290
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Don't cause any trouble for me.

291
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Do you hear me?

292
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I know.

293
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You're the best soul-guarding man in the world.

294
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'll go and settle down.

295
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm sorry.

296
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Your Highness, what are you looking at?

297
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
What's so good about this hand?

298
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
What?

299
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Gao Xiang brought a staff to discuss business with you.

300
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
They're waiting in the hall.

301
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I see.

302
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'll go and talk to them.

303
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I'll go and talk to them.

304
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'll go and talk to them.

305
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'll go and talk to them.

306
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I see.

307
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Your Highness, Chu Gui Hong just came to steal.

308
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Miss Song asked Xiao Zhu to come.

309
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
What's wrong with her?

310
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
She said she came to take care of me.

311
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
But she didn't say anything.

312
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Keep an eye on her.

313
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
If she needs anything, make sure to arrange it.

314
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Your Highness, you're being a bit contradictory.

315
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Should I be on her side or take care of her?

316
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You've been with me for so long.

317
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Don't you understand?

318
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Your Highness, I'm sorry.

319
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Please give me another chance.

320
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Your Highness.

321
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Miss Song.

322
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Your Highness, how long has it been?

323
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It's been half a week.

324
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I've been waiting for you.

325
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I'm sorry.

326
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I'm sorry.

327
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm sorry.

328
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I'm sorry.

329
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm sorry.

330
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm sorry.

331
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I'm sorry.

332
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm sorry.

333
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I'm sorry.

334
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I'm sorry.

335
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Miss Song, this is the main place.

336
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Why are you here?

337
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I just wanted to take a walk.

338
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Your Highness, you've made me familiar with the environment.

339
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm going to another place now.

340
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Your Highness, Prime Minister.

341
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
The marriage is a long story.

342
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Although it's an old tradition,

343
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
it's still a bit suspicious.

344
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
If you want to

345
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
get married with a good reputation,

346
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
the only way is

347
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
to become a crown prince.

348
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
But among the six departments,

349
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
only the Ministry of Revenue

350
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
and the Ministry of Commerce are allowed to marry Song Yi Meng.

351
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
If we make a decision now,

352
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'm afraid that

353
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Minister Song will think that

354
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm not good enough to marry Song Yi Meng.

355
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Isn't the reason why

356
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Your Highness wants to marry the eldest daughter of Minister Song?

357
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Yes.

358
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Otherwise, why did Your Highness

359
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
want to marry Song's daughter?

360
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Yes.

361
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
That's right.

362
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Enough.

363
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I have my own opinion.

364
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Leave.

365
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Yes.

366
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Uncle,

367
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
do you have anything else to say?

368
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Your Highness's purpose of

369
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
forcing Song Yi Meng to marry is two things.

370
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
First, to disband the alliance between the Song family and the Chu family.

371
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Second, to gain Song Yu De's support.

372
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Now Song Yi Meng and Chu Gui Hong

373
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
have already got married and settled.

374
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Song Chu's alliance is clearly in the past.

375
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
But Song Yi Meng's behavior

376
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
has always been good and I'm afraid that he has changed too much.

377
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I think

378
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Your Highness should change your mind

379
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
and ask for a new daughter.

380
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Didn't I tell you that

381
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
the court is still in the court.

382
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Marriage is just an external affair.

383
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Uncle, you don't have to worry about that.

384
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Is Your Highness

385
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
thinking about Song Yi Meng?

386
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I'll think about it myself.

387
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
If I don't get rid of this daughter,

388
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I'll be in big trouble.

389
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Come.

390
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Princess.

391
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Yes.

392
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Yes, Princess.

393
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
You must be tired.

394
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Here, eat something.

395
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I prepared this for you.

396
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Thank you.

397
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Your Highness,

398
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
where have you been recently?

399
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Can you tell me?

400
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
This... Princess,

401
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Your Highness's whereabouts are a secret.

402
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
If we tell you,

403
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
you'll be in trouble.

404
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
What you said is not about your identity.

405
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
He is the Highness,

406
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I'm the Princess.

407
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Isn't it Princess Zhun?

408
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Why are you so stubborn?

409
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Isn't Princess Zhun also Princess Zhun?

410
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Telling others is called telling others.

411
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Telling yourself is called sharing your daily life.

412
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Forget it.

413
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I won't make things difficult for you.

414
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
You only need to tell me now.

415
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Your Highness,

416
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
have you been to Song's house frequently?

417
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Especially, have you been to...

418
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Song Yi Meng, are you here to take care of me

419
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
or to take care of the horse?

420
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Why are you running in the horse shed?

421
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Your Highness,

422
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
why are you here?

423
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Calm down.

424
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I just want to know

425
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
everything about you.

426
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Oh, so you've been

427
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
investigating into my study.

428
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I can't just go to your bedroom.

429
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You should be serious.

430
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Go to your room and wait for me.

431
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I'll settle the score with you later.

432
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I'll listen to you.

433
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I'll take my leave.

434
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Your Highness, she's making a fool of herself.

435
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Do you want me to take her to the test?

436
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
You're going to the test?

437
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
What do you want to test?

438
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
What can you test?

439
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
No.

440
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
You're just too bored to do anything.

441
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Go to the horse shed.

442
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Test?

443
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
What are you looking at? Feed the horse.

444
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
The horse has already fed the horse.

445
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I'm afraid that the human race has not fed the horse.

446
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I'm so confused.

447
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It's so hard to hide.

448
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Luckily, I react quickly.

449
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I have good eyes.

450
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I'm sorry.

451
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Oh my god.

452
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I really have to find it.

453
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,640
No.

454
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,600
The hair of both men and women in ancient times is very long.

455
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,400
This doesn't count.

456
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
What are you looking for?

457
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I just want to see

458
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,600
if you usually sleep in a soft bed or a hard bed.

459
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,400
If the bed is too soft,

460
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,400
I want to change it to a harder one for you.

461
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,400
Otherwise, it's not good for your waist.

462
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,400
What do you want?

463
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,400
Just tell me directly.

464
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,400
There is no need to use this method.

465
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,400
And no one is interested in you.

466
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,400
And no one likes the feeling of being suspected.

467
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,400
Especially the bones.

468
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,400
Especially the back.

469
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,000
Lu Jia.

470
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,400
Lu Jia doesn't have it.

471
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,120
Lu Jia.

472
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,000
I won.

473
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,400
I won.

474
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,800
Come on.

475
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,800
Give me the money.

476
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,400
Again.

477
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,840
Is this how you live your life?

478
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,840
Yes.

479
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,840
People in the world are always looking for something fast and easy.

480
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,440
I'm good at all kinds of things.

481
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,440
What's wrong?

482
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,440
You don't like it?

483
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,440
If you don't like it, go outside and wait.

484
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,840
You said you'd let me choose the date for three days.

485
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,840
You can't stand it for less than a day.

486
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,840
We're going to kill them.

487
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,840
Master Li, you're so boring.

488
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,840
Let's bet big.

489
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,840
What do you want to bet?

490
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,840
This is the Biren's family treasure knife, the mountain knife.

491
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,840
It's worth a thousand gold.

492
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:17,840
Plus the house, the land, and the house.

493
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,840
And the Biren's hands.

494
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,840
Let's win with one hand.

495
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,840
This is a good knife.

496
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:34,840
But I'm afraid I can't win.

497
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:38,840
I don't like the gold and the treasure.

498
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,840
This woman looks good.

499
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,840
I think she's elegant and elegant.

500
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,840
Worth a bet.

501
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,840
Okay.

502
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,280
You bet me?

503
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,280
Yes.

504
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,280
You have to follow me.

505
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,280
You're my man.

506
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,280
So what if I bet you?

507
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,280
If you don't like it, you can go now.

508
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,280
Okay.

509
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,280
Since you're on the table, there's no reason to bet.

510
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,280
You bet me.

511
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,280
But you have to bet on me.

512
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,720
Okay.

513
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,720
I'll bet on you.

514
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,720
Okay.

515
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,720
You bet me.

516
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,720
Okay.

517
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,720
Okay.

518
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,720
Okay.

519
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,720
Okay.

520
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,720
Okay.

521
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,720
Okay.

522
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,720
Okay.

523
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,720
Okay.

524
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,720
Okay.

525
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,720
Okay.

526
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,720
This.

527
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,720
Give me that knife.

528
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,520
This is also a piece of the thing.

529
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,600
All solders should send someone to my place to be our guest.

530
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,600
The hand he used to hold

531
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,120
It'll be treated by a salaried wage

532
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:27,120
Miss Sang Er, I didn't know you were so good at hiding.

533
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,120
It's just a trick. Just use your hands.

534
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:35,120
And also, take off your hat.

535
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,120
Take off your hat.

536
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,120
If you want to find someone to return to you next time,

537
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,120
you should at least change your face.

538
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,120
I've seen this person many times.

539
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,120
What do you think?

540
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,120
I...

541
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,120
Hero Li, I want to go shopping tomorrow.

542
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:07,120
Please come with me.

543
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,120
Second Master.

544
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,120
This Song Yiting is not easy to handle.

545
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,120
So high.

546
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,120
I can't get it back.

547
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,120
My knife is gone.

548
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,120
And my house.

549
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,120
My land.

550
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,120
And mine.

551
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,120
The beard.

552
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,120
Ah!

553
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,120
From what Nan Heng did,

554
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:58,120
it's obvious that there must be a ghost in the box.

555
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,120
Love letter?

556
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,120
Letter?

557
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,120
Letter?

558
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,120
Could it be...

559
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,120
the secret medicine that Yating prepared?

560
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,120
Let me go!

561
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,120
Let me go!

562
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,120
Let me go!

563
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,120
Since you're not kind, don't blame me for being ungrateful.

564
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,120
Nan, you forced me to do this.

565
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,120
Come on.

566
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:01,120
Boss, I heard that this is the biggest medical clinic in the capital.

567
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,120
If I want some of that...

568
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,120
that kind of special medicine,

569
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,120
I don't know if I can have it.

570
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,120
I know about the post-mortem.

571
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,120
Do you want the medicine that can help you overcome difficulties

572
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,120
or the medicine that can help you get rid of your bad luck?

573
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,120
Boss, what are you thinking?

574
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,120
None of them.

575
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:26,120
I want the medicine that can help you get rid of your bad luck.

576
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:29,120
I'd rather be a monk than a nun.

577
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:37,120
Boss, Miss Song Er is coming out.

578
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:42,120
Before she wears the robe, please repeat what you did today.

579
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,120
Okay.

580
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:51,120
Boss Ji's arrogance, Nan Rui's ignorance, Chu Gui Hong's negligence in the body...

581
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,120
are all the crimes of men.

582
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:59,120
I will make sure that Song Er will not regret it.

583
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,120
Song Er is relieved.

584
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,120
There is no regret.

585
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,120
The game is over.

586
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,120
It's so expensive.

587
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,120
It's so hard to stand.

588
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,120
What's the result?

589
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,120
Bao Gu, what are you holding?

590
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,120
Right.

591
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,620
Do you remember that action scene?

592
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,500
On the map wait.

593
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:52,360
You type that one to

594
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,180
goes via Bluetooth.

595
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:58,180
Look, do you think you're going to see your sister in this dress?

596
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:02,180
I don't know, I thought you were going to seduce someone.

597
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:10,180
You're so big and luxurious.

598
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,180
In my opinion,

599
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:18,180
it's just a common thing to like to make a fuss in front of men.

600
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,180
I'm sorry.

601
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,180
What else can you buy?

602
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,180
You have a meeting later.

603
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,180
A man like me who is successful in his career

604
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:45,180
has no time to waste on these father's orders.

605
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,180
Enough!

606
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:51,180
If your purpose is to make me hate you,

607
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:54,180
then congratulations, you did it.

608
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:58,180
You don't have to come with me anymore.

609
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:21,180
Except for the one on Miss Song,

610
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:23,180
this one is for you.

611
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,180
For me?

612
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:33,180
Men's and women's clothes are really good together.

613
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:36,180
Hero Li is a man of high status.

614
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:39,180
This sky blue color suits him best.

615
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,180
He often dances.

616
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,180
His clothes are not only good-looking,

617
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:46,180
but also strong and light.

618
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:49,180
A close-knit place like the sleeve pocket

619
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,180
can never be careless.

620
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,180
Boss,

621
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:54,180
I want you to help me with something.

622
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,180
Say it.

623
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:59,180
Hero Li has a hidden secret.

624
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,180
He doesn't show his true face to others.

625
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,180
But I think

626
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,180
he is the most beautiful person in this world.

627
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:08,180
Only the most vivid mask

628
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,180
can match him.

629
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,180
This is the drawing I designed.

630
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,180
Here you are.

631
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,180
I'm a professional.

632
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,180
Here you are.

633
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,180
I've been running this store for so many years.

634
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,180
Miss Song is an old lady.

635
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:26,180
I've never seen her so caring.

636
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,180
Such a good thing,

637
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,180
how dare you do this?

638
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,180
I don't want your money.

639
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,180
I will be back.

640
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,180
This is...

641
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,180
tonic.

642
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,180
Miss Song,

643
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,180
isn't this bowl too big?

644
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,380
It's from your body.

645
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,940
How can you make up for it

646
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,460
if you don't give me some medicine?

647
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,260
Your Highness,

648
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,860
drink it while it's hot.

649
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,460
It's not good for your health

650
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,300
if it's cold.

651
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,420
Drink it.

652
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,420
What are the effects of this medicine?

653
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,900
I...

654
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,780
I'm dry and tired.

655
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,100
I don't want to take medicine.

656
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,820
Anyway, it's good for your health.

657
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,620
Drink it.

658
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,700
Do you want to make up for it?

659
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,220
You're still young.

660
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,220
You're not old enough.

661
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,700
I don't think it's a good idea.

662
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,100
You want to poison me, right?

663
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:58,940
I...

664
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:01,660
Your Highness,

665
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,620
it's all for my future happiness.

666
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,940
I can't do anything to you.

667
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,220
The five senses are connected.

668
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,020
It's the best way to do it.

669
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,460
Your Highness, let me taste it for you.

670
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:18,900
No.

671
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,100
You can't drink it.

672
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,020
It's such a expensive medicine.

673
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,460
How can I give it to you?

674
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,620
You're still young.

675
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:28,100
You're the only one who can drink it.

676
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:30,900
Your Highness,

677
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:34,140
let me drink it for you.

678
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,260
Okay.

679
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:44,540
Here.

680
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,180
Open your mouth.

681
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,580
It's too far.

682
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,380
I can't reach it.

683
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,580
Come on.

684
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:53,780
Open your mouth.

685
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,700
Still can't reach it.

686
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,060
Closer.

687
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,860
Your Highness, please take the medicine.

688
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,020
Wait.

689
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:10,900
Sit here.

690
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:12,700
Sit...

691
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,340
Sit.

692
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,140
Is it enough?

693
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:23,740
It depends on how much you want me to drink it.

694
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,260
Okay.

695
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,580
I'll sit here

696
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,140
and take the medicine for you.

697
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,700
Let's drink it together.

698
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:47,900
Please help me.

699
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:51,620
Cheers!

700
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,100
Come on.

701
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,660
You should as drunk as now.

702
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,340
It's still not enough.

703
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,220
Your Highness,

704
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,520
are you afraid

705
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,060
if this spoon

706
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:11,700
Okay.

707
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,580
I'll let you see

708
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,460
if I dare or not.

709
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,900
Come on, open your mouth.

710
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,820
Are you happy?

711
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,420
Are you happy?

712
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,940
Come on, big man.

713
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,460
Take the medicine.

714
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:28,940
Come on.

715
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,180
Sorry, my foot slipped.

716
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:38,780
You did it on purpose, right?

717
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,900
Hey, what are you going to do?

718
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,380
If you try to play

719
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,660
ever again,

720
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:48,980
remember to

721
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,060
dress smoothly.

722
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:52,500
I…

723
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,460
Master of Tai Chi

724
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,420
Take your time.

725
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,120
teilweise, miss Song mark

726
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:25,120
But I threw his heart on the ground and fell down at will.

727
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:31,120
The most evil person in the world is just like me.

728
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:35,120
Don't think too much, Master.

729
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:39,120
You don't want to do this just to deal with the task, right?

730
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,120
Tomorrow is the last day.

731
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:44,120
Take the knife back.

732
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,120
No one will see you again.

733
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,120
Yes, Master.

734
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,120
You're not to blame for this.

735
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,120
You rejected him.

736
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,120
He still has a long way to go.

737
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:57,120
After all, it's just a relationship caused by one-sided support.

738
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,120
How deep can it be?

739
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,120
I'm sure after a while, this little lady will forget everything.

740
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,120
Yes, yes.

741
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,120
He's not the kind of person I am.

742
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:10,120
Master, if you change the time and place with Miss Song,

743
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:13,120
would you fall in love with a girl like her?

744
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:22,120
What she likes is a fake Li Shiliu.

745
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:27,120
And I'm the kind of person who can't get married in my life.

746
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:30,120
Some people are destined to be impossible to start.

747
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:34,120
