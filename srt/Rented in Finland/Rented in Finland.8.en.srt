1
00:00:05,179 --> 00:00:06,878
(Lee Je Hoon)

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,579
(Lee Dong Hwi)

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,448
(Kwak Dong Yeon)

4
00:00:10,449 --> 00:00:12,080
(Cha Eun Woo)

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,820
(Rented in Finland)

6
00:00:14,949 --> 00:00:19,059
(From a place isolated in nature where all they had was one another)

7
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:21,229
(Did they move to Zootopia, )

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:26,030
(where there are all kinds of cute animals?)

9
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:28,669
(It's a puppy.)

10
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:30,640
(Broccoli?)

11
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,710
(It's not even a border collie. Hi, I'm Ransu.)

12
00:00:33,939 --> 00:00:35,038
Chicken?

13
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:38,639
(There are chickens in the front yard.)

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,549
(There are sheep in the backyard.)

15
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:46,990
(It's a strange, yet interesting and crowded house.)

16
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:51,090
(Their first dinner at their Zootopia home)

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,130
(Chef Kwak cooks omelet rice and green onion kimchi.)

18
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:58,060
(He easily cooks it without a recipe.)

19
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,699
(Everything is going well.)

20
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,600
(Nervous)

21
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:04,569
(Je Hoon, the eldest, tries making the main dish!)

22
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:07,739
How do I have to chop the onions?

23
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,609
- No way. - Okay.

24
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:12,339
Je Hoon, you shouldn't cut it like that.

25
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,150
(Glancing at Dong Hwi)

26
00:01:15,349 --> 00:01:16,749
- Je Hoon. - Yes?

27
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,149
- Be careful. - Okay.

28
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,849
(He is determined to cook it despite his clumsy knife skills.)

29
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:24,489
I'm so scared for your thumb.

30
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,489
(The younger roommates watch him closely.)

31
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,129
(There is tight security.)

32
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:34,429
He's a fool that knows nothing other than acting.

33
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,269
- That's all he knows about. - Yes, that's right.

34
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,798
I really hope it's tasty, Je Hoon.

35
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,069
- Don't worry. - Okay.

36
00:01:40,269 --> 00:01:42,438
Let's trust him.

37
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:43,439
(They look concerned.)

38
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:45,309
- All right. - That's enough.

39
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,379
I'll cook it with my version of the recipe.

40
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,579
Okay.

41
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:54,290
(He takes something out.)

42
00:01:55,989 --> 00:01:57,919
(Butter?)

43
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,590
- What? - Je Hoon.

44
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,128
Butter?

45
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:03,530
(Is butter an ingredient for stir-fried sausages and vegetables?)

46
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:06,760
Honestly, when you cook stir-fried sausages and vegetables...

47
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:09,468
This is my version of it.

48
00:02:09,469 --> 00:02:11,198
- Do as you wish. - Okay.

49
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,269
We trust you.

50
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,840
(He heard that butter gave food a savory taste.)

51
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:16,109
I'm sure there is a reason he's using it.

52
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,909
Je Hoon must have his reasons.

53
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:24,050
(He focuses on the butter, the game changer.)

54
00:02:26,419 --> 00:02:29,449
(However...)

55
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,889
(This is no normal amount of butter.)

56
00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:34,560
It's okay.

57
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:37,030
(He adds a savory taste to the pan.)

58
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:45,969
(It quickly starts melting.)

59
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,039
(What's scarier than the butter...)

60
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,150
(is the serious look on Je Hoon's face.)

61
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,520
(This time, he is determined to cook a tasty dish for the others.)

62
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:03,219
Je Hoon is...

63
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,460
Wait, Je Hoon.

64
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,620
- Wait, Je Hoon. - Yes?

65
00:03:06,889 --> 00:03:08,360
- Je Hoon. Hold on. - What is it?

66
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,729
You added way too much butter.

67
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,559
The air reeks of butter.

68
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,799
(But I heard butter added a savory taste to food.)

69
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,400
All I can smell is butter, Je Hoon.

70
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:18,968
The smell of butter is unbelievable.

71
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:21,409
(He added too much of the savory ingredient.)

72
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,680
This is an excessive amount of butter, Je Hoon.

73
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,750
(It would be a fried dish instead of a stir-fried one.)

74
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,810
This is a excessive amount of butter?

75
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,780
Well, do as you wish.

76
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,849
Gosh, Je Hoon.

77
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:35,989
Give him a chance.

78
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,090
(Dong Yeon feels bad for Je Hoon's hard effort.)

79
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,219
- Give it a try, Je Hoon. - Okay.

80
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:40,460
I'll help you.

81
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,030
(Eun Woo leaves after boosting Je Hoon's confidence.)

82
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:48,699
(He still looks determined.)

83
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,399
It's okay.

84
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,199
(The reality is that it's become a butter park.)

85
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:57,739
(There is a roof over the outdoor kitchen...)

86
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:01,050
(and a large burner.)

87
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:04,819
(Dong Yeon thought cooking dinner would be a breeze.)

88
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:09,550
(However, due to the rookie chef Je Hoon's love of butter, )

89
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:14,990
(everyone is on the edge of their seats.)

90
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:19,160
(It's sadder because he tries so hard.)

91
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:25,870
(He adds onions to the pool of butter.)

92
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:29,268
I'll cook the onions...

93
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,338
to bring out the sweet flavor.

94
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:32,579
(The chopped onions slowly become soaked in butter.)

95
00:04:33,379 --> 00:04:36,579
(He saw chefs make cool moves as they stir-fry ingredients.)

96
00:04:36,649 --> 00:04:37,649
(Shouting)

97
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,750
(He tosses it into the air.)

98
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,720
(Rookie chef Je Hoon's first stir-fried sausages and vegetables)

99
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,719
(Embarrassed)

100
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,689
(He likes trying everything others do.)

101
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:48,958
(He witnessed the mistake.)

102
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,188
(He pretends he didn't see it.)

103
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:51,259
It looks tasty.

104
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,769
(They sense the anxiety in the air.)

105
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,769
(The surveillance team arrives.)

106
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,438
(They keep a close eye on him.)

107
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:01,709
(While everyone watches closely, )

108
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:05,740
(he adds the bell peppers.)

109
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,378
(Eun Woo's hand squeezes Dong Hwi's shoulder.)

110
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:09,078
(Their hands are clasped together.)

111
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:11,779
(Together, they wish for Je Hoon's success.)

112
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:16,620
(Je Hoon has no idea how nervous the others are.)

113
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,660
(He adds the sausages he carefully cut.)

114
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:26,500
(Highly focused)

115
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:29,469
Look at Je Hoon.

116
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,639
(Good luck, Je Hoon!)

117
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:35,139
(One gets away.)

118
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:38,708
Did you see the bell pepper fly out and go back in?

119
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:40,878
It went into my mouth.

120
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:43,649
(He quickly puts it in his mouth.)

121
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,148
All right.

122
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:46,818
(They are surprised at his quick response.)

123
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:48,490
- Je Hoon. - Yes?

124
00:05:48,589 --> 00:05:50,050
Don't worry.

125
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,888
It looks like a Chinese restaurant over there.

126
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:54,930
(Even his back tells us there is nothing to worry about.)

127
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:57,799
We can look forward to Dong Yeon's omelet rice.

128
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,500
(It's time for Chef Kwak to cook his omelet rice.)

129
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:07,370
(He looks like a professional as he starts with making green onion oil.)

130
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,980
(When the scent of green onion is in the air, he adds bacon.)

131
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:18,220
(It already looks savory.)

132
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,688
- That looks amazing. - Gosh.

133
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:23,050
(It also makes them feel at ease.)

134
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,230
(He adds a bunch of onions he chopped beforehand.)

135
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:30,929
(He adds two spoons of oyster sauce...)

136
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,829
(for umami.)

137
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,170
(He casually tosses minced garlic in.)

138
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:39,299
(The highlight is the smoky flavor.)

139
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,970
That's impressive.

140
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:42,410
Gosh.

141
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:44,540
- Dong Yeon is a great cook. - Yes, he is.

142
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,909
That's cool.

143
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:47,610
(He shows off a fancy move with the wok for a smoky flavor.)

144
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,309
(Shaking the pan)

145
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,350
(Jealous)

146
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:54,250
(The pot rice is ready.)

147
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:57,120
(It's slightly burned.)

148
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:01,389
(Even scorched rice is tasty when made into fried rice.)

149
00:07:02,529 --> 00:07:06,100
(The key is to quickly mix it over high heat.)

150
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,629
(Tossing the rice)

151
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,539
That's amazing.

152
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:16,370
(His perfect control over the wok doesn't allow any rice to escape.)

153
00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:20,209
(This is the way you're supposed to use a wok.)

154
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,350
(It makes the people watching feel at ease.)

155
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:26,180
Look at that omelet rice.

156
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,448
It looks tasty.

157
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:28,649
(That's our Trustworthy Man.)

158
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:32,290
(With a few elaborate tosses of the skilled chef, )

159
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,060
That's impressive.

160
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:36,328
He is a skilled chef.

161
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:37,860
(the fried rice is ready.)

162
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:40,329
Dong Hwi.

163
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:42,269
The eggs...

164
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,099
- The eggs... - Do you want me to beat the eggs?

165
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,568
(He understands and asks if he should beat the eggs.)

166
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:47,610
What about the eggs?

167
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,410
Beat 6 to 7 eggs.

168
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,509
Okay.

169
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,309
(After living together for a week, they work hand in glove.)

170
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,180
(Assistant 1 Dong Hwi cracks the eggs.)

171
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:02,449
(Assistant 2 Eun Woo beats the eggs.)

172
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:06,289
The eggs are ready.

173
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,129
(The eggs are ready within a minute thanks to their perfect teamwork.)

174
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:10,898
(It is slowly added to a heated pan.)

175
00:08:10,899 --> 00:08:12,759
Don't you need more sausages?

176
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:19,240
(Then he tilts the pan to spread the beaten eggs out.)

177
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,839
(The blanket of eggs is cooking to a soft texture.)

178
00:08:25,779 --> 00:08:27,279
You're good at this.

179
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,479
This is nice.

180
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,649
How do you do that?

181
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:32,720
You just tilt it to the side so it doesn't burn.

182
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,220
Gosh, you're good.

183
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,119
Gosh, look at that omelet rice.

184
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,558
(Cover the rice with an egg blanket, and the omelet rice is ready.)

185
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,830
That looks so tasty.

186
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,259
This is unbelievable.

187
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:46,830
Look how amazing it looks.

188
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:48,470
It's to kill for.

189
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,230
(Feeling sad for some reason)

190
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,340
(Look, everyone!)

191
00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:57,168
(Take a look at the unbelievable stir-fried sausages and vegetables!)

192
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:58,480
It smells good, Je Hoon.

193
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,109
I think it's time to add the sauce.

194
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,178
Yes.

195
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:05,220
(He finally adds the sauce.)

196
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,449
The color is so pretty.

197
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:09,619
It really is.

198
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:13,220
(It looks quite tasty.)

199
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,189
It looks pretty good.

200
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,860
(Amazed)

201
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,398
(Really?)

202
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,799
(He is finally relieved.)

203
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,069
It must be hot.

204
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,039
(He gains confidence and checks the taste.)

205
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,769
(Will it also taste good?)

206
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,940
(What?)

207
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,240
Hey.

208
00:09:35,179 --> 00:09:36,309
Gosh.

209
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,490
(He tastes it without saying anything.)

210
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:47,789
(Je Hoon?)

211
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,460
Je Hoon. Why aren't you saying anything after tasting it?

212
00:09:50,929 --> 00:09:52,299
- You know... - What?

213
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,169
When you taste something...

214
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:56,829
and it's so good, you're left speechless?

215
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:57,969
- Yes. - It's that good?

216
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,799
- Let me taste it. - Wait a second.

217
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,340
- Je Hoon. - No.

218
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,370
I think you need...

219
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:05,440
someone to stop you.

220
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:10,548
Give me a chance.

221
00:10:10,549 --> 00:10:11,949
(Just give me some time.)

222
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,350
Don't be too surprised.

223
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:14,850
All right.

224
00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:19,519
(He quickly takes something out.)

225
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,758
(Maybe it tastes greasy, he adds gochujang.)

226
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:28,029
(He's come a long way and can fix the taste now.)

227
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,970
(Will the gochujang be able to get rid of the greasiness of butter?)

228
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,808
- It's ready. - That's great.

229
00:10:37,809 --> 00:10:38,809
(Je Hoon's first stir-fried sausages and vegetables are ready.)

230
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:43,549
(Find out how it tastes in a moment.)

231
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,778
- Garlic flakes? - Yes.

232
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,589
- Nice. - The omelet rice looks great.

233
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:48,590
(Dong Yeon even made garlic flakes in that short time.)

234
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:52,888
You made the omelet super thin.

235
00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:55,129
(Trustworthy Man Dong Yeon's omelet rice)

236
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,590
(Chef Kwak's kimchi made with Finnish green onions)

237
00:10:56,591 --> 00:10:58,029
The green onion kimchi looks like something I'd like.

238
00:10:58,059 --> 00:11:00,129
I think it would be a good combination with the omelet rice.

239
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:01,899
It looks so tasty.

240
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:03,100
It looks amazing.

241
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:05,369
The sausages look tasty.

242
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:07,409
(And Je Hoon's stir-fried sausages and vegetables that look perfect!)

243
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,808
Thank you Je Hoon and Dong Yeon,

244
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:12,079
who cooked today.

245
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,138
You're welcome.

246
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:15,879
(Their first hearty meal at their new home)

247
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:19,148
- Thank you for cooking. - Enjoy.

248
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:21,119
- Gosh, Master Kwak. - Let's eat.

249
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,350
(They try the omelet rice, the main dish, first.)

250
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,189
(Marveling)

251
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:29,389
(Dong Hwi takes a bite too.)

252
00:11:30,429 --> 00:11:31,460
This is good.

253
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,429
- Dong Yeon. - The omelet rice is tasty.

254
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,768
The garlic flakes were a nice touch.

255
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:37,069
(The soft blanket of eggs and crispy garlic flakes...)

256
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,570
(go well with the deliciously seasoned fried rice.)

257
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,940
It's so tasty.

258
00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:42,139
It's good.

259
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:45,309
The garlic flakes were a nice touch.

260
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,610
(Even the chef is satisfied.)

261
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,110
Oh, the green onion kimchi.

262
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,879
- This is green onion kimchi, right? - Yes.

263
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,489
How is it so tasty?

264
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,749
(Green onion kimchi made with the leek of Lapland)

265
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,990
- It's so tasty. - Yes.

266
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:00,190
(How does it taste so good?)

267
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,959
(Do you like it?)

268
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,960
Wait.

269
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:05,428
How is this so tasty?

270
00:12:05,429 --> 00:12:07,199
I needed a few more ingredients like sesame seeds...

271
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,529
- and perilla oil. - Really?

272
00:12:10,669 --> 00:12:12,000
The green onion kimchi is tasty.

273
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,500
The green onion kimchi is nice.

274
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:16,709
- It doesn't have a sour flavor. - Right.

275
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,379
I don't do this in Korea,

276
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:19,980
- but I added some vinegar. - Vinegar?

277
00:12:20,409 --> 00:12:22,179
How did you think of making kimchi...

278
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:24,120
with green onion?

279
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,320
This is awesome.

280
00:12:25,321 --> 00:12:28,289
I learned how to make it from Paik Jong Won.

281
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,788
(A taste of their homeland at the northernmost part of the world)

282
00:12:30,789 --> 00:12:31,990
It's his recipe.

283
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,729
I'm grateful for him.

284
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,028
It's really tasty.

285
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:37,029
(Homemaker Kwak succeeds in making kimchi in Lapland.)

286
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,898
I didn't know I'd be this grateful to Mr. Paik.

287
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:41,399
(It's a successful meal so far.)

288
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,099
(Clearing his throat)

289
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,399
(Glancing at the others)

290
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,710
(Looking up)

291
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,908
(Pandora's box hasn't been open yet.)

292
00:12:50,909 --> 00:12:54,449
(Je Hoon's first dish after his failed attempt to cook eggs)

293
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:55,450
(10 minutes has passed, )

294
00:12:55,451 --> 00:13:00,279
(but no one has tried it yet.)

295
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,518
(No one...)

296
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,120
(has the courage to try it.)

297
00:13:07,659 --> 00:13:10,529
(My stir-fried sausages and vegetables...)

298
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,799
(The first courageous attempt)

299
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:15,700
I'll try it.

300
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,970
(The model employee of Je Hoon's agency musters courage.)

301
00:13:19,169 --> 00:13:20,199
Try it.

302
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,470
- Je Hoon's sausage and vegetables? - Yes.

303
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,440
(Takes a bite)

304
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:29,080
(What do you think?)

305
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:34,250
(Does it taste okay?)

306
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:36,549
It's tasty.

307
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:38,559
It's tasty.

308
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,830
(Will his embarrassing cooking incident be forgotten?)

309
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,758
- Je Hoon's sausage and vegetables? - Yes.

310
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:45,028
(It's tasty?)

311
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:47,159
(Really?)

312
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,899
(Highly nervous)

313
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,139
It's tasty.

314
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:57,979
(It's not bad.)

315
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,210
(Nodding)

316
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,850
(He is relieved.)

317
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:07,649
(Is Je Hoon, the slow and steady cook, rewarded with this dish?)

318
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,190
Je Hoon.

319
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:13,889
You should've added half the amount of butter.

320
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,129
It's very buttery.

321
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,700
The butter...

322
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,259
But it's okay with the green onion kimchi.

323
00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:20,928
- Hear me out. - Okay.

324
00:14:20,929 --> 00:14:23,628
If you have this with the green onion kimchi,

325
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,798
it will be a great combination.

326
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:27,669
Should we just mix it together?

327
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:31,980
I should've added just a little bit.

328
00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:34,480
From now on,

329
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,450
I'll call you Butter Lee.

330
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:42,850
(He added a whole bunch of butter in the scrambled eggs.)

331
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,289
(Butter Lee, the prince of butter)

332
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,529
It's still tasty.

333
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,960
I added too much.

334
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,599
- I should've added less. - Right?

335
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,769
Yes, that's right.

336
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
(Je Hoon blames himself.)

337
00:14:56,001 --> 00:14:58,039
(He feels upset.)

338
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,639
However,

339
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,109
it's way closer to food...

340
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,378
than the eggs you cooked.

341
00:15:05,379 --> 00:15:06,539
You're right.

342
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:09,250
(It's way closer to food.)

343
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,509
You've gotten better.

344
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,678
- Compared to that, - That's right.

345
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,080
This is unbelievable.

346
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:16,419
- You did a great job. - Je Hoon.

347
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,789
You get 200 brownie points.

348
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:20,759
- Thank you. - Seriously.

349
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:25,159
(Staring at him)

350
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,169
(Look at this, Je Hoon.)

351
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,169
This is addictive.

352
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,870
- I can't stop eating it. - Because of the butter,

353
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,509
it goes down smoothly.

354
00:15:36,909 --> 00:15:38,740
(Thank you.)

355
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:39,879
It's a nice balance.

356
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,479
After eating this, I have the kimchi to get rid of the oily taste.

357
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,750
- That's right. - That's right.

358
00:15:43,049 --> 00:15:44,179
It has a strong flavor.

359
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:45,980
I like it.

360
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,048
- Je Hoon. - Yes?

361
00:15:48,049 --> 00:15:50,689
- Because you added a lot of butter, - Yes?

362
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:53,659
- the omelet rice tastes like... - Yes.

363
00:15:54,059 --> 00:15:56,259
- jangjorim butter bibimbap. - You're right.

364
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:58,399
- Doesn't it taste like it? - Yes, it does.

365
00:15:58,659 --> 00:16:01,399
The flavor of butter...

366
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,669
- It transferred. - has spread to the rice.

367
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,230
(Laughing)

368
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,399
The smell of butter spread to my nose when I was laughing.

369
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:09,139
I'm sorry.

370
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,638
- No, from my mouth. - I see.

371
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:11,639
(The butter stir-fried sausages and vegetables has various charms.)

372
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:13,009
(The slow and steady cook is still learning.)

373
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:15,110
I'll do a better job next time.

374
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,979
- Je Hoon, it's uncomfortable... - This is surprising.

375
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,649
To cook in a kitchen you aren't used to.

376
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,190
It's very difficult.

377
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,388
When you see us...

378
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:27,189
eating your food,

379
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,190
don't you feel good?

380
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,830
(He is busy eating.)

381
00:16:31,129 --> 00:16:32,200
I love it.

382
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:34,259
When I first tried it,

383
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,870
I was actually scared.

384
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,069
I knew I was in trouble.

385
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:39,168
(Je Hoon was terrified the nightmare of eggs would repeat itself.)

386
00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:40,500
You might've regained your reputation.

387
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,439
But seeing...

388
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,139
that you enjoyed most of it,

389
00:16:45,179 --> 00:16:46,340
I feel proud of myself.

390
00:16:46,779 --> 00:16:47,850
Thank you.

391
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:50,809
(The senior chef is proud as well.)

392
00:16:51,049 --> 00:16:53,820
It's almost 10pm.

393
00:16:54,789 --> 00:16:57,419
- But it still isn't dark. - We had another late dinner.

394
00:16:57,889 --> 00:16:58,960
- That's right. - You're right.

395
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,959
(The village's night sky...)

396
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:07,359
(is painted a dark purple.)

397
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,400
I lose track of time...

398
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,108
because the sun doesn't set.

399
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:16,140
I know.

400
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:19,479
It feels like we said goodbye to Oiva yesterday.

401
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,778
(Fact: They moved today.)

402
00:17:20,779 --> 00:17:22,108
I lost track of the date.

403
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,649
(The days are way too long because of the late sunsets.)

404
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:25,920
We did so many things today.

405
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,548
- Yes, we did. - We even moved today.

406
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:30,018
We drove a long way here.

407
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:31,690
(Using both hands to eat)

408
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:33,619
Since we do things non-stop, I'm always hungry.

409
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:36,189
- Of course. - It's a lot of physical activity.

410
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,190
Even today,

411
00:17:37,191 --> 00:17:38,400
- We built a house. - we used a lot of energy.

412
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,298
(Scraping his plate clean)

413
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:41,329
Yes, as soon as we unpacked.

414
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,868
We moved things, washed the car,

415
00:17:43,869 --> 00:17:46,170
- and clipped the sheep's nails. - We even clipped the sheep's nails.

416
00:17:46,369 --> 00:17:48,469
It wasn't easy controlling...

417
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,970
- the sheep. - It was tough.

418
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:52,979
- Animals. - Animals are like that.

419
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:53,980
(They have a tough road ahead of them at the Zootopia home.)

420
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,079
(They end their eventful day with stuffing their faces.)

421
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,779
That's another meal cleared.

422
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,018
What should we have tomorrow?

423
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:06,419
(The chef is burdened with worries about the next day's meals.)

424
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,359
We would've went straight back to Korea if it weren't for you.

425
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:10,660
- That's true. - Yes, it is.

426
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:12,859
I'm sure Eun Woo would've stepped up if I weren't here.

427
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:14,699
Eun Woo is a good cook too.

428
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,970
- Yes, he is. - He's a good cook.

429
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:18,299
Our teamwork is improving.

430
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:21,338
(They agree.)

431
00:18:21,339 --> 00:18:23,369
We ended up finishing everything.

432
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,209
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you, Dong Yeon.

433
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:27,739
- Thank you for the food. - We finished everything.

434
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,879
Everyone finished all their food.

435
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,348
- Let's clean up. - Thank you.

436
00:18:31,349 --> 00:18:32,818
(The 4 of them work together and finish their 1st meal here.)

437
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:34,250
I'll do the dishes.

438
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,160
It's time to get ready for bed now.

439
00:18:38,259 --> 00:18:39,460
Let's take a shower.

440
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,430
(Je Hoon, the eldest, takes his toiletries out.)

441
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:45,900
- Je Hoon. - Yes?

442
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,828
Do you have shampoo?

443
00:18:48,829 --> 00:18:50,299
I'm all out.

444
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:51,740
I have shampoo.

445
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,799
That's a huge relief.

446
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:57,109
This is a shampoo I love.

447
00:18:57,339 --> 00:18:59,538
It's made with natural ingredients only.

448
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:00,779
It's really nice. You should try it.

449
00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:02,750
If it's made with natural ingredients,

450
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:04,818
do I have to leave it in for a while?

451
00:19:04,819 --> 00:19:07,719
- Yes. - Thank you so much, Je Hoon.

452
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,250
- We can share it. - Okay.

453
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:10,649
Okay.

454
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,720
You're like our guardian.

455
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:14,789
CEO Lee Je Hoon.

456
00:19:14,829 --> 00:19:17,130
You are extremely well-prepared.

457
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,159
- I have everything. Just ask. - Thank you.

458
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,299
- Okay. - This is nice.

459
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,068
Let's wash our hair thoroughly today.

460
00:19:22,069 --> 00:19:23,169
Okay.

461
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:24,170
(They heat underground water and take a shower at the sauna.)

462
00:19:24,869 --> 00:19:26,439
(Groaning)

463
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,598
(Sauna)

464
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:30,210
(What is this sound?)

465
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,139
(Dong Yeon is already enjoying the sauna.)

466
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:35,549
(The man of nature's unstoppable love for saunas)

467
00:19:37,349 --> 00:19:42,190
(He now heats up the sauna with ease.)

468
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:46,818
(The steam makes the inside look foggy.)

469
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:49,858
(Groaning)

470
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:51,229
Gosh. This is so lovely.

471
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,430
(Gosh. This is so lovely.)

472
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,969
Here it comes.

473
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,230
(Here it comes.)

474
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:04,608
(The humming comes out automatically as he warms himself up.)

475
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:07,880
(The camera is abandoned as the result of his excitement.)

476
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:09,979
(Wiping)

477
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,779
(The editor says, "Thank you.")

478
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:17,048
(Mr. Kwak has entered the world of 1 sauna session a day...)

479
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,789
(in Lapland.)

480
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:25,059
(Now, he can't fall asleep without a taking a sauna.)

481
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:28,970
I love you

482
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,569
(What is he going to do without a sauna back in Korea?)

483
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,509
(A story of the man of nature's unchanging love for sauna)

484
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:48,690
(Meanwhile, one man, Dong Hwi, struggles alone.)

485
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:53,690
(He can hear a fly somewhere.)

486
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:57,559
(Holding an Excalibur)

487
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:06,569
(He's on a war against a fly.)

488
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:11,309
(Meanwhile, Eun Woo enters his first private room.)

489
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:15,778
(A small yet cozy home of his own)

490
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:17,109
This bed is small.

491
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,879
(In the past, )

492
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:25,059
(he had to sleep while being really close to others.)

493
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:31,900
(The unfamiliar and precious space of his own after a long time)

494
00:21:32,029 --> 00:21:35,500
(He puts the lotion on under the electric light.)

495
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:40,769
(For the first time, he turns off the light, not the candle.)

496
00:21:43,609 --> 00:21:45,640
(Sniffing)

497
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,980
(The youngest one goes to bed early in the room of his own.)

498
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:54,950
(Meanwhile, the elder brothers' room for 2 people)

499
00:21:55,549 --> 00:21:58,890
(In the end, he collapsed after getting defeated by the fly.)

500
00:22:06,829 --> 00:22:08,528
(The moment of the knight passes.)

501
00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:11,940
(When the sun starts to shine, )

502
00:22:13,269 --> 00:22:16,339
(the fog that covered the lake lifts.)

503
00:22:19,779 --> 00:22:23,149
(Having neighbors for the first time, )

504
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:25,349
(this is our rented house.)

505
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,289
(Unlike before, they have a bustling morning.)

506
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:35,328
(The new cohabitants of the Renters...)

507
00:22:35,329 --> 00:22:38,160
(greet their morning in their own way.)

508
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,529
(Wake up!)

509
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,200
(The first morning in Kemijarvi)

510
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:49,368
(The young ones in private rooms...)

511
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:51,809
(are still asleep.)

512
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,150
(His feet are sticking out as the bed is small.)

513
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:59,118
(The older ones are still passed out too.)

514
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:01,689
(They are the only ones sleeping in.)

515
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:04,250
(Of the Renters, who will be the first to wake up?)

516
00:23:07,089 --> 00:23:09,960
(Dong Yeon's alarm goes off.)

517
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:13,058
(As the phone is fully charged, thanks to electricity, )

518
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:15,529
(they hear the alarm for the first time.)

519
00:23:16,069 --> 00:23:19,539
(They can hear the alarm in the older brothers' room too.)

520
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,670
(He is forced to wake up.)

521
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,980
(He almost misses the time without electricity.)

522
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:30,979
(Squeaking)

523
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:34,989
(The 200-year-old floor makes the same sound, though.)

524
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:37,618
(Staggering)

525
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:40,118
(Squeaking)

526
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:41,490
Dong Hwi, are you up?

527
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,730
Yes.

528
00:23:44,059 --> 00:23:46,960
(Wiggling)

529
00:23:48,569 --> 00:23:50,028
The bed is small.

530
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:51,768
(The bed is small.)

531
00:23:51,769 --> 00:23:53,670
I didn't know that because I passed out.

532
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,368
I tried to catch a bug...

533
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:56,670
- but passed out. - Goodness.

534
00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:00,779
Wasn't there a big bee here yesterday? No.

535
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,710
Wasn't there a big dung fly?

536
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:06,179
- Was there? - It made the sound of...

537
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,220
(It's new to him.)

538
00:24:07,849 --> 00:24:10,720
It kept making the sound of a helicopter.

539
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,859
I see.

540
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,318
So, I stood with the fly swatter.

541
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:15,459
(Dong Hwi suffered from a big dung fly after a while.)

542
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,889
Then I passed out.

543
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:17,960
(Dong Hwi suffered from a big dung fly after a while.)

544
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:22,430
(At this moment)

545
00:24:22,769 --> 00:24:26,440
(The helicopter goes wild in the other room.)

546
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:31,680
(The one who made the older brothers wake up is still asleep.)

547
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:35,380
(Clacking)

548
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,018
(Sticking his head out)

549
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:42,289
- Dong Yeon, were you sleeping? - I'm up.

550
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:46,159
(Laughing)

551
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,689
(The big brother comes to arrest the perp with the alarm.)

552
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:49,859
Hey.

553
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:52,899
Your bed is really big.

554
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,130
(Envying)

555
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,399
It's really nice.

556
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,739
(Dong Yeon enjoyed the luxury for the first time privately.)

557
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,339
But the sunlight is crazy.

558
00:25:02,009 --> 00:25:04,608
- Take your time before getting up. - Okay.

559
00:25:04,609 --> 00:25:06,180
(He says that after waking him up.)

560
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,319
(He wakes up with his unique cabbage-like hairstyle.)

561
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:17,819
(Why does his hair puff up more as time goes by?)

562
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,189
My hair looks crazy.

563
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,730
(My hair looks crazy.)

564
00:25:24,029 --> 00:25:26,899
(He wears a hat to push down his cabbage-style hair.)

565
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,000
(Looking this way and that way)

566
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:34,298
(Dong Yeon didn't look at the mirror in the cottages in the forest.)

567
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:40,109
(In the town, he puts extra care even when picking a hat.)

568
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:45,479
(After trying on many hats for a long time...)

569
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,549
(Thinking)

570
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:52,490
(He picks a common baseball cap.)

571
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,759
(Dong Yeon goes out after dressing up.)

572
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,169
(He is wearing a facial mask.)

573
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:12,278
(He gets himself an urgent skin care...)

574
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,410
(as he has come to a town with more people.)

575
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:16,349
What?

576
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:20,450
(What surprised him at the corner of the yard were...)

577
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:25,460
(the chickens, his roomates that woke up early.)

578
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:29,259
(Homemaker Kwak can't just sit and watch.)

579
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:34,660
(Homemaker Kwak feeds the chickens as he feeds the Renters.)

580
00:26:35,069 --> 00:26:40,039
(It's good. We love Homemaker Kwak.)

581
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:44,839
(Meanwhile, Je Hoon is washing up at the front yard.)

582
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,239
(He brushes his teeth with the water from a hose, )

583
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,508
(not with the water from a lake.)

584
00:26:49,509 --> 00:26:50,609
Je Hoon.

585
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,450
Yes.

586
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:55,089
(The youngest one woke up too.)

587
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:57,489
Je Hoon, I want to wash my hair.

588
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,289
(I want to wash my hair.)

589
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:01,758
If I wash it with this water, my head will freeze, right?

590
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:03,630
(If I wash it with this water, my head will freeze, right?)

591
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:06,599
(This water pump is...)

592
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,400
After a sauna, do we come here and...

593
00:27:09,369 --> 00:27:12,699
No. You may do that if you want to.

594
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,538
We have to warn you...

595
00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:16,368
- that the water is very cold. - Yes.

596
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:18,679
- It's freezing. - I see. Is it really cold?

597
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,549
(The ice-cold groundwater is colder than a cold bath.)

598
00:27:23,349 --> 00:27:25,950
Your head might freeze and break.

599
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:28,990
But...

600
00:27:29,349 --> 00:27:32,019
if it's really itchy, it's worth trying.

601
00:27:32,789 --> 00:27:33,959
(Carefully)

602
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,990
(Surprised)

603
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,859
(It takes at least 1 hour to heat up the water in the sauna.)

604
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:43,700
(I already washed my hair in the sauna yesterday.)

605
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,268
It's cold.

606
00:27:46,269 --> 00:27:47,339
(Shaking)

607
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:52,980
(I can't decide.)

608
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,910
By the way, because...

609
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,910
I've been eating strong-tasting foods,

610
00:27:58,819 --> 00:28:00,720
my face is always puffy.

611
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,650
It's because you put so much butter yesterday.

612
00:28:05,019 --> 00:28:06,588
It's the salted butter, isn't it?

613
00:28:06,589 --> 00:28:07,960
(The buttery sausages added flavors and puffiness.)

614
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:11,589
(Thanks to it, their faces are puffy.)

615
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:14,659
(By the way, he needs to wash his hair.)

616
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,029
Do you want me to pour water over your head?

617
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,268
Gosh. I should get totally ready for it.

618
00:28:20,269 --> 00:28:23,068
I will put your head in it completely.

619
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:24,539
Je Hoon, please be gentle.

620
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:28,079
(The ice-cold water is on.)

621
00:28:28,549 --> 00:28:31,278
(Am I making a right decision?)

622
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,750
(Was it better to heat up the water for 1 hour?)

623
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,150
- Je Hoon, it's so strong. - Is it?

624
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:38,489
(They try to find the gush of water that would be the least painful.)

625
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:39,659
Pick one.

626
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,890
- Weaker. - "Weaker."

627
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,729
I'll freeze to death.

628
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:46,000
(I'll freeze to death.)

629
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:47,258
This softly?

630
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:48,669
(They picked the softest stream of water.)

631
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:50,329
- Why does it look so weak? - I know.

632
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:52,869
- Should we? - Here you go.

633
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:56,308
(Nervous)

634
00:28:56,309 --> 00:28:57,440
- Here it comes. - Okay.

635
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,479
(The freezing groundwater starts to wet his hair.)

636
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,539
It's cold, isn't it?

637
00:29:03,549 --> 00:29:07,679
(Like Anne said, it's freezing.)

638
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,789
- Gosh. It looks so refreshing. - Gosh.

639
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,359
(Screaming)

640
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,459
- Gosh. The groundwater. - Yes.

641
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,160
(Crying)

642
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:20,229
How long has it been since we showered under a hose?

643
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,429
(Still, they didn't have to draw water from a lake.)

644
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:23,068
Gosh. It's warm.

645
00:29:23,069 --> 00:29:25,298
- "It's warm?" - It's hot. It's summer now.

646
00:29:25,299 --> 00:29:26,499
(He deceives himself to survive.)

647
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,069
- It's so hot. - Right.

648
00:29:28,509 --> 00:29:30,240
- You're doing great. - Yes.

649
00:29:31,509 --> 00:29:32,609
Gosh.

650
00:29:34,109 --> 00:29:36,909
My head is getting numb.

651
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,410
(His scalp is getting numb in real time.)

652
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:39,819
(His ear is red because it's frozen.)

653
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,548
- Do you want shampoo? - Yes.

654
00:29:41,549 --> 00:29:42,750
It's cold, Je Hoon.

655
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,220
(Screaming)

656
00:29:46,221 --> 00:29:49,230
(The cold shower stops momentarily to grab the shampoo.)

657
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:54,059
(It's shampoo time with the natural shampoo Je Hoon brought.)

658
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,268
Gosh. It's refreshing, isn't it?

659
00:29:56,269 --> 00:29:57,328
Yes. It's so refreshing.

660
00:29:57,329 --> 00:29:59,670
(Rubbing and scratching)

661
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,769
(Now, he needs to rinse it.)

662
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:04,508
- Here it comes. - Please wait.

663
00:30:04,509 --> 00:30:05,538
Okay.

664
00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:06,980
(Sighing)

665
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,679
This is so...

666
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,450
(He can't dare to do it again.)

667
00:30:12,049 --> 00:30:14,578
For the rest of your life, would you use the hot water from a bucket...

668
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:17,449
or wash comfortably with the cold water from a hose?

669
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:18,489
The hot one.

670
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:19,919
(The bucket with hot water even if takes a long time)

671
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,788
- That's better, right? - I get cold easily.

672
00:30:21,789 --> 00:30:22,789
I see.

673
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:27,528
(He has to be playful even when he's feeling cold.)

674
00:30:27,529 --> 00:30:29,130
- Let's go. - Let's go.

675
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,239
Gosh. Please hold on.

676
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,839
(Hesitating)

677
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,710
Gosh. Je Hoon.

678
00:30:39,009 --> 00:30:41,278
(Running away as soon as the water touches him)

679
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:42,308
Je Hoon.

680
00:30:42,309 --> 00:30:44,709
(Quick-frozen again)

681
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:45,818
It's so cold, isn't it?

682
00:30:45,819 --> 00:30:46,819
Je Hoon, let's go.

683
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:48,750
(1 second)

684
00:30:48,751 --> 00:30:49,789
(2 seconds)

685
00:30:49,819 --> 00:30:52,519
Je Hoon, don't come so close.

686
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:58,359
(He asks to keep the hose away after 2 seconds.)

687
00:30:58,529 --> 00:31:00,159
If it's close, it's so cold.

688
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,160
Hold on.

689
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,999
Gosh. It's tough.

690
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,299
(They're in town, but living in the countryside is still hard.)

691
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,539
Gosh.

692
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,910
Gosh. It's so hot.

693
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,669
Gosh. It's burning hot.

694
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:13,808
Hey. You're controlling your mind really well.

695
00:31:13,809 --> 00:31:15,038
Je Hoon, it's really warm.

696
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,079
It's warm, isn't it?

697
00:31:16,849 --> 00:31:18,549
Gosh. It's like a sauna out here.

698
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,318
Gosh. I love it.

699
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:23,518
- Good job. - It's hot.

700
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,190
(Mischievous Eun Woo overcomes a pain by deceiving himself.)

701
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,758
(He finishes the icy shampooing after going through so much.)

702
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:28,828
Thank you.

703
00:31:28,829 --> 00:31:30,890
(He finishes the icy shampooing after going through so much.)

704
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,899
How was it? Awesome?

705
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,068
Gosh. Je Hoon. It's so refreshing.

706
00:31:36,069 --> 00:31:37,868
(He's fully awake after a cold wash.)

707
00:31:37,869 --> 00:31:39,140
Gosh. It's refreshing.

708
00:31:39,769 --> 00:31:43,038
(The puffiness is gone after the cold wash.)

709
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:44,269
Hey, well done.

710
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,379
Rather than feeling itchy all day,

711
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:50,480
- it's better to wash in cold once. - Right.

712
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,219
- Tell me whenever you need it. - Okay.

713
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,789
- I'll make you feel how warm it is. - Okay.

714
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:57,549
Let's go.

715
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:59,819
- Je Hoon, thank you. - Not a problem.

716
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:09,200
Gosh.

717
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,329
It's pretty.

718
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:16,640
(Electricity is pretty no matter how many times he sees it.)

719
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,249
I'm charging my phone while we have electricity.

720
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,880
(This is the chance to charge everything they have.)

721
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:33,519
(The electric shave that was out of battery is fully charged.)

722
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:37,989
(They get ready meticulously...)

723
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:40,799
(in case they don't have electricity at the next place they rented.)

724
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:50,210
(Surprisingly, he puts moisturizer, thinking about the townspeople.)

725
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,980
(Following everyone, Dong Yeon takes care of his skin.)

726
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:57,579
(His secret is the strong touch.)

727
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,680
You have to put on sunscreen...

728
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,490
or you'll get tanned.

729
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:10,059
(Okay, Je Hoon. I'm putting it on.)

730
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:11,828
(The brothers have their first glam time...)

731
00:33:11,829 --> 00:33:14,499
You have to put on sunscreen frequently.

732
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,930
(as they are excited about the town with more people.)

733
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:19,469
Je Hoon, so far,

734
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:21,499
Dong Yeon has prepared breakfast all the time.

735
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,768
I'll prepare it quickly this time.

736
00:33:23,769 --> 00:33:24,909
- Really? - Yes.

737
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:26,139
Nice.

738
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:28,980
- I'll whip it up. - Okay. Thank you.

739
00:33:31,349 --> 00:33:35,650
(When Cha Eun Woo Suddenly Becomes My Roommate)

740
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:38,319
(Really?)

741
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,990
(He's my roommate?)

742
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:45,829
(It's 10am. My roommate approaches me.)

743
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,430
(Eun Woo: You must be hungry.)

744
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,799
(Me: No. I feel full just by looking at you.)

745
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,910
(Eun Woo: My face is puffy, isn't it?)

746
00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:01,809
(Me: No. It's my heart that is puffing up.)

747
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:03,308
Should I do it quickly?

748
00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:05,109
(Eun Woo: Should I whip up breakfast?)

749
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:08,650
(Me: Take your time. I can wait forever.)

750
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:17,389
(An austere rooster roommate blocks Chef Cha's way.)

751
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:19,629
It's a rooster.

752
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:24,369
(Suddenly, the rooster and Eun Woo are in a standoff.)

753
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,909
(Launching a preemptive attack)

754
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:39,079
(The 27-year-old Mischievous Eun Woo is having a cockfight.)

755
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,150
Sorry.

756
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:47,559
(My new roommate is strange.)

757
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:50,828
(Before deciding what to cook, )

758
00:34:50,829 --> 00:34:53,059
(he needs to check what ingredients he has.)

759
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:57,069
(Butter)

760
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,499
(Bread)

761
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,069
(Yogurt)

762
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:02,069
(Milk)

763
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,139
Eggs.

764
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:08,480
(Only the basic ingredients are left.)

765
00:35:08,809 --> 00:35:12,420
(With these ingredients...)

766
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:16,448
(He breaks the eggs without hesitation.)

767
00:35:16,449 --> 00:35:19,860
(A lot of them)

768
00:35:21,659 --> 00:35:23,359
Four? Five?

769
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:27,659
(4 eggs? 5 eggs?)

770
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,429
(What is he going to make with these many eggs?)

771
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,238
(It can't be scrambled eggs.)

772
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:35,269
Okay.

773
00:35:36,409 --> 00:35:38,839
Cha Eun Woo's French toast.

774
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,309
(Today's menu is Eun Woo's French toast!)

775
00:35:40,539 --> 00:35:43,578
When I was young, Mom cooked it like this...

776
00:35:43,579 --> 00:35:46,949
after I got home from school and before a tutoring class.

777
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:51,349
(He beats the yellow eggs which the bread will soak.)

778
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:56,460
(How did she season it?)

779
00:35:56,559 --> 00:35:57,860
Is this salt?

780
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:03,530
(He adds salt as he learned by watching his mother.)

781
00:36:03,969 --> 00:36:09,110
(He cuts off the crusts following his mom's method.)

782
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,839
(He soaks the bread in the beaten eggs...)

783
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:18,010
(and puts it on the pan.)

784
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:20,420
This looks good.

785
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,319
(Reproducing Mom's toasts from his childhood...)

786
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,488
This is crazy.

787
00:36:24,489 --> 00:36:26,690
(exactly as it is)

788
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:32,400
(After cooking it until golden, he puts it on a plate to finish.)

789
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,029
(It seemed he was done, )

790
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:41,170
(but he oils the pan again.)

791
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,138
There's a special recipe.

792
00:36:43,139 --> 00:36:46,710
(He adds the crusts he cut off before.)

793
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:49,249
(Eun Woo's hidden recipe)

794
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:52,349
(Cut the bread crusts into bite-sized pieces.)

795
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:54,880
(Adding a spoonful of butter)

796
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:01,619
(Don't put too much butter. Je Hoon, go easy with butter.)

797
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:07,900
(Coat the pieces in savory butter.)

798
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:12,639
(Adding sweet sugar)

799
00:37:13,139 --> 00:37:18,869
(When toasted until crisp, it's a rusk, the hidden menu.)

800
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:22,038
It looks like the breakfast served at a hotel.

801
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:23,749
(He finishes making breakfast using his mother's old recipe!)

802
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:24,980
It's done.

803
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:28,379
(Mischievous Eun Woo's French toast and rusk with memories)

804
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:32,150
I'll deliver my love for our members.

805
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:37,860
(And he throws in a yogurt.)

806
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:43,900
(Hitting)

807
00:37:45,469 --> 00:37:46,599
(Screaming)

808
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:52,139
(It's so painful that he goes speechless.)

809
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:57,849
(Giving a resenting look)

810
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,719
I bumped into it yesterday too.

811
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:01,979
Gosh. I'm not going to cook.

812
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:07,190
(The roof at the countryside is too low for him.)

813
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,058
Hey. Well done, Eun Woo.

814
00:38:09,059 --> 00:38:11,489
I made a hotel-style breakfast.

815
00:38:11,829 --> 00:38:13,658
Gosh. What is this?

816
00:38:13,659 --> 00:38:14,959
(He delivered it to their room as a room service!)

817
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,328
It looks so good.

818
00:38:16,329 --> 00:38:17,468
What is this?

819
00:38:17,469 --> 00:38:18,999
Did you turn the crusts into this?

820
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,500
- That's right. - That's crazy.

821
00:38:20,769 --> 00:38:21,899
It's a great idea.

822
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,738
- Exactly. - It's like a snack.

823
00:38:23,739 --> 00:38:24,809
(The rusk caught Chef Kwak's eyes.)

824
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,538
Try the snack first.

825
00:38:26,539 --> 00:38:27,579
Okay.

826
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:29,308
(Savoring)

827
00:38:29,309 --> 00:38:30,480
(He tries it first to see if it tastes like his childhood.)

828
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,150
Thank you for the food.

829
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:34,819
It's tasty.

830
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,089
(The big brother is amazed at the taste of childhood too!)

831
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:37,250
It's good.

832
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:39,389
It's so flavorful and tasty.

833
00:38:39,789 --> 00:38:42,488
Gosh. There's nothing Eun Woo can't do.

834
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:44,329
(The main chef is pleased too.)

835
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:48,929
(Devouring)

836
00:38:50,429 --> 00:38:51,669
Gosh. It's so good.

837
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,800
(Proud)

838
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,199
So, when did you sleep last night?

839
00:38:55,739 --> 00:38:58,409
I slept around 12:30am.

840
00:38:58,809 --> 00:38:59,880
I see.

841
00:39:00,139 --> 00:39:02,380
Interestingly, we went to bed...

842
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:04,678
without saying goodnight.

843
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:07,280
- We went out like a light. - Yes. I passed out.

844
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,119
You're not mad at anything, right?

845
00:39:09,989 --> 00:39:13,158
Well. We didn't even say goodnight.

846
00:39:13,159 --> 00:39:15,359
I enjoyed a moment of my own.

847
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,529
- I took a sauna. - Good job.

848
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:18,690
What's amazing is that...

849
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:20,760
I'm gradually sleeping more.

850
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,369
I sleep an hour more every day.

851
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,239
- That's nice. - You didn't sleep on our first day.

852
00:39:26,539 --> 00:39:27,639
On our first day,

853
00:39:28,139 --> 00:39:29,169
I practically stayed up all night.

854
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:30,509
(Dong Hwi couldn't sleep because of the midnight sun.)

855
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:33,939
- But as time passed... - It's because we work a lot.

856
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,178
- Our bodies get exhausted. - That's right.

857
00:39:35,179 --> 00:39:37,579
(Dong Hwi is now sound asleep even when the sun is up.)

858
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:39,650
I thought about making us two toasts each,

859
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:40,650
but ended up making just one.

860
00:39:40,651 --> 00:39:41,718
- That's too bad. - It's nice and light.

861
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:43,719
It was so good that I wanted more.

862
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,719
Stopping when you feel like something's not enough...

863
00:39:45,989 --> 00:39:47,218
- Right. - Makes you want more.

864
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:48,259
That's right.

865
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,460
It keeps you wanting more.

866
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:52,730
This is always a habit of mine.

867
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,629
(Xylitol gum is Dong Hwi's favorite.)

868
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:56,929
- When... - Xylitol gum.

869
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:58,598
- Who wants some? - Me.

870
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:00,269
- Yes. - It's good.

871
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,439
- Yes. - Gosh.

872
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,539
Thank you.

873
00:40:05,409 --> 00:40:09,679
(The eldest brother puts the gum in his mouth.)

874
00:40:09,809 --> 00:40:10,980
This is really...

875
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:13,649
I heard chewing this after having a meal...

876
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:14,849
was a good habit to have.

877
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,348
- Is that a known fact? - Yes.

878
00:40:16,349 --> 00:40:18,888
Right, I think I heard that too. "Hyva tapa" means "good habit."

879
00:40:18,889 --> 00:40:19,889
(Good habit!)

880
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:21,360
Yes, good habit!

881
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,359
Thank you for the food.

882
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,360
- Thank you. - Thank you for the food.

883
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:29,670
Thank you. Let's go.

884
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,030
Let's go.

885
00:40:31,031 --> 00:40:32,368
While we have electricity,

886
00:40:32,369 --> 00:40:34,099
we should all charge our portable chargers.

887
00:40:34,539 --> 00:40:37,368
You're right. Having electricity means we can charge things.

888
00:40:37,369 --> 00:40:38,369
We have to charge them while we can.

889
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:39,380
(Planner Kwak lets his brothers know about charging their electronics.)

890
00:40:40,539 --> 00:40:42,339
- The food was so good. - It really was.

891
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,349
(The Renters come outside to wash the dishes.)

892
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,679
(Staring)

893
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:49,289
Juri, good morning.

894
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:50,619
Good morning.

895
00:40:53,789 --> 00:40:54,789
How are you?

896
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:56,359
- I'm good. How are you? - Good.

897
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,429
Good morning.

898
00:40:58,530 --> 00:40:59,558
Good morning.

899
00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:00,828
(They greet Juri as fellow villagers.)

900
00:41:00,829 --> 00:41:01,860
Good morning.

901
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:04,969
What's Juri doing?

902
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:08,268
(It seems like...)

903
00:41:08,269 --> 00:41:09,939
(he's doing household chores.)

904
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:12,269
What's Juri doing?

905
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:15,579
- He's doing that with water. - I see.

906
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,980
Yes, I'm washing carpet.

907
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,118
(Come to think of it, every house they've stayed in so far...)

908
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:27,659
(had carpets on the floor.)

909
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,559
(Carpets are essential in Lapland because of the long winter.)

910
00:41:31,389 --> 00:41:35,559
(There's a public wash place for carpets by the lake.)

911
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,468
(In the summer, when the sun is bright, )

912
00:41:39,469 --> 00:41:41,699
(everyone washes their carpets.)

913
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:43,569
(The weather is nice and the sun is out.)

914
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:46,840
(So today is carpet-washing day.)

915
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:50,308
(Everyone in the neighborhood is washing their carpets.)

916
00:41:50,309 --> 00:41:51,408
- That's nice. - We should try it.

917
00:41:51,409 --> 00:41:52,480
All right, let's do it.

918
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:53,879
(They take the carpets from their rented house...)

919
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,690
(and bring them out to the front yard.)

920
00:41:57,489 --> 00:41:59,018
(They're now...)

921
00:41:59,019 --> 00:42:01,590
(doing household chores on their own.)

922
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,729
Dong Yeon, leave this to us.

923
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,300
(Carpet washing)

924
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,928
Can I go take a walk?

925
00:42:07,929 --> 00:42:09,229
- Yes, go take a walk. - I want to look around.

926
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,469
- Sure. - I'll be on my way then.

927
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:11,670
Leave this to me.

928
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:12,840
Thank you.

929
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,868
- Thank you, Juri. - Thank you.

930
00:42:14,869 --> 00:42:15,908
(Thanks to the generosity of the second oldest, )

931
00:42:15,909 --> 00:42:18,440
(Dong Yeon is free.)

932
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,609
We're washing this one and then those two, right?

933
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:21,638
Yes.

934
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:22,650
(They brought out all the carpets from their rented house.)

935
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:24,109
Let's see.

936
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:25,849
(They've only ever walked on carpets before.)

937
00:42:26,219 --> 00:42:28,750
This is amazing.

938
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:33,159
(Now that they're in a village, they can use equipment like this.)

939
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,218
(If they did this yesterday, )

940
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,530
(they would have had to wash the carpets with lake water.)

941
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:38,689
- Let's begin. - Okay.

942
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:41,159
(Dong Hwi and Eun Woo start washing their first-ever carpet!)

943
00:42:42,969 --> 00:42:44,199
Hey, this is fun.

944
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:46,968
(City Dong Hwi...)

945
00:42:46,969 --> 00:42:49,869
(now has fun doing household chores.)

946
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:53,539
(The equipment shoots out biodegradable soap water.)

947
00:42:54,539 --> 00:42:57,010
(It feels like they're relieving stress.)

948
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,050
Yes!

949
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:03,349
(The work suits him!)

950
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:06,289
(He meticulously washes the front and back of the carpet.)

951
00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:08,019
(Life is like laundry.)

952
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:09,260
Gosh.

953
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:11,759
I see.

954
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,260
(It may get dirty, but washing it will make it clean again.)

955
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:14,899
I got the hang of it now.

956
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:15,900
(Eun Woo is just watching Dong Hwi...)

957
00:43:15,901 --> 00:43:17,800
(because...)

958
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,900
(Dong Hwi is happy.)

959
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,400
Nice.

960
00:43:22,539 --> 00:43:24,639
(Goodness, it startled me.)

961
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:27,178
(The quiet village...)

962
00:43:27,179 --> 00:43:29,650
(is full of the sound of carpet-cleaning.)

963
00:43:31,409 --> 00:43:32,718
(As Eun Woo is watching...)

964
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:34,980
(his passionate brother...)

965
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:37,289
You kind of look like a firefighter.

966
00:43:37,349 --> 00:43:38,449
- I do? - Yes.

967
00:43:38,989 --> 00:43:41,420
(In that case!)

968
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,289
(The youngest brother added fuel to Dong Hwi's fiery passion.)

969
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,029
(Whether it's water or fire, )

970
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:49,159
(Dong Hwi finds a way to use it for making people laugh.)

971
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,500
It looks like you're extinguishing fire.

972
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:53,239
- Okay. - Yes.

973
00:43:53,469 --> 00:43:54,500
This one's complete.

974
00:43:55,139 --> 00:43:56,869
We should flip this over.

975
00:43:56,969 --> 00:43:57,969
I was about to.

976
00:43:58,909 --> 00:44:01,309
- Gosh, this is really heavy. - It's because it's wet.

977
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:02,510
It's very heavy.

978
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,880
- It's severely heavy. - Right?

979
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:09,079
- This isn't easy to flip. - We cleaned this and this.

980
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:11,989
(Dong Hwi is malfunctioning.)

981
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:13,589
(His passion is put on brakes at the idea of flipping the carpet.)

982
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:15,288
- It's quite heavy. - Right?

983
00:44:15,289 --> 00:44:16,328
Flipping it would be a workout.

984
00:44:16,329 --> 00:44:18,190
(Thinking)

985
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:20,399
(The former class president...)

986
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,159
(takes a closer look at the carpet.)

987
00:44:22,969 --> 00:44:24,929
How can we do this efficiently?

988
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:27,098
(Brainiac Cha...)

989
00:44:27,099 --> 00:44:29,639
(looks for an efficient way to flip the carpet.)

990
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:33,280
I'll...

991
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:35,610
- Lift the bottom? - Yes.

992
00:44:35,909 --> 00:44:37,078
(They pull on each end...)

993
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:39,519
(and spread out the carpet.)

994
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:42,619
And then what?

995
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:45,349
And you come here and lift this.

996
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:46,960
What?

997
00:44:47,889 --> 00:44:50,089
- No, don't let it fall off. - I'm not letting it fall off.

998
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:51,130
- You are? - Wait.

999
00:44:51,159 --> 00:44:53,730
What do you want us to do after this?

1000
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,098
- After this, - Yes.

1001
00:44:55,099 --> 00:44:56,099
(What I'm trying to do is...)

1002
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:57,170
You should...

1003
00:44:57,530 --> 00:44:59,739
run over here really fast and grab the front.

1004
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:01,468
(Run over there really fast...)

1005
00:45:01,469 --> 00:45:03,639
(and what?)

1006
00:45:03,769 --> 00:45:04,939
- You should... - Yes.

1007
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:06,110
- run over here really fast, - Yes.

1008
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:08,809
Come over to this side of the pole,

1009
00:45:08,909 --> 00:45:10,479
Go on the other side of this pole.

1010
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,480
And hold it.

1011
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:13,018
(Why?)

1012
00:45:13,019 --> 00:45:14,449
You want me to go up this pole?

1013
00:45:14,519 --> 00:45:15,519
(They're not communicating.)

1014
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,289
- No. - I move to the front.

1015
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:19,320
- And grab it. - I'm grabbing it.

1016
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:21,690
- Grab it. That's it. - I'm grabbing it.

1017
00:45:21,889 --> 00:45:23,889
Switch the hands you're holding each end with.

1018
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:24,989
Wait.

1019
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:28,359
- What? - Hey, wait.

1020
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,428
Eun Woo.

1021
00:45:29,429 --> 00:45:31,598
Let's put this down for a second.

1022
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:34,198
- It's too heavy, right? - Yes, let's put it down real quick.

1023
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:36,439
Hey. Let's put it down.

1024
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,440
(Dong Hwi gives up because of low muscular endurance.)

1025
00:45:37,441 --> 00:45:38,868
- Put it down for a second. - Put it down?

1026
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:39,879
Yes.

1027
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,739
(The city boys are missing their laundry apps.)

1028
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:44,609
(Meanwhile, )

1029
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:46,578
I finally got to go on a walk.

1030
00:45:46,579 --> 00:45:47,619
(the man of nature has been given some free time.)

1031
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:51,150
(What?)

1032
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:53,460
(Did the man of nature find something?)

1033
00:45:54,019 --> 00:45:55,090
This looks nice.

1034
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,459
(Dong Yeon's location)

1035
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:59,058
(A curious object...)

1036
00:45:59,059 --> 00:46:01,800
(and Dong Yeon's curious behavior)

1037
00:46:02,699 --> 00:46:03,929
- Look. - Okay.

1038
00:46:04,369 --> 00:46:06,468
Yes, we'll do it after we put it down like that.

1039
00:46:06,469 --> 00:46:09,039
- After we put it down? - Yes, that's it.

1040
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:11,739
(Gosh)

1041
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:13,709
(He rides around the ranch...)

1042
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:15,178
This is so cool.

1043
00:46:15,179 --> 00:46:16,750
(feeling pumped.)

1044
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:18,650
(A single bike...)

1045
00:46:18,651 --> 00:46:20,349
(is triggering a dopamine rush for him.)

1046
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:22,480
I should run away.

1047
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:26,158
Dong Hwi, you know my brother is called Dong Hwi too, right?

1048
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:28,190
(Dong Yeon suddenly decides to run away from the rented house.)

1049
00:46:29,389 --> 00:46:31,690
Gosh. This is so nice.

1050
00:46:33,059 --> 00:46:36,099
(He's getting a dopamine rush just because of 2 wheels.)

1051
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:39,538
(With clouds of dust behind him, )

1052
00:46:39,539 --> 00:46:42,940
(he rides toward the entrance of the village.)

1053
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:47,138
I have nothing to fear now!

1054
00:46:47,139 --> 00:46:48,239
(Since I have this bike, I have nothing to fear now!)

1055
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:50,479
(They couldn't find any signs of people...)

1056
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,780
(before.)

1057
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:56,150
(They just wanted to see human traces.)

1058
00:46:56,219 --> 00:46:57,589
(Dong Yeon's location, the location of the house)

1059
00:46:57,590 --> 00:46:59,249
(Dong Yeon missed seeing people.)

1060
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:02,219
(Now he's going to explore the village.)

1061
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:03,788
This is so nice.

1062
00:47:03,789 --> 00:47:06,530
(He's very excited from seeing the village with people.)

1063
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:08,159
(People)

1064
00:47:09,329 --> 00:47:12,500
(It's been a while since he breathed the same air as other people.)

1065
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:15,539
That house is so pretty.

1066
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:17,609
(Just looking at neighboring houses...)

1067
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:19,880
(is giving him chills.)

1068
00:47:20,039 --> 00:47:22,179
This is so nice.

1069
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:24,579
(He's enjoying looking around the village for the first time.)

1070
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:32,590
(Mr. Kwak is stepping hard on the pedals.)

1071
00:47:33,159 --> 00:47:36,119
(What does our village look like?)

1072
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:40,559
The weather is so nice.

1073
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:45,769
(He broke away for a brief moment to enjoy traveling on his own.)

1074
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:49,070
A family of reindeers.

1075
00:47:50,469 --> 00:47:52,110
Are you going to pass? I'll go then.

1076
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:53,739
Okay.

1077
00:47:58,309 --> 00:48:01,380
(The reindeers are running around freely.)

1078
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:03,789
They really look free.

1079
00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:09,388
(Dong Yeon sees something...)

1080
00:48:09,389 --> 00:48:11,889
(and parks the bike for a second.)

1081
00:48:12,429 --> 00:48:15,158
(What did he see?)

1082
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:17,469
(A family of swans)

1083
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,439
This is insane.

1084
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,900
(Welcome to our village.)

1085
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:25,340
I'll get going now. Sorry.

1086
00:48:28,409 --> 00:48:30,780
Gosh, this is insane.

1087
00:48:35,179 --> 00:48:36,589
This is so cool.

1088
00:48:36,590 --> 00:48:37,750
(The blue lake surrounds the village.)

1089
00:48:41,289 --> 00:48:43,059
(In awe)

1090
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:49,499
(He would have missed this view if he were in a car.)

1091
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,699
(He wouldn't have felt all these emotions if he were in a car.)

1092
00:48:58,969 --> 00:49:00,738
(Taking things slowly allowed him...)

1093
00:49:00,739 --> 00:49:02,109
This is so nice.

1094
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:04,849
(to appreciate this happiness.)

1095
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:11,650
I want to go further.

1096
00:49:12,989 --> 00:49:16,489
(He said that unconsciously.)

1097
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:20,729
(Drunk on freedom, )

1098
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:24,269
(he keeps going forward without thinking.)

1099
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:27,038
(The location of the house)

1100
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:28,268
(He's now...)

1101
00:49:28,269 --> 00:49:31,170
(more than 5km away from the house.)

1102
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:35,408
(He wanted to see the village.)

1103
00:49:35,409 --> 00:49:38,510
(Why is he heading to the forest now?)

1104
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:41,280
(Looking around)

1105
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:45,749
This looks like a lodging.

1106
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:46,860
(Gosh, this looks like a lodging.)

1107
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:50,489
(He spotted an old building.)

1108
00:49:51,159 --> 00:49:52,630
I want to go see it.

1109
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:57,129
(Drawn by his curiosity, )

1110
00:49:57,130 --> 00:49:59,800
(he enters the strange building.)

1111
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,900
(What is this place?)

1112
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:05,840
It's a school.

1113
00:50:06,409 --> 00:50:07,639
It's a school.

1114
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:11,179
The school is closed because there aren't any kids.

1115
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:14,448
(That means...)

1116
00:50:14,449 --> 00:50:17,119
(it's a closed school!)

1117
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:21,590
I can look around, right?

1118
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,058
(What is he fearlessly...)

1119
00:50:24,059 --> 00:50:27,400
(trying to do at a closed school?)

1120
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:31,070
(He decides to explore the closed school.)

1121
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:33,800
Is this building really not being used?

1122
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,039
It seems like it.

1123
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:40,039
Exploring a closed school.

1124
00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:42,209
(The time I rode a bike around the village I was in...)

1125
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:43,909
(and ended up exploring a closed school nearby)

1126
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:45,348
I'm so curious.

1127
00:50:45,349 --> 00:50:46,619
(I'm so curious.)

1128
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:50,690
(Dong Yeon is led by his curiosity rather than fear.)

1129
00:50:51,219 --> 00:50:53,219
(What?)

1130
00:50:53,489 --> 00:50:56,059
There are four buildings.

1131
00:50:57,789 --> 00:50:59,360
And there's something over there.

1132
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:01,799
(All of a sudden, he looks like he's in real estate.)

1133
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:02,960
The property is quite big.

1134
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:05,169
It would have been fun if they turned this into an accommodation.

1135
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:06,170
(A closed-school themed accommodation)

1136
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:08,900
What a waste.

1137
00:51:09,769 --> 00:51:12,210
The space is very nice.

1138
00:51:13,539 --> 00:51:14,739
It's time to head back.

1139
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:16,209
I don't want to go.

1140
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:18,780
(Since he's himself again, he should return to the house.)

1141
00:51:20,179 --> 00:51:21,319
(The two brothers are still wrestling with the carpet.)

1142
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,550
We'll hang it in the middle.

1143
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:24,589
Push it from where you are.

1144
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:25,649
(Push it from where you are.)

1145
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:26,860
Eun Woo.

1146
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,289
(Yes?)

1147
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:30,989
- You want me to push? - No, pull it.

1148
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:33,828
Pull it, please.

1149
00:51:33,829 --> 00:51:34,929
(Mischievous Eun Woo is a master of pushing and pulling.)

1150
00:51:35,159 --> 00:51:37,299
- I'll spray the water now. - Yes, go ahead.

1151
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:38,769
(They move on to the next carpet without taking a break.)

1152
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,368
(The cleaning perfectionist...)

1153
00:51:41,369 --> 00:51:44,139
(sprays water meticulously.)

1154
00:51:44,869 --> 00:51:46,039
Gosh, that's nice.

1155
00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:51,809
These will dry well since the sun is out today.

1156
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,880
(Gosh, the weather is perfect for carpet cleaning.)

1157
00:51:57,889 --> 00:51:59,019
Show me your hands!

1158
00:52:03,019 --> 00:52:05,090
(His forearm muscles are insane!)

1159
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,759
(Eun Woo is being so meticulous that...)

1160
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:11,030
(the water might even get rid of our emotional baggage.)

1161
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:13,199
We'll do the same thing as before.

1162
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:14,968
Should I flip this?

1163
00:52:14,969 --> 00:52:17,610
(They're focused on cleaning without even realizing the time.)

1164
00:52:18,769 --> 00:52:19,839
(They're finally coming to an end...)

1165
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:22,380
(with washing their carpets.)

1166
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,880
(These renters are more meticulous than they seem.)

1167
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:29,379
- The carpets look very good. Clean. - Thank you very much.

1168
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:30,920
You've done a great job.

1169
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:32,988
This is the last one?

1170
00:52:32,989 --> 00:52:34,319
- Yes, the last one. - Yes.

1171
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,658
- We have to flip it. - Yes, we have to flip it. Okay.

1172
00:52:36,659 --> 00:52:38,230
(All they have to do now is flip the carpet and finish up!)

1173
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:40,299
(Once again, they're faced with...)

1174
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:41,328
(the challenge of flipping the carpet.)

1175
00:52:41,329 --> 00:52:42,530
I do this.

1176
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,000
Yes, that's right.

1177
00:52:45,769 --> 00:52:47,969
Can I show you an easier way?

1178
00:52:48,469 --> 00:52:50,139
- Easier way? What's that? - Yes.

1179
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:51,268
What is he going to do?

1180
00:52:51,269 --> 00:52:53,039
(The carpet is too heavy.)

1181
00:52:53,239 --> 00:52:54,380
- Take this. - Yes.

1182
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:57,110
(Like this.)

1183
00:52:57,449 --> 00:53:00,149
(In an instant, )

1184
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:02,079
(the carpet flipped and the atmosphere changed.)

1185
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:06,420
(They are reminded of their embarrassing past.)

1186
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:08,018
Run over here really fast and grab the front.

1187
00:53:08,019 --> 00:53:10,260
Let's put this down for a second.

1188
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:11,388
That's it.

1189
00:53:11,389 --> 00:53:13,429
(The brothers are bowing their heads.)

1190
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,659
(Anyway)

1191
00:53:15,929 --> 00:53:18,500
After this, would you like to come?

1192
00:53:18,869 --> 00:53:21,670
(Their landlord is asking them to go somewhere with him.)

1193
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:23,198
Yes.

1194
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:25,368
(They accept without knowing where it is.)

1195
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:27,678
- Yes. We'd love to. - Okay, that's great.

1196
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:28,709
(The renters have to follow around the landlords...)

1197
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:29,739
(as they go about their day.)

1198
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:31,609
(Juri does everything around this village...)

1199
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:34,280
(and he has a special daily routine.)

1200
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,118
- Yes. - Okay. Very good.

1201
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:37,649
- Great. Great. - Very good.

1202
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:40,559
- I'll tell the other members. - Yes, that's great.

1203
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,089
(The others...)

1204
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:46,259
(are told of visiting the place.)

1205
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:48,500
(Did you hear?)

1206
00:53:48,699 --> 00:53:50,969
(Gosh, no way.)

1207
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:53,639
(They're going there?)

1208
00:53:54,039 --> 00:53:56,300
(That's strange.)

1209
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,610
(Goodness)

1210
00:53:58,309 --> 00:54:00,639
(I'm going to run away.)

1211
00:54:00,739 --> 00:54:02,909
Eun Woo, let's go.

1212
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,448
- Let's go. - All right.

1213
00:54:05,449 --> 00:54:07,780
(Dong Yeon and Je Hoon joined them after hearing the news.)

1214
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:10,649
- Okay, let's go this way. - Yes.

1215
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:11,789
(They get going to solve a mystery task in the village.)

1216
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:13,759
Here is our bus.

1217
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,090
(Here is the bus we'll be taking there.)

1218
00:54:15,559 --> 00:54:17,828
- Gosh, this is school. - So school.

1219
00:54:17,829 --> 00:54:19,389
(The village bus of this neighborhood is...)

1220
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:22,198
- The wheels are really big. - Look at those wheels.

1221
00:54:22,199 --> 00:54:24,199
It looks like Optimus Prime.

1222
00:54:25,099 --> 00:54:26,899
(The old tractor...)

1223
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:30,769
(has a graceful charisma.)

1224
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:33,479
(Lapland's cultivator...)

1225
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:36,239
(is on another scale.)

1226
00:54:36,679 --> 00:54:39,149
- We can sit on this. - Yes, these are stools.

1227
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,479
- These are stools? - These are stools.

1228
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,380
(Curious Je Hoon is excited.)

1229
00:54:42,449 --> 00:54:45,550
This is an old tractor, so this is a little bit...

1230
00:54:45,789 --> 00:54:46,888
(The wooden railing is shaky.)

1231
00:54:46,889 --> 00:54:48,018
- Will we be okay? - Sorry.

1232
00:54:48,019 --> 00:54:49,389
(The wooden railing is shaky.)

1233
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:51,089
It's sturdy.

1234
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:52,229
This is sturdy?

1235
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:54,158
Well, it's... Yes.

1236
00:54:54,159 --> 00:54:55,198
- It seems okay. - I'm worried.

1237
00:54:55,199 --> 00:54:58,129
(Their opinions are wavering from the start.)

1238
00:54:58,130 --> 00:55:00,299
(Engine on)

1239
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:01,968
Yes, let's go.

1240
00:55:01,969 --> 00:55:03,069
Okay.

1241
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:05,170
(There's no going back now!)

1242
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:09,039
(They head off to the mystery location.)

1243
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:12,448
(Like gentle sheep, )

1244
00:55:12,449 --> 00:55:15,679
(they are sitting on the hay stools.)

1245
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:20,119
- The ride isn't uncomfortable... - It's not bad.

1246
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:22,018
As I thought it would be.

1247
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:24,059
(The ride is smooth but they have a bad feeling about this.)

1248
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:29,730
(They're being taken on the tractor without any information.)

1249
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,429
(Vroom)

1250
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,569
There's exhaust.

1251
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:36,809
(They're all covering their noses against the smoky exhaust.)

1252
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:39,339
(Uncovering his nose)

1253
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:41,039
This is a manly smell.

1254
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:43,109
The smell of men's cologne.

1255
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:44,980
(Real men don't try to avoid it!)

1256
00:55:45,409 --> 00:55:46,849
Men's air freshener.

1257
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:52,190
(They enter the road with the real man in the back.)

1258
00:55:52,489 --> 00:55:56,320
(Where is this bus going to stop?)

1259
00:55:57,260 --> 00:55:59,389
(Looking around)

1260
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:02,459
(In the village in the middle of nowhere in Lapland, )

1261
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:04,299
It's quite far away.

1262
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:05,829
(what could be Juri's most important daily routine?)

1263
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:09,469
(Where are they headed?)

1264
00:56:10,409 --> 00:56:12,868
(Juri turns right at an alley.)

1265
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:14,238
It's a neighboring house.

1266
00:56:14,239 --> 00:56:15,279
(A neighboring house?)

1267
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,440
Nice.

1268
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:20,149
(Before, we used to be the only people...)

1269
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:22,219
(in the 20km radius.)

1270
00:56:23,449 --> 00:56:27,089
(They finally get to meet neighbors for the first time!)

1271
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:28,419
Nice driver.

1272
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:29,788
(They finally get to meet neighbors for the first time!)

1273
00:56:29,789 --> 00:56:31,589
(It was written on the bottom of their invitation.)

1274
00:56:31,590 --> 00:56:35,300
"P.S., everyone in the village is waiting to see you."

1275
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,429
(Actually, the village of Kemijarvi is...)

1276
00:56:39,769 --> 00:56:42,768
(is a very close-knit community...)

1277
00:56:42,769 --> 00:56:47,110
(where people help each other with everything.)

1278
00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:50,109
- Okay. Let's go. - Okay.

1279
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:51,579
Let's see if he's home.

1280
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:57,448
Arno.

1281
00:56:57,449 --> 00:57:00,089
(Juri goes inside the neighbor's house to say hi.)

1282
00:57:00,090 --> 00:57:01,260
Hello.

1283
00:57:02,289 --> 00:57:04,029
(But...)

1284
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:05,788
(what...)

1285
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:10,199
(are they here to do?)

1286
00:57:10,429 --> 00:57:13,698
(They may not know the reason, but they do need one thing.)

1287
00:57:13,699 --> 00:57:15,940
- Is this smile okay? - It's nice.

1288
00:57:16,239 --> 00:57:17,439
That smile makes you look like you have a nice personality.

1289
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,469
(That nice smile is perfect.)

1290
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:19,739
I'm all set.

1291
00:57:21,039 --> 00:57:22,109
He said, "I'm all set."

1292
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:23,238
(Dong Hwi is quite nervous to meet a neighbor for the first time.)

1293
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:25,210
- I'll tell you if this shakes. - Okay.

1294
00:57:27,650 --> 00:57:30,388
(Arno, their neighbor, is finally making his appearance.)

1295
00:57:30,389 --> 00:57:31,889
- Hi. - Here is Arno.

1296
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:33,489
- Hello. - Hello.

1297
00:57:33,690 --> 00:57:35,360
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

1298
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:37,388
(They must be the young men that moved in recently.)

1299
00:57:37,389 --> 00:57:40,598
These men are willing to help you...

1300
00:57:40,599 --> 00:57:42,199
with the harvesting.

1301
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:44,299
(The reason they're here...)

1302
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:49,639
(is to harvest?)

1303
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:51,968
Yes, this is our field.

1304
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:55,579
(Juri spends his time helping the village elderly on their farms.)

1305
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,179
- This is rye? - Rye.

1306
00:57:58,849 --> 00:58:01,880
(Koreans have rice. The Finnish have rye.)

1307
00:58:02,719 --> 00:58:06,090
(The reason harvesting the rye is an urgent matter)

1308
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:10,230
Last autumn, when they grew just a little bit,

1309
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:13,658
the reindeers came and ate everything.

1310
00:58:13,659 --> 00:58:16,359
- So these are like a miracle here. - Okay.

1311
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,530
(These are the only remaining rye.)

1312
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:20,670
(What? There's leftover rye?)

1313
00:58:21,139 --> 00:58:24,739
(I hear they have rye there!)

1314
00:58:25,269 --> 00:58:28,638
(If you leave any, we'll eat them all up!)

1315
00:58:28,639 --> 00:58:32,780
(We have to cut the plants before the reindeers eat them!)

1316
00:58:32,909 --> 00:58:35,078
It's easy. Very easy.

1317
00:58:35,079 --> 00:58:36,250
It's easy?

1318
00:58:36,619 --> 00:58:38,118
But I don't know.

1319
00:58:38,119 --> 00:58:40,119
(It's easy for me, but I don't know about you.)

1320
00:58:40,219 --> 00:58:41,590
I can't believe I'm holding a sickle.

1321
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:43,360
Goodness.

1322
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:45,289
Be careful. They are sharp.

1323
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:46,760
We have to be careful.

1324
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:49,959
Our backs are going to hurt so much today.

1325
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,368
- Right. - Let's go.

1326
00:58:51,369 --> 00:58:54,138
All right. Let's work our rent off!

1327
00:58:54,139 --> 00:58:55,300
Let's go!

1328
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:57,638
(They suit up...)

1329
00:58:57,639 --> 00:59:00,639
(and brace themselves.)

1330
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:02,908
Okay. We can do anything.

1331
00:59:02,909 --> 00:59:04,380
Okay. Yes.

1332
00:59:05,079 --> 00:59:08,250
(Exchange of labor is common in this neighborhood.)

1333
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:10,349
Okay. We can do anything.

1334
00:59:10,449 --> 00:59:11,690
Sure.

1335
00:59:11,949 --> 00:59:12,949
Yes.

1336
00:59:14,019 --> 00:59:15,259
Do we start?

1337
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,359
- Yes. - Like this.

1338
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:18,988
(Cutting)

1339
00:59:18,989 --> 00:59:20,029
Okay.

1340
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:21,329
(It's easy, right?)

1341
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:22,500
I see.

1342
00:59:22,501 --> 00:59:23,559
(He learns how by watching.)

1343
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:25,929
So, I just have to do it like this.

1344
00:59:29,869 --> 00:59:34,980
(The former city boys are enthusiastic about farming.)

1345
00:59:35,239 --> 00:59:37,779
I personally love rye bread.

1346
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:38,948
- Rye bread is good. - Yes.

1347
00:59:38,949 --> 00:59:40,178
It has such a nice texture.

1348
00:59:40,179 --> 00:59:43,150
Before the reindeers have it,

1349
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:44,749
let's reap it first...

1350
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:46,389
- For us to have it. - That's right.

1351
00:59:47,090 --> 00:59:49,460
This fight is about who eats it first.

1352
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:50,730
You're right.

1353
00:59:52,059 --> 00:59:54,029
Whether the reindeers or people have it first.

1354
00:59:54,030 --> 00:59:55,058
That's right.

1355
00:59:55,059 --> 00:59:56,130
(We'll protect the rye farm of our village ourselves.)

1356
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:58,769
How do I say, "Let's go," in Finnish?

1357
00:59:59,269 --> 01:00:00,999
- "Mennaan." - "Mennaan."

1358
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,699
- "Mennaan." - "Mennaan."

1359
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,269
(Okay, got it.)

1360
01:00:04,409 --> 01:00:05,469
Mennaan.

1361
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:07,280
Mennaan.

1362
01:00:07,539 --> 01:00:09,980
(Go where, though?)

1363
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,578
- Dong Yeon is like... - Mennaan.

1364
01:00:12,579 --> 01:00:14,880
A fish in water. He loves this job.

1365
01:00:15,019 --> 01:00:16,879
He has a vocation for this job.

1366
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,049
(He's found his second job in Finland.)

1367
01:00:18,050 --> 01:00:20,860
I think I should get a weekend farm or something.

1368
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:23,589
It clears my mind. I love it.

1369
01:00:23,590 --> 01:00:25,389
(He's totally satisfied with the work.)

1370
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:31,429
(Another guy is quietly reaping from afar.)

1371
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:33,269
(Cutting)

1372
01:00:33,429 --> 01:00:34,500
Gosh.

1373
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:35,800
(Cutting)

1374
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:38,408
Goodness.

1375
01:00:38,409 --> 01:00:40,739
(One shot, one kill)

1376
01:00:41,739 --> 01:00:44,710
(This city boy finds it unexpectedly to his liking.)

1377
01:00:44,909 --> 01:00:46,849
Dong Hwi looks like...

1378
01:00:47,349 --> 01:00:49,349
as if he had farmed here for tens of years.

1379
01:00:50,019 --> 01:00:51,420
He looks so local, doesn't he?

1380
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:53,960
- You mean, Dong Hwi? - You're right.

1381
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:55,919
This is stress-releasing.

1382
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,429
- It's not bad, right? - Yes.

1383
01:00:58,630 --> 01:01:00,288
It totally releases my stress.

1384
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:03,769
(Focusing on reaping fascinatingly gets rid of distracting thoughts.)

1385
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:07,070
(Sparkly eyes)

1386
01:01:07,869 --> 01:01:11,110
(The eldest member likes new challenges.)

1387
01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:15,280
(He's releasing his stress too.)

1388
01:01:16,539 --> 01:01:18,250
I've never expected...

1389
01:01:18,409 --> 01:01:20,820
I'd reap some rye here in Finland.

1390
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:22,320
I know.

1391
01:01:22,321 --> 01:01:24,789
(Eun Woo was all enthusiastic.)

1392
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:26,448
It's getting plucked by the root.

1393
01:01:26,449 --> 01:01:27,920
(He's plucking it instead of cutting it.)

1394
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:34,129
(Je Hoon laughs at Eun Woo.)

1395
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:37,670
(But he's literally plucking it as a whole.)

1396
01:01:37,929 --> 01:01:41,238
Gosh, look. It got plucked by the root.

1397
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:42,969
(Maybe he's planning to replant it somewhere else.)

1398
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:47,139
(The young men are slowly getting tired.)

1399
01:01:47,210 --> 01:01:50,179
(Gosh, my back hurts.)

1400
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:52,510
Farming isn't easy.

1401
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,550
I know. It's so tough.

1402
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:56,650
- Je Hoon. - What?

1403
01:01:57,489 --> 01:01:59,289
- Let me show you something funny. - What is it?

1404
01:01:59,389 --> 01:02:01,260
(Something funny?)

1405
01:02:04,789 --> 01:02:08,130
(Is it Dong Hwi or a scarecrow?)

1406
01:02:11,170 --> 01:02:12,198
(Mr. Scarecrow can even tell good farming jokes.)

1407
01:02:12,199 --> 01:02:14,340
We need that.

1408
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:16,739
He's totally like a scarecrow.

1409
01:02:17,369 --> 01:02:18,539
It's working.

1410
01:02:20,110 --> 01:02:21,809
- No birds. - Right, no birds.

1411
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:26,449
(They're recharged thanks to Mr. Scarecrow.)

1412
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:29,749
(From a bird's eye view, it's even harder to tell the difference.)

1413
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:31,590
He's totally like a scarecrow.

1414
01:02:32,789 --> 01:02:36,260
(Let's cheer up and work together.)

1415
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:38,658
Can you teach me just one more time?

1416
01:02:38,659 --> 01:02:39,730
Of course.

1417
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:44,099
What?

1418
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:45,969
What is it?

1419
01:02:49,139 --> 01:02:50,139
(A sudden bell sound)

1420
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:51,369
He's ringing a bell.

1421
01:02:51,570 --> 01:02:53,468
(Arno shows up as he rings a bell.)

1422
01:02:53,469 --> 01:02:54,539
Okay.

1423
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:56,539
What's this sign?

1424
01:02:57,079 --> 01:02:58,679
(Everyone's confused.)

1425
01:02:59,449 --> 01:03:02,650
It's time for a break.

1426
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:04,419
Oh, a break.

1427
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:05,919
- A break? - A break time.

1428
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:08,090
- Oh, a break time. - It's the only thing I understood.

1429
01:03:08,289 --> 01:03:10,859
Come here and eat.

1430
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:12,530
- Oh, eat. Good. - Okay. Something to eat.

1431
01:03:12,889 --> 01:03:14,598
- Okay. - It's time for snacks.

1432
01:03:14,599 --> 01:03:16,199
Snacks!

1433
01:03:17,369 --> 01:03:19,029
Will there be makgeolli?

1434
01:03:19,030 --> 01:03:21,269
(When you have snacks at a farm, you've got to have makgeolli.)

1435
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:22,799
- Nice. - Yes.

1436
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,769
- Let's go have snacks. - Let's go.

1437
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:27,380
- Okay. - The work has made me hungry.

1438
01:03:28,210 --> 01:03:29,808
(The Finnish-style snack is...)

1439
01:03:29,809 --> 01:03:31,909
- Hot dogs. - Hot dogs! No way.

1440
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:34,749
- My gosh. - This is insane.

1441
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:35,820
(The Finnish-style snack is hot dog.)

1442
01:03:35,949 --> 01:03:38,389
- I'm losing my mind. - Goodness.

1443
01:03:38,489 --> 01:03:39,848
They have everything there is.

1444
01:03:39,849 --> 01:03:42,559
- Right. - I guess in Finland, people have...

1445
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,988
hot dogs for a snack in the middle of farming.

1446
01:03:44,989 --> 01:03:46,090
This is unique.

1447
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:48,230
It's so long.

1448
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,929
It's warm. I guess it was just cooked.

1449
01:03:50,969 --> 01:03:52,768
(For the young men here to help out)

1450
01:03:52,769 --> 01:03:54,999
- It's a nice habit. - Right.

1451
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,439
(The village elder has prepared the snack.)

1452
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:58,869
This sausage is good.

1453
01:03:59,139 --> 01:04:02,409
(Help yourselves, young men.)

1454
01:04:03,079 --> 01:04:05,408
- You're all enjoying it. - It's good.

1455
01:04:05,409 --> 01:04:07,179
It means you worked hard.

1456
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:09,549
It's good.

1457
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:11,149
(It's their first snack at a neighbor's house...)

1458
01:04:11,150 --> 01:04:12,719
(after exchanging labor.)

1459
01:04:14,519 --> 01:04:16,118
(The unspoken affection raises their appetite.)

1460
01:04:16,119 --> 01:04:17,429
- It's to die for. - I know.

1461
01:04:17,659 --> 01:04:19,230
- It's good. - Oh, no.

1462
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:21,559
I feel like we're at an amusement park.

1463
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:25,030
And to have it in the middle of work,

1464
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:26,768
- it tastes so good indeed. - Of course.

1465
01:04:26,769 --> 01:04:28,000
(It tastes amazing to have a snack in the middle of work.)

1466
01:04:28,769 --> 01:04:29,969
Anything tastes good if you do physical labor.

1467
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:35,380
This is what happiness is.

1468
01:04:35,539 --> 01:04:37,210
Working hard and eating delicious food.

1469
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:39,849
It's nice.

1470
01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:41,949
I'm having the second one soon.

1471
01:04:42,579 --> 01:04:43,579
Isn't this like a tangerine?

1472
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:45,190
(He got some on his shirt.)

1473
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:46,719
How sloppy.

1474
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:48,519
Who's such a high-maintenance?

1475
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:50,789
- You. - Yes, right.

1476
01:04:53,489 --> 01:04:54,559
Who's next?

1477
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:56,360
- Je Hoon. - Je Hoon.

1478
01:04:57,199 --> 01:04:59,699
(Dong Brothers hit it off quite well.)

1479
01:04:59,769 --> 01:05:01,599
(Embarrassed)

1480
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,199
How nice.

1481
01:05:05,139 --> 01:05:06,639
In Korea,

1482
01:05:07,239 --> 01:05:09,739
time passes the same and quickly.

1483
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:12,179
But it goes so hectically...

1484
01:05:12,349 --> 01:05:14,179
that I realize it only afterward.

1485
01:05:15,349 --> 01:05:17,549
But here, I space out and enjoy...

1486
01:05:17,550 --> 01:05:18,589
- the leisure. - Right.

1487
01:05:18,590 --> 01:05:19,849
(They're still busy, but they feel a sense of leisure.)

1488
01:05:21,559 --> 01:05:24,328
(When they wake up in the morning, )

1489
01:05:24,329 --> 01:05:30,829
(they take care of the family members.)

1490
01:05:31,429 --> 01:05:35,170
(They do house chores under the warm sunlight.)

1491
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:40,369
(And they share their daily lives with their neighbors.)

1492
01:05:40,940 --> 01:05:44,309
(Staring)

1493
01:05:45,409 --> 01:05:46,550
How nice.

1494
01:05:47,349 --> 01:05:49,078
I'm full.

1495
01:05:49,079 --> 01:05:51,349
(They're busy all day, but they often look at nature before them.)

1496
01:05:51,550 --> 01:05:53,090
We unexpectedly spend little time using our phones.

1497
01:05:54,719 --> 01:05:56,819
- I happen to disregard it. - Right.

1498
01:05:56,820 --> 01:05:58,159
(The void of the Internet has opened a new time for them.)

1499
01:05:59,090 --> 01:06:01,029
(Spacing out in nature, )

1500
01:06:01,030 --> 01:06:04,130
(they feel the sunshine.)

1501
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:09,098
(They're taking their own measures...)

1502
01:06:09,099 --> 01:06:14,510
(to find composure.)

1503
01:06:14,639 --> 01:06:15,940
I don't even check the time.

1504
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:18,479
- Same here. - From one moment.

1505
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:19,650
Same here.

1506
01:06:21,079 --> 01:06:22,119
You're right.

1507
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,489
I keep looking at my watch because I have to cook.

1508
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:27,389
We have to eat soon.

1509
01:06:27,519 --> 01:06:29,419
You have to do it even if no one else does.

1510
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:30,488
You're an exception.

1511
01:06:30,489 --> 01:06:32,730
(If you don't, we'll all be starved.)

1512
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:35,359
While we were helping Juri...

1513
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:37,799
- clean the carpet, - What about it?

1514
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:42,299
We heard that the villagers were gathering for a party.

1515
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:43,839
- Really? - Yes.

1516
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:46,409
I'm throwing a party in the evening.

1517
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:48,439
- What? - Would you like to come?

1518
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:50,380
- A party in the evening? - In the evening.

1519
01:06:50,949 --> 01:06:53,179
It's going to be a potluck party...

1520
01:06:53,679 --> 01:06:55,479
with our neighbors.

1521
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:56,819
- We'd love it. - Gosh.

1522
01:06:56,820 --> 01:06:58,788
All the villagers are coming for a party?

1523
01:06:58,789 --> 01:07:00,488
- Okay? - Yes.

1524
01:07:00,489 --> 01:07:02,189
- Okay. - We'd love to.

1525
01:07:02,190 --> 01:07:04,089
- Very good. - We'll talk to the others.

1526
01:07:04,090 --> 01:07:05,130
Okay.

1527
01:07:05,489 --> 01:07:07,189
Are we invited?

1528
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:08,630
Yes, he's invited us.

1529
01:07:09,199 --> 01:07:13,199
What should we bring to the party?

1530
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:15,669
Hardly anyone of them might have had Korean food before.

1531
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:16,840
Probably.

1532
01:07:19,409 --> 01:07:21,138
This is tough.

1533
01:07:21,139 --> 01:07:23,210
(They're flustered, wondering what to make to eat with others.)

1534
01:07:23,809 --> 01:07:25,809
Should we make bulgogi?

1535
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:28,119
- They might love it. - But...

1536
01:07:28,719 --> 01:07:31,389
the sauce has to be made deliciously.

1537
01:07:31,690 --> 01:07:33,089
- Can you... - I can do that.

1538
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:34,659
- Dong Yeon can do it. - Goodness.

1539
01:07:35,019 --> 01:07:37,260
I have an idea.

1540
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:40,288
You know chili pepper japchae with Chinese flower buns,

1541
01:07:40,289 --> 01:07:41,460
- right? - Yes.

1542
01:07:41,699 --> 01:07:43,928
- It's like a fusion dish. - Right.

1543
01:07:43,929 --> 01:07:46,499
It has bread and japchae.

1544
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:47,969
- Right. - It's not bad.

1545
01:07:49,670 --> 01:07:51,309
What should I make?

1546
01:07:55,639 --> 01:07:56,839
- Any ideas? - First...

1547
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:58,250
(Dong Yeon, what do I do?)

1548
01:07:59,050 --> 01:08:00,650
(Looking away)

1549
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,579
(Eun Woo?)

1550
01:08:03,679 --> 01:08:04,949
First...

1551
01:08:06,789 --> 01:08:09,420
Don't you need help with making bulgogi?

1552
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:11,388
Yesterday...

1553
01:08:11,389 --> 01:08:13,329
But it requires a lot of cutting.

1554
01:08:14,159 --> 01:08:16,760
I'll try to clean the vegetables...

1555
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:20,130
nicely and neatly.

1556
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:23,368
How about this? We have zucchinis.

1557
01:08:23,369 --> 01:08:24,409
Right.

1558
01:08:24,569 --> 01:08:25,839
You can make jeon with those.

1559
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:27,539
- With flour? - Yes.

1560
01:08:27,710 --> 01:08:30,809
Korean pizza and bulgogi.

1561
01:08:30,810 --> 01:08:32,050
Korean pizza is a good idea.

1562
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:33,210
Okay.

1563
01:08:34,279 --> 01:08:36,079
We're busy today.

1564
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:38,149
We better go and get started in a hurry.

1565
01:08:38,189 --> 01:08:40,119
- Okay. - Okay.

1566
01:08:40,489 --> 01:08:43,260
Now that we're stuffed, let's finish it up.

1567
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:44,488
- Okay. - All right.

1568
01:08:44,489 --> 01:08:45,759
Let's go.

1569
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:46,930
- Yes. - Let's go.

1570
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:48,499
Mennaan!

1571
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,500
(Let's go finish it up.)

1572
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:51,869
Mennaan!

1573
01:08:53,069 --> 01:08:57,439
(The neighbor's snack has boosted their energy and speed.)

1574
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:59,539
(They give all their might until the end.)

1575
01:08:59,710 --> 01:09:01,979
We're practically wiping out this field.

1576
01:09:02,579 --> 01:09:03,680
As expected,

1577
01:09:04,010 --> 01:09:06,408
it takes fast for us to work together.

1578
01:09:06,409 --> 01:09:09,020
(Are they good enough to be accepted as villagers?)

1579
01:09:09,779 --> 01:09:13,350
(The young men have gotten attached to the village's rye field.)

1580
01:09:13,489 --> 01:09:15,688
(The rye is getting piled up.)

1581
01:09:15,689 --> 01:09:17,560
- We've harvested so much. - I know.

1582
01:09:18,859 --> 01:09:19,960
We're almost done.

1583
01:09:20,329 --> 01:09:21,399
Are we almost done?

1584
01:09:21,529 --> 01:09:23,960
- I think we're almost done. - Right?

1585
01:09:25,970 --> 01:09:27,368
It's nice and neat.

1586
01:09:27,369 --> 01:09:30,399
(The field has become nice and neat after 2 hours of work.)

1587
01:09:31,310 --> 01:09:33,469
(Their first exchange of labor as part of the village...)

1588
01:09:33,470 --> 01:09:35,108
(is of success.)

1589
01:09:35,109 --> 01:09:36,279
All done.

1590
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:39,608
(Thank you for coming to our village.)

1591
01:09:39,609 --> 01:09:41,379
- Thank you very much. - Thank you.

1592
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:43,778
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1593
01:09:43,779 --> 01:09:44,788
Thank you.

1594
01:09:44,789 --> 01:09:45,819
Good job.

1595
01:09:46,090 --> 01:09:48,119
- Good job. - Good job.

1596
01:09:48,590 --> 01:09:50,658
You should go back.

1597
01:09:50,659 --> 01:09:52,390
- Let's go back. - Let's go back.

1598
01:09:53,289 --> 01:09:54,429
Okay, let's go.

1599
01:09:54,430 --> 01:09:55,759
- Okay. Oh, right. - Okay.

1600
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:56,760
(They have to ride the tractor back to the house now.)

1601
01:09:56,761 --> 01:09:58,569
- So... - Can you teach me?

1602
01:09:58,670 --> 01:09:59,770
- Yes. - Yes?

1603
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,898
I've only driven ones with automatic gear.

1604
01:10:02,899 --> 01:10:03,899
(The model young man wants to try all the village chores himself.)

1605
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:05,738
- I'm not sure if I can do it. - Okay.

1606
01:10:05,739 --> 01:10:08,608
- You can climb on there. - Yes.

1607
01:10:08,609 --> 01:10:09,879
- Okay. - Here.

1608
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:10,880
From here.

1609
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:11,880
(He excitedly gets on the driver's seat.)

1610
01:10:11,881 --> 01:10:13,909
Just...

1611
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:16,978
It won't suddenly take off, right?

1612
01:10:16,979 --> 01:10:18,149
No.

1613
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:20,619
- I haven't started the engine yet. - Okay.

1614
01:10:20,819 --> 01:10:22,020
Okay.

1615
01:10:23,489 --> 01:10:25,260
I feel uneasy about his driving.

1616
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:28,260
He won't get it trapped in a ditch, will he?

1617
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:31,028
Maybe he took the plunge to do this.

1618
01:10:31,029 --> 01:10:33,029
(The younger members are anxious because...)

1619
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:36,038
(Je Hoon, do you have clear visibility?)

1620
01:10:36,039 --> 01:10:37,299
(Should I turn on the wipers for you?)

1621
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:38,770
(I hardly turn them on.)

1622
01:10:38,909 --> 01:10:40,840
(All wet)

1623
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:44,039
(He stunned them with the wipers on a rainy day.)

1624
01:10:45,979 --> 01:10:47,549
(Wait. Is this not the right direction?)

1625
01:10:47,550 --> 01:10:49,919
(You just circled around the place.)

1626
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:51,648
(Embarrassed)

1627
01:10:51,649 --> 01:10:54,489
(How did you drive in "Taxi Driver?")

1628
01:10:54,659 --> 01:10:57,288
(Every time he took the wheel, )

1629
01:10:57,289 --> 01:11:01,229
(he made the younger members anxious.)

1630
01:11:01,630 --> 01:11:03,198
- This is a clutch. - A clutch.

1631
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:04,260
Yes.

1632
01:11:04,529 --> 01:11:05,770
This is the brakes.

1633
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:07,398
- The brakes? - Yes.

1634
01:11:07,399 --> 01:11:11,169
This one is the gas pedal.

1635
01:11:11,170 --> 01:11:12,170
(Super focused)

1636
01:11:12,210 --> 01:11:20,210
(The passengers are singing to soothe their anxiety.)

1637
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:25,750
- This is the best ever. - Yes.

1638
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:28,259
- Very good. - Let's go.

1639
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:29,289
(He's determined to show how cool he can be this time.)

1640
01:11:33,229 --> 01:11:35,899
(Where is he going?)

1641
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:37,800
Wait. The house.

1642
01:11:39,369 --> 01:11:40,529
Why is this going back?

1643
01:11:40,869 --> 01:11:42,140
Where's the clutch?

1644
01:11:42,699 --> 01:11:43,969
Let's go.

1645
01:11:43,970 --> 01:11:45,309
(He's the most startled one here.)

1646
01:11:45,310 --> 01:11:46,340
Why is it going back?

1647
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:49,680
Je Hoon, is everything okay?

1648
01:11:50,409 --> 01:11:53,510
(The passengers are getting even more anxious.)

1649
01:11:53,909 --> 01:11:55,149
I'm a bit scared.

1650
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,719
If he rams into something,

1651
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:00,089
I'll step on this and jump.

1652
01:12:00,090 --> 01:12:01,159
Me too.

1653
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:03,618
I'll just lie down.

1654
01:12:03,619 --> 01:12:05,260
(The younger members are thinking of ways to save themselves.)

1655
01:12:05,890 --> 01:12:08,728
(He finally notices that it's in reverse.)

1656
01:12:08,729 --> 01:12:10,130
This is one.

1657
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:12,169
- Left and down. - Two.

1658
01:12:12,170 --> 01:12:13,170
Yes.

1659
01:12:13,729 --> 01:12:15,238
Okay. I'll go.

1660
01:12:15,239 --> 01:12:17,139
(The engine is started again.)

1661
01:12:17,140 --> 01:12:19,709
- Now... - Mennaan.

1662
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:21,479
(Will it work this time?)

1663
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:23,939
Let's go.

1664
01:12:24,279 --> 01:12:25,510
Oh, yes.

1665
01:12:25,579 --> 01:12:26,908
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1666
01:12:26,909 --> 01:12:29,049
(It rattles greatly, )

1667
01:12:29,050 --> 01:12:31,089
(but the tractor begins to move.)

1668
01:12:31,090 --> 01:12:34,220
- Goodness. - To the left.

1669
01:12:34,250 --> 01:12:35,760
Let's go, deluxe taxi.

1670
01:12:35,789 --> 01:12:37,859
I don't think this is a deluxe taxi.

1671
01:12:39,930 --> 01:12:42,599
I can't believe I'm driving a tractor here.

1672
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:43,600
(He's excited to get the tractor going.)

1673
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:45,169
(But...)

1674
01:12:45,170 --> 01:12:48,800
(The speed can't be measured.)

1675
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:50,140
(It's really slow unlike how excited he is.)

1676
01:12:50,141 --> 01:12:51,470
I'm a little bit scared.

1677
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:53,408
"A little bit."

1678
01:12:53,409 --> 01:12:56,439
You shouldn't have given him the wheel.

1679
01:12:57,279 --> 01:12:59,978
- A bit more gas. - He's getting it.

1680
01:12:59,979 --> 01:13:01,549
(Gas? Okay.)

1681
01:13:01,550 --> 01:13:03,778
(Turning the booster on)

1682
01:13:03,779 --> 01:13:05,250
Help!

1683
01:13:05,819 --> 01:13:07,050
Okay, let's go.

1684
01:13:12,789 --> 01:13:14,828
(He forces himself to smile, )

1685
01:13:14,829 --> 01:13:17,500
(but he looks tensed up.)

1686
01:13:18,699 --> 01:13:21,300
(Dong Brothers are almost clinging to the tractor.)

1687
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:22,770
Juri is holding it tightly too.

1688
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:25,869
I'm also a little bit worried.

1689
01:13:27,909 --> 01:13:30,538
He understood Korean.

1690
01:13:30,539 --> 01:13:33,180
(He can tell by looking at the same postures.)

1691
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:39,189
(A forked road appears.)

1692
01:13:39,590 --> 01:13:40,819
Gosh, he might get it stuck.

1693
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:42,060
A left turn.

1694
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:45,960
(Uneasy at the forked road)

1695
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:47,288
He didn't.

1696
01:13:47,289 --> 01:13:50,529
(He's managed to change directions.)

1697
01:13:50,930 --> 01:13:52,929
Easy.

1698
01:13:52,930 --> 01:13:54,269
(The deluxe tractor is in operation.)

1699
01:13:54,270 --> 01:13:55,500
Easy.

1700
01:13:55,770 --> 01:13:58,270
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1701
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:04,409
(He sings to cheer his boss.)

1702
01:14:04,850 --> 01:14:07,209
Okay. Maybe I can relax a bit.

1703
01:14:07,210 --> 01:14:09,050
- Yes. - Now.

1704
01:14:09,149 --> 01:14:10,478
Now, relax.

1705
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:11,890
(His shoulders are stiff.)

1706
01:14:12,489 --> 01:14:15,658
Are you and your wife...

1707
01:14:15,659 --> 01:14:18,288
allergic to anything?

1708
01:14:18,289 --> 01:14:21,130
Because we're going to prepare some food...

1709
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:23,198
- for the evening party. - Yes.

1710
01:14:23,199 --> 01:14:26,199
We'd like it gluten-free.

1711
01:14:26,970 --> 01:14:28,499
And no mushrooms.

1712
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:29,898
- No mushrooms? - No.

1713
01:14:29,899 --> 01:14:31,269
Although they're the best ingredients.

1714
01:14:31,270 --> 01:14:32,869
Good. Okay.

1715
01:14:35,039 --> 01:14:36,078
Okay?

1716
01:14:36,079 --> 01:14:37,509
- Okay. - Okay.

1717
01:14:37,510 --> 01:14:40,148
And now, do you remember how to stop it?

1718
01:14:40,149 --> 01:14:41,219
(Relieved)

1719
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:43,319
- From where... - Pull.

1720
01:14:44,119 --> 01:14:46,118
- Okay, that's good enough. - Yes.

1721
01:14:46,119 --> 01:14:47,119
(It's good that they've arrived.)

1722
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:49,319
- Good job. - We've arrived safely.

1723
01:14:49,819 --> 01:14:51,228
(He's finally relieved.)

1724
01:14:51,229 --> 01:14:52,988
- Okay. - Goodness.

1725
01:14:52,989 --> 01:14:54,488
- Safe. - Okay, safe.

1726
01:14:54,489 --> 01:14:55,930
(We're safe.)

1727
01:14:56,460 --> 01:14:57,500
Gosh.

1728
01:14:58,329 --> 01:14:59,629
It's raining.

1729
01:14:59,630 --> 01:15:00,630
(It suddenly rains as soon as they've returned.)

1730
01:15:00,729 --> 01:15:01,970
Guys, it's raining.

1731
01:15:02,699 --> 01:15:03,840
Chicken.

1732
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:07,509
It's kind of perfect timing.

1733
01:15:07,510 --> 01:15:09,538
- Yes. - Perfect timing.

1734
01:15:09,539 --> 01:15:11,180
- Yes. - Just perfect.

1735
01:15:11,380 --> 01:15:12,709
Okay, see you later.

1736
01:15:12,710 --> 01:15:14,148
Okay, see you. Thanks.

1737
01:15:14,149 --> 01:15:15,479
- Thanks. - See you.

1738
01:15:23,590 --> 01:15:24,859
It's suddenly raining a lot.

1739
01:15:25,689 --> 01:15:29,028
(Worried about the party)

1740
01:15:29,029 --> 01:15:31,300
(The Renters missed people.)

1741
01:15:32,430 --> 01:15:37,140
(They have been all excited about the village party.)

1742
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:42,779
(They doll themselves up for the party.)

1743
01:15:43,779 --> 01:15:44,879
Is it raining?

1744
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:46,409
(But they keep checking the weather out of anxiety.)

1745
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,118
(The rain pours down as if it had waited.)

1746
01:15:48,119 --> 01:15:49,220
It's raining.

1747
01:15:50,850 --> 01:15:51,920
(The party is expected to start at 7pm...)

1748
01:15:52,090 --> 01:15:53,188
It's raining so much.

1749
01:15:53,189 --> 01:15:54,220
(in the front yard outside.)

1750
01:15:54,390 --> 01:15:56,759
Later when we have the evening party,

1751
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:58,029
will it stop raining?

1752
01:15:59,390 --> 01:16:02,630
(It shouldn't be canceled due to rain.)

1753
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:04,970
The party will start at 7pm.

1754
01:16:05,229 --> 01:16:07,630
- But it's almost 4:50pm right now. - Gosh.

1755
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:10,269
We better go grocery shopping.

1756
01:16:10,270 --> 01:16:11,640
(They need to buy ingredients to cook for the party.)

1757
01:16:12,539 --> 01:16:16,179
(Dong Brothers have stepped outside first.)

1758
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:17,379
Gosh, the rain clouds...

1759
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:18,478
(They travel to the supermarket through the rain.)

1760
01:16:18,479 --> 01:16:19,850
It's raining too hard.

1761
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:24,989
(Will it be possible to throw a party today?)

1762
01:16:28,319 --> 01:16:29,589
It keeps raining.

1763
01:16:29,590 --> 01:16:31,060
(Time passes.)

1764
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:34,328
(They've been so excited about the crowded party.)

1765
01:16:34,329 --> 01:16:35,399
I feel like crying.

1766
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:37,328
- Ready? - Let's go.

1767
01:16:37,329 --> 01:16:38,398
Okay.

1768
01:16:38,399 --> 01:16:41,369
(Let's move first.)

1769
01:16:41,699 --> 01:16:43,739
It's raining, so let's quickly pick those.

1770
01:16:44,170 --> 01:16:46,039
- Zucchinis, let's go. - Okay.

1771
01:16:46,770 --> 01:16:50,340
(It'll be too late if they wait for the rain to stop.)

1772
01:16:50,710 --> 01:16:51,749
- All right. - Gosh.

1773
01:16:51,750 --> 01:16:52,879
(At the landlord's vegetable field)

1774
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:54,279
These are so big.

1775
01:16:54,550 --> 01:16:55,879
- Je Hoon. - Should I pick this?

1776
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:57,050
Cut this, please.

1777
01:16:58,390 --> 01:17:02,119
(They're used to picking vegetables more than grocery shopping.)

1778
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:03,688
This one looks good.

1779
01:17:03,689 --> 01:17:05,459
(They pick the ones they like.)

1780
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:06,960
- There. - Nice.

1781
01:17:07,390 --> 01:17:09,529
Will we need those?

1782
01:17:09,930 --> 01:17:11,159
(The mini field right next to it)

1783
01:17:11,229 --> 01:17:14,299
To have bulgogi, we might need...

1784
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:15,738
- Vegetables for wraps? - Yes.

1785
01:17:15,739 --> 01:17:17,538
(Quickly taking vegetables for bulgogi wraps)

1786
01:17:17,539 --> 01:17:18,939
- This is crazy. - It's so much.

1787
01:17:19,569 --> 01:17:23,738
Do we have leftover garlic and stuff?

1788
01:17:23,739 --> 01:17:24,880
I put it over there.

1789
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:27,679
We're supposed to gather at 7pm.

1790
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:29,078
We only have an hour left.

1791
01:17:29,079 --> 01:17:30,079
Gosh.

1792
01:17:30,579 --> 01:17:32,520
(However...)

1793
01:17:32,850 --> 01:17:34,519
(Bulgogi, chili pepper japchae, zucchini jeon)

1794
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:36,858
(They have 3 dishes to make.)

1795
01:17:36,859 --> 01:17:40,359
(And the food has to be at least 10 servings.)

1796
01:17:40,930 --> 01:17:42,429
(It means they have tons of ingredients to prepare.)

1797
01:17:42,430 --> 01:17:44,159
- Nice. Perfect. - Okay.

1798
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:48,640
(In the midst of this, one of them can't cook.)

1799
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:51,939
(Will we be okay on our own?)

1800
01:17:52,569 --> 01:17:54,339
Let's prepare the ingredients.

1801
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:56,109
(They prepare the ingredients before the others return.)

1802
01:17:56,310 --> 01:17:57,409
All right, then...

1803
01:17:58,109 --> 01:17:59,279
Do we cut the zucchinis first?

1804
01:18:00,109 --> 01:18:02,349
- I'm going to make minced garlic. - Minced garlic?

1805
01:18:02,350 --> 01:18:04,079
- We need it. - We're back.

1806
01:18:05,649 --> 01:18:08,389
(Dong Brothers are back from grocery shopping.)

1807
01:18:08,390 --> 01:18:10,319
- It must've been hard. - All right.

1808
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:11,989
Good job.

1809
01:18:12,359 --> 01:18:13,629
It took quite a lot of time.

1810
01:18:13,630 --> 01:18:14,630
(Grateful to have them back in time)

1811
01:18:15,130 --> 01:18:16,328
(It's their first time cooking for guests.)

1812
01:18:16,329 --> 01:18:17,658
- What's this? - It's perfect.

1813
01:18:17,659 --> 01:18:19,430
- It's for Chinese flower buns. - It's perfect.

1814
01:18:19,569 --> 01:18:20,829
This is flour...

1815
01:18:21,369 --> 01:18:22,600
for making jeon.

1816
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:25,039
Do something else. I'll mince the garlic.

1817
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:28,079
I've tried to peel them with hands.

1818
01:18:28,739 --> 01:18:29,979
- It's not easy. - Right.

1819
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:31,908
You're a garlic expert.

1820
01:18:31,909 --> 01:18:33,810
(They need more minced garlic than usual.)

1821
01:18:34,149 --> 01:18:35,379
If you crush them by pressing,

1822
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:38,188
- you don't have to use your nails. - Oh, that's right.

1823
01:18:38,189 --> 01:18:40,020
It's just lying down along the grain.

1824
01:18:41,619 --> 01:18:45,489
(He has another skill of pressing on them in a plastic bag.)

1825
01:18:46,890 --> 01:18:50,259
(His skill has been upgraded.)

1826
01:18:50,260 --> 01:18:52,099
(There is no time!)

1827
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:53,499
This is quite satisfying.

1828
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:55,500
(He shows off his superhuman strength.)

1829
01:18:56,069 --> 01:18:58,339
This could go so fast.

1830
01:18:58,340 --> 01:18:59,470
(While Dong Hwi is operating the garlic factory, )

1831
01:19:00,270 --> 01:19:03,179
(the main chef is operating the onion factory.)

1832
01:19:03,180 --> 01:19:05,309
(He creates his own minced onions...)

1833
01:19:05,310 --> 01:19:07,449
(for getting rid of the smell from the bulgogi.)

1834
01:19:13,289 --> 01:19:14,688
(Groaning)

1835
01:19:14,689 --> 01:19:16,589
(Turning his wrist)

1836
01:19:16,590 --> 01:19:17,720
All right.

1837
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:22,658
(Gritting his teeth)

1838
01:19:22,659 --> 01:19:25,699
(After stretching his wrist, the human blender turns back on.)

1839
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:30,840
(He pays extra attention since it's for serving guests.)

1840
01:19:31,369 --> 01:19:33,969
(The sous-chef chops onions for the chili pepper japchae.)

1841
01:19:33,970 --> 01:19:36,738
(And he preps bell peppers.)

1842
01:19:36,739 --> 01:19:40,180
(Now, he can get through ingredients to serve 10 people in a flash.)

1843
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:42,949
(Meanwhile, the key variable of today)

1844
01:19:43,979 --> 01:19:45,050
Not too thick?

1845
01:19:45,689 --> 01:19:47,648
(Still, he folds his fingers as he learned when using a knife.)

1846
01:19:47,649 --> 01:19:48,760
That's perfect.

1847
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:54,329
(He's certainly in a rush, but...)

1848
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:57,228
- About here? - Yes, good.

1849
01:19:57,229 --> 01:19:59,100
(His hands can't keep up.)

1850
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:01,869
Did I slice them too thinly?

1851
01:20:01,939 --> 01:20:03,898
How do they look now?

1852
01:20:03,899 --> 01:20:05,869
(He asks for a confirmation on the thickness to prevent mistakes.)

1853
01:20:06,109 --> 01:20:08,238
- Yes, that's good. - Is it all right?

1854
01:20:08,239 --> 01:20:10,079
- That's good, Je Hoon. - Okay.

1855
01:20:10,739 --> 01:20:12,549
I'll slice them at this thickness.

1856
01:20:12,550 --> 01:20:14,680
(He may be slow, but he's more serious than anyone else.)

1857
01:20:15,479 --> 01:20:20,289
(The eldest tries to help in any way he can though he's new to cooking.)

1858
01:20:21,590 --> 01:20:22,659
It's so big.

1859
01:20:23,489 --> 01:20:25,630
(Smiling)

1860
01:20:26,359 --> 01:20:28,829
- With many people coming... - Yes?

1861
01:20:29,359 --> 01:20:32,699
And everyone preparing food together for a party...

1862
01:20:32,770 --> 01:20:35,300
makes me feel like I'm entering a cooking competition.

1863
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:38,310
(More serious than ever)

1864
01:20:38,369 --> 01:20:40,538
I think it kind of feels like a holiday...

1865
01:20:40,539 --> 01:20:41,979
where all of our relatives are gathering.

1866
01:20:42,210 --> 01:20:43,709
That's why we're making jeon.

1867
01:20:43,710 --> 01:20:46,210
(That's right. The eldest is in charge of zucchini jeon.)

1868
01:20:46,979 --> 01:20:48,618
(Actually, zucchini jeon is...)

1869
01:20:48,619 --> 01:20:51,749
(the easiest to make out of all kinds of jeon.)

1870
01:20:51,750 --> 01:20:53,390
(However, )

1871
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:56,359
(you need to season the zucchini just enough with salt, )

1872
01:20:57,590 --> 01:20:59,759
(coat it in flour, )

1873
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:03,659
(coat it in beaten eggs, )

1874
01:21:04,899 --> 01:21:08,170
(and pan-fry them to a golden brown without burning them.)

1875
01:21:09,069 --> 01:21:12,670
(For cooking rookie Je Hoon, this is the hardest dish ever.)

1876
01:21:12,869 --> 01:21:16,609
(Will the zucchini jeon make it onto the party table?)

1877
01:21:17,979 --> 01:21:21,050
(He lays out the zucchini slices on a plate.)

1878
01:21:21,949 --> 01:21:25,520
(Thankfully, he seems to have seen how this is done.)

1879
01:21:25,890 --> 01:21:28,119
Hang on. Then, these zucchinis...

1880
01:21:28,890 --> 01:21:32,288
I have to salt them a bit.

1881
01:21:32,289 --> 01:21:33,489
(Zucchini jeon recipe: Salt the zucchini slices and let them sit.)

1882
01:21:34,229 --> 01:21:38,229
(He doesn't forget and salts the zucchini on his own.)

1883
01:21:38,699 --> 01:21:43,299
(But this salt container is somewhat familiar.)

1884
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:45,769
(He detects a bad feeling.)

1885
01:21:45,770 --> 01:21:47,470
You can sprinkle them very lightly.

1886
01:21:48,140 --> 01:21:49,978
You can sprinkle them very lightly.

1887
01:21:49,979 --> 01:21:51,209
- Very lightly? - Yes, just...

1888
01:21:51,210 --> 01:21:52,978
think of it as a few grains of salt on each slice.

1889
01:21:52,979 --> 01:21:54,448
- Oh, just a few grains each? - Yes.

1890
01:21:54,449 --> 01:21:55,879
(The main chef is anxious, and the eldest listens well.)

1891
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:58,288
(But...)

1892
01:21:58,289 --> 01:22:02,289
(that angle is...)

1893
01:22:02,989 --> 01:22:05,859
(Will it be the 2nd salt attack?)

1894
01:22:06,689 --> 01:22:09,199
If you do that... Just because your hand is far doesn't make it light.

1895
01:22:10,199 --> 01:22:11,699
(Surprised)

1896
01:22:12,630 --> 01:22:15,199
It's just harder to see... Yes, that's better.

1897
01:22:16,270 --> 01:22:18,869
(What a relief.)

1898
01:22:20,510 --> 01:22:21,840
That's it.

1899
01:22:23,239 --> 01:22:25,309
- I can sprinkle it like this. - Very little.

1900
01:22:25,310 --> 01:22:27,149
It would be better if you use your other hand too.

1901
01:22:27,449 --> 01:22:29,050
No, not like that. Pinch the salt.

1902
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:31,520
- Like this? - Yes, that's right.

1903
01:22:32,289 --> 01:22:33,948
I think you can do a bit more.

1904
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:36,319
(Thanks to Homemaker Kwak, the salt gets sprinkled safely.)

1905
01:22:37,390 --> 01:22:38,559
Good.

1906
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:42,100
(Okay, done with watch duty)

1907
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:46,229
I'm working so delicately.

1908
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:47,569
A small pinch.

1909
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:53,109
With the thought of making delicious food for others.

1910
01:22:53,539 --> 01:22:55,979
Now, I will beat the eggs.

1911
01:22:57,079 --> 01:23:00,109
(Thankfully, he cracks the eggs in a bowl, not a frying pan.)

1912
01:23:01,079 --> 01:23:05,449
(He takes so much care to crack a single egg.)

1913
01:23:06,289 --> 01:23:10,319
(He's so tense about cooking to serve guests.)

1914
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:13,459
I beat the eggs.

1915
01:23:13,460 --> 01:23:15,129
(The stirring master skillfully finishes beating the eggs.)

1916
01:23:15,130 --> 01:23:17,129
(Zucchini jeon recipe: Beat the eggs.)

1917
01:23:17,130 --> 01:23:18,568
(Coat the zucchini slices evenly with flour.)

1918
01:23:18,569 --> 01:23:22,399
(He has to move on to the next step.)

1919
01:23:23,300 --> 01:23:26,970
(But he's putting the zucchini slices into a Ziplock bag?)

1920
01:23:27,369 --> 01:23:29,439
(What are you trying to do?)

1921
01:23:30,039 --> 01:23:32,509
(He takes the bag with the zucchini slices...)

1922
01:23:32,510 --> 01:23:36,420
(and pours in the flour.)

1923
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:43,090
(He uses the Ziplock skill that he learned by watching Dong Hwi.)

1924
01:23:44,890 --> 01:23:46,129
(Thanks to that, he finishes quickly and without spilling.)

1925
01:23:46,130 --> 01:23:47,728
The flour is being coated well.

1926
01:23:47,729 --> 01:23:48,930
(Job complete)

1927
01:23:49,930 --> 01:23:54,068
(The good student even developed practical skills of his own.)

1928
01:23:54,069 --> 01:23:55,199
Okay.

1929
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:58,469
(The zucchini slices coated in flour, the beaten eggs)

1930
01:23:58,470 --> 01:24:01,779
(He prepares to make the zucchini jeon without any mistakes.)

1931
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:04,408
- The sun came out right on time. - My gosh.

1932
01:24:04,409 --> 01:24:06,850
It was raining so much, but it's sunny now.

1933
01:24:09,579 --> 01:24:11,519
I think the sun is out for sure now.

1934
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:14,819
(The sky has cleared up as if it never rained earlier.)

1935
01:24:15,489 --> 01:24:18,630
(There's even a rainbow.)

1936
01:24:19,460 --> 01:24:22,859
(Nice. Guys, there's going to be a party!)

1937
01:24:23,859 --> 01:24:26,728
(40 minutes before the party starts)

1938
01:24:26,729 --> 01:24:28,569
This is too crowded for all four of us to cook.

1939
01:24:28,970 --> 01:24:31,839
Let's move the chili pepper japchae and the nurungji.

1940
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,770
- I'll go to make the zucchini jeon. - Okay.

1941
01:24:34,510 --> 01:24:36,209
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1942
01:24:36,210 --> 01:24:39,710
(The main chef, in charge of bulgogi, starts prepping the meat.)

1943
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:43,420
(Staring)

1944
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:46,590
(Is there some kind of problem?)

1945
01:24:51,189 --> 01:24:54,390
(Checking on the condition of the meat)

1946
01:24:57,529 --> 01:24:58,728
This is a whole chunk of meat.

1947
01:24:58,729 --> 01:25:00,398
(This is a whole chunk of meat.)

1948
01:25:00,399 --> 01:25:01,599
(For the bulgogi sauce to soak in well...)

1949
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:02,669
I'm doomed.

1950
01:25:02,670 --> 01:25:05,409
(The meat has to be thinly sliced.)

1951
01:25:06,210 --> 01:25:09,608
(Kwak Dong Yeon made this kind of mistake?)

1952
01:25:09,609 --> 01:25:11,608
(Because he was in a rush, he couldn't check the meat...)

1953
01:25:11,609 --> 01:25:15,250
(and bought a big chunk.)

1954
01:25:17,350 --> 01:25:21,219
(The main chef drops his head.)

1955
01:25:21,220 --> 01:25:23,159
(Frozen)

1956
01:25:24,359 --> 01:25:28,800
(A party table without bulgogi is an unimaginable disaster.)

1957
01:25:31,029 --> 01:25:32,599
(He must...)

1958
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:35,800
(make this work in any way.)

1959
01:25:36,970 --> 01:25:41,039
(Is there anything I can do?)

1960
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:46,078
(First, he grabs hold of his knife and his sanity.)

1961
01:25:46,079 --> 01:25:49,920
(He tries to slice the meat thinly.)

1962
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:57,890
This is totally ruined.

1963
01:26:00,930 --> 01:26:03,059
It has to be really thin.

1964
01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:04,299
(It doesn't look easy to slice it thinly.)

1965
01:26:04,300 --> 01:26:06,130
This is going very wrong.

1966
01:26:07,130 --> 01:26:08,599
Let's try to make it work somehow.

1967
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:11,068
(He even starts tearing it apart with his hands.)

1968
01:26:11,069 --> 01:26:12,739
Let's try it.

1969
01:26:14,909 --> 01:26:16,379
(He doesn't have much time, and there's an issue with the meat.)

1970
01:26:16,380 --> 01:26:21,250
(Will he safely overcome this crisis?)

1971
01:26:23,479 --> 01:26:26,189
I don't think it will get marinated well as it's too thick.

1972
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:30,759
(He cuts the thick meat...)

1973
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:35,159
(with the knife and opens it flat.)

1974
01:26:39,329 --> 01:26:43,170
(Cutting slits into the meat)

1975
01:26:46,109 --> 01:26:48,108
(He cuts slits into the meat so that the sauce can soak in well.)

1976
01:26:48,109 --> 01:26:50,539
I should at least cut some slits into the meat.

1977
01:26:54,449 --> 01:26:56,449
Nice. Perfect!

1978
01:26:57,380 --> 01:26:59,188
(The tenacious Kwak Dong Yeon...)

1979
01:26:59,189 --> 01:27:02,460
(finishes reviving the meat.)

1980
01:27:03,590 --> 01:27:05,658
Put most of the meat...

1981
01:27:05,659 --> 01:27:06,859
(He overcomes the crisis with his delicate handiwork.)

1982
01:27:07,390 --> 01:27:10,460
(Now, he has to make the sauce.)

1983
01:27:11,159 --> 01:27:12,769
(Usually, what makes bulgogi tasty...)

1984
01:27:12,770 --> 01:27:15,099
(is the sauce!)

1985
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:17,299
(Ground onions)

1986
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:19,009
(Ground pear)

1987
01:27:19,010 --> 01:27:20,969
(Minced garlic)

1988
01:27:20,970 --> 01:27:22,778
(Soy sauce)

1989
01:27:22,779 --> 01:27:24,578
(Cooking wine)

1990
01:27:24,579 --> 01:27:26,249
(Plum extract)

1991
01:27:26,250 --> 01:27:27,978
(Sugar)

1992
01:27:27,979 --> 01:27:29,879
(Black pepper)

1993
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:31,649
(Sesame oil)

1994
01:27:32,250 --> 01:27:35,859
(It's a difficult sauce that requires several seasonings.)

1995
01:27:36,260 --> 01:27:40,489
(Will he be able to recreate that taste in Lapland?)

1996
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:46,670
(Even the wind feels ominous.)

1997
01:27:47,229 --> 01:27:49,369
(Blowing)

1998
01:27:51,699 --> 01:27:52,868
Don't be flustered.

1999
01:27:52,869 --> 01:27:54,238
It's nothing.

2000
01:27:54,239 --> 01:27:55,639
(The windscreen rings like a gong.)

2001
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:57,779
I can just put it back up. Why get surprised?

2002
01:27:58,539 --> 01:27:59,778
It's no big deal.

2003
01:27:59,779 --> 01:28:01,210
(Taking a deep breath and letting it out)

2004
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:04,549
(He doesn't get surprised and goes back to finding the seasonings.)

2005
01:28:04,550 --> 01:28:06,449
Just keep going. Don't be flustered.

2006
01:28:07,149 --> 01:28:08,420
Just keep going.

2007
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:11,259
What are you going to use now?

2008
01:28:11,260 --> 01:28:12,989
Honey. Right, you need to find the honey.

2009
01:28:13,590 --> 01:28:14,729
Where is the honey?

2010
01:28:14,859 --> 01:28:16,130
The groceries you bought are in here.

2011
01:28:16,199 --> 01:28:17,460
It must be in here.

2012
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:18,829
Indeed, it's in here.

2013
01:28:21,899 --> 01:28:23,499
Open the honey. Okay.

2014
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:24,569
(Talking to himself)

2015
01:28:25,609 --> 01:28:27,539
How will you open it? I don't know that either.

2016
01:28:28,909 --> 01:28:30,578
Find out. It must be this.

2017
01:28:30,579 --> 01:28:31,679
(He is currently under extreme stress due to the party.)

2018
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:32,949
That's it.

2019
01:28:34,279 --> 01:28:35,448
You did it.

2020
01:28:35,449 --> 01:28:36,519
You can do it if you try.

2021
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:39,050
(He finishes off with self-praise.)

2022
01:28:39,090 --> 01:28:42,020
(Getting ready to add honey after adding sugar)

2023
01:28:42,390 --> 01:28:44,059
The wind normally blows. Don't get flustered.

2024
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:45,728
(Bulgogi sauce recipe: ground onion, ground pear, minced garlic...)

2025
01:28:45,729 --> 01:28:47,528
Oh, no. The bulgogi...

2026
01:28:47,529 --> 01:28:48,658
(There's no honey in the recipe.)

2027
01:28:48,659 --> 01:28:51,060
I should normally add starch sugar, not honey.

2028
01:28:52,699 --> 01:28:54,669
I think honey will be okay.

2029
01:28:54,670 --> 01:28:57,800
(He's replacing the sweetness of starch syrup with honey.)

2030
01:28:58,439 --> 01:29:00,409
Yes, I have ground onions.

2031
01:29:01,310 --> 01:29:02,310
Put that in.

2032
01:29:02,311 --> 01:29:04,640
(Ground onions, honey instead of starch syrup, sugar)

2033
01:29:06,710 --> 01:29:10,979
(Will he be able to recreate the taste of Korean bulgogi?)

2034
01:29:12,420 --> 01:29:15,420
(And what did he ambitiously bring out?)

2035
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:18,659
(The scale for making hand-drip coffee?)

2036
01:29:20,229 --> 01:29:24,229
(The master of cooking for himself hasn't cooked for 10 before.)

2037
01:29:25,430 --> 01:29:28,029
(Elaborate)

2038
01:29:28,130 --> 01:29:30,269
People who can't cook well need to do this...

2039
01:29:30,270 --> 01:29:32,439
to make it taste somewhat similar to usual.

2040
01:29:33,810 --> 01:29:37,380
(Planner Kwak takes each step carefully without being proud.)

2041
01:29:38,479 --> 01:29:40,680
(Delicate handiwork)

2042
01:29:41,079 --> 01:29:45,020
(He utilizes the thick soy sauce he brought wrapped in 5 layers.)

2043
01:29:45,050 --> 01:29:50,060
(Ground onions, honey instead of starch syrup, sugar, soy sauce)

2044
01:29:51,020 --> 01:29:52,089
Minced garlic.

2045
01:29:52,090 --> 01:29:53,460
(He adds Dong Hwi's minced garlic.)

2046
01:29:54,260 --> 01:29:55,858
(Ground onions, honey instead of starch syrup, sugar, )

2047
01:29:55,859 --> 01:29:57,499
(soy sauce, minced garlic)

2048
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:58,698
(And black pepper)

2049
01:29:58,699 --> 01:30:00,368
(Ground onions, honey instead of starch syrup, sugar, )

2050
01:30:00,369 --> 01:30:01,999
(soy sauce, minced garlic, black pepper)

2051
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,140
(And sesame oil)

2052
01:30:03,439 --> 01:30:06,538
(Ground onions, honey instead of starch syrup, sugar, )

2053
01:30:06,539 --> 01:30:09,640
(soy sauce, minced garlic, black pepper, sesame oil)

2054
01:30:10,579 --> 01:30:13,609
(He adds all of the seasonings and mixes them up.)

2055
01:30:13,949 --> 01:30:16,649
(Dong Yeon's bulgogi sauce is complete.)

2056
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:18,249
(Part of his recipe were left out and changed.)

2057
01:30:18,250 --> 01:30:21,319
(Will it suit their neighbors' tastes?)

2058
01:30:21,420 --> 01:30:24,858
Both of us are cooking so many dishes we haven't made before.

2059
01:30:24,859 --> 01:30:27,460
I know. I can't believe I'm cooking zucchini jeon.

2060
01:30:29,430 --> 01:30:30,698
Gosh, that smells insane.

2061
01:30:30,699 --> 01:30:31,800
Doesn't it?

2062
01:30:33,430 --> 01:30:34,898
- No, I mean mine. - Oh, yours?

2063
01:30:34,899 --> 01:30:37,340
(Eun Woo, who's in charge of the chili pepper japchae...)

2064
01:30:38,199 --> 01:30:40,108
(Eun Woo's mom's house, 2 days before departure)

2065
01:30:40,109 --> 01:30:42,279
So today... Last time,

2066
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:44,880
I tried making some stir-fried spicy pork.

2067
01:30:45,409 --> 01:30:46,710
But my mom, more than me...

2068
01:30:47,380 --> 01:30:48,880
It was too plain.

2069
01:30:49,479 --> 01:30:52,890
She said it was too plain and became more ambitious.

2070
01:30:53,850 --> 01:30:57,488
My mom wrote down this recipe for me.

2071
01:30:57,489 --> 01:30:59,359
(Eun Woo's mom wrote down the ambitious recipes herself.)

2072
01:30:59,659 --> 01:31:01,629
First, I'll try making the chili pepper japchae.

2073
01:31:01,630 --> 01:31:03,398
(Among those, his mom's ambitious masterpiece, chili pepper japchae)

2074
01:31:03,399 --> 01:31:04,500
I'll try making it.

2075
01:31:05,229 --> 01:31:07,630
This is the first chili pepper japchae I'm making in my life.

2076
01:31:08,569 --> 01:31:10,569
For the seasonings, look in the bottom drawer.

2077
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:12,840
From now on, speed is of the essence.

2078
01:31:13,039 --> 01:31:14,069
Yes.

2079
01:31:14,569 --> 01:31:17,509
(His mom couldn't just watch and ends up stepping in.)

2080
01:31:17,510 --> 01:31:18,539
I'll do it.

2081
01:31:19,380 --> 01:31:20,409
- Is this it? - No.

2082
01:31:21,909 --> 01:31:23,818
(He's still fumbling around.)

2083
01:31:23,819 --> 01:31:25,319
Yes, the one in the very front.

2084
01:31:26,819 --> 01:31:28,519
(In the end, )

2085
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:31,460
(his brother controls the heat too.)

2086
01:31:33,460 --> 01:31:35,560
(Simply laughing)

2087
01:31:37,930 --> 01:31:39,269
Yes, the oyster sauce.

2088
01:31:39,270 --> 01:31:40,899
(Oyster sauce)

2089
01:31:41,029 --> 01:31:43,899
What if that splatters on your face?

2090
01:31:45,470 --> 01:31:47,170
Okay, that's enough. It'll be too salty.

2091
01:31:47,739 --> 01:31:49,710
And add a bit of sugar.

2092
01:31:50,279 --> 01:31:52,139
(His brother's hand slides in.)

2093
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:53,579
Add the sugar...

2094
01:31:53,649 --> 01:31:55,919
Yes. And stir fry it.

2095
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:59,389
(He learns from his mom and his brother stirs it for him.)

2096
01:31:59,390 --> 01:32:04,189
(Will Eun Woo's chili pepper japchae become a success?)

2097
01:32:05,659 --> 01:32:08,129
(Eun Woo's chili pepper japchae recipe)

2098
01:32:08,130 --> 01:32:10,600
(Stir-fry minced garlic with black pepper.)

2099
01:32:11,699 --> 01:32:14,729
Gosh, you made such nice and spicy garlic oil.

2100
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:16,169
Yes.

2101
01:32:16,170 --> 01:32:19,140
(The garlic that's done being stir-fried is set off to the side.)

2102
01:32:22,010 --> 01:32:24,710
(Adding the vegetables)

2103
01:32:24,779 --> 01:32:28,679
(Add chili oil and cooking oil to stir-fry bell peppers and onions.)

2104
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:30,979
(What about the chili oil?)

2105
01:32:31,250 --> 01:32:32,719
- A little more? - Yes, the chili oil.

2106
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:36,619
(During his mom's cooking lesson, he added chili oil.)

2107
01:32:38,289 --> 01:32:39,889
(But today, )

2108
01:32:39,890 --> 01:32:41,488
(since the guests won't be able to eat spicy food...)

2109
01:32:41,489 --> 01:32:42,899
Oh, nice.

2110
01:32:43,829 --> 01:32:45,358
(With Eun Woo's consideration, )

2111
01:32:45,359 --> 01:32:48,430
(it's special chili pepper japchae.)

2112
01:32:51,069 --> 01:32:52,568
It's finally losing its crispness.

2113
01:32:52,569 --> 01:32:53,640
(When the crispness of the bell peppers and onions die down...)

2114
01:32:53,670 --> 01:32:55,509
(When the vegetables start to cook, add the meat and stir-fry.)

2115
01:32:55,510 --> 01:32:56,779
I added the meat, Je Hoon.

2116
01:32:58,739 --> 01:33:05,989
(Add oyster sauce, soy sauce, sugar, and black pepper.)

2117
01:33:06,619 --> 01:33:10,159
(It already looks pretty legit.)

2118
01:33:11,989 --> 01:33:13,260
Hey, that looks good.

2119
01:33:13,890 --> 01:33:15,260
- Do you think so? - Yes.

2120
01:33:16,060 --> 01:33:17,800
I am trying my best, but...

2121
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:19,399
I'll try.

2122
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:22,769
Lastly, the garlic I stir-fried earlier...

2123
01:33:22,770 --> 01:33:23,899
(He adds to the flavor with the garlic he stir-fried earlier.)

2124
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:25,339
I think it'll taste really good.

2125
01:33:25,340 --> 01:33:27,639
Just by the looks, it already gets a pass.

2126
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:29,140
(Will the village neighbors like the chili pepper japchae?)

2127
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:32,778
(Meanwhile, the guy to watch out for...)

2128
01:33:32,779 --> 01:33:35,720
- Je Hoon, they look pretty good. - Yes, they look good.

2129
01:33:36,750 --> 01:33:38,948
- Like this and... - Oh, nice.

2130
01:33:38,949 --> 01:33:40,789
Aren't they nice and golden brown?

2131
01:33:40,989 --> 01:33:42,148
Oh, this one looks good.

2132
01:33:42,149 --> 01:33:43,188
(Unexpectedly, he makes tasty-looking zucchini jeon.)

2133
01:33:43,189 --> 01:33:44,960
It looks so good just as it is now.

2134
01:33:45,020 --> 01:33:46,630
(What a relief.)

2135
01:33:46,930 --> 01:33:48,689
- It has a good vibe, right? - It feels like a holiday.

2136
01:33:48,890 --> 01:33:51,060
(Giggling)

2137
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:53,869
That's the perfect timing right now.

2138
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:56,269
(The eldest's cooking skills...)

2139
01:33:56,270 --> 01:33:57,898
(are improving day by day.)

2140
01:33:57,899 --> 01:33:59,568
Yes, very good.

2141
01:33:59,569 --> 01:34:00,569
Good.

2142
01:34:01,069 --> 01:34:02,908
Just keep going. Don't be flustered.

2143
01:34:02,909 --> 01:34:04,140
(How is Chef Kwak's bulgogi going after many tribulations?)

2144
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:08,010
(The bulgogi for Anne)

2145
01:34:08,079 --> 01:34:09,979
Oh, she said she didn't eat mushrooms.

2146
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:12,318
(He adds sauce to the meat in two separate bowls for Anne.)

2147
01:34:12,319 --> 01:34:13,349
Bring that over.

2148
01:34:13,350 --> 01:34:14,920
(He adds sauce to the meat in two separate bowls for Anne.)

2149
01:34:15,689 --> 01:34:18,760
(He looks like an expert as he mixes the meat with his hands.)

2150
01:34:19,289 --> 01:34:22,260
(Putting so much care into it)

2151
01:34:23,859 --> 01:34:27,529
(Has the thick meat been marinated well?)

2152
01:34:27,630 --> 01:34:30,439
(A piece of meat)

2153
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:35,210
(He tries a taste test out of anxiety.)

2154
01:34:36,310 --> 01:34:38,510
I don't know why this keeps working.

2155
01:34:41,180 --> 01:34:45,449
(Since it passed the test, he starts cooking.)

2156
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:51,420
(As he stirs it so that the sauce seeps in well, )

2157
01:34:54,359 --> 01:34:58,329
(the bulgogi is becoming cooked after much difficulties.)

2158
01:35:00,869 --> 01:35:02,328
(Checking the time)

2159
01:35:02,329 --> 01:35:04,199
(Looking carefully)

2160
01:35:04,239 --> 01:35:05,938
- Eun Woo. - Yes?

2161
01:35:05,939 --> 01:35:07,170
Are you almost done?

2162
01:35:07,869 --> 01:35:09,880
- We're almost done. - Yes.

2163
01:35:10,939 --> 01:35:13,310
(10 minutes before the party starts)

2164
01:35:14,079 --> 01:35:15,849
We can finish if we work fast.

2165
01:35:15,850 --> 01:35:17,520
(They must finish before the guests come!)

2166
01:35:18,579 --> 01:35:21,249
(Eun Woo grills the flower buns to go with chili pepper japchae.)

2167
01:35:21,250 --> 01:35:22,890
They look so tasty and golden brown.

2168
01:35:24,220 --> 01:35:26,188
(The eldest is making zucchini jeon skewers.)

2169
01:35:26,189 --> 01:35:28,929
So it's easy for our guests to eat...

2170
01:35:28,930 --> 01:35:31,398
It could be hard to use forks or chopsticks.

2171
01:35:31,399 --> 01:35:32,629
Okay, nice, Je Hoon.

2172
01:35:32,630 --> 01:35:34,899
(Je Hoon's careful consideration so they're easy to eat)

2173
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:38,970
(And Dong Hwi's nurungji is being cooked well too.)

2174
01:35:40,069 --> 01:35:41,938
(When they set the tables with the landlords...)

2175
01:35:41,939 --> 01:35:43,840
We can leave it here. Yes.

2176
01:35:46,409 --> 01:35:48,310
Gosh, we timed it perfectly.

2177
01:35:49,479 --> 01:35:50,579
Nice.

2178
01:35:51,979 --> 01:35:54,349
I'm kind of anxious and nervous.

2179
01:35:54,350 --> 01:35:55,350
(Sitting side by side)

2180
01:35:55,351 --> 01:35:56,759
Gosh, I'm nervous.

2181
01:35:56,760 --> 01:35:57,890
(So nervous)

2182
01:35:58,220 --> 01:35:59,328
- My gosh. - Oh, someone is coming.

2183
01:35:59,329 --> 01:36:00,828
- Oh, the neighbors. - Okay.

2184
01:36:00,829 --> 01:36:02,260
(Their neighbors arrive right then.)

2185
01:36:04,460 --> 01:36:07,729
(Strange footsteps...)

2186
01:36:09,369 --> 01:36:11,938
(The neighborhood stars...)

2187
01:36:11,939 --> 01:36:15,069
(are coming with their mysterious figures.)

2188
01:36:17,510 --> 01:36:19,379
(Exclaiming)

2189
01:36:19,380 --> 01:36:20,849
(Surprised)

2190
01:36:20,850 --> 01:36:24,249
(Our guests are...)

2191
01:36:24,250 --> 01:36:26,649
(ponies?)

2192
01:36:26,949 --> 01:36:28,220
- My gosh. - What?

2193
01:36:28,789 --> 01:36:31,158
(Unbelievable)

2194
01:36:31,159 --> 01:36:33,228
- What... - Are they ponies?

2195
01:36:33,229 --> 01:36:35,129
My gosh. The pony has bangs.

2196
01:36:35,130 --> 01:36:36,859
(What's up with these party guests?)

2197
01:36:37,100 --> 01:36:38,130
My gosh.

2198
01:36:39,100 --> 01:36:40,130
My gosh.

2199
01:36:40,430 --> 01:36:41,599
What...

2200
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:42,799
(A unique party in the countryside)

2201
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:43,839
(The strange village party begins now.)

2202
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:46,108
- Are they horses? - They're ponies.

2203
01:36:46,109 --> 01:36:47,670
(The strange village party begins now.)

2204
01:36:48,470 --> 01:36:50,179
(Gritting his teeth...)

2205
01:36:50,180 --> 01:36:52,278
(and sweating bullets, )

2206
01:36:52,279 --> 01:36:54,380
(they made...)

2207
01:36:54,949 --> 01:36:56,920
(a table full of Korean food for their neighbors.)

2208
01:36:57,279 --> 01:37:01,920
(Will the Renters' party table be a success?)

2209
01:37:04,260 --> 01:37:06,028
(At first, they were afraid of their life in the countryside.)

2210
01:37:06,029 --> 01:37:08,029
(Now, they're used to their life in the countryside.)

2211
01:37:08,329 --> 01:37:09,728
(City boys...)

2212
01:37:09,729 --> 01:37:11,228
(to nature boys)

2213
01:37:11,229 --> 01:37:14,600
(Are they changing?)

2214
01:37:15,029 --> 01:37:17,500
(The next rented room is no problem either!)

2215
01:37:17,569 --> 01:37:19,000
(Or so they thought.)

2216
01:37:19,510 --> 01:37:20,970
(They're getting on a boat?)

2217
01:37:21,569 --> 01:37:24,380
(Is the next rented room perhaps on a deserted island?)

2218
01:37:24,439 --> 01:37:26,179
(Still, )

2219
01:37:26,180 --> 01:37:30,180
(the nature boys can do it!)

2220
01:37:30,279 --> 01:37:32,279
(Will the nature boys be able to do it?)

2221
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:35,350
(They can't let down their guards until the end.)

2222
01:37:36,260 --> 01:37:40,529
(You have gone off course.)

2223
01:37:41,489 --> 01:37:46,100
(Their rental life keeps going off course.)

2224
01:37:47,270 --> 01:37:48,568
(There are lots of horses...)

2225
01:37:48,569 --> 01:37:50,639
(and lots of trouble.)

2226
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:52,810
(And there are lots of babies too.)

2227
01:37:53,340 --> 01:37:58,810
(Their rough and tumble life in the countryside continues!)

2228
01:38:04,119 --> 01:38:05,849
(Lee Je Hoon)

2229
01:38:05,850 --> 01:38:07,589
(Lee Dong Hwi)

2230
01:38:07,590 --> 01:38:09,419
(Kwak Dong Yeon)

2231
01:38:09,420 --> 01:38:11,020
(Cha Eun Woo)

2232
01:38:11,159 --> 01:38:13,960
(Rented In Finland)
