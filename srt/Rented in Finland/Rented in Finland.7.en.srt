1
00:00:05,303 --> 00:00:07,073
(Lee Je Hoon)

2
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:08,772
(Lee Dong Hwi)

3
00:00:08,773 --> 00:00:10,643
(Kwak Dong Yeon)

4
00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:12,273
(Cha Eun Woo)

5
00:00:12,373 --> 00:00:15,013
(Rented in Finland)

6
00:00:15,183 --> 00:00:18,583
(The second place they rented in Lapland)

7
00:00:20,284 --> 00:00:25,624
(A 30-minute drive on a mountain path with only dirt and trees)

8
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:27,523
- Gosh. - Goodness.

9
00:00:28,293 --> 00:00:31,563
(At the end of the road...)

10
00:00:32,664 --> 00:00:34,203
- Goodness. - Is this the house?

11
00:00:34,404 --> 00:00:36,904
- Gosh. - This deep in the forest.

12
00:00:37,273 --> 00:00:41,544
(The house of their dreams?)

13
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:45,043
(Their rented life...)

14
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:46,713
(becomes even more chaotic.)

15
00:00:48,514 --> 00:00:51,382
(They not only ruin the kitchen,)

16
00:00:51,383 --> 00:00:53,724
(but also their image.)

17
00:00:54,953 --> 00:00:57,892
(The Renters lay everything down...)

18
00:00:57,893 --> 00:01:01,624
(and become one with nature.)

19
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:05,293
(They were once city boys.)

20
00:01:05,294 --> 00:01:09,904
(Have they adapted perfectly to life in the wilderness?)

21
00:01:10,973 --> 00:01:14,143
(What kind of place will they stay next?)

22
00:01:21,643 --> 00:01:23,583
- Should we start getting ready? - Shall we?

23
00:01:23,714 --> 00:01:24,782
- Let's go. - Okay.

24
00:01:24,783 --> 00:01:26,783
We should get moving.

25
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:34,264
Let's start packing our stuff.

26
00:01:34,964 --> 00:01:36,223
- Gosh. - Goodness.

27
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,764
Now that we have to go,

28
00:01:40,604 --> 00:01:41,663
I feel sad.

29
00:01:42,104 --> 00:01:45,133
I've become more attached to this house.

30
00:01:45,134 --> 00:01:46,203
Me too.

31
00:01:46,943 --> 00:01:48,374
Maybe because it's cozier.

32
00:01:49,574 --> 00:01:51,713
Won't the third house have a charm of itself?

33
00:01:51,714 --> 00:01:53,173
- Of course. - I'm sure it does.

34
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:54,683
I can't believe we have to leave.

35
00:01:54,684 --> 00:01:56,083
(They are getting ready for the move with sad hearts.)

36
00:01:56,313 --> 00:01:57,354
(Knocking)

37
00:01:57,913 --> 00:01:58,953
What?

38
00:01:59,154 --> 00:02:01,853
(Some came to them...)

39
00:02:01,854 --> 00:02:04,294
(this deep in the forest?)

40
00:02:04,753 --> 00:02:07,393
- Yes? - Hey.

41
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:10,563
(It's Oiva, the landlord.)

42
00:02:10,834 --> 00:02:13,464
- Yes? - Hey.

43
00:02:13,563 --> 00:02:15,032
You're alive.

44
00:02:15,033 --> 00:02:16,334
(The Renters are alive.)

45
00:02:16,434 --> 00:02:17,502
Oiva.

46
00:02:17,503 --> 00:02:18,803
We're alive.

47
00:02:18,804 --> 00:02:21,674
- I know you leave today. - Yes.

48
00:02:21,804 --> 00:02:24,143
I wanted to see you once again.

49
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,412
- I see. - Yes.

50
00:02:25,413 --> 00:02:27,942
Did you eat and sleep well?

51
00:02:27,943 --> 00:02:29,282
- Yes. - Yes.

52
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:30,413
Of course...

53
00:02:30,954 --> 00:02:34,683
I also hope you are now closer with nature...

54
00:02:34,684 --> 00:02:36,954
- Yes. - and silence.

55
00:02:37,154 --> 00:02:38,424
- Of course. - Yes.

56
00:02:39,594 --> 00:02:42,693
Do you know the sky looked different every day?

57
00:02:45,594 --> 00:02:46,732
I do. It's gorgeous.

58
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:48,864
We got to see all types of beautiful skies.

59
00:02:55,943 --> 00:03:00,943
(They had more time to look up at the sky while they were here.)

60
00:03:04,383 --> 00:03:07,654
(They were busy adapting in the first house.)

61
00:03:07,823 --> 00:03:11,193
(So they had more time to enjoy the quiet nature here.)

62
00:03:12,753 --> 00:03:17,964
(Oma rauha, one's own peace)

63
00:03:19,464 --> 00:03:22,062
(They each found their peace...)

64
00:03:22,063 --> 00:03:28,174
(in their own ways.)

65
00:03:31,473 --> 00:03:34,042
(And Oiva, who made it possible)

66
00:03:34,043 --> 00:03:36,714
(Lapland-style wooden visitor log book)

67
00:03:37,513 --> 00:03:41,853
(With thankful hearts,)

68
00:03:43,253 --> 00:03:45,653
(they carefully write...)

69
00:03:45,654 --> 00:03:49,163
(about their memories at the second house.)

70
00:03:50,894 --> 00:03:53,434
Say thank you to Marketa.

71
00:03:53,704 --> 00:03:55,333
- For the blueberry pie. - I will tell her.

72
00:03:55,334 --> 00:03:57,632
- It was really nice. - Yes.

73
00:03:57,633 --> 00:03:59,533
The custard cream was delicious.

74
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:00,704
We have...

75
00:04:02,244 --> 00:04:04,512
a lot of berries and mushrooms.

76
00:04:04,513 --> 00:04:09,183
We have to use those, so no reason to buy it from markets.

77
00:04:09,184 --> 00:04:10,282
No reason.

78
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:12,654
They are very fresh.

79
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:14,852
They taste better than the ones at the supermarket.

80
00:04:14,853 --> 00:04:17,123
(His gaze is fixed on something.)

81
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:19,824
(We follow his gaze.)

82
00:04:20,524 --> 00:04:21,693
He's drawing you.

83
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:23,524
(Hwicasso is drawing a caricature of Oiva.)

84
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:25,464
(I can't wait to see it!)

85
00:04:26,134 --> 00:04:27,704
It's your cap.

86
00:04:27,803 --> 00:04:29,863
(His signature cap)

87
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:32,903
Don't spoil the surprise.

88
00:04:32,904 --> 00:04:34,903
Oiva is watching you.

89
00:04:34,904 --> 00:04:37,214
Just talk to him.

90
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:39,144
It's hard to draw with you looking at me.

91
00:04:39,344 --> 00:04:41,043
He's staring at me.

92
00:04:41,913 --> 00:04:43,513
I think he's asking you to do a good job.

93
00:04:43,514 --> 00:04:44,884
He's giving me an affectionate gaze.

94
00:04:45,584 --> 00:04:47,153
(Sending hearts with his eyes)

95
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:48,982
I'm putting in more effort.

96
00:04:48,983 --> 00:04:51,754
(Look forward to it.)

97
00:04:51,923 --> 00:04:54,524
- We're only out... - You are ready.

98
00:04:55,064 --> 00:04:56,194
when it's light outside. It's hard to get used to.

99
00:04:56,394 --> 00:04:57,634
- Thank you. - Thank you.

100
00:04:57,894 --> 00:04:59,064
This is mine.

101
00:04:59,764 --> 00:05:01,334
- Thank you. - Thank you.

102
00:05:01,704 --> 00:05:03,634
Je Hoon wrote, "I'll be back."

103
00:05:03,933 --> 00:05:05,203
Of course I'll be back.

104
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:06,633
I'll be back

105
00:05:06,634 --> 00:05:07,872
We're coming together, right?

106
00:05:07,873 --> 00:05:09,172
Yes, of course.

107
00:05:09,173 --> 00:05:10,403
(Dong Yeon: I will never forget the time I spent here.)

108
00:05:10,404 --> 00:05:12,743
(Eun Woo: Thank you, beautiful nature.)

109
00:05:14,613 --> 00:05:16,814
(Dong Hwi: Thank you so much.)

110
00:05:17,553 --> 00:05:19,713
(I'll say the rest...)

111
00:05:19,714 --> 00:05:21,722
(through my drawing.)

112
00:05:21,723 --> 00:05:22,783
I'm done.

113
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:26,222
(You're done?)

114
00:05:26,223 --> 00:05:28,122
Everyone.

115
00:05:28,123 --> 00:05:29,193
(I'll go get my drawing.)

116
00:05:29,194 --> 00:05:30,223
Come closer.

117
00:05:30,394 --> 00:05:31,634
I can't wait to see it.

118
00:05:32,334 --> 00:05:34,233
In 1, 2, 3.

119
00:05:36,363 --> 00:05:37,473
I want to see it.

120
00:05:39,904 --> 00:05:41,144
Awesome.

121
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:45,013
(Oiva loves it.)

122
00:05:45,014 --> 00:05:46,144
Thank you.

123
00:05:46,243 --> 00:05:47,713
Wait a second.

124
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:49,384
- Goodness. - Wait a second.

125
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:52,714
Awesome.

126
00:05:54,923 --> 00:05:55,923
There you go.

127
00:05:55,924 --> 00:05:57,653
(It looks exactly like him. Good job, Hwicasso.)

128
00:05:57,654 --> 00:05:59,493
- Okay. - That's a great drawing.

129
00:05:59,694 --> 00:06:00,992
- And Oiva. - Thank you.

130
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:02,524
We have some more gifts.

131
00:06:03,423 --> 00:06:05,732
This is Korean dried laver. Do you know about it?

132
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:07,564
- Oh, I know. - Yes.

133
00:06:07,764 --> 00:06:08,764
(The Planner, the day when he packed his bags)

134
00:06:08,765 --> 00:06:10,404
For the landlords...

135
00:06:11,173 --> 00:06:13,274
I'd like to give them some gifts.

136
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:15,944
First, I bought some dried laver.

137
00:06:16,344 --> 00:06:19,943
I heard that dried laver...

138
00:06:19,944 --> 00:06:22,384
was really popular among foreigners.

139
00:06:22,913 --> 00:06:24,483
So I prepared it.

140
00:06:25,654 --> 00:06:26,714
Isn't it so cute?

141
00:06:26,913 --> 00:06:27,922
It's so pretty.

142
00:06:27,923 --> 00:06:29,723
(After much consideration...)

143
00:06:30,384 --> 00:06:32,222
It's an accessory box.

144
00:06:32,223 --> 00:06:34,264
Inside... Gosh, it's so pretty.

145
00:06:34,923 --> 00:06:36,023
I'd like to have one too.

146
00:06:36,024 --> 00:06:37,964
It feels like I'll choose this one.

147
00:06:39,194 --> 00:06:40,432
This is Korean dried laver.

148
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:43,802
(They express their gratitude to Oiva as well.)

149
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:44,904
I like it a lot.

150
00:06:45,103 --> 00:06:48,144
This is kind of... A little cabinet...

151
00:06:48,444 --> 00:06:51,742
which is designed by Korean traditional...

152
00:06:51,743 --> 00:06:52,872
- Traditional... - patterns.

153
00:06:52,873 --> 00:06:54,444
Oh, thank you. Nice.

154
00:06:54,783 --> 00:06:55,843
Thank you very much.

155
00:06:55,844 --> 00:06:57,713
- Goodness. - That was so delicate of you.

156
00:06:57,714 --> 00:06:59,084
(Good job, Dong Yeon)

157
00:06:59,654 --> 00:07:03,754
So, I have to say goodbye.

158
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:05,894
I have to go.

159
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:07,123
Goodbye.

160
00:07:07,564 --> 00:07:08,963
Goodbye.

161
00:07:08,964 --> 00:07:11,492
- Goodbye. - Thank you.

162
00:07:11,493 --> 00:07:13,363
- Thank you. - Thank you.

163
00:07:13,493 --> 00:07:15,264
Goodbye and thank you.

164
00:07:15,433 --> 00:07:18,833
Have a nice trip here in Lapland.

165
00:07:18,834 --> 00:07:20,303
- We will. - Come again.

166
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:21,703
- Thank you. - Thank you so much.

167
00:07:21,704 --> 00:07:23,543
- See you. - Bye.

168
00:07:23,574 --> 00:07:24,873
- See you. - Bye.

169
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:27,074
- I'm so grateful. - Thank you.

170
00:07:27,243 --> 00:07:29,113
- Seriously. - He has such a warm heart.

171
00:07:29,214 --> 00:07:30,583
He's like a welcoming uncle...

172
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:33,182
you see in cartoons.

173
00:07:33,183 --> 00:07:35,723
You're right. He really is.

174
00:07:36,754 --> 00:07:38,823
Thanks to him,

175
00:07:38,824 --> 00:07:40,922
- we were able to adapt easily. - That's right.

176
00:07:40,923 --> 00:07:42,063
(Uncle Oiva puts the gifts from his nephews in his backpack.)

177
00:07:42,064 --> 00:07:43,722
We spent two...

178
00:07:43,723 --> 00:07:46,032
happy days here.

179
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:47,093
Yes, we did.

180
00:07:47,094 --> 00:07:50,872
(Thanks to Oiva, they found oma rauha, their own peace.)

181
00:07:50,873 --> 00:07:53,334
- It's so beautiful here. - It really is.

182
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,574
I know.

183
00:07:56,644 --> 00:08:01,084
(They start a new journey to their third rented place.)

184
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:08,623
- Gosh. - Careful.

185
00:08:10,483 --> 00:08:11,992
There is a reindeer in front of us.

186
00:08:11,993 --> 00:08:13,293
(A reindeer is here to see them off.)

187
00:08:13,553 --> 00:08:14,764
I'll turn the hazard lights on.

188
00:08:15,064 --> 00:08:16,394
Move, reindeer.

189
00:08:16,993 --> 00:08:18,363
It won't get out of the way.

190
00:08:18,594 --> 00:08:19,663
Go slowly.

191
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,662
It's moving in a zigzag.

192
00:08:21,663 --> 00:08:23,063
(It's escorting the Renters.)

193
00:08:23,064 --> 00:08:24,533
It's moving in an "S" shape.

194
00:08:24,603 --> 00:08:25,704
- It's cute. - It's going.

195
00:08:26,774 --> 00:08:28,972
- Wait. - It's moving to the right.

196
00:08:28,973 --> 00:08:30,813
Wait. It's getting off the road.

197
00:08:30,814 --> 00:08:31,844
(Goodbye, Renters.)

198
00:08:32,043 --> 00:08:33,414
It's so cute.

199
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:35,382
- Bye. - Goodbye.

200
00:08:35,383 --> 00:08:36,444
(It'll be sad not to see reindeers in Korea.)

201
00:08:37,113 --> 00:08:39,352
(They have a good feeling about the move after seeing the reindeer.)

202
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:41,783
- I think I can speed up now. - Of course.

203
00:08:41,784 --> 00:08:42,784
(Let's speed up now!)

204
00:08:42,785 --> 00:08:44,553
I was worried it'll be too bumpy in the back.

205
00:08:44,554 --> 00:08:45,623
It's okay.

206
00:08:46,554 --> 00:08:49,723
(In order to get out of this place,)

207
00:08:50,893 --> 00:08:52,593
(they have to drive a curvy unpaved road...)

208
00:08:52,594 --> 00:08:55,834
(for 20km.)

209
00:08:56,964 --> 00:09:01,844
(They have to drive 30 minutes to leave the forest.)

210
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:04,443
(They still have a long way to go.)

211
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:06,813
We didn't get gas...

212
00:09:06,814 --> 00:09:09,142
after renting the car, but we're still fine.

213
00:09:09,143 --> 00:09:11,413
I was actually going to mention that when we left the forest.

214
00:09:11,414 --> 00:09:14,084
We're dangerously low on gas.

215
00:09:15,383 --> 00:09:16,853
Really?

216
00:09:17,393 --> 00:09:19,323
- Don't you see it on the dashboard? - How far can we go?

217
00:09:19,324 --> 00:09:20,453
We can drive 30km.

218
00:09:20,454 --> 00:09:21,564
- What? - Only 30km?

219
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:22,763
We should go straight to a gas station.

220
00:09:23,094 --> 00:09:24,333
We can only go 30km now?

221
00:09:24,334 --> 00:09:25,794
Yes, look at it.

222
00:09:26,263 --> 00:09:28,233
I'm sure that isn't true.

223
00:09:28,363 --> 00:09:30,563
I don't know the gas mileage of this car,

224
00:09:30,564 --> 00:09:31,804
but we don't have much gas left.

225
00:09:32,334 --> 00:09:34,473
We didn't get any gas while we were here.

226
00:09:34,603 --> 00:09:36,574
- You're right. - Although we were driving a lot.

227
00:09:36,704 --> 00:09:37,973
Let's go straight to a gas station.

228
00:09:38,074 --> 00:09:41,544
Check how far the gas station is.

229
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,544
- We don't have reception. - I know where it is.

230
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:45,184
- We saw it before. - Right, we don't have reception.

231
00:09:45,353 --> 00:09:46,353
I know where the gas station is.

232
00:09:46,354 --> 00:09:48,982
It was in downtown Posio.

233
00:09:48,983 --> 00:09:50,522
- Right. - Where we had coffee?

234
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:51,652
- It's near the cafe. - Yes.

235
00:09:51,653 --> 00:09:53,424
- I remember. - Near the cafe?

236
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:54,862
It's near the cafe.

237
00:09:54,863 --> 00:09:56,263
- You're right. It's there. - I saw it.

238
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,963
Hearing that we don't have much gas left...

239
00:09:58,964 --> 00:10:00,232
makes me nervous.

240
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:02,103
(It's approximately a 50-minute drive to town.)

241
00:10:02,204 --> 00:10:05,433
(Will the gas last that long?)

242
00:10:05,434 --> 00:10:07,973
Why does the way out seem longer?

243
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:09,102
I know. We should be out by now.

244
00:10:09,103 --> 00:10:10,304
- It's because we're anxious. - Right.

245
00:10:10,503 --> 00:10:12,612
I'm worried. I hope we're okay.

246
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:15,584
(The unpaved road stretches out endlessly.)

247
00:10:16,044 --> 00:10:18,813
People should carry extra gas around...

248
00:10:18,814 --> 00:10:20,013
in areas like this.

249
00:10:20,714 --> 00:10:21,723
You're right.

250
00:10:22,023 --> 00:10:25,023
You don't even have reception.

251
00:10:25,123 --> 00:10:27,563
- That's right. - If you have an emergency,

252
00:10:27,564 --> 00:10:29,923
- how will you call for help? - I don't know.

253
00:10:29,924 --> 00:10:32,632
- You'd be in trouble. - That can't happen.

254
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:34,603
(You can't call the insurance company and will be in big trouble.)

255
00:10:37,674 --> 00:10:38,903
It went down to 20km.

256
00:10:39,434 --> 00:10:40,574
- It's 20km? - Yes.

257
00:10:40,603 --> 00:10:41,973
Then the car will stop soon.

258
00:10:46,214 --> 00:10:50,044
(They haven't even gotten to the end of the unpaved road yet.)

259
00:10:51,414 --> 00:10:54,324
(Glancing at the dashboard)

260
00:10:55,324 --> 00:10:59,123
(Feeling nervous, he keeps checking how far they can go.)

261
00:11:00,723 --> 00:11:03,793
(Their faces turn darker as they continue driving.)

262
00:11:03,794 --> 00:11:04,863
I feel anxious.

263
00:11:05,993 --> 00:11:08,033
(After driving for a while feeling anxious)

264
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:09,863
- I'm worried. - What should we do?

265
00:11:11,174 --> 00:11:12,972
It's the road.

266
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:14,372
- We see it. - We see it.

267
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:15,643
(They finally see the paved road.)

268
00:11:15,773 --> 00:11:18,414
You have to drive for best gas mileage now.

269
00:11:20,273 --> 00:11:22,413
I'm worried, but we'll be okay, right?

270
00:11:22,414 --> 00:11:23,414
(Worried the car might stop)

271
00:11:23,444 --> 00:11:25,382
I think we're near Posio.

272
00:11:25,383 --> 00:11:26,482
- We're almost there. - Yes.

273
00:11:26,483 --> 00:11:27,753
- We just need to go a bit further. - We're almost there.

274
00:11:28,023 --> 00:11:29,652
- All right. - Please.

275
00:11:29,653 --> 00:11:32,653
(There are gas stations everywhere in Seoul.)

276
00:11:33,094 --> 00:11:35,163
(Who knew it would be so hard to find one here?)

277
00:11:35,164 --> 00:11:36,223
We're almost there.

278
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:39,132
(Keeping his eyes forward)

279
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:40,263
It's the gas station.

280
00:11:40,564 --> 00:11:42,103
- Okay. - I see it.

281
00:11:43,434 --> 00:11:44,434
It's the gas station.

282
00:11:44,873 --> 00:11:46,403
- Okay. - I see it.

283
00:11:47,434 --> 00:11:48,742
- It's over there. - There's a supermarket.

284
00:11:48,743 --> 00:11:49,804
- ABC. - ABC.

285
00:11:50,174 --> 00:11:51,214
This is a relief.

286
00:11:52,814 --> 00:11:53,944
It's 1.9 euros?

287
00:11:54,544 --> 00:11:55,643
- My gosh. - How much?

288
00:11:55,784 --> 00:11:56,784
Let's see.

289
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:58,653
Gas isn't cheap here.

290
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:00,453
It's around three dollars per liter.

291
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:01,823
(It's 2 euros per liter, almost twice the price of Korea.)

292
00:12:01,824 --> 00:12:02,853
It's expensive.

293
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:04,252
Let's put the cash in.

294
00:12:04,253 --> 00:12:05,593
(How much do they need?)

295
00:12:05,594 --> 00:12:07,123
- It's below that. - How much?

296
00:12:07,564 --> 00:12:09,623
- How much should I add? - Let's try 50 euros.

297
00:12:09,893 --> 00:12:10,893
That much?

298
00:12:10,894 --> 00:12:12,064
- Fifty euros. - Fifty euros?

299
00:12:12,564 --> 00:12:13,964
- Fifty euros? - Yes, for now.

300
00:12:14,564 --> 00:12:19,674
(Having been terrified because of low gas, he spends generously.)

301
00:12:20,233 --> 00:12:21,344
- There. - Here we go.

302
00:12:23,473 --> 00:12:24,473
It won't go in.

303
00:12:24,474 --> 00:12:26,173
(Unresponsive)

304
00:12:26,174 --> 00:12:27,214
It's spitting it back out.

305
00:12:29,143 --> 00:12:32,882
Is this right? Does the picture mean this?

306
00:12:32,883 --> 00:12:34,482
(The picture seems to indicate this is where the money goes in.)

307
00:12:34,483 --> 00:12:35,554
Why won't it take the money?

308
00:12:36,954 --> 00:12:38,153
Should we try a 20-euro note?

309
00:12:39,054 --> 00:12:40,852
It has a drawing of a 50-euro note.

310
00:12:40,853 --> 00:12:43,323
(They try a 20-euro note just in case.)

311
00:12:43,324 --> 00:12:44,334
It's not working.

312
00:12:44,733 --> 00:12:46,293
It goes in this way. Right?

313
00:12:46,294 --> 00:12:48,433
(They put their heads together to figure it out.)

314
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,564
Here.

315
00:12:50,064 --> 00:12:51,102
- It goes in this way. - Yes.

316
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,703
(They try putting the note in the opposite way.)

317
00:12:52,704 --> 00:12:54,003
- It isn't working. - No.

318
00:12:54,103 --> 00:12:55,903
You have to feel the same pull.

319
00:12:56,174 --> 00:12:58,443
It won't take the money I'm inserting.

320
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,012
(It won't take the money I'm inserting.)

321
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:01,184
Maybe it has to go in like this.

322
00:13:01,684 --> 00:13:02,843
- Like the picture? - Yes.

323
00:13:02,844 --> 00:13:04,012
(An endless picture guessing struggle)

324
00:13:04,013 --> 00:13:05,314
- It isn't working. - I wonder why.

325
00:13:07,414 --> 00:13:09,153
Come to think of it,

326
00:13:09,883 --> 00:13:11,924
I've never paid cash for gas.

327
00:13:12,554 --> 00:13:13,694
- Right? - Yes.

328
00:13:15,023 --> 00:13:16,423
It goes in like this. Right?

329
00:13:16,424 --> 00:13:18,392
(Je Hoon, the eldest, goes somewhere.)

330
00:13:18,393 --> 00:13:19,492
- Hi. - Hi.

331
00:13:19,493 --> 00:13:20,963
- Can I ask you something? - Yes.

332
00:13:20,964 --> 00:13:23,663
Could you please check the gas machine?

333
00:13:23,664 --> 00:13:25,402
Yes, I can help you.

334
00:13:25,403 --> 00:13:26,633
Thank you.

335
00:13:26,804 --> 00:13:28,073
Thank you.

336
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:30,043
(I brought help, guys.)

337
00:13:30,044 --> 00:13:31,814
Please. We don't have fuel.

338
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:34,613
- Please. - It'll work.

339
00:13:34,743 --> 00:13:37,112
- Look here. - Yes.

340
00:13:37,113 --> 00:13:38,653
There is a picture here.

341
00:13:39,513 --> 00:13:40,714
- Over here. - Okay.

342
00:13:41,324 --> 00:13:44,184
(That's what we kept doing.)

343
00:13:46,554 --> 00:13:48,663
(It still doesn't work.)

344
00:13:48,664 --> 00:13:50,263
Is it the wrong direction?

345
00:13:50,623 --> 00:13:52,334
- Nothing is happening. - It's the same as the picture.

346
00:13:52,993 --> 00:13:54,763
We can try it this way.

347
00:13:54,804 --> 00:13:55,862
The opposite way?

348
00:13:55,863 --> 00:13:57,803
(The local tries the same thing as the Renters.)

349
00:13:57,804 --> 00:13:58,873
What?

350
00:13:59,204 --> 00:14:00,934
(What?)

351
00:14:01,944 --> 00:14:03,173
Yes.

352
00:14:03,174 --> 00:14:05,273
- Nice. - Thank you so much.

353
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,213
We could've been in trouble. It's working now.

354
00:14:07,214 --> 00:14:09,044
Now it says...

355
00:14:09,113 --> 00:14:10,314
- One. - That one?

356
00:14:10,513 --> 00:14:11,513
Is that right?

357
00:14:11,714 --> 00:14:14,653
Now you can get gas.

358
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:15,882
- Should I? - Yes.

359
00:14:15,883 --> 00:14:17,693
- Is it 95? - Yes, 95E10.

360
00:14:17,694 --> 00:14:19,694
(The Renters luckily escape the crisis.)

361
00:14:20,753 --> 00:14:21,963
- There you go. - All right.

362
00:14:21,964 --> 00:14:23,423
- Okay. - It's working.

363
00:14:23,424 --> 00:14:25,093
- Thank you. - Thank you so much.

364
00:14:25,094 --> 00:14:26,463
- Thank you. - Thank you.

365
00:14:26,464 --> 00:14:27,862
- Thank you. - Thank you.

366
00:14:27,863 --> 00:14:29,333
- Thank you. - Thank you.

367
00:14:29,334 --> 00:14:30,703
(They get gas thanks to the kindness of a passerby.)

368
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,602
We only added 50 euros,

369
00:14:32,603 --> 00:14:34,503
but the price is going up rapidly.

370
00:14:35,544 --> 00:14:37,003
I don't think we'll be able to get much gas.

371
00:14:38,814 --> 00:14:43,084
(50 euros disappears in a blink.)

372
00:14:44,113 --> 00:14:45,453
Let's get every last drop.

373
00:14:45,454 --> 00:14:46,512
(Shaking every last drop off)

374
00:14:46,513 --> 00:14:49,152
(Gas station hack of a frugal man)

375
00:14:49,153 --> 00:14:50,153
Okay.

376
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:52,392
- Dong Yeon. - Nice.

377
00:14:52,393 --> 00:14:53,653
You'll get us a bit further.

378
00:14:54,924 --> 00:14:56,823
- We'll go another 300m. - That's right.

379
00:14:56,824 --> 00:14:58,334
- Shall we go? - Let's go.

380
00:14:59,133 --> 00:15:00,293
(After solving their problem, they head for the third rented room.)

381
00:15:00,294 --> 00:15:01,303
I was nervous.

382
00:15:01,304 --> 00:15:02,964
- It's a relief we got help. - I know.

383
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,574
Here we go.

384
00:15:05,003 --> 00:15:06,033
Let's go.

385
00:15:06,034 --> 00:15:07,132
(Posio to Kemijarvi)

386
00:15:07,133 --> 00:15:08,573
(2 hours)

387
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,643
- How long does it take? - My gosh.

388
00:15:11,513 --> 00:15:13,242
(After solving the urgent problem,)

389
00:15:13,243 --> 00:15:16,043
(they suddenly get hungry.)

390
00:15:16,044 --> 00:15:17,044
You know.

391
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:19,482
The blackcurrant pie was so good.

392
00:15:19,483 --> 00:15:20,483
- It was the best. - Yes, it was.

393
00:15:20,483 --> 00:15:21,483
With custard cream.

394
00:15:21,484 --> 00:15:22,783
The custard cream was amazing.

395
00:15:22,784 --> 00:15:24,393
(Their hunger reminds them of the previous day's breakfast.)

396
00:15:24,853 --> 00:15:27,924
(He licks his lips.)

397
00:15:29,393 --> 00:15:31,633
(Thinking about something)

398
00:15:31,863 --> 00:15:34,233
Should we go to the restaurant Oiva recommended?

399
00:15:34,363 --> 00:15:35,434
Sounds good.

400
00:15:35,503 --> 00:15:38,333
It's called Lapin Satu. Please enjoy.

401
00:15:38,334 --> 00:15:39,533
- Okay, thank you. - Nice.

402
00:15:39,534 --> 00:15:41,304
(Oiva recommended a restaurant he is a regular at.)

403
00:15:41,743 --> 00:15:43,204
We should travel on a full stomach.

404
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:45,213
- You're right. - Let's go.

405
00:15:45,214 --> 00:15:46,612
- Let's go. - Let's have lunch.

406
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:47,784
(They only get to eat out on moving days.)

407
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:49,814
Look at the clouds.

408
00:15:51,113 --> 00:15:53,814
It's a view I want to share with everyone I care about.

409
00:15:54,214 --> 00:15:56,653
You showed it to the three people you care about.

410
00:15:58,523 --> 00:15:59,694
- Is that it? - Is that it?

411
00:15:59,924 --> 00:16:00,993
It's nice.

412
00:16:01,964 --> 00:16:03,723
Yes, it's Lapin Satu.

413
00:16:04,493 --> 00:16:06,433
- Thanks for driving. - Okay.

414
00:16:06,434 --> 00:16:07,533
(The restaurant Oiva frequents at the end of a tree-lined road)

415
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:09,263
We were right. It says "restaurant."

416
00:16:11,273 --> 00:16:13,033
As soon as you opened the door,

417
00:16:13,034 --> 00:16:14,872
- I could smell tasty food. - What's this?

418
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:16,902
- I smell curry. - Right? It smells like curry.

419
00:16:16,903 --> 00:16:18,772
(Super excited)

420
00:16:18,773 --> 00:16:20,742
- It's food I like. - It's really curry.

421
00:16:20,743 --> 00:16:22,313
- Right? - I told you.

422
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,043
- Chicken curry. - It's chicken curry.

423
00:16:24,044 --> 00:16:25,853
- Hello. - Hello.

424
00:16:26,013 --> 00:16:27,983
- Hello. - Hello.

425
00:16:28,353 --> 00:16:29,752
- Welcome. - Hello.

426
00:16:29,753 --> 00:16:31,253
(The warm-looking owner welcomes them.)

427
00:16:34,993 --> 00:16:38,034
(A buffet of Lapland homestyle dishes)

428
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:42,603
(The menu is handwritten.)

429
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:47,574
(The cozy interior makes them feel like visiting someone's home.)

430
00:16:48,243 --> 00:16:52,844
(The homestyle dishes are simple but nicely laid out.)

431
00:16:53,314 --> 00:16:54,843
- Chicken curry. - Yes.

432
00:16:54,844 --> 00:16:56,012
(Chicken curry, perfect for a meal and loved by moms)

433
00:16:56,013 --> 00:16:57,512
Meatballs.

434
00:16:57,513 --> 00:16:58,713
- Meatballs. - Nice, meatballs.

435
00:16:58,714 --> 00:16:59,784
They even have meatballs.

436
00:16:59,954 --> 00:17:02,083
- Fish. - Fish.

437
00:17:02,084 --> 00:17:03,652
- It's muikku. - Muikku.

438
00:17:03,653 --> 00:17:05,994
(Fried muikku, the highlight of the buffet)

439
00:17:06,153 --> 00:17:07,892
(Fried muikku: A traditional festive Finnish dish...)

440
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:10,064
(of fried vendace)

441
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:14,834
(It's the crispy lake snack loved by the people of Lapland.)

442
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,862
This is what it looks like.

443
00:17:16,863 --> 00:17:18,504
- Yes, it's the famous muikku. - Yes.

444
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,573
It looks tasty. I'm going to have so much.

445
00:17:20,574 --> 00:17:21,673
Look at that.

446
00:17:21,844 --> 00:17:23,073
I'm starving.

447
00:17:23,074 --> 00:17:24,912
(The simple but nice homestyle meal recommended by Oiva)

448
00:17:24,913 --> 00:17:27,142
- Enjoy. - Gosh.

449
00:17:27,143 --> 00:17:28,814
- Is it a buffet? - Yes, it's a buffet.

450
00:17:28,984 --> 00:17:31,583
- I see. - We can eat all we want.

451
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:33,053
- Yes. - We can do this.

452
00:17:33,054 --> 00:17:34,883
- Let's eat enough to skip dinner. - Okay.

453
00:17:36,024 --> 00:17:37,053
Did you hear what Dong Yeon said?

454
00:17:37,054 --> 00:17:38,523
He wants to eat enough for lunch and dinner.

455
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:39,524
(He's trying to make the most out of food cooked by someone else.)

456
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,523
- We can give it a try. - He's hardcore.

457
00:17:41,524 --> 00:17:42,763
- Thank you. - Thank you.

458
00:17:42,764 --> 00:17:43,793
- Thank you. - Let's eat.

459
00:17:43,794 --> 00:17:45,994
- Let's eat. I'm starving. - I'm hungry.

460
00:17:46,963 --> 00:17:48,102
I'm starving.

461
00:17:48,103 --> 00:17:49,564
(Let's enjoy the buffet of Lapland.)

462
00:17:49,663 --> 00:17:50,703
This looks tasty.

463
00:17:51,133 --> 00:17:52,633
You can't go wrong with this.

464
00:17:53,034 --> 00:17:54,203
I took too much.

465
00:17:55,504 --> 00:17:56,743
- You should eat a lot. - The side dishes.

466
00:17:56,744 --> 00:17:57,973
I have to eat the other dishes.

467
00:17:57,974 --> 00:17:59,642
Let's eat as much as we can.

468
00:17:59,643 --> 00:18:00,813
- You have to eat a lot. - Shall we?

469
00:18:00,814 --> 00:18:02,643
(They are ready to dig into the food laid out in front of their eyes.)

470
00:18:03,814 --> 00:18:05,783
(The more rice the better.)

471
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:07,153
- I can't stop singing. - Muikku.

472
00:18:07,584 --> 00:18:09,284
I wonder how it tastes.

473
00:18:09,584 --> 00:18:10,653
I'm curious.

474
00:18:12,853 --> 00:18:13,993
I like this kind of food.

475
00:18:13,994 --> 00:18:15,593
(Curious of its taste, he takes a lot.)

476
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:16,724
It looks amazing.

477
00:18:17,094 --> 00:18:19,892
- Mashed potatoes. - You know what? I love curry.

478
00:18:19,893 --> 00:18:20,893
Me too.

479
00:18:20,894 --> 00:18:22,033
(This is how the serious planner takes food at a buffet.)

480
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:23,304
I'm so happy.

481
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:25,234
They have mashed potatoes.

482
00:18:27,074 --> 00:18:28,642
- This looks amazing. - Gosh.

483
00:18:28,643 --> 00:18:31,613
(It's like playing Tetris on his plate.)

484
00:18:33,574 --> 00:18:34,784
My goodness.

485
00:18:35,383 --> 00:18:37,013
It's like the craft service...

486
00:18:37,014 --> 00:18:38,613
- in Korea. - Right.

487
00:18:38,913 --> 00:18:40,084
You're right.

488
00:18:40,254 --> 00:18:42,382
If the craft service is like this,

489
00:18:42,383 --> 00:18:43,852
- I eat like crazy. - I see.

490
00:18:43,853 --> 00:18:45,494
My plate is even heavy right now.

491
00:18:46,353 --> 00:18:47,892
(And this place's hidden place!)

492
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:49,264
My goodness.

493
00:18:52,193 --> 00:18:54,064
I can't believe this.

494
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:55,932
It's so pretty here.

495
00:18:55,933 --> 00:18:57,132
(It's an outdoor terrace to enjoy the lake view.)

496
00:18:57,133 --> 00:18:58,974
- Isn't it amazing? - I love it, Je Hoon.

497
00:18:59,804 --> 00:19:02,102
- Okay. Thanks for the food. - Enjoy.

498
00:19:02,103 --> 00:19:03,804
- Help yourselves. - Gosh.

499
00:19:04,474 --> 00:19:05,843
What was the name of the fish again?

500
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:07,314
- Muikku. - Muikku.

501
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:08,843
Muikku?

502
00:19:08,844 --> 00:19:11,513
(How do they like muikku they're trying for the first time?)

503
00:19:11,514 --> 00:19:12,613
Muikku.

504
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:21,192
- Hey, muikku tastes good. - Is it?

505
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:22,423
(Muikku tastes good.)

506
00:19:24,494 --> 00:19:25,662
(He can't stop humming.)

507
00:19:25,663 --> 00:19:27,362
- How is it? - It's so good.

508
00:19:27,363 --> 00:19:28,462
(It suits the Renters' palates.)

509
00:19:28,463 --> 00:19:29,504
It's so tasty.

510
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:31,974
It's my type of fish.

511
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:33,803
It's good.

512
00:19:33,804 --> 00:19:35,102
(It's crunchy and savory like a light version of fried smelt.)

513
00:19:35,103 --> 00:19:38,013
I can really eat until dinner here.

514
00:19:38,014 --> 00:19:39,113
Yes.

515
00:19:39,814 --> 00:19:42,583
It's just so good.

516
00:19:42,584 --> 00:19:43,843
(The home-cooking of Lapland suits their palates.)

517
00:19:43,844 --> 00:19:44,913
It's amazing.

518
00:19:44,953 --> 00:19:47,314
It's interesting. Seriously.

519
00:19:47,584 --> 00:19:50,422
- It has soft flavors. - It's soft.

520
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:52,852
- It's crazy. - This is crazy.

521
00:19:52,853 --> 00:19:54,023
(He has been using the knife only to cut the ingredients.)

522
00:19:54,024 --> 00:19:56,123
- This is my type of food. - That's true.

523
00:19:56,393 --> 00:19:57,493
- Is it on me? - No. It's all right.

524
00:19:57,494 --> 00:19:58,862
(A day like this does come, indeed.)

525
00:19:58,863 --> 00:20:00,264
What? Is it boneless?

526
00:20:00,963 --> 00:20:02,133
Really?

527
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:04,333
- Is the chicken boneless? - Is it?

528
00:20:04,334 --> 00:20:06,304
I can't help but have two more pieces, then.

529
00:20:06,734 --> 00:20:08,872
- Gosh. It's boneless chicken. - Isn't it crazy?

530
00:20:08,873 --> 00:20:11,142
Dong Yeon, let's get some chicken breast, the protein.

531
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:12,474
This is crazy.

532
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,043
Why is the chicken breast so soft?

533
00:20:14,044 --> 00:20:16,514
(Taking another plate of boneless chicken with ease!)

534
00:20:17,314 --> 00:20:18,452
The meatballs are tasty too.

535
00:20:18,453 --> 00:20:20,212
(The handmade meatballs are tasty too!)

536
00:20:20,213 --> 00:20:22,453
- The meatballs are really tasty. - Yes. They're tasty.

537
00:20:22,923 --> 00:20:25,193
- Thank you, Dong Yeon. - Thank you.

538
00:20:25,994 --> 00:20:28,063
When you brought it,

539
00:20:28,064 --> 00:20:29,392
it looked like you made it.

540
00:20:29,393 --> 00:20:30,422
(Laughing)

541
00:20:30,423 --> 00:20:31,594
You have that energy.

542
00:20:32,334 --> 00:20:34,192
Right? It's because I've been cooking.

543
00:20:34,193 --> 00:20:35,203
(Mistaking him unconsciously)

544
00:20:35,304 --> 00:20:37,834
Curry is really nice too.

545
00:20:37,863 --> 00:20:39,003
It's light.

546
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,672
I'll get more curry.

547
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:42,574
(I'll refill it again because the curry tastes good.)

548
00:20:45,274 --> 00:20:48,343
(At the cottage, they had to split firewood and make fire.)

549
00:20:48,344 --> 00:20:50,683
It's amazing and interesting.

550
00:20:51,213 --> 00:20:53,484
- Nothing would taste bad here. - Right.

551
00:20:54,383 --> 00:20:56,484
(Laughing)

552
00:20:58,123 --> 00:20:59,223
I almost choked on food.

553
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:00,754
(He almost choked because he ate too fast.)

554
00:21:01,224 --> 00:21:03,962
I love how they serve it as a buffet.

555
00:21:03,963 --> 00:21:05,094
- Right. - Yes.

556
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,234
Has anyone brought...

557
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:09,663
a container from the cottage?

558
00:21:10,863 --> 00:21:12,132
I want to...

559
00:21:12,133 --> 00:21:13,603
Don't embarrass me.

560
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:15,872
- It's that good. - Right.

561
00:21:15,873 --> 00:21:18,004
(It's that good.)

562
00:21:18,574 --> 00:21:20,513
Everything would taste great at a place like this.

563
00:21:20,514 --> 00:21:23,443
(Their forks won't stop moving.)

564
00:21:23,744 --> 00:21:25,382
If you eat this well,

565
00:21:25,383 --> 00:21:27,014
- it means it's really good. - Right.

566
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:30,352
I've never seen you eat this well.

567
00:21:30,353 --> 00:21:32,224
- He's on fire. - He's eating well.

568
00:21:32,353 --> 00:21:34,122
My stomach has opened up after eating this.

569
00:21:34,123 --> 00:21:35,423
(My stomach has opened up after eating this.)

570
00:21:36,294 --> 00:21:37,462
I love it.

571
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:38,933
(The king of self-control's appetite is on fire in Lapland.)

572
00:21:39,863 --> 00:21:44,163
(The Lapland's magic lets them put the guard down.)

573
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:45,433
Gosh. It's so good.

574
00:21:47,304 --> 00:21:49,274
The restaurants have different vibes, don't they?

575
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:51,372
- Right. They're so different. - Of course.

576
00:21:51,373 --> 00:21:52,813
How should I put it?

577
00:21:52,814 --> 00:21:56,412
- It feels like having a meal... - Right.

578
00:21:56,413 --> 00:21:59,054
- at a kin's or neighbor's house. - Right.

579
00:22:00,784 --> 00:22:02,622
"This is how we live."

580
00:22:02,623 --> 00:22:05,352
"You can come again anytime." That's how it feels.

581
00:22:05,353 --> 00:22:06,452
- You're right. - Right.

582
00:22:06,453 --> 00:22:08,192
- It's... - It's not showy.

583
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:09,662
(It's candid.)

584
00:22:09,663 --> 00:22:10,794
Eat more.

585
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:15,132
You must be busy, but we have to be careful...

586
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:16,162
Is there a bee?

587
00:22:16,163 --> 00:22:17,963
- Really? - Be careful.

588
00:22:19,234 --> 00:22:20,672
Just stay still.

589
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,102
(Running into Je Hoon's arms as a bee appears)

590
00:22:22,103 --> 00:22:23,843
- It's gone. - Now,

591
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:25,443
- it's after you. - It's near you this time.

592
00:22:26,413 --> 00:22:27,843
(Scared)

593
00:22:27,844 --> 00:22:30,383
(Je Hoon runs into Eun Woo's arms this time.)

594
00:22:31,084 --> 00:22:32,852
It's a small one,

595
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:34,953
so it's all right.

596
00:22:35,453 --> 00:22:36,622
My goodness.

597
00:22:36,623 --> 00:22:38,852
(They finish eating with a bee incident.)

598
00:22:38,853 --> 00:22:40,153
Now, shall we get going?

599
00:22:40,594 --> 00:22:43,264
- They must be waiting for us. - Sounds good.

600
00:22:43,794 --> 00:22:45,593
- Thanks for the food. - Thanks for the food.

601
00:22:45,594 --> 00:22:47,094
- Yes. Thanks. - Let's go.

602
00:22:47,693 --> 00:22:48,932
Let's go.

603
00:22:48,933 --> 00:22:50,233
(They head to the next rented home, leaving happy mealtime behind.)

604
00:22:50,234 --> 00:22:51,834
I ate so much at lunch.

605
00:22:52,004 --> 00:22:53,733
- I ate so much too. - Right.

606
00:22:53,734 --> 00:22:55,373
- You ate well. - I had two.

607
00:22:56,344 --> 00:22:57,504
Gosh.

608
00:22:57,943 --> 00:22:59,973
It's nice to have xylitol after a meal.

609
00:22:59,974 --> 00:23:01,244
(They have to have xylitol after a meal now!)

610
00:23:01,683 --> 00:23:03,284
For dinner,

611
00:23:03,643 --> 00:23:05,014
are we making pasta?

612
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:07,284
- I thought about it. - Yes.

613
00:23:08,224 --> 00:23:09,723
Since it's a new place,

614
00:23:09,724 --> 00:23:11,224
- with a fresh heart, - Yes.

615
00:23:12,153 --> 00:23:15,294
what can we make together by joining forces?

616
00:23:16,064 --> 00:23:17,192
I like the idea of joining forces.

617
00:23:17,193 --> 00:23:18,793
I thought of the remaining ingredients.

618
00:23:18,794 --> 00:23:20,933
We have to use up the onions and green onions.

619
00:23:21,334 --> 00:23:22,932
- Due to their condition? - Before they go bad.

620
00:23:22,933 --> 00:23:24,432
So, like I mentioned before,

621
00:23:24,433 --> 00:23:26,333
we can make green onion kimchi or onion kimchi.

622
00:23:26,334 --> 00:23:28,443
- Sounds good. - We can make them.

623
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:31,202
I'll make omelet rice.

624
00:23:31,203 --> 00:23:32,712
(The main dish for dinner will be omelet rice.)

625
00:23:32,713 --> 00:23:33,873
Also,

626
00:23:34,574 --> 00:23:36,942
we can make stir-fried sausages and vegetables.

627
00:23:36,943 --> 00:23:38,653
- It's easy to make. - I'd love that.

628
00:23:39,014 --> 00:23:40,554
Do you have a recipe for it?

629
00:23:40,584 --> 00:23:41,882
I do.

630
00:23:41,883 --> 00:23:43,183
- In that case, - I do have a recipe for it.

631
00:23:43,453 --> 00:23:45,653
I don't want to be rude or anything, but...

632
00:23:45,754 --> 00:23:48,263
I made you...

633
00:23:48,264 --> 00:23:50,763
- delicious blueberry jam before. - Right.

634
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:53,192
Can I try making the stir-fried sausages and vegetables...

635
00:23:53,193 --> 00:23:54,293
since there's a recipe?

636
00:23:54,294 --> 00:23:55,804
You're being a bit rude.

637
00:23:56,734 --> 00:23:58,702
(Je Hoon has developed an interest in cooking.)

638
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:01,642
Honestly, after making the jam, my trust in Je Hoon...

639
00:24:01,643 --> 00:24:03,642
has increased dramatically.

640
00:24:03,643 --> 00:24:04,912
That was really good.

641
00:24:04,913 --> 00:24:05,913
(SInce the blueberry jam, his credibility in cooking increased.)

642
00:24:05,914 --> 00:24:08,112
For you,

643
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:11,213
I'll carefully read the recipe and won't do anything stupid...

644
00:24:11,344 --> 00:24:13,652
to make the stir-fried sausages and vegetables.

645
00:24:13,653 --> 00:24:15,122
- Yes. - Sounds good.

646
00:24:15,123 --> 00:24:16,283
In addition to that,

647
00:24:16,284 --> 00:24:18,523
when making the green onion kimchi or omelet rice,

648
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:21,452
we'll prepare the ingredients together.

649
00:24:21,453 --> 00:24:23,863
- Of course. - Okay. We'll help you with that.

650
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:26,363
- We'll help you diligently. - Let's go!

651
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:30,033
Gosh. Green onion kimchi must be so tasty.

652
00:24:30,034 --> 00:24:31,734
(Green onion kimchi must be so tasty.)

653
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:34,942
Gosh. This place is different.

654
00:24:34,943 --> 00:24:36,274
(Gosh. This place is different.)

655
00:24:36,744 --> 00:24:38,643
It has a different vibe.

656
00:24:40,344 --> 00:24:42,712
Doesn't the sky feel so close to the ground?

657
00:24:42,713 --> 00:24:43,843
You're right.

658
00:24:43,844 --> 00:24:47,783
(After a two-hour drive, they enter Kemijarvi!)

659
00:24:47,784 --> 00:24:49,253
I'm not a good painter,

660
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:51,553
but I want to make a watercolor painting...

661
00:24:51,554 --> 00:24:52,652
if there are paints.

662
00:24:52,653 --> 00:24:54,093
- Je Hoon. - Yes.

663
00:24:54,094 --> 00:24:55,263
(Kemijarvi, the kingdom of water!)

664
00:24:55,264 --> 00:24:57,122
If not now, when are you going to paint?

665
00:24:57,123 --> 00:24:58,862
(The kingdom of water! Kemijarvi)

666
00:24:58,863 --> 00:25:01,233
Gosh. The scenery is mind-blowing.

667
00:25:01,234 --> 00:25:03,503
(Kemijarvi: A city surrounded by lakes and rivers)

668
00:25:03,504 --> 00:25:05,803
(It is known for its beautiful waterfront landscape.)

669
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:08,344
("Arvi" of Kemijarvi means a lake.)

670
00:25:09,304 --> 00:25:13,814
(It's a paradise for anglers.)

671
00:25:14,344 --> 00:25:16,583
(Due to clear lakes and rivers,)

672
00:25:16,584 --> 00:25:19,013
(various fish live in Kemijarvi,)

673
00:25:19,014 --> 00:25:21,213
(making it the place to go for the fishing lovers.)

674
00:25:22,383 --> 00:25:26,724
(Welcome to Kemijarvi!)

675
00:25:27,754 --> 00:25:29,264
The power poles have changed.

676
00:25:30,294 --> 00:25:32,734
- They are made of wood. - You're right.

677
00:25:33,094 --> 00:25:35,333
Right. They are wood poles.

678
00:25:35,334 --> 00:25:36,564
(Even the power poles look natural.)

679
00:25:37,804 --> 00:25:40,073
Will they have electricity, then?

680
00:25:40,074 --> 00:25:41,672
(Will they have electricity, then?)

681
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:42,872
- Seems like it. - Exactly.

682
00:25:42,873 --> 00:25:44,173
Sounds good.

683
00:25:44,974 --> 00:25:46,313
You're right.

684
00:25:46,314 --> 00:25:48,244
- Exactly. - The power poles are everywhere.

685
00:25:49,713 --> 00:25:51,212
We'll arrive in five minutes.

686
00:25:51,213 --> 00:25:52,683
- Okay. - Okay.

687
00:25:53,113 --> 00:25:54,953
- The road is well-planned. - Yes.

688
00:25:55,853 --> 00:25:57,183
Hey, look.

689
00:25:58,353 --> 00:26:00,653
Please pull over. I'll jump right in.

690
00:26:00,953 --> 00:26:02,224
- I mean... - What is this?

691
00:26:04,123 --> 00:26:06,132
There's the Yeongdo Bridge here.

692
00:26:06,133 --> 00:26:08,503
Bring me an oar. Where's the oar?

693
00:26:08,504 --> 00:26:09,533
(They run into a beautiful bridge on the way to the rented house.)

694
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:10,862
- Gosh. - I want to pull an oar.

695
00:26:10,863 --> 00:26:12,274
We're driving on a cool bridge.

696
00:26:13,074 --> 00:26:14,574
The bridge is awesome.

697
00:26:16,203 --> 00:26:17,743
Is that person fishing?

698
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:19,074
- Where? - The front.

699
00:26:20,274 --> 00:26:21,643
Is that person fishing?

700
00:26:21,673 --> 00:26:23,443
- The one with the red pants? - Yes.

701
00:26:23,943 --> 00:26:25,853
- That person's fishing. - That person's fishing.

702
00:26:27,014 --> 00:26:28,623
I think it's an old lady, though.

703
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:29,953
Goodness. You're right.

704
00:26:30,153 --> 00:26:31,554
An old lady is fishing.

705
00:26:32,254 --> 00:26:34,692
An old lady is fishing with her headphones on.

706
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:35,923
- She's so cool. - Hello.

707
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:38,993
She's listening to music with the headphones.

708
00:26:38,994 --> 00:26:41,094
- That's true. She's so cool. - Get a big one.

709
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:43,564
- She rode her bicycle here. - Cool.

710
00:26:45,034 --> 00:26:46,373
A cool old lady.

711
00:26:47,703 --> 00:26:51,142
She'll have a good meal with what she catches today.

712
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:55,784
(Wait. There's a person near our rented place?)

713
00:26:56,113 --> 00:26:57,513
(Last place they rented)

714
00:26:57,514 --> 00:27:01,613
(Our cottage was the only house in a 20km radius.)

715
00:27:04,084 --> 00:27:05,223
(What?)

716
00:27:05,224 --> 00:27:06,352
What is that?

717
00:27:06,353 --> 00:27:07,753
(We have neighbors now!)

718
00:27:07,754 --> 00:27:09,024
- Hello. - Goodness.

719
00:27:10,064 --> 00:27:11,193
Awesome.

720
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:12,663
It's so pretty.

721
00:27:13,334 --> 00:27:15,663
This village is very cute.

722
00:27:16,264 --> 00:27:18,672
The houses are very cute and pretty.

723
00:27:18,673 --> 00:27:20,102
(Their previous houses were isolated.)

724
00:27:20,103 --> 00:27:23,004
(But this time, it is in a village!)

725
00:27:23,143 --> 00:27:26,044
I have news that will make Dong Hwi happy.

726
00:27:26,314 --> 00:27:27,373
What is it?

727
00:27:27,643 --> 00:27:29,513
I still see the power poles here.

728
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:31,182
(The power poles are connected when they're 1 minute away.)

729
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:33,212
- The electricity is... - That means we can charge stuff.

730
00:27:33,213 --> 00:27:34,253
We can charge stuff.

731
00:27:34,254 --> 00:27:35,283
(Are there people and electricity?)

732
00:27:35,284 --> 00:27:37,382
(Please.)

733
00:27:37,383 --> 00:27:39,593
I want water. I want a shower.

734
00:27:39,594 --> 00:27:42,093
- That's... - It's likely to have a boiler.

735
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:43,224
- That's right. - It's likely to have it.

736
00:27:43,324 --> 00:27:44,594
Will it have hot water?

737
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,293
It's highly likely to have hot water.

738
00:27:46,294 --> 00:27:47,862
(They've become greedy as they enter a village for the first time.)

739
00:27:47,863 --> 00:27:49,862
If I may wish a little more,

740
00:27:49,863 --> 00:27:52,172
after using the toilet,

741
00:27:52,173 --> 00:27:53,573
- I wish I could flush it. - Right.

742
00:27:53,574 --> 00:27:54,774
I really want to flush it.

743
00:27:55,443 --> 00:27:57,102
I miss the flushing sound.

744
00:27:57,103 --> 00:27:58,173
Yes.

745
00:27:58,474 --> 00:28:00,473
- Gosh. I think this is it. - We're here.

746
00:28:00,474 --> 00:28:02,514
- We must be here. - This way?

747
00:28:02,943 --> 00:28:04,083
Yes. It's after a right turn.

748
00:28:04,084 --> 00:28:05,213
(They finally arrive at the third rented place!)

749
00:28:05,953 --> 00:28:10,524
(Please let there be electricity, waterworks, and internet.)

750
00:28:12,554 --> 00:28:14,123
There are many houses, though.

751
00:28:15,054 --> 00:28:17,093
- There are many houses? - I've already seen...

752
00:28:17,094 --> 00:28:18,462
- more than eight houses. - What?

753
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:19,534
- What? - You're right.

754
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:23,034
Is it a school or what?

755
00:28:24,534 --> 00:28:26,474
It's like a town here.

756
00:28:27,974 --> 00:28:29,573
(Living in a town away from isolation)

757
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:32,612
What is this place? It's such a pretty house.

758
00:28:32,613 --> 00:28:34,173
It's in red and white.

759
00:28:35,484 --> 00:28:37,442
- Gosh. What's going on? - The houses are so pretty.

760
00:28:37,443 --> 00:28:39,653
- I know. - Gosh. What's going on?

761
00:28:40,453 --> 00:28:41,814
They look so nice.

762
00:28:42,423 --> 00:28:44,153
(But...)

763
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:46,623
What is this big tractor?

764
00:28:47,254 --> 00:28:48,493
Are they farmers?

765
00:28:48,494 --> 00:28:50,524
- Gosh. They must be farming. - Farming?

766
00:28:52,094 --> 00:28:56,703
(The Renters are dragged to place while singing a work song.)

767
00:28:57,564 --> 00:29:02,774
(A new type of struggle is coming soon.)

768
00:29:04,244 --> 00:29:08,413
(They get nervous with the appearance of a tractor.)

769
00:29:09,943 --> 00:29:11,112
A puppy!

770
00:29:11,113 --> 00:29:12,814
- Where is it? - Broccoli. Back there.

771
00:29:13,153 --> 00:29:14,313
- Back there? - Broccoli?

772
00:29:14,314 --> 00:29:15,353
Yes.

773
00:29:16,754 --> 00:29:17,882
Broccoli?

774
00:29:17,883 --> 00:29:20,254
(Broccoli?)

775
00:29:20,623 --> 00:29:22,324
Hey, the phone doesn't work at all.

776
00:29:22,963 --> 00:29:24,162
- The signal is gone. - Gosh.

777
00:29:24,163 --> 00:29:25,493
(Unlike their expectation, there's no internet.)

778
00:29:25,494 --> 00:29:27,034
My goodness.

779
00:29:27,663 --> 00:29:29,834
By the way, that dog is a broccoli?

780
00:29:31,133 --> 00:29:32,902
(I'm not a broccoli.)

781
00:29:32,903 --> 00:29:35,304
It can't be broccoli. That's a vegetable.

782
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:36,474
It's a broccoli.

783
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:38,344
- Isn't it a Border Collie? - A Border Collie.

784
00:29:39,913 --> 00:29:41,844
Since he's a chef, he calls a dog...

785
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:43,844
with a vegetable name.

786
00:29:44,183 --> 00:29:45,452
(Out of embarrassment,)

787
00:29:45,453 --> 00:29:46,712
How cute.

788
00:29:46,713 --> 00:29:47,814
(he takes it out on Dong Hwi.)

789
00:29:48,314 --> 00:29:50,183
He called a Border Collie a broccoli.

790
00:29:50,784 --> 00:29:52,392
That's a Border Collie, Dong Yeon.

791
00:29:52,393 --> 00:29:53,423
(It's a Russo-European Laika.)

792
00:29:53,724 --> 00:29:55,362
- They're here. - Right.

793
00:29:55,363 --> 00:29:56,363
(The landlords comes out noticing the Renters' presence.)

794
00:29:56,364 --> 00:29:58,223
- Hi. - Hello.

795
00:29:58,224 --> 00:29:59,794
(The landlords comes out noticing the Renters' presence.)

796
00:30:00,494 --> 00:30:01,962
- They are the ones from the photo. - Hello.

797
00:30:01,963 --> 00:30:03,803
- Hello. Nice to meet you. - Welcome!

798
00:30:03,804 --> 00:30:04,863
- Hello. - Hey.

799
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:08,074
"Hello. We're newlyweds in our first year of marriage."

800
00:30:08,603 --> 00:30:12,513
"We fell in love with warm and peaceful Kemijarvi."

801
00:30:12,514 --> 00:30:14,744
"So we settled down here."

802
00:30:14,774 --> 00:30:17,612
"We're living with an animal family."

803
00:30:17,613 --> 00:30:22,853
(The life with special roommates, welcome to Zootopia!)

804
00:30:23,084 --> 00:30:26,594
"PS, everyone in town is looking forward to your arrival."

805
00:30:27,193 --> 00:30:29,293
(A Zootopia with a strong community)

806
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:33,034
(What kind of daily lives will they have here?)

807
00:30:34,064 --> 00:30:35,093
Hello.

808
00:30:35,094 --> 00:30:36,102
- Hello. - Hi.

809
00:30:36,103 --> 00:30:37,103
Nice to meet you.

810
00:30:37,564 --> 00:30:39,432
- Thank you for inviting us. - Yes.

811
00:30:39,433 --> 00:30:44,402
Okay. I might start from your apartment.

812
00:30:44,403 --> 00:30:45,773
- Okay. - Yes.

813
00:30:45,774 --> 00:30:47,543
Yes. It's an old building.

814
00:30:47,544 --> 00:30:48,813
(The landlords' house, the Renters' house)

815
00:30:48,814 --> 00:30:51,044
- Let's go. - Yes. Let's look around.

816
00:30:51,344 --> 00:30:52,953
It was built in 1819.

817
00:30:55,054 --> 00:30:57,422
It's more than 200 years old, then.

818
00:30:57,423 --> 00:30:58,892
- Yes. - Yes.

819
00:30:58,893 --> 00:30:59,994
It's crazy.

820
00:31:00,193 --> 00:31:02,862
But it looks like a new building.

821
00:31:02,863 --> 00:31:05,123
- Gosh. - They must have managed it well.

822
00:31:05,794 --> 00:31:07,693
- Welcome. - Thank you.

823
00:31:09,203 --> 00:31:10,933
- There are snakes again. - There are snakes here too.

824
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:13,733
(Mini Lapland Encyclopedia)

825
00:31:13,734 --> 00:31:14,932
(As they coexist with nature in Lapland,)

826
00:31:14,933 --> 00:31:16,442
You don't have to worry about them.

827
00:31:16,443 --> 00:31:18,244
(they put fake snakes on the porch to keep wild animals away.)

828
00:31:18,344 --> 00:31:19,413
Let's go.

829
00:31:20,774 --> 00:31:21,943
My goodness.

830
00:31:22,584 --> 00:31:24,783
So we have three rooms here.

831
00:31:24,784 --> 00:31:26,353
- Three rooms. - What?

832
00:31:26,683 --> 00:31:28,113
- 3 rooms? - 3.

833
00:31:28,183 --> 00:31:29,783
- Gosh. - Yes. Here it is.

834
00:31:29,784 --> 00:31:32,023
(How are our rented rooms away from isolation?)

835
00:31:32,024 --> 00:31:33,192
Gosh. This is really...

836
00:31:33,193 --> 00:31:34,594
My goodness.

837
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:38,063
- It's so luxurious. - It's so...

838
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:39,293
(An antique room welcomes the city boys.)

839
00:31:39,294 --> 00:31:41,662
It's a house I saw in movies.

840
00:31:41,663 --> 00:31:44,063
(It's as if they had time traveled.)

841
00:31:44,064 --> 00:31:45,903
It can't get more romantic than this.

842
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:47,833
- It's pretty. - Yes.

843
00:31:47,834 --> 00:31:49,343
(It's filled with antique furniture.)

844
00:31:49,344 --> 00:31:51,243
They're all old furniture...

845
00:31:51,244 --> 00:31:53,142
- Right. - that have been used...

846
00:31:53,143 --> 00:31:55,274
- Really? - for a really long time here.

847
00:31:55,443 --> 00:31:56,514
For a long time?

848
00:31:56,613 --> 00:31:58,484
- Everything is so classic. - Yes.

849
00:31:58,853 --> 00:32:01,412
- Gosh. - They're the ultimate antiques.

850
00:32:01,413 --> 00:32:04,054
(Of everything, what grabs their attention the most?)

851
00:32:04,824 --> 00:32:06,824
So, you have electricity, right?

852
00:32:07,153 --> 00:32:09,463
Yes. We have electricity here.

853
00:32:10,264 --> 00:32:12,233
Thank goodness. This is our first time...

854
00:32:12,234 --> 00:32:14,193
- No. - having it in Lapland.

855
00:32:14,334 --> 00:32:15,603
- Okay. - Okay.

856
00:32:15,963 --> 00:32:18,263
We've stayed in other places,

857
00:32:18,264 --> 00:32:20,273
and there was no electricity.

858
00:32:20,274 --> 00:32:21,533
(They encounter the light of civilization down in a village.)

859
00:32:21,534 --> 00:32:23,244
- This is luxury. - Yes.

860
00:32:24,403 --> 00:32:25,744
It's super luxurious.

861
00:32:25,873 --> 00:32:27,212
It's a five-star hotel.

862
00:32:27,213 --> 00:32:28,314
- Yes. - Okay.

863
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,844
What is this?

864
00:32:32,683 --> 00:32:35,212
(Some rice puffs with holes are hanging from the ceiling.)

865
00:32:35,213 --> 00:32:36,923
What is this?

866
00:32:37,554 --> 00:32:38,853
They are bread.

867
00:32:39,024 --> 00:32:40,524
- Bread? - Yes.

868
00:32:40,824 --> 00:32:42,223
Can we eat them?

869
00:32:42,224 --> 00:32:43,224
Yes.

870
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:46,494
These are really old bread. And these are...

871
00:32:46,893 --> 00:32:48,902
I don't know how many years old they are,

872
00:32:48,903 --> 00:32:50,564
but they're still edible.

873
00:32:51,163 --> 00:32:53,034
They must be really old.

874
00:32:53,074 --> 00:32:54,172
For a long time.

875
00:32:54,173 --> 00:32:58,074
It's an old way of keeping the bread edible.

876
00:32:58,173 --> 00:32:59,513
- I see. - Yes.

877
00:32:59,514 --> 00:33:00,943
(When a rye bread is dried properly, it can be stored for years.)

878
00:33:01,373 --> 00:33:02,443
Back there.

879
00:33:03,244 --> 00:33:05,044
Is it a real gun?

880
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:07,652
It's a real one, but it's not working.

881
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:08,882
- Right. - Right.

882
00:33:08,883 --> 00:33:10,652
(You can own a gun for hunting in Lapland.)

883
00:33:10,653 --> 00:33:12,593
It's a real one, but it won't work.

884
00:33:12,594 --> 00:33:13,953
(You can own a gun for hunting in Lapland.)

885
00:33:14,094 --> 00:33:17,862
There's a phone. It's a really old one.

886
00:33:17,863 --> 00:33:20,234
- It's an old phone. - Is it working?

887
00:33:21,064 --> 00:33:23,233
(Of course, it does.)

888
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:24,663
That's how you dial.

889
00:33:25,334 --> 00:33:26,672
It's like an alarm.

890
00:33:26,673 --> 00:33:27,703
- Yes. - Gosh.

891
00:33:29,544 --> 00:33:30,773
(The house has electricity.)

892
00:33:30,774 --> 00:33:33,172
- It's crazy. - The house is so nice and pretty.

893
00:33:33,173 --> 00:33:34,712
(Everything looks wonderful, but...)

894
00:33:34,713 --> 00:33:37,413
Two of you can sleep here in this room.

895
00:33:37,784 --> 00:33:39,254
Don't tell me there will be tents.

896
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,084
Please. I hope not.

897
00:33:41,183 --> 00:33:43,584
I'm curious about the other two rooms too.

898
00:33:44,423 --> 00:33:45,652
- It won't be the tents. - No.

899
00:33:45,653 --> 00:33:46,692
(How does the second room look?)

900
00:33:46,693 --> 00:33:47,852
What if it's outdoor when they open the door?

901
00:33:47,853 --> 00:33:50,794
This is the second room. Someone can sleep here.

902
00:33:50,994 --> 00:33:52,162
Nice. It's small and cute.

903
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:53,462
It's a private room.

904
00:33:53,463 --> 00:33:54,862
(A private room?)

905
00:33:54,863 --> 00:33:56,303
It's a private room.

906
00:33:56,304 --> 00:33:58,662
Yes. It's small.

907
00:33:58,663 --> 00:34:01,304
- And it's cute. - It's for one person, right?

908
00:34:01,474 --> 00:34:02,773
Yes. For one.

909
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:03,804
Okay.

910
00:34:04,844 --> 00:34:07,912
- Wait. Is this a refrigerator? - Yes, it is.

911
00:34:07,913 --> 00:34:10,113
- Hey, there's a fridge. - We have a fridge.

912
00:34:10,213 --> 00:34:12,312
- A fridge? We have a fridge? - We have a fridge.

913
00:34:12,313 --> 00:34:13,353
(The main chef is super excited about the news.)

914
00:34:13,354 --> 00:34:15,624
- Can I open it? - Yes, I think so.

915
00:34:16,923 --> 00:34:18,123
(It's dazzling.)

916
00:34:18,124 --> 00:34:21,453
They put two bottles of cold water.

917
00:34:21,454 --> 00:34:24,394
(Compared to the first day, they've made a huge progress!)

918
00:34:26,693 --> 00:34:28,434
- It feels so strange. - Okay.

919
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:29,733
Come on.

920
00:34:30,063 --> 00:34:31,304
Please. No way.

921
00:34:31,804 --> 00:34:33,002
No way.

922
00:34:33,003 --> 00:34:34,033
(They feel more anxious as everything looks so good.)

923
00:34:34,034 --> 00:34:35,434
Okay. Let's look here.

924
00:34:36,244 --> 00:34:37,643
It's a large main room.

925
00:34:37,644 --> 00:34:38,873
(They go into the next room feeling nervous.)

926
00:34:38,874 --> 00:34:40,213
It's a luxury suite.

927
00:34:41,144 --> 00:34:42,343
- Gosh. - Goodness.

928
00:34:42,344 --> 00:34:44,583
- It's a suite. - I know.

929
00:34:45,184 --> 00:34:48,683
The four of us can sit together...

930
00:34:48,684 --> 00:34:50,624
- and eat something. - It's so nice.

931
00:34:50,824 --> 00:34:51,982
(It's a suite as big as Oiva's cottage!)

932
00:34:51,983 --> 00:34:53,554
It's really awesome.

933
00:34:54,354 --> 00:34:55,454
Goodness.

934
00:34:55,563 --> 00:34:57,193
Gosh. This place is crazy.

935
00:34:57,224 --> 00:34:58,563
Hey, look.

936
00:34:58,693 --> 00:35:00,292
As it's a main bedroom, the bed...

937
00:35:00,293 --> 00:35:01,633
- It's big. - is big.

938
00:35:02,193 --> 00:35:04,764
(The previous beds they had)

939
00:35:04,804 --> 00:35:07,033
(The bed is small.)

940
00:35:07,034 --> 00:35:10,374
(Curling up)

941
00:35:11,173 --> 00:35:13,312
(We can finally sleep with our legs stretched out.)

942
00:35:13,313 --> 00:35:14,613
It's so soft.

943
00:35:15,043 --> 00:35:16,982
If we have to pay for this room,

944
00:35:16,983 --> 00:35:18,212
we don't have money for it.

945
00:35:18,213 --> 00:35:19,253
Okay.

946
00:35:19,554 --> 00:35:22,113
We will remember that.

947
00:35:22,213 --> 00:35:23,253
Yes.

948
00:35:24,653 --> 00:35:27,454
(Dong Yeon is smiling, but he still feels anxious.)

949
00:35:27,624 --> 00:35:29,594
- Yes! - We love it here.

950
00:35:29,793 --> 00:35:31,263
I see. That's good.

951
00:35:31,264 --> 00:35:32,763
If they have a toilet,

952
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:33,962
(Please let there be a flush toilet.)

953
00:35:33,963 --> 00:35:35,603
I'd be so happy.

954
00:35:35,604 --> 00:35:36,704
A restroom...

955
00:35:36,833 --> 00:35:38,403
- It's not here, is it? - I don't think so.

956
00:35:39,204 --> 00:35:40,903
- I don't there's one here. - No.

957
00:35:41,633 --> 00:35:44,703
Okay. Now we can go to see our kitchen.

958
00:35:44,704 --> 00:35:46,213
- Kitchen. - Yes.

959
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:47,943
The kitchen is the most important.

960
00:35:48,374 --> 00:35:50,312
So is this the kitchen?

961
00:35:50,313 --> 00:35:51,744
Yes, outdoor kitchen here.

962
00:35:51,844 --> 00:35:53,252
- The kitchen is outside. - Gosh.

963
00:35:53,253 --> 00:35:54,913
(The romantic outdoor kitchen is located in the yard.)

964
00:35:54,914 --> 00:35:56,482
It's an outdoor kitchen?

965
00:35:56,483 --> 00:35:57,982
- Yes. - Gosh.

966
00:35:57,983 --> 00:35:59,453
(Welcome. Is this your first time seeing a kitchen with a roof?)

967
00:35:59,454 --> 00:36:00,753
- Gosh. - Yes.

968
00:36:04,963 --> 00:36:06,394
- What is this? - There's a microwave.

969
00:36:06,463 --> 00:36:07,764
- There's a microwave. - It's a microwave.

970
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:10,434
- Really? - Yes.

971
00:36:11,164 --> 00:36:13,002
(They're greeted by a microwave, which they haven't seen in Finland.)

972
00:36:13,003 --> 00:36:14,173
Let me try.

973
00:36:14,304 --> 00:36:15,643
(Beep)

974
00:36:15,644 --> 00:36:16,744
This is nice.

975
00:36:17,443 --> 00:36:19,474
Dong Yeon is touched right now.

976
00:36:19,974 --> 00:36:21,172
There's a microwave.

977
00:36:21,173 --> 00:36:24,283
(The kitchen has electricity and a roof.)

978
00:36:24,284 --> 00:36:27,284
Okay. Now we have perfect kitchen to cook.

979
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:31,183
Now, of course, you want to see the toilet?

980
00:36:31,184 --> 00:36:32,953
- Yes, sure. - I think you need that one.

981
00:36:32,954 --> 00:36:35,022
- The toilet. - We have a toilet here.

982
00:36:35,023 --> 00:36:36,023
(It's finally time!)

983
00:36:36,024 --> 00:36:37,692
- Please. - It's important to have a toilet.

984
00:36:37,693 --> 00:36:39,333
(The bathroom is the most important to the city boys.)

985
00:36:41,563 --> 00:36:44,462
(They have a kitchen with electricity and a roof!)

986
00:36:44,463 --> 00:36:49,942
(The house would be perfect if it had a flush toilet!)

987
00:36:49,943 --> 00:36:51,003
Because...

988
00:36:52,474 --> 00:36:53,514
(Gosh)

989
00:36:54,344 --> 00:36:56,143
- Okay. - Outdoor toilet.

990
00:36:56,144 --> 00:36:57,343
This is our toilet.

991
00:36:57,344 --> 00:36:59,684
(The color scheme is bright and fresh.)

992
00:36:59,883 --> 00:37:03,054
(There's even a toilet paper holder.)

993
00:37:04,423 --> 00:37:08,124
(It seems like the bathroom is worth looking forward to.)

994
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:10,264
(Beneath the cutting-edge LED light...)

995
00:37:12,934 --> 00:37:13,994
We're familiar with this.

996
00:37:14,293 --> 00:37:15,394
Yes.

997
00:37:15,594 --> 00:37:17,132
We know how to do that.

998
00:37:17,133 --> 00:37:18,303
Okay.

999
00:37:18,304 --> 00:37:20,332
(They try their best to stay composed.)

1000
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:22,074
- Okay. - No problem.

1001
00:37:22,344 --> 00:37:24,003
- We can do it. - No problem.

1002
00:37:25,673 --> 00:37:28,413
It was dark at the house we stayed in before.

1003
00:37:28,414 --> 00:37:30,684
But the bathroom here is painted blue,

1004
00:37:30,744 --> 00:37:32,042
- Right. Okay. - so it feels more sanitary...

1005
00:37:32,043 --> 00:37:33,653
- and clean. - Okay. We got this.

1006
00:37:33,753 --> 00:37:35,414
- We're used to this now. - We can do this.

1007
00:37:35,983 --> 00:37:37,053
Good.

1008
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:39,353
Do we have any kind of shower booth or...

1009
00:37:39,354 --> 00:37:40,453
(Eun Woo still has hope. Is there a shower booth?)

1010
00:37:40,454 --> 00:37:42,023
- Shower? - Sorry.

1011
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:44,594
We'll have to do it with the bowl in the sauna.

1012
00:37:44,793 --> 00:37:46,292
Sauna in here.

1013
00:37:46,293 --> 00:37:47,862
We're familiar with it now.

1014
00:37:47,863 --> 00:37:49,304
- With a bowl. - We can do this.

1015
00:37:51,264 --> 00:37:52,772
- Chicken? - Yes.

1016
00:37:52,773 --> 00:37:54,074
They are free here.

1017
00:37:54,604 --> 00:37:55,942
- There is... - Look, there are chickens.

1018
00:37:55,943 --> 00:37:58,043
- Chickens. - Do they raise them outside?

1019
00:37:58,204 --> 00:37:59,213
Chickens.

1020
00:38:00,273 --> 00:38:02,812
- They're cute. - Right. That's amazing.

1021
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:03,942
(Written in their invitation was "We currently live with animals!")

1022
00:38:03,943 --> 00:38:06,213
Our other chickens are somewhere.

1023
00:38:06,653 --> 00:38:07,953
- Somewhere. - I see.

1024
00:38:07,954 --> 00:38:09,183
They're all over the place.

1025
00:38:09,184 --> 00:38:11,054
(Their animals roam around the yard without being fenced in.)

1026
00:38:11,684 --> 00:38:15,593
(Chickens, dog, cats, sheep)

1027
00:38:15,594 --> 00:38:18,593
(This house is like Zootopia with all the animals living here.)

1028
00:38:18,594 --> 00:38:19,962
There it is.

1029
00:38:19,963 --> 00:38:21,063
Gosh, there are sheep.

1030
00:38:25,204 --> 00:38:26,273
Hello.

1031
00:38:26,874 --> 00:38:28,034
Gosh, they're so cute.

1032
00:38:29,644 --> 00:38:30,744
So cute.

1033
00:38:31,204 --> 00:38:33,613
You can feed them. Yes, they love this.

1034
00:38:34,074 --> 00:38:35,113
- Goodness. - Gosh.

1035
00:38:35,474 --> 00:38:36,844
There are four like us.

1036
00:38:38,184 --> 00:38:39,353
They're so small.

1037
00:38:39,354 --> 00:38:41,582
(He's getting a boost of dopamine.)

1038
00:38:41,583 --> 00:38:43,883
- Try it. - They eat so fast.

1039
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:45,483
Right? They finish the food in an instant.

1040
00:38:45,624 --> 00:38:46,752
In an instant.

1041
00:38:46,753 --> 00:38:48,324
- How old are they? - Oh, my.

1042
00:38:48,454 --> 00:38:51,123
They're only about a year and a half.

1043
00:38:51,124 --> 00:38:52,562
- A year and a half. - Babies.

1044
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:54,994
They're really young.

1045
00:38:55,264 --> 00:38:58,434
Are these actual sheep? Gosh, they really are sheep.

1046
00:38:59,133 --> 00:39:03,473
Later, you can get a little bit closer to them.

1047
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:04,704
- Yes? - All right.

1048
00:39:04,773 --> 00:39:06,443
- Okay. - Okay.

1049
00:39:06,474 --> 00:39:07,542
I'm nervous.

1050
00:39:07,543 --> 00:39:08,913
He just said we'd get closer to the sheep.

1051
00:39:08,914 --> 00:39:10,312
- Really? - With the sheep?

1052
00:39:10,313 --> 00:39:11,883
(Getting closer to the sheep? That makes them nervous.)

1053
00:39:13,383 --> 00:39:14,883
I can't believe how cute they are.

1054
00:39:15,354 --> 00:39:16,923
- It feels like we're at a zoo. - Right.

1055
00:39:17,554 --> 00:39:21,422
So you have chickens and lambs and one dog there?

1056
00:39:21,423 --> 00:39:23,423
- Yes. - Yes, we can go meet him.

1057
00:39:23,523 --> 00:39:24,824
- Yes. - Yes.

1058
00:39:25,164 --> 00:39:26,434
It's a Border Collie.

1059
00:39:27,534 --> 00:39:28,534
So cute.

1060
00:39:28,535 --> 00:39:30,263
His name is Ransu.

1061
00:39:30,264 --> 00:39:31,332
- Ran? - Ransu?

1062
00:39:31,333 --> 00:39:33,574
Yes, Ransu is only nine months old.

1063
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:35,434
- I see. - He's really young.

1064
00:39:36,244 --> 00:39:37,974
He has waited for you.

1065
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:40,014
He's so cute.

1066
00:39:40,113 --> 00:39:43,013
(He's self-quarantining, in case the city boys are scared of dogs.)

1067
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:44,383
I'll give you snacks later.

1068
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,683
Goodness. How adorable.

1069
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:47,953
(Thank you for being considerate. You can let him out!)

1070
00:39:47,954 --> 00:39:49,583
Does he do that?

1071
00:39:50,153 --> 00:39:52,454
You know, how dogs herd sheep.

1072
00:39:53,293 --> 00:39:54,594
Do you think he does that?

1073
00:39:54,793 --> 00:39:57,422
Maybe. Border Collies are smart, so it's possible.

1074
00:39:57,423 --> 00:39:59,164
(Is the nine-month-old Ransu a sheep herding dog?)

1075
00:39:59,233 --> 00:40:03,332
Is he going to take the job of protecting sheep...

1076
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:05,103
- and lambs, like leading the lambs? - No.

1077
00:40:05,104 --> 00:40:07,873
- He's more of a hunting dog. - I see.

1078
00:40:07,874 --> 00:40:10,344
(He may look cute, but he comes from a long line of hunting dogs.)

1079
00:40:10,644 --> 00:40:13,373
I don't know yet...

1080
00:40:13,374 --> 00:40:14,973
what he will do.

1081
00:40:14,974 --> 00:40:16,712
But I hope he does something.

1082
00:40:16,713 --> 00:40:18,643
(Ransu doesn't have any hunting experience because he's so young.)

1083
00:40:18,644 --> 00:40:20,812
- Okay. Then we can continue... - Yes.

1084
00:40:20,813 --> 00:40:21,883
- walking that way. - Sure.

1085
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:27,824
This whole ranch is about 6 hectares.

1086
00:40:28,554 --> 00:40:30,023
- It's 6 hectares? - Yes.

1087
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:31,993
How big is 6 hectares?

1088
00:40:31,994 --> 00:40:33,394
I don't know how big it is.

1089
00:40:33,693 --> 00:40:35,164
I can't imagine.

1090
00:40:35,594 --> 00:40:38,562
It's about six football fields.

1091
00:40:38,563 --> 00:40:41,703
(It's about six soccer fields! That's approximately 60,000㎡.)

1092
00:40:41,704 --> 00:40:42,744
That's huge.

1093
00:40:42,844 --> 00:40:45,402
- The ranch is really big. - Right.

1094
00:40:45,403 --> 00:40:46,514
Six soccer fields.

1095
00:40:46,673 --> 00:40:47,673
(Since the property is huge with electricity and individual rooms,)

1096
00:40:48,144 --> 00:40:51,612
(there are lots of work to do as well.)

1097
00:40:51,613 --> 00:40:52,683
- Goodness. - One...

1098
00:40:52,684 --> 00:40:56,023
(Men who have come down to the village in search of people,)

1099
00:40:56,324 --> 00:41:00,423
(forget about the silence so far!)

1100
00:41:00,954 --> 00:41:04,264
(They're so busy in the countryside.)

1101
00:41:04,363 --> 00:41:05,623
(Is this...)

1102
00:41:05,624 --> 00:41:06,632
(okay?)

1103
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:09,534
- No. - Don't let the sheep out.

1104
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:12,103
(The intensity of the labor is proportional to...)

1105
00:41:12,104 --> 00:41:14,474
(the number of animals.)

1106
00:41:15,534 --> 00:41:18,003
(In the village, 24 hours isn't enough.)

1107
00:41:18,704 --> 00:41:20,513
(This is the weight of staying at a house that's 6 hectares.)

1108
00:41:20,514 --> 00:41:22,543
(I want to return to the forest.)

1109
00:41:22,744 --> 00:41:25,784
- Gosh, we're going in deep. - This path doesn't seem to end.

1110
00:41:26,153 --> 00:41:27,954
I wonder what's there.

1111
00:41:28,054 --> 00:41:30,954
(What will they find in this deep forest?)

1112
00:41:32,083 --> 00:41:36,163
So this is one of our...

1113
00:41:36,164 --> 00:41:37,422
(It's the favorite secret place of the landlord couple.)

1114
00:41:37,423 --> 00:41:41,164
And we like to sit here at the evenings, and...

1115
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:42,862
(There's a lake at the end of the path deep in the forest.)

1116
00:41:42,863 --> 00:41:45,204
Guys, there are outdoor...

1117
00:41:45,304 --> 00:41:46,333
Chairs?

1118
00:41:46,434 --> 00:41:47,772
A one-person sofa?

1119
00:41:47,773 --> 00:41:50,104
- Gosh. Here, you can... - There are swings here.

1120
00:41:50,503 --> 00:41:52,643
- Gosh. - My goodness.

1121
00:41:52,644 --> 00:41:53,673
So here...

1122
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:58,543
I like to just sit in this chair.

1123
00:41:59,284 --> 00:42:00,883
- Okay. - Just enjoy...

1124
00:42:01,454 --> 00:42:03,652
- the atmosphere of the forest, - A hidden place.

1125
00:42:03,653 --> 00:42:06,554
lake, and... And of course, the nature.

1126
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:08,692
There are swings here.

1127
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:09,893
It's not a swing. It's a sofa.

1128
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:11,493
(Let me see how it feels on it.)

1129
00:42:11,494 --> 00:42:14,232
The couple... Since they're newlyweds...

1130
00:42:14,233 --> 00:42:15,393
(I'll push it for him.)

1131
00:42:15,394 --> 00:42:17,333
They enjoy the romantic time here.

1132
00:42:18,664 --> 00:42:20,434
- Gosh, Je Hoon. Goodness. - I'm fine.

1133
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:27,673
(Production by Juri's Healing Spot)

1134
00:42:28,043 --> 00:42:29,843
(Direction by Cha Eun Woo)

1135
00:42:29,844 --> 00:42:31,982
(Starting Lee Je Hoon)

1136
00:42:31,983 --> 00:42:34,053
(Special appearance: Kwak Dong Yeon)

1137
00:42:34,054 --> 00:42:36,724
(They will continue making a fuss that will make the couple startled.)

1138
00:42:37,083 --> 00:42:38,823
(I'm fine.)

1139
00:42:38,824 --> 00:42:39,894
Sorry, Je Hoon.

1140
00:42:40,653 --> 00:42:42,353
- Sorry, Je Hoon. - Are you okay?

1141
00:42:42,354 --> 00:42:43,692
- That's okay. - Are you okay?

1142
00:42:43,693 --> 00:42:44,693
Why did it fall down so easily?

1143
00:42:44,923 --> 00:42:46,192
I just wanted to push it for him.

1144
00:42:46,193 --> 00:42:47,533
I'm fine. It was fun.

1145
00:42:47,534 --> 00:42:49,534
(I'm fine. It was fun.)

1146
00:42:50,003 --> 00:42:52,462
So you guys rest here sometimes?

1147
00:42:52,463 --> 00:42:54,673
- Yes, in the evenings. - In the evenings?

1148
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:57,244
- When the sun sets? - When the sun sets... Yes.

1149
00:42:57,804 --> 00:43:00,374
We make a little bonfire here and...

1150
00:43:00,474 --> 00:43:01,844
Maybe some wine and...

1151
00:43:02,543 --> 00:43:05,113
- Relaxing music and... - How romantic.

1152
00:43:05,144 --> 00:43:06,483
When did you get married?

1153
00:43:07,583 --> 00:43:09,152
- Just about... - Two months ago.

1154
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:10,223
- two months ago. - What?

1155
00:43:10,224 --> 00:43:11,253
- Really? - Yes.

1156
00:43:11,454 --> 00:43:13,354
(Surprised)

1157
00:43:13,454 --> 00:43:15,153
They got married two months ago?

1158
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:22,434
Gosh. They are newlyweds.

1159
00:43:24,233 --> 00:43:26,933
(Their wedding was held in the front yard of the house...)

1160
00:43:26,934 --> 00:43:29,644
(2 months ago.)

1161
00:43:30,273 --> 00:43:35,273
(They marched on a wedding tractor.)

1162
00:43:36,083 --> 00:43:37,712
They must be so happy now.

1163
00:43:37,713 --> 00:43:39,014
Are we bothering you?

1164
00:43:39,383 --> 00:43:42,083
- No. Of course not. - No.

1165
00:43:43,324 --> 00:43:46,054
(They look lovely.)

1166
00:43:46,153 --> 00:43:47,223
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1167
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:48,724
- Let's go. - Go.

1168
00:43:51,124 --> 00:43:52,463
It's so quiet and nice.

1169
00:43:52,764 --> 00:43:54,192
This is a very peaceful place.

1170
00:43:54,193 --> 00:43:56,034
- Yes. - Very peaceful.

1171
00:43:56,463 --> 00:43:58,664
Were you all born in the city?

1172
00:43:59,204 --> 00:44:00,403
- Yes. - Yes.

1173
00:44:01,034 --> 00:44:02,673
Okay.

1174
00:44:03,003 --> 00:44:08,273
Actually, I have always lived in the city.

1175
00:44:08,644 --> 00:44:12,442
So I have always dreamed of living in the countryside.

1176
00:44:12,443 --> 00:44:14,382
I see.

1177
00:44:14,383 --> 00:44:19,223
This is something I dreamed of.

1178
00:44:19,224 --> 00:44:21,192
(The Finland city boy has moved to countryside 2 years ago...)

1179
00:44:21,193 --> 00:44:23,164
(because he enjoys Finland's nature and calmness.)

1180
00:44:25,324 --> 00:44:28,133
I have the same dream.

1181
00:44:30,463 --> 00:44:32,303
You just have to make them come true.

1182
00:44:32,304 --> 00:44:33,534
- Yes. - Yes.

1183
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:37,803
We also have two cats.

1184
00:44:37,804 --> 00:44:39,144
- Cats? - Cats.

1185
00:44:39,173 --> 00:44:40,743
- They have cats. - They have cats.

1186
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:42,244
- They are somewhere. - Really?

1187
00:44:42,273 --> 00:44:43,283
- Somewhere? - Somewhere?

1188
00:44:43,284 --> 00:44:47,082
I'm sure you'll be able to see them, but we don't know where...

1189
00:44:47,083 --> 00:44:48,152
They're hiding.

1190
00:44:48,153 --> 00:44:49,153
(The cats are shy, so they're hiding since the city boys got here.)

1191
00:44:49,154 --> 00:44:50,724
They also move freely here,

1192
00:44:51,354 --> 00:44:52,824
so you may see them sometime.

1193
00:44:53,153 --> 00:44:54,224
I'll have to find them.

1194
00:44:54,693 --> 00:44:57,324
I really hope you enjoy your stay here.

1195
00:44:57,624 --> 00:44:59,123
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1196
00:44:59,124 --> 00:45:00,164
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1197
00:45:01,133 --> 00:45:03,703
All right. So...

1198
00:45:03,704 --> 00:45:05,132
An important task remains.

1199
00:45:05,133 --> 00:45:07,433
Let's discuss which room each of us will take.

1200
00:45:07,434 --> 00:45:08,533
- Let's discuss. - Sounds good.

1201
00:45:08,534 --> 00:45:09,573
Okay.

1202
00:45:09,574 --> 00:45:12,173
(At the houses they stayed in so far, the four men...)

1203
00:45:12,673 --> 00:45:15,514
(slept side by side in one open space.)

1204
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:19,144
(But at this house, they get separate rooms.)

1205
00:45:19,684 --> 00:45:20,684
(But only two of them...)

1206
00:45:20,685 --> 00:45:22,784
(will get to use a room by himself.)

1207
00:45:23,224 --> 00:45:26,693
(The other two will have to share a room again.)

1208
00:45:27,894 --> 00:45:30,022
(All of a sudden, they're trying to read each other.)

1209
00:45:30,023 --> 00:45:31,023
Wait.

1210
00:45:31,594 --> 00:45:33,593
(They're not voicing their thoughts,)

1211
00:45:33,594 --> 00:45:35,463
(but they all want to use a room alone.)

1212
00:45:36,034 --> 00:45:37,502
(This is going to be hard.)

1213
00:45:37,503 --> 00:45:38,562
Which game should we play?

1214
00:45:38,563 --> 00:45:39,902
What's that game we play with our hands?

1215
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:40,903
- The zero game? - The zero game.

1216
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,204
How do we play it?

1217
00:45:42,403 --> 00:45:44,373
So for example, if I say "three,"

1218
00:45:44,374 --> 00:45:46,343
and you all lift a total of three fingers,

1219
00:45:46,344 --> 00:45:47,574
I win, so I'm done.

1220
00:45:47,613 --> 00:45:49,374
So they have to match. We have to guess the right number.

1221
00:45:49,583 --> 00:45:51,684
We'll go clockwise.

1222
00:45:52,414 --> 00:45:53,753
I'll go first.

1223
00:45:54,483 --> 00:45:55,513
- Okay. - Yes.

1224
00:45:55,514 --> 00:45:56,522
(They have to be in the top two...)

1225
00:45:56,523 --> 00:45:57,983
(to be able to use a room alone.)

1226
00:45:59,284 --> 00:46:00,824
One, two, three. Four.

1227
00:46:01,293 --> 00:46:02,693
One, two, three. Four.

1228
00:46:04,693 --> 00:46:05,923
It's six.

1229
00:46:06,793 --> 00:46:08,733
(Why is this making Je Hoon's mouth dry?)

1230
00:46:09,264 --> 00:46:10,434
Not a chance.

1231
00:46:11,534 --> 00:46:12,933
(It's Eun Woo's turn now.)

1232
00:46:12,934 --> 00:46:15,333
One, two, three. Four.

1233
00:46:16,344 --> 00:46:17,644
- Gosh, it's three. - It was close.

1234
00:46:18,204 --> 00:46:19,974
(He almost got it.)

1235
00:46:20,273 --> 00:46:21,874
One, two, three. Zero.

1236
00:46:23,083 --> 00:46:24,083
Not even close.

1237
00:46:24,813 --> 00:46:26,482
(Eyes blazing)

1238
00:46:26,483 --> 00:46:27,983
One, two, three. Three.

1239
00:46:30,383 --> 00:46:31,383
Not even close.

1240
00:46:31,554 --> 00:46:32,883
One, two, three. Two.

1241
00:46:34,793 --> 00:46:35,823
This isn't going to end.

1242
00:46:35,824 --> 00:46:37,494
(The four of them have never been this serious.)

1243
00:46:38,494 --> 00:46:39,732
(This isn't going to end.)

1244
00:46:39,733 --> 00:46:41,164
One, two, three. Four.

1245
00:46:41,733 --> 00:46:43,103
- Four. - That's four.

1246
00:46:43,104 --> 00:46:44,233
One, two, three. Four.

1247
00:46:45,104 --> 00:46:46,433
- Four. - That's four.

1248
00:46:46,434 --> 00:46:47,434
Gosh, Eun Woo.

1249
00:46:47,435 --> 00:46:49,503
(Eun Woo gets a room to himself.)

1250
00:46:50,043 --> 00:46:52,474
(He's very excited.)

1251
00:46:53,173 --> 00:46:55,474
You did it. Which room are you going to take?

1252
00:46:55,613 --> 00:46:57,344
- The wine cellar? - What?

1253
00:46:57,514 --> 00:46:58,612
The wine cellar isn't...

1254
00:46:58,613 --> 00:47:01,454
(There was a wine cellar on one side of the ranch.)

1255
00:47:02,083 --> 00:47:05,023
(This is technically a separate room you can use by yourself.)

1256
00:47:05,423 --> 00:47:06,894
(Dong Hwi is so silly.)

1257
00:47:06,923 --> 00:47:09,792
Goodness. Well, Eun Woo will be taking the best room.

1258
00:47:09,793 --> 00:47:12,693
(There's only one room left to use alone!)

1259
00:47:13,063 --> 00:47:16,232
(The zero game is much more heated now.)

1260
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:17,563
(Please)

1261
00:47:18,534 --> 00:47:19,832
One, two, three.

1262
00:47:19,833 --> 00:47:20,874
Zero.

1263
00:47:22,374 --> 00:47:23,374
- No one else lifted their fingers. - Dong Hwi.

1264
00:47:23,375 --> 00:47:24,603
I said zero,

1265
00:47:24,604 --> 00:47:25,844
- Dong Hwi. - but then I lifted a finger.

1266
00:47:25,943 --> 00:47:27,212
(Je Hoon and Dong Yeon didn't lift any finger.)

1267
00:47:27,213 --> 00:47:28,474
No one else lifted their fingers.

1268
00:47:28,744 --> 00:47:31,112
- I shouldn't have lifted mine. - Right.

1269
00:47:31,113 --> 00:47:32,883
(That was so close.)

1270
00:47:33,213 --> 00:47:35,184
(Other people's mistakes make me happy.)

1271
00:47:35,313 --> 00:47:36,784
One, two, three. Two.

1272
00:47:36,923 --> 00:47:38,324
- One, two, three. Two. - One, two, three.

1273
00:47:40,153 --> 00:47:41,252
Nice.

1274
00:47:41,253 --> 00:47:43,723
(Kwak Dong Yeon gets a room to himself.)

1275
00:47:43,724 --> 00:47:45,062
- One, two, three. Two. - One, two, three.

1276
00:47:45,063 --> 00:47:46,123
Nice.

1277
00:47:46,124 --> 00:47:47,862
(Thanks to Dong Hwi, Dong Yeon won.)

1278
00:47:47,863 --> 00:47:49,163
It's the uprising of the younger brothers.

1279
00:47:49,164 --> 00:47:51,164
(The single rooms are all taken by the younger brothers!)

1280
00:47:51,934 --> 00:47:53,333
(Nice)

1281
00:47:54,133 --> 00:47:55,502
(The CEO and his actor are stuck with the double room.)

1282
00:47:55,503 --> 00:47:57,244
I was being silly.

1283
00:47:58,503 --> 00:48:00,743
- Let's go, Dong Yeon. - Let's go.

1284
00:48:00,744 --> 00:48:02,414
We won against them.

1285
00:48:02,813 --> 00:48:03,943
Let's grab our bags.

1286
00:48:04,483 --> 00:48:06,483
(There's excitement in their footsteps.)

1287
00:48:08,983 --> 00:48:11,554
Seeing how the two of you are walking together,

1288
00:48:11,624 --> 00:48:13,253
you are the perfect fit...

1289
00:48:13,624 --> 00:48:15,923
- for sleeping in the same room. - for sleeping in the same room.

1290
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:19,934
What did you say? My ears are itchy, so I didn't quite catch that.

1291
00:48:20,434 --> 00:48:21,463
I'm sorry.

1292
00:48:21,494 --> 00:48:23,562
- Dong Yeon, aren't your ears itchy? - Yes.

1293
00:48:23,563 --> 00:48:24,933
(Gosh, it didn't work.)

1294
00:48:24,934 --> 00:48:26,833
You should go inside first since you're first place.

1295
00:48:27,633 --> 00:48:29,942
- Take your time, guys. - Okay.

1296
00:48:29,943 --> 00:48:31,074
All right.

1297
00:48:32,804 --> 00:48:36,914
(Eun Woo gets to choose his room, so he takes a look at the rooms first.)

1298
00:48:37,244 --> 00:48:39,684
- Isn't this one cozy too? - It is.

1299
00:48:39,914 --> 00:48:41,053
To be honest, they're all nice.

1300
00:48:41,054 --> 00:48:43,054
We're just really lucky right now,

1301
00:48:43,554 --> 00:48:45,582
so we're starting to be greedy.

1302
00:48:45,583 --> 00:48:48,152
I feel like I'll fall asleep easily here.

1303
00:48:48,153 --> 00:48:49,652
("I feel like I'll fall asleep easily here.")

1304
00:48:49,653 --> 00:48:52,023
It is more compact.

1305
00:48:52,494 --> 00:48:56,833
(He takes a look at the bigger room too.)

1306
00:48:57,534 --> 00:48:59,833
(Eun Woo is carefully considering his options.)

1307
00:49:02,534 --> 00:49:04,244
- I choose this one. - This one?

1308
00:49:04,673 --> 00:49:06,243
- I choose this one. - This one?

1309
00:49:06,244 --> 00:49:08,843
Yes, I don't really like sleeping in big rooms.

1310
00:49:08,844 --> 00:49:09,844
(Eun Woo chooses the small room.)

1311
00:49:10,244 --> 00:49:11,583
You made a generous decision.

1312
00:49:12,113 --> 00:49:13,383
Well then, naturally...

1313
00:49:13,514 --> 00:49:14,684
Yes, you take the big room.

1314
00:49:15,184 --> 00:49:17,023
I have so many things, so I wanted the big room anyway.

1315
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:18,923
- Yes, you do have a lot of things. - Right.

1316
00:49:20,253 --> 00:49:21,824
- Guys. - Welcome.

1317
00:49:21,954 --> 00:49:24,264
- Who took this room? - Eun Woo.

1318
00:49:24,793 --> 00:49:26,123
Eun Woo gets his own room.

1319
00:49:26,124 --> 00:49:27,663
Gosh.

1320
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:29,263
(At least they're not sleeping in the tree tent.)

1321
00:49:29,264 --> 00:49:31,002
This is great.

1322
00:49:31,003 --> 00:49:32,233
This is amazing.

1323
00:49:32,363 --> 00:49:33,373
It is pretty.

1324
00:49:33,374 --> 00:49:34,374
- Eun Woo. - Yes?

1325
00:49:34,375 --> 00:49:36,133
What are you trying to do in a room by yourself?

1326
00:49:36,644 --> 00:49:38,542
- Why are you staying there alone? - What are you talking about?

1327
00:49:38,543 --> 00:49:40,073
All right.

1328
00:49:40,074 --> 00:49:41,212
Let's go.

1329
00:49:41,213 --> 00:49:42,474
- Where? - What are you saying?

1330
00:49:42,914 --> 00:49:44,684
Go where?

1331
00:49:45,014 --> 00:49:47,112
Since we brought our bags inside,

1332
00:49:47,113 --> 00:49:48,913
- let's unpack. - All right. Let's unpack...

1333
00:49:48,914 --> 00:49:51,023
- and relax before we regroup. - Okay.

1334
00:49:52,684 --> 00:49:53,824
(Gosh)

1335
00:49:55,793 --> 00:49:57,462
(Looking around)

1336
00:49:57,463 --> 00:49:59,123
Goodness, this is nice.

1337
00:49:59,124 --> 00:50:01,494
(Looking at the room while sitting still)

1338
00:50:01,934 --> 00:50:04,204
How many years had it been...

1339
00:50:04,664 --> 00:50:07,433
This is so old that we don't even know how long it's been built.

1340
00:50:07,434 --> 00:50:09,272
They said it was built in the 18th century.

1341
00:50:09,273 --> 00:50:11,204
So it's more than 200 years old.

1342
00:50:11,273 --> 00:50:12,374
Right.

1343
00:50:13,644 --> 00:50:16,982
(All over the room,)

1344
00:50:16,983 --> 00:50:21,813
(there are traces and signs of the long time.)

1345
00:50:26,324 --> 00:50:29,824
Gosh, I like being cozy. When my room is too big, it's...

1346
00:50:30,023 --> 00:50:31,692
(He's a tall guy who likes small spaces.)

1347
00:50:31,693 --> 00:50:33,264
This is the perfect size.

1348
00:50:35,534 --> 00:50:38,363
(Eun Woo is humming while looking around his room.)

1349
00:50:38,733 --> 00:50:40,673
(Humming)

1350
00:50:41,133 --> 00:50:42,603
(Gosh)

1351
00:50:42,604 --> 00:50:44,903
(I love my room!)

1352
00:50:45,204 --> 00:50:47,312
(Meanwhile, what's Dong Yeon up to in the big room?)

1353
00:50:47,313 --> 00:50:49,443
First of all, the fact that there's a door.

1354
00:50:49,644 --> 00:50:51,083
The fact that there's a door.

1355
00:50:52,244 --> 00:50:53,684
And there's electric lighting.

1356
00:50:54,514 --> 00:50:56,522
Do I really deserve to enjoy such luxury?

1357
00:50:56,523 --> 00:50:57,854
(Do I really deserve to enjoy such luxury?)

1358
00:50:58,253 --> 00:51:01,624
(So this really is my room?)

1359
00:51:02,423 --> 00:51:03,663
Watch your hand.

1360
00:51:03,664 --> 00:51:08,133
(He slept in the dark attic in their first house.)

1361
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:14,474
(At their second house, he slept in a tree tent with no door or walls.)

1362
00:51:15,133 --> 00:51:16,743
This is beautiful.

1363
00:51:16,744 --> 00:51:18,144
(He knows how precious having doors and lighting is.)

1364
00:51:18,804 --> 00:51:20,414
Before I mess it up,

1365
00:51:22,713 --> 00:51:24,283
I should take a picture.

1366
00:51:24,284 --> 00:51:27,113
(I should take a picture!)

1367
00:51:28,583 --> 00:51:33,184
(No matter how much Dong Yeon looks at it, the room is lovely.)

1368
00:51:34,054 --> 00:51:37,023
(He's putting in a lot of effort in taking pictures.)

1369
00:51:37,664 --> 00:51:40,594
(After taking a whole bunch of pictures of the room,)

1370
00:51:41,463 --> 00:51:45,034
(he takes some selfies.)

1371
00:51:45,604 --> 00:51:47,873
(Immersed)

1372
00:51:47,874 --> 00:51:51,173
(I'm the only one in this room right now.)

1373
00:51:51,844 --> 00:51:55,874
(I now have my own room.)

1374
00:51:56,074 --> 00:52:00,354
(It's 5pm in no time.)

1375
00:52:00,414 --> 00:52:05,123
If it's possible, we would need some help...

1376
00:52:05,124 --> 00:52:07,953
- Really? Sure, anything. - with our sheep.

1377
00:52:07,954 --> 00:52:10,022
- I'll do it. - We'll do it together.

1378
00:52:10,023 --> 00:52:11,363
Yes, sure.

1379
00:52:13,023 --> 00:52:16,833
(In Lapland, sheep ranching is as important as reindeer ranching.)

1380
00:52:17,204 --> 00:52:21,003
(The land of snow has a long winter of 7 months.)

1381
00:52:21,474 --> 00:52:26,974
(Because of this climate, they need nutritious food high in protein.)

1382
00:52:27,514 --> 00:52:31,583
(Among them is dairy products like sheep milk or cheese,)

1383
00:52:32,043 --> 00:52:35,483
(which is an important food source for the people of Lapland.)

1384
00:52:35,954 --> 00:52:38,523
(Also, sheep wool is warm and durable.)

1385
00:52:38,923 --> 00:52:43,523
(It's useful when making clothes or blankets.)

1386
00:52:44,523 --> 00:52:48,363
(The landlords spend most of their time taking care of animals.)

1387
00:52:50,233 --> 00:52:53,434
(What will taking care of the sheep entail today?)

1388
00:52:56,534 --> 00:53:00,113
(A beauty salon for sheep? That's piquing their curiosity.)

1389
00:53:00,273 --> 00:53:01,672
I'll go bring them.

1390
00:53:01,673 --> 00:53:03,683
(They confidently walk toward the sheep.)

1391
00:53:03,684 --> 00:53:06,143
- Try to get only one. - One.

1392
00:53:06,144 --> 00:53:08,082
Because they want all to come.

1393
00:53:08,083 --> 00:53:09,152
Keep the opening this wide.

1394
00:53:09,153 --> 00:53:10,953
- Yes, that's it. It's you. - Come here.

1395
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:12,854
Yes, come this way.

1396
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:15,053
- Look at this. - Here.

1397
00:53:15,054 --> 00:53:17,062
Look at this. We can't do this.

1398
00:53:17,063 --> 00:53:19,223
- One's out. - Wait.

1399
00:53:19,224 --> 00:53:20,793
- Okay. - Nice.

1400
00:53:20,963 --> 00:53:22,764
- You did it. - Next.

1401
00:53:22,934 --> 00:53:26,633
Next, of course, you should take it to the trimming stand.

1402
00:53:27,434 --> 00:53:28,573
Cute.

1403
00:53:28,574 --> 00:53:31,304
(Je Hoon tries to herd the sheep.)

1404
00:53:31,673 --> 00:53:32,772
(It looks like it's coming to Je Hoon,)

1405
00:53:32,773 --> 00:53:34,043
(but it soon turns away.)

1406
00:53:34,673 --> 00:53:35,743
(The sheep is unfamiliar with its new roommates.)

1407
00:53:35,744 --> 00:53:37,344
Just open it first.

1408
00:53:38,284 --> 00:53:39,343
Just open.

1409
00:53:39,344 --> 00:53:41,184
(They open the trimming stand and lure it with a treat.)

1410
00:53:42,753 --> 00:53:43,882
Lower it.

1411
00:53:43,883 --> 00:53:44,923
(The sheep is using its front legs to go back and forth.)

1412
00:53:45,224 --> 00:53:47,523
We'll move its legs.

1413
00:53:48,293 --> 00:53:49,293
(Hop)

1414
00:53:50,324 --> 00:53:53,093
Calm it down.

1415
00:53:53,094 --> 00:53:54,792
- Very calm. - Move slowly.

1416
00:53:54,793 --> 00:53:56,062
It's quite smart.

1417
00:53:56,063 --> 00:53:58,104
(First thing's first, the sheep checks how it looks.)

1418
00:53:58,204 --> 00:53:59,764
(It's not easy, is it?)

1419
00:54:00,133 --> 00:54:01,233
Hello.

1420
00:54:04,644 --> 00:54:08,543
(Je Hoon tries luring the sheep with his sweetness.)

1421
00:54:11,744 --> 00:54:13,813
- Good. Perfect. - Good.

1422
00:54:14,354 --> 00:54:15,583
Nice.

1423
00:54:16,483 --> 00:54:17,753
(Bleating)

1424
00:54:17,854 --> 00:54:19,023
I'm sorry.

1425
00:54:21,324 --> 00:54:22,652
- Does it hurt? - And now,

1426
00:54:22,653 --> 00:54:23,993
- You're all right, right? - we have to keep...

1427
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:26,692
- Keep the sheep very calm. - Very calm.

1428
00:54:26,693 --> 00:54:29,094
So you can talk...

1429
00:54:29,193 --> 00:54:31,403
- to her. - And you move slowly.

1430
00:54:31,633 --> 00:54:33,033
(Thanks to them, the sheep quickly calmed down.)

1431
00:54:33,034 --> 00:54:34,232
And...

1432
00:54:34,233 --> 00:54:36,304
- now... Yes. - We need to grab it?

1433
00:54:37,374 --> 00:54:38,874
I'll hold it like this.

1434
00:54:39,173 --> 00:54:41,442
- Okay. - Just keep it in place.

1435
00:54:41,443 --> 00:54:43,172
I'll squeeze my thighs.

1436
00:54:43,173 --> 00:54:45,113
(What on earth did they mean by beauty salon?)

1437
00:54:45,414 --> 00:54:46,812
It will be over soon.

1438
00:54:46,813 --> 00:54:47,954
(The landlords show them a demonstration.)

1439
00:54:48,554 --> 00:54:51,223
(At the beauty salon,)

1440
00:54:51,224 --> 00:54:54,593
(they trim sheep hooves.)

1441
00:54:54,594 --> 00:54:56,693
(Do sheep get their hooves trimmed?)

1442
00:54:57,394 --> 00:55:00,023
This is the part.

1443
00:55:00,994 --> 00:55:02,692
(Hooves have to be trimmed regularly to prevent infection and injuries.)

1444
00:55:02,693 --> 00:55:06,563
If you cut too deep, it will be bloody.

1445
00:55:08,374 --> 00:55:09,433
(The man of nature aspirant has never seen this before.)

1446
00:55:09,434 --> 00:55:10,903
You don't like this.

1447
00:55:11,204 --> 00:55:12,773
- Do you want to try it? - Okay.

1448
00:55:12,874 --> 00:55:15,874
Then you have to hold it with a lot of force with your thighs.

1449
00:55:15,943 --> 00:55:17,442
It keeps moving around.

1450
00:55:17,443 --> 00:55:18,943
(The two of them take care of the sheep together.)

1451
00:55:21,383 --> 00:55:23,284
(Keeping it in place)

1452
00:55:23,624 --> 00:55:24,753
Okay.

1453
00:55:26,684 --> 00:55:30,523
(The sheep is pushed to one side, so it can stand more comfortably.)

1454
00:55:30,764 --> 00:55:32,323
I'll try trimming a hoof.

1455
00:55:32,324 --> 00:55:34,563
(They're more skilled at handling the sheep after experiencing it.)

1456
00:55:36,463 --> 00:55:38,033
(Je Hoon is trimming its hoof meticulously.)

1457
00:55:38,034 --> 00:55:39,563
The hoof is...

1458
00:55:41,733 --> 00:55:43,273
You have done this before?

1459
00:55:46,604 --> 00:55:47,643
My first time.

1460
00:55:47,644 --> 00:55:48,673
(It's his first time touching sheep today.)

1461
00:55:49,813 --> 00:55:52,213
(Skilled as if it wasn't his first time)

1462
00:55:52,514 --> 00:55:53,554
Nice.

1463
00:55:54,813 --> 00:55:55,813
(Je Hoon carefully lifts the other leg.)

1464
00:55:55,814 --> 00:55:56,883
Like this.

1465
00:55:57,784 --> 00:56:00,224
(Dong Yeon holds it meticulously.)

1466
00:56:01,394 --> 00:56:02,454
It'll be over soon.

1467
00:56:02,594 --> 00:56:04,422
Yes, just like that.

1468
00:56:04,423 --> 00:56:05,423
(Given how skilled he's getting,)

1469
00:56:05,963 --> 00:56:07,562
(it's expected to be his regular.)

1470
00:56:07,563 --> 00:56:09,062
Let him go. Okay.

1471
00:56:09,063 --> 00:56:10,934
Okay. Now, we're done.

1472
00:56:12,563 --> 00:56:15,204
And open it like this.

1473
00:56:15,403 --> 00:56:17,073
- Okay. - Thanks for your patience.

1474
00:56:17,074 --> 00:56:18,473
Okay. And now...

1475
00:56:18,474 --> 00:56:19,543
It must've been hard.

1476
00:56:19,903 --> 00:56:22,213
You can give him a little of this.

1477
00:56:23,014 --> 00:56:24,043
Good job.

1478
00:56:24,284 --> 00:56:25,313
Come here.

1479
00:56:25,813 --> 00:56:27,853
It's time to go back inside now.

1480
00:56:27,854 --> 00:56:28,954
(It's not over until it's brought back inside.)

1481
00:56:29,684 --> 00:56:30,883
Is it good?

1482
00:56:31,354 --> 00:56:32,482
Go inside now.

1483
00:56:32,483 --> 00:56:33,824
(He lures it with some snacks.)

1484
00:56:34,293 --> 00:56:36,192
(Crowded)

1485
00:56:36,193 --> 00:56:37,692
Wait. This is not good.

1486
00:56:37,693 --> 00:56:39,693
Look. The sheep shouldn't come out.

1487
00:56:40,793 --> 00:56:42,962
- Okay. - It should go in.

1488
00:56:42,963 --> 00:56:44,232
(Despite the confident answer)

1489
00:56:44,233 --> 00:56:46,233
- Oh, no. - Wait.

1490
00:56:48,673 --> 00:56:50,672
Don't let the sheep out.

1491
00:56:50,673 --> 00:56:52,644
Don't let... Oh, come on.

1492
00:56:53,074 --> 00:56:54,312
(Flustered)

1493
00:56:54,313 --> 00:56:56,273
The sheep shouldn't come out.

1494
00:56:57,313 --> 00:56:59,583
(It ends up leaving the place.)

1495
00:56:59,983 --> 00:57:02,413
(Oh, come on.)

1496
00:57:02,414 --> 00:57:05,684
(We're watching you.)

1497
00:57:05,854 --> 00:57:06,854
Here.

1498
00:57:07,523 --> 00:57:10,193
You need to lure it inside.

1499
00:57:10,624 --> 00:57:12,292
Right. There you go.

1500
00:57:12,293 --> 00:57:14,133
- Nice. - Come out.

1501
00:57:14,293 --> 00:57:15,563
It should go in more.

1502
00:57:15,594 --> 00:57:17,902
Close the door. Okay.

1503
00:57:17,903 --> 00:57:19,003
- There you go. - Come out.

1504
00:57:20,003 --> 00:57:22,502
There you go.

1505
00:57:22,503 --> 00:57:23,974
- Nice. - Come here.

1506
00:57:24,104 --> 00:57:25,303
He's professional now.

1507
00:57:25,304 --> 00:57:26,874
(He's lucky with his tenants this time.)

1508
00:57:26,974 --> 00:57:29,644
Come here and sit down like this.

1509
00:57:30,284 --> 00:57:31,313
Here.

1510
00:57:32,644 --> 00:57:33,683
It's eating grass.

1511
00:57:33,684 --> 00:57:35,683
(It prefers staple food to snacks.)

1512
00:57:35,684 --> 00:57:36,854
Come here.

1513
00:57:37,423 --> 00:57:38,883
Delicious, right?

1514
00:57:42,824 --> 00:57:44,394
(Oh, I almost fell for it.)

1515
00:57:44,594 --> 00:57:45,963
Gosh, it knows.

1516
00:57:46,934 --> 00:57:48,132
- Okay. - Here.

1517
00:57:48,133 --> 00:57:49,562
(The landlord couple ends up giving him help.)

1518
00:57:49,563 --> 00:57:50,863
(It's forced to come up.)

1519
00:57:51,704 --> 00:57:52,704
Here.

1520
00:57:53,633 --> 00:57:54,732
There we go.

1521
00:57:54,733 --> 00:57:56,073
(While it's busy eating, they fix its head.)

1522
00:57:56,074 --> 00:57:57,244
Just a moment.

1523
00:57:58,474 --> 00:57:59,503
What's your name?

1524
00:58:00,074 --> 00:58:01,143
Arqese.

1525
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:02,844
- "Arqese?" - Arqese?

1526
00:58:03,144 --> 00:58:04,684
"Arqese?"

1527
00:58:04,813 --> 00:58:07,313
(Arqese, Tina, Carjat, Eva)

1528
00:58:07,914 --> 00:58:10,753
(Each one has a name too.)

1529
00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:13,284
Eva is always looking in there.

1530
00:58:13,324 --> 00:58:15,094
There it is.

1531
00:58:15,454 --> 00:58:17,022
(Eva's hobby is to peeping into the hen house.)

1532
00:58:17,023 --> 00:58:18,094
How cute.

1533
00:58:18,224 --> 00:58:19,792
Gosh, it's so cute.

1534
00:58:19,793 --> 00:58:21,033
You can feed her.

1535
00:58:21,034 --> 00:58:22,593
- Yes, she loves this. - So cute!

1536
00:58:22,594 --> 00:58:24,603
- Her name is Tina. - Tina.

1537
00:58:24,604 --> 00:58:26,934
This one is the shiest.

1538
00:58:27,173 --> 00:58:29,104
She says it's the shiest one.

1539
00:58:29,574 --> 00:58:31,144
- It's a boy. - Yes.

1540
00:58:31,374 --> 00:58:34,474
It's really like a donkey sometimes.

1541
00:58:36,374 --> 00:58:40,184
(Carjat is the official troublemaker in this farm.)

1542
00:58:40,883 --> 00:58:41,982
(They're more like a family to the landlord couple.)

1543
00:58:41,983 --> 00:58:43,414
Going nice.

1544
00:58:44,023 --> 00:58:45,354
Very nice.

1545
00:58:46,054 --> 00:58:47,553
I'll trim you nicely.

1546
00:58:47,554 --> 00:58:50,054
(Following their loving heart, he trims its face hair too.)

1547
00:58:50,523 --> 00:58:53,093
(Please shape my sideburns nicely.)

1548
00:58:53,094 --> 00:58:55,163
It's kind of like a barbershop.

1549
00:58:55,164 --> 00:58:56,394
- Yes. - Right.

1550
00:58:56,934 --> 00:58:58,363
It's becoming more handsome.

1551
00:58:59,534 --> 00:59:00,902
(Really?)

1552
00:59:00,903 --> 00:59:02,934
- He enjoys this. - Yes.

1553
00:59:03,104 --> 00:59:04,144
He likes it.

1554
00:59:04,244 --> 00:59:05,844
It's all over. Good job.

1555
00:59:06,403 --> 00:59:07,974
(Neat and tidy)

1556
00:59:09,074 --> 00:59:12,212
Okay. I think this is good enough of meeting the sheep.

1557
00:59:12,213 --> 00:59:13,684
(The sheep are looking pretty now thanks to you guys.)

1558
00:59:14,054 --> 00:59:16,312
(Meanwhile, where are Dong Hwi and Eun Woo?)

1559
00:59:16,313 --> 00:59:17,482
- Dong Hwi. - What?

1560
00:59:17,483 --> 00:59:19,823
Have you hand-washed a car before?

1561
00:59:19,824 --> 00:59:21,824
- No. - This is my first time too.

1562
00:59:22,153 --> 00:59:23,253
First off...

1563
00:59:23,793 --> 00:59:25,263
Look. I guess...

1564
00:59:25,264 --> 00:59:26,993
water comes out from this. It has a hose.

1565
00:59:26,994 --> 00:59:28,063
You're right.

1566
00:59:28,293 --> 00:59:29,633
Oh, what is this?

1567
00:59:29,894 --> 00:59:31,132
We finally have a hose.

1568
00:59:31,133 --> 00:59:32,164
(They have a hose. This means...)

1569
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:35,132
- Okay. - And then, here.

1570
00:59:35,133 --> 00:59:36,632
(Turning on the water pump and pressing the water sprayer)

1571
00:59:36,633 --> 00:59:38,204
- Yes. - I see.

1572
00:59:39,104 --> 00:59:42,113
(They finally meet a proper kind of water after a week.)

1573
00:59:42,673 --> 00:59:44,283
(Touched)

1574
00:59:44,284 --> 00:59:45,744
It's better.

1575
00:59:46,744 --> 00:59:48,382
Is this natural water?

1576
00:59:48,383 --> 00:59:50,252
Yes, it's from underground.

1577
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:52,152
- I see. - It's underground water.

1578
00:59:52,153 --> 00:59:54,253
(It pumps up underground water for domestic uses.)

1579
00:59:54,354 --> 00:59:57,022
And you get water for the sauna from this.

1580
00:59:57,023 --> 00:59:58,563
- I see. - Okay.

1581
00:59:58,793 --> 01:00:00,394
It's really cold water.

1582
01:00:00,494 --> 01:00:02,593
- Is it really cold? - Yes.

1583
01:00:02,594 --> 01:00:04,863
- I guess it's underground water. - It's really cold.

1584
01:00:05,664 --> 01:00:09,673
(Don't worry. We've fetched water from a puddle.)

1585
01:00:09,804 --> 01:00:10,873
Let's wash our car.

1586
01:00:10,874 --> 01:00:12,442
Dong Hwi and I...

1587
01:00:12,443 --> 01:00:13,943
- will... - Wash the car.

1588
01:00:14,273 --> 01:00:16,112
This is enough. Look.

1589
01:00:16,113 --> 01:00:17,443
(They're grateful just for the fact they don't have to fetch water.)

1590
01:00:18,113 --> 01:00:20,013
Oh, I have to push the back one.

1591
01:00:20,014 --> 01:00:23,082
- We can select a mode too. - Okay.

1592
01:00:23,083 --> 01:00:24,152
(The problem is...)

1593
01:00:24,153 --> 01:00:27,894
(they don't even know that the window is open.)

1594
01:00:28,793 --> 01:00:30,923
Hey, the window is open.

1595
01:00:31,523 --> 01:00:32,763
The window is open. Hurry.

1596
01:00:32,764 --> 01:00:35,462
Hey, is it wet inside?

1597
01:00:35,463 --> 01:00:36,663
(Fortunately, not much water came in.)

1598
01:00:36,664 --> 01:00:39,204
- It's okay. - Hurry up and close it.

1599
01:00:39,434 --> 01:00:41,204
Who took the passenger's seat?

1600
01:00:41,673 --> 01:00:42,733
Wasn't it you?

1601
01:00:43,104 --> 01:00:45,543
What are you talking about? I just drove the car here.

1602
01:00:46,204 --> 01:00:47,373
(Sliding down)

1603
01:00:47,374 --> 01:00:49,473
Dong Hwi, can you reverse a little?

1604
01:00:49,474 --> 01:00:52,583
(He lowered the window to move the car just a while ago.)

1605
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:54,752
(They resume with the window closed.)

1606
01:00:54,753 --> 01:00:56,153
That really surprised me.

1607
01:00:57,583 --> 01:00:58,752
(Traces of their harsh journey)

1608
01:00:58,753 --> 01:01:01,752
Let's wash it roughly in general first.

1609
01:01:01,753 --> 01:01:03,054
(Traces of their harsh journey)

1610
01:01:04,023 --> 01:01:05,293
I've had...

1611
01:01:06,224 --> 01:01:09,894
some kind of romance about hand-washing a car.

1612
01:01:10,063 --> 01:01:11,304
- Really? - Yes.

1613
01:01:11,333 --> 01:01:13,462
Then, will you do this alone?

1614
01:01:13,463 --> 01:01:14,604
No.

1615
01:01:17,344 --> 01:01:18,402
Gosh, this...

1616
01:01:18,403 --> 01:01:19,803
(There's no carwash in this neighborhood anyway.)

1617
01:01:19,804 --> 01:01:21,744
- It's fun. - Is it?

1618
01:01:22,514 --> 01:01:24,513
It refreshes my mind too.

1619
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:25,812
I'll start from where you finished.

1620
01:01:25,813 --> 01:01:26,914
Go on.

1621
01:01:27,854 --> 01:01:29,312
Gosh, my sleeves keep coming down.

1622
01:01:29,313 --> 01:01:30,313
(The long sleeves bother him.)

1623
01:01:31,124 --> 01:01:32,124
What is it?

1624
01:01:32,324 --> 01:01:33,824
I'm going to take this off.

1625
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:35,124
Okay.

1626
01:01:41,693 --> 01:01:44,863
If dirt gets stuck in this brush, it won't be easy to wash it off.

1627
01:01:45,304 --> 01:01:46,862
No, we can do it.

1628
01:01:46,863 --> 01:01:47,903
(He gets fully ready with his sleeves rolled up.)

1629
01:01:48,133 --> 01:01:49,673
(Surprised)

1630
01:01:49,934 --> 01:01:51,003
Can I do this?

1631
01:01:52,943 --> 01:01:55,474
(You'll regret it if you do.)

1632
01:01:55,974 --> 01:01:59,184
Can you strongly spray water inside each wheel?

1633
01:01:59,684 --> 01:02:00,712
(He wants to.)

1634
01:02:00,713 --> 01:02:01,954
- But... - Yes?

1635
01:02:02,753 --> 01:02:04,053
it's not as easy...

1636
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:06,023
(The hardened mud wouldn't come off so easily.)

1637
01:02:07,923 --> 01:02:14,063
(He meticulously focuses on the frames near the wheels.)

1638
01:02:14,394 --> 01:02:16,332
(Water has been sprayed here.)

1639
01:02:16,333 --> 01:02:18,034
Gosh, it's so... Dong Hwi.

1640
01:02:18,164 --> 01:02:20,204
Can't you be a little more meticulous?

1641
01:02:20,673 --> 01:02:21,773
I can't.

1642
01:02:21,974 --> 01:02:23,703
Goodness. Dong Hwi.

1643
01:02:23,704 --> 01:02:24,743
(The clean freak starts nagging him.)

1644
01:02:24,744 --> 01:02:27,513
What you see from up there... The upper part isn't...

1645
01:02:27,514 --> 01:02:28,574
(Who am I talking to?)

1646
01:02:29,414 --> 01:02:30,474
Dong Hwi!

1647
01:02:30,883 --> 01:02:31,883
What?

1648
01:02:32,943 --> 01:02:33,954
Nothing.

1649
01:02:34,483 --> 01:02:35,553
- What? - Dong Hwi.

1650
01:02:35,554 --> 01:02:36,684
(Acting like he can't hear)

1651
01:02:37,014 --> 01:02:38,923
(I know you can hear me.)

1652
01:02:39,253 --> 01:02:40,823
(Pulling a trick to avoid his nagging)

1653
01:02:40,824 --> 01:02:42,752
- I know you can hear me. - Yes, I do. What is it?

1654
01:02:42,753 --> 01:02:44,062
Can't you be more meticulous?

1655
01:02:44,063 --> 01:02:45,192
Okay, I will.

1656
01:02:45,193 --> 01:02:47,663
If you stand like this and spray water...

1657
01:02:47,664 --> 01:02:49,164
- from one direction, - Yes?

1658
01:02:49,394 --> 01:02:51,264
you can't see thoroughly.

1659
01:02:51,804 --> 01:02:54,573
Lower yourself and look up the tires.

1660
01:02:54,574 --> 01:02:56,172
It's full of mud there.

1661
01:02:56,173 --> 01:02:57,502
- Oh, really? - Yes.

1662
01:02:57,503 --> 01:02:59,574
Okay. I'll do it upward. Oh, it's clean here.

1663
01:02:59,903 --> 01:03:01,074
- Is it? - Yes.

1664
01:03:01,344 --> 01:03:02,913
- It's not clean at all there. - But...

1665
01:03:02,914 --> 01:03:04,184
Okay. What the...

1666
01:03:04,784 --> 01:03:06,244
(Getting splashed)

1667
01:03:06,684 --> 01:03:08,514
(Are you going to keep nagging me?)

1668
01:03:08,883 --> 01:03:11,354
It didn't reach your eyes thanks to your glasses.

1669
01:03:11,753 --> 01:03:12,882
My glasses have no lenses.

1670
01:03:12,883 --> 01:03:14,954
(They're lens-free.)

1671
01:03:15,193 --> 01:03:16,354
- They don't? - No.

1672
01:03:17,394 --> 01:03:21,664
(The fashionista's embarrassing TPO for car-washing)

1673
01:03:21,863 --> 01:03:23,462
Try that side. I washed it just now.

1674
01:03:23,463 --> 01:03:25,232
- I'll do the other side. - I know you can do it fast.

1675
01:03:25,233 --> 01:03:26,704
- We just have four to do. - Okay.

1676
01:03:26,963 --> 01:03:27,973
(Full of mud)

1677
01:03:27,974 --> 01:03:29,673
- Come on and do it. - Okay.

1678
01:03:30,534 --> 01:03:32,273
It's like a lot of chocolate milk.

1679
01:03:32,503 --> 01:03:34,843
Gosh, like coffee milk.

1680
01:03:34,844 --> 01:03:36,014
(Due to the off-road driving, the car wouldn't be washed easily.)

1681
01:03:36,414 --> 01:03:37,844
It's hard.

1682
01:03:39,184 --> 01:03:43,184
(This perfectionist won't tolerate even a single stain of mud.)

1683
01:03:43,313 --> 01:03:45,923
We've traveled so much for a few days.

1684
01:03:46,284 --> 01:03:48,993
I know with so many unpaved roads.

1685
01:03:48,994 --> 01:03:51,224
(They're suddenly reminded of their journey with nature.)

1686
01:03:52,264 --> 01:03:53,293
Goodness.

1687
01:03:53,724 --> 01:03:55,233
- Dong Hwi. - What?

1688
01:03:55,333 --> 01:03:56,994
It's... Goodness.

1689
01:03:58,133 --> 01:04:00,874
- What? - It's not washed at all.

1690
01:04:01,434 --> 01:04:03,673
Eun Woo. I get it, okay?

1691
01:04:04,874 --> 01:04:06,074
Goodness, gracious.

1692
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:08,874
(Getting an idea)

1693
01:04:09,713 --> 01:04:11,684
(What is he trying to do?)

1694
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:15,954
(Getting back at him for all the nagging)

1695
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:19,684
(He gets splashed with water in the middle of working.)

1696
01:04:19,923 --> 01:04:21,224
Oh, come on.

1697
01:04:21,324 --> 01:04:23,253
Well... What?

1698
01:04:25,063 --> 01:04:26,063
What...

1699
01:04:26,594 --> 01:04:27,632
Dong Hwi.

1700
01:04:27,633 --> 01:04:29,632
(What a satisfying revenge for all his mischievous tricks.)

1701
01:04:29,633 --> 01:04:30,833
Are you kidding me?

1702
01:04:31,563 --> 01:04:34,074
- You really... - Eun Woo.

1703
01:04:34,804 --> 01:04:36,733
When did you go to a water festival alone?

1704
01:04:36,903 --> 01:04:38,574
When did you go to a water festival alone?

1705
01:04:40,914 --> 01:04:44,144
(He might even come out of the screen.)

1706
01:04:44,583 --> 01:04:47,013
(A wash festival in Finland)

1707
01:04:47,014 --> 01:04:48,784
Fine. Eun Woo, bring it on.

1708
01:04:48,954 --> 01:04:50,153
- Okay. - Bring it on.

1709
01:04:50,583 --> 01:04:52,683
When I'm ready, I'll give you a signal.

1710
01:04:52,684 --> 01:04:53,724
Okay.

1711
01:04:54,523 --> 01:04:55,594
Ready.

1712
01:04:56,224 --> 01:04:57,323
Not yet.

1713
01:04:57,324 --> 01:04:58,394
(Coming up with a trick)

1714
01:05:01,793 --> 01:05:04,833
(Determined never to get caught)

1715
01:05:05,164 --> 01:05:07,034
(Squeezing in)

1716
01:05:07,503 --> 01:05:08,604
Ready, go.

1717
01:05:10,374 --> 01:05:11,374
Where is he?

1718
01:05:11,744 --> 01:05:14,574
(Fortunately, he hasn't noticed.)

1719
01:05:15,874 --> 01:05:17,014
(Peekaboo)

1720
01:05:17,144 --> 01:05:18,213
Where is he?

1721
01:05:18,613 --> 01:05:19,644
(Chuckling)

1722
01:05:19,914 --> 01:05:21,954
(He can't find me, can he?)

1723
01:05:23,784 --> 01:05:24,784
Goodness.

1724
01:05:24,784 --> 01:05:25,784
(Found you.)

1725
01:05:25,954 --> 01:05:26,954
Goodness.

1726
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:29,493
(Wiggling)

1727
01:05:29,494 --> 01:05:30,494
Hey!

1728
01:05:31,224 --> 01:05:32,292
(Screaming)

1729
01:05:32,293 --> 01:05:33,293
Hey!

1730
01:05:35,363 --> 01:05:37,664
(He escapes in a rush.)

1731
01:05:38,804 --> 01:05:41,604
(Feeling humiliated for nothing)

1732
01:05:42,604 --> 01:05:44,203
(He's happy that he's done another teasing today.)

1733
01:05:44,204 --> 01:05:45,244
Dong Hwi.

1734
01:05:46,074 --> 01:05:48,344
Hey, I feel too humiliated to stand up.

1735
01:05:50,213 --> 01:05:53,483
(He crawls out of humiliation.)

1736
01:05:54,583 --> 01:05:56,514
(All wet)

1737
01:05:56,914 --> 01:05:58,083
- Eun Woo. - Dong Hwi.

1738
01:05:58,983 --> 01:06:01,494
You should've told me that you wanted number one.

1739
01:06:03,324 --> 01:06:04,462
This is...

1740
01:06:04,463 --> 01:06:05,463
(It's not that he wet his pants.)

1741
01:06:05,464 --> 01:06:06,523
How pretty.

1742
01:06:06,824 --> 01:06:08,363
Even my underwear is wet.

1743
01:06:10,164 --> 01:06:11,502
- Dong Hwi. - How did you find me?

1744
01:06:11,503 --> 01:06:13,263
(There may be blue...)

1745
01:06:13,264 --> 01:06:14,332
(and better blue.)

1746
01:06:14,333 --> 01:06:15,604
It wouldn't reach me.

1747
01:06:17,903 --> 01:06:19,573
(He's unstoppable.)

1748
01:06:19,574 --> 01:06:21,144
Let's stop fooling around now.

1749
01:06:21,673 --> 01:06:22,813
All right. Let's hurry and wash the car.

1750
01:06:23,773 --> 01:06:25,914
- Let's wrap it up. - Okay.

1751
01:06:27,344 --> 01:06:28,752
(Now that they've cooled off their sweat,)

1752
01:06:28,753 --> 01:06:30,153
(they finish up meticulously.)

1753
01:06:31,023 --> 01:06:34,893
(They're done experiencing their first car handwash.)

1754
01:06:34,894 --> 01:06:35,894
Done.

1755
01:06:36,094 --> 01:06:37,253
All done now.

1756
01:06:37,624 --> 01:06:38,624
Good job.

1757
01:06:38,625 --> 01:06:39,863
Good job.

1758
01:06:40,293 --> 01:06:41,293
It's clean.

1759
01:06:41,294 --> 01:06:42,594
It's as good as new.

1760
01:06:45,363 --> 01:06:46,462
Okay.

1761
01:06:46,463 --> 01:06:47,573
(After attending to the sheep, they are carrying some wooden boards.)

1762
01:06:47,574 --> 01:06:49,333
These are like bricks.

1763
01:06:52,474 --> 01:06:53,772
Yes.

1764
01:06:53,773 --> 01:06:54,844
There.

1765
01:06:55,074 --> 01:06:57,173
(They begin assembling something.)

1766
01:06:57,344 --> 01:07:00,184
Oh, there's no need...

1767
01:07:00,284 --> 01:07:01,653
for other steps.

1768
01:07:02,113 --> 01:07:03,752
It has latches.

1769
01:07:03,753 --> 01:07:04,753
(Juri made these materials herself.)

1770
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:06,453
Juri, you're a genius.

1771
01:07:06,454 --> 01:07:07,523
I think so.

1772
01:07:10,494 --> 01:07:11,863
One, two, three.

1773
01:07:12,264 --> 01:07:15,164
(What are they making?)

1774
01:07:17,833 --> 01:07:18,833
What are you up to?

1775
01:07:19,863 --> 01:07:21,703
It's a house for Broccoli. Oh, I mean...

1776
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:23,133
- Broccoli's house? - You mean, Border Collie.

1777
01:07:23,374 --> 01:07:25,103
(My house?)

1778
01:07:25,104 --> 01:07:29,042
In winter, the temperature drops lower than minus 30°C here.

1779
01:07:29,043 --> 01:07:33,612
It gets really cold, so it has to have an insulated roof.

1780
01:07:33,613 --> 01:07:34,854
(Insulated roofs are a must.)

1781
01:07:35,284 --> 01:07:39,224
(After the sheep, they attend to their dog.)

1782
01:07:39,483 --> 01:07:42,894
We should get a roof here...

1783
01:07:42,994 --> 01:07:46,324
and paint the house.

1784
01:07:46,463 --> 01:07:48,163
- Paint. - Paint, I see.

1785
01:07:48,164 --> 01:07:50,933
Here, we have... Actually, he's a good painter.

1786
01:07:50,934 --> 01:07:51,934
(Bragging about him)

1787
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:53,534
- Okay, good. - Right.

1788
01:07:54,133 --> 01:07:57,542
We'll do the nailing and attaching.

1789
01:07:57,543 --> 01:07:59,543
Why don't you guys paint the house?

1790
01:07:59,773 --> 01:08:00,914
- Okay. - Up there?

1791
01:08:01,074 --> 01:08:04,343
We'll make the dog house. You can take a break.

1792
01:08:04,344 --> 01:08:06,982
We're very thankful for this house,

1793
01:08:06,983 --> 01:08:09,812
so we're going to make it for you.

1794
01:08:09,813 --> 01:08:10,983
- Thanks. - Yes.

1795
01:08:11,324 --> 01:08:13,684
- Take your time. - Let's leave them to it.

1796
01:08:13,954 --> 01:08:15,423
- Thank you. - With both hands.

1797
01:08:15,494 --> 01:08:17,053
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1798
01:08:17,054 --> 01:08:18,463
It should match the house color.

1799
01:08:19,064 --> 01:08:22,032
So let's color it red or brown.

1800
01:08:22,033 --> 01:08:25,264
- Okay. Men in Lapland... - Yes.

1801
01:08:25,864 --> 01:08:30,133
have a fantasy of building their houses on their own.

1802
01:08:31,073 --> 01:08:32,304
- Men? - Yes.

1803
01:08:33,373 --> 01:08:34,944
I'm a good match to Lapland.

1804
01:08:35,413 --> 01:08:36,713
I have a similar fantasy.

1805
01:08:36,873 --> 01:08:38,242
Me too.

1806
01:08:38,243 --> 01:08:39,543
- Really? - Later in the future.

1807
01:08:42,713 --> 01:08:43,854
It's kind of fun.

1808
01:08:44,154 --> 01:08:45,154
I know. It's fun.

1809
01:08:45,953 --> 01:08:47,153
- Is it fun? - Yes.

1810
01:08:47,154 --> 01:08:49,322
(They're excited to do anything now that they're out in town.)

1811
01:08:49,323 --> 01:08:53,122
(Meanwhile, this artist is quite focused.)

1812
01:08:53,123 --> 01:08:54,564
Goodness.

1813
01:08:55,163 --> 01:08:56,663
- Dong Hwi. - Yes?

1814
01:08:56,764 --> 01:08:59,502
I'm coloring the side here yellow.

1815
01:08:59,503 --> 01:09:01,974
But the red paint crossed the line.

1816
01:09:02,073 --> 01:09:03,632
- It did? - Goodness.

1817
01:09:03,633 --> 01:09:05,274
- Oh, no. Okay. - It's not good.

1818
01:09:05,344 --> 01:09:06,502
- Je Hoon. - What?

1819
01:09:06,503 --> 01:09:08,613
I'm sorry, but it's freestyle painting.

1820
01:09:08,614 --> 01:09:11,213
(This design has its reason.)

1821
01:09:11,743 --> 01:09:14,484
(Perfect teamwork)

1822
01:09:14,614 --> 01:09:15,783
Is it good?

1823
01:09:16,514 --> 01:09:18,683
(They're quite meticulous and skilled.)

1824
01:09:18,684 --> 01:09:19,724
Where was it?

1825
01:09:19,823 --> 01:09:21,194
It must be here. Right?

1826
01:09:22,793 --> 01:09:25,694
(Eun Woo attaches waterproofing paper.)

1827
01:09:27,993 --> 01:09:31,203
(Dong Yeon does draft nailing.)

1828
01:09:33,033 --> 01:09:34,903
I'm learning the wisdom of life here.

1829
01:09:34,904 --> 01:09:37,533
(Dong Yeon's method to raise a work rotation time)

1830
01:09:38,173 --> 01:09:39,202
Nice, Dong Yeon.

1831
01:09:39,203 --> 01:09:40,304
- Not bad, right? - Yes.

1832
01:09:41,944 --> 01:09:43,913
- Should we nail it this way? - It would work.

1833
01:09:46,144 --> 01:09:51,724
(The two meticulous perfectionists have met.)

1834
01:09:52,753 --> 01:09:56,154
(Super focused)

1835
01:09:56,724 --> 01:10:00,224
(They work without talking.)

1836
01:10:00,663 --> 01:10:02,364
(Meticulous)

1837
01:10:02,934 --> 01:10:04,264
Let's do two more sheets after this.

1838
01:10:05,234 --> 01:10:06,234
Good.

1839
01:10:06,333 --> 01:10:08,333
- Nice. It's getting fast. - It's fun.

1840
01:10:09,133 --> 01:10:12,503
(I hope it will be the same for the result.)

1841
01:10:13,904 --> 01:10:18,413
(Building a dog house after carwashing and sheep trimming)

1842
01:10:19,583 --> 01:10:21,782
(Today,)

1843
01:10:21,783 --> 01:10:27,184
(they're really working out their forearm muscles.)

1844
01:10:30,224 --> 01:10:33,163
I'm kind of getting the hang of painting.

1845
01:10:34,463 --> 01:10:37,133
(As he focuses on painting,)

1846
01:10:38,163 --> 01:10:42,104
(he gets the hang of it.)

1847
01:10:43,474 --> 01:10:46,173
(The passionate painter won't miss a single crack.)

1848
01:10:46,243 --> 01:10:48,814
To spice it up... All right.

1849
01:10:49,043 --> 01:10:50,913
Let's spice it up.

1850
01:10:51,283 --> 01:10:52,683
"Nice to meet you."

1851
01:10:52,684 --> 01:10:53,782
(Dong Hwi begins decorating the house.)

1852
01:10:53,783 --> 01:10:55,912
- "Ransu." - "Ransu."

1853
01:10:55,913 --> 01:10:57,453
R-A-N-S-U.

1854
01:10:58,253 --> 01:11:01,554
(He draws with nonchalant strokes.)

1855
01:11:02,694 --> 01:11:05,293
(The youngest members are finishing it up too.)

1856
01:11:05,463 --> 01:11:08,564
(They're so focused that their veins are popped.)

1857
01:11:09,194 --> 01:11:11,734
(Doing their jobs faithfully)

1858
01:11:11,963 --> 01:11:13,163
I think we're pretty much done.

1859
01:11:13,333 --> 01:11:14,404
Done.

1860
01:11:14,673 --> 01:11:15,733
Okay.

1861
01:11:15,734 --> 01:11:17,673
(The one and only house for Ransu is complete.)

1862
01:11:17,944 --> 01:11:19,872
- Ransu might love this. - I know.

1863
01:11:19,873 --> 01:11:21,042
I wonder if Ransu will like this.

1864
01:11:21,043 --> 01:11:24,212
Look at how Dong Hwi spiced it up...

1865
01:11:24,213 --> 01:11:25,513
with amazing strokes.

1866
01:11:25,514 --> 01:11:27,443
Does that yellow pattern...

1867
01:11:27,444 --> 01:11:30,013
mean a dog's paw?

1868
01:11:30,014 --> 01:11:32,223
A piece can be interpreted freely...

1869
01:11:32,224 --> 01:11:33,854
depending on how each person sees it.

1870
01:11:34,423 --> 01:11:36,493
How you've interpreted it is right.

1871
01:11:36,953 --> 01:11:40,694
And this thing on the roof...

1872
01:11:41,434 --> 01:11:43,292
It's for waterproofing, right?

1873
01:11:43,293 --> 01:11:44,293
- Yes. - The roof can never leak.

1874
01:11:44,294 --> 01:11:45,663
- Right. - Perfect.

1875
01:11:45,864 --> 01:11:47,462
It's meticulously done.

1876
01:11:47,463 --> 01:11:49,332
- I think Dong Yeon and I... - Our teamwork is not bad, right?

1877
01:11:49,333 --> 01:11:51,343
- Don't we work well together? - You're so good.

1878
01:11:51,344 --> 01:11:52,603
It's perfect.

1879
01:11:52,604 --> 01:11:55,242
- It's meant to be practical. - It's done neatly...

1880
01:11:55,243 --> 01:11:56,813
in perfect order.

1881
01:11:56,814 --> 01:11:57,814
Great job.

1882
01:11:58,583 --> 01:12:00,413
- It's nicely done. - Anyway, I'm hungry.

1883
01:12:00,514 --> 01:12:01,613
- Okay. - Okay.

1884
01:12:01,614 --> 01:12:02,983
- Let's go eat. - Good work.

1885
01:12:02,984 --> 01:12:04,252
- Good work. - Let's go.

1886
01:12:04,253 --> 01:12:05,354
(It's already 8pm.)

1887
01:12:06,083 --> 01:12:07,083
I like it.

1888
01:12:07,084 --> 01:12:09,823
(They'll let it dry under the midnight sun.)

1889
01:12:10,194 --> 01:12:13,064
(Thanks, guys.)

1890
01:12:15,163 --> 01:12:17,533
(Sighing)

1891
01:12:18,604 --> 01:12:20,263
(He needs to cook.)

1892
01:12:20,264 --> 01:12:24,104
(But he lies down first.)

1893
01:12:24,703 --> 01:12:27,203
- It's hard to trim the sheep. - Right.

1894
01:12:28,114 --> 01:12:29,143
(Je Hoon was tensed up in case he'd hurt the sheep.)

1895
01:12:29,144 --> 01:12:30,144
I'm exhausted.

1896
01:12:31,713 --> 01:12:33,583
- I see you're drained. - Yes.

1897
01:12:34,783 --> 01:12:36,282
How was it trimming the sheep's hooves?

1898
01:12:36,283 --> 01:12:38,882
We needed to be very delicate.

1899
01:12:38,883 --> 01:12:40,153
They said the sheep could bleed...

1900
01:12:40,154 --> 01:12:41,393
- if we cut them too deeply. - Right.

1901
01:12:41,394 --> 01:12:44,223
I tried to cut them thinly and meticulously.

1902
01:12:44,224 --> 01:12:45,224
Good job.

1903
01:12:45,323 --> 01:12:47,493
It was not easy,

1904
01:12:47,864 --> 01:12:49,332
but it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

1905
01:12:49,333 --> 01:12:50,393
It was meaningful.

1906
01:12:50,394 --> 01:12:52,264
When you guys were trimming the sheep's hooves...

1907
01:12:53,203 --> 01:12:54,604
You're spitting again.

1908
01:12:55,173 --> 01:12:57,403
He sprayed water directly to my anus.

1909
01:12:57,404 --> 01:12:58,404
(He sprayed water to his anus.)

1910
01:12:58,405 --> 01:13:00,643
- Right. - The water was sprayed to my anus.

1911
01:13:00,644 --> 01:13:03,474
It felt almost like I was standing on a fountain.

1912
01:13:03,573 --> 01:13:06,913
So Eun Woo volunteered to be your personal bidet.

1913
01:13:07,783 --> 01:13:10,483
It's because you kept complaining about the bathroom condition.

1914
01:13:10,484 --> 01:13:12,622
- You must be grateful. - I volunteered to help.

1915
01:13:12,623 --> 01:13:13,654
(This is not it.)

1916
01:13:13,684 --> 01:13:14,694
Not you too, Je Hoon.

1917
01:13:15,854 --> 01:13:18,564
(Everyone's in this together.)

1918
01:13:19,323 --> 01:13:20,923
How are you going to live without me?

1919
01:13:21,963 --> 01:13:23,993
(He can't live without anyone to tease.)

1920
01:13:24,633 --> 01:13:25,833
I'm hungry.

1921
01:13:25,864 --> 01:13:29,533
Then let's cook with the stuff we bought from the store.

1922
01:13:29,904 --> 01:13:31,872
We'll have stir-fried sausages and vegetables,

1923
01:13:31,873 --> 01:13:34,672
green onion kimchi, and omelet rice.

1924
01:13:34,673 --> 01:13:36,613
The stir-fried sausages and vegetables is...

1925
01:13:36,614 --> 01:13:38,783
for four people. That's the recipe.

1926
01:13:39,184 --> 01:13:41,212
- It makes four servings? - Yes, it's for four people.

1927
01:13:41,213 --> 01:13:43,553
Well, I think I'll be fine...

1928
01:13:43,554 --> 01:13:44,953
- with this recipe. - It's not hard, right?

1929
01:13:45,423 --> 01:13:46,923
I can make it perfectly.

1930
01:13:47,383 --> 01:13:48,694
Trust me and leave it up to me.

1931
01:13:49,594 --> 01:13:50,752
- I wonder... - I think he said that...

1932
01:13:50,753 --> 01:13:52,024
for the scrambled eggs too.

1933
01:13:52,764 --> 01:13:54,094
I wonder...

1934
01:13:54,564 --> 01:13:55,792
I'll cook the stir-fried sausages and vegetables.

1935
01:13:55,793 --> 01:13:56,863
And Dong Yeon...

1936
01:13:56,864 --> 01:13:58,632
If someone can just help me wash the rice...

1937
01:13:58,633 --> 01:13:59,863
Oh, I'll do it.

1938
01:13:59,864 --> 01:14:01,632
- Do you know how to wash rice? - Of course.

1939
01:14:01,633 --> 01:14:02,673
(I'll be Dong Yeon's cooking assistant.)

1940
01:14:03,673 --> 01:14:04,903
There's something else for you to do.

1941
01:14:04,904 --> 01:14:06,473
- What's that? - You shouldn't be doing that stuff.

1942
01:14:06,474 --> 01:14:07,643
- What is it? - You have an important task.

1943
01:14:07,644 --> 01:14:09,113
What is it? Leave it up to me. I'll do anything.

1944
01:14:09,114 --> 01:14:10,773
- It's garlic. - Oh, mincing garlic.

1945
01:14:10,774 --> 01:14:12,212
- You have to mince garlic again. - Garlic?

1946
01:14:12,213 --> 01:14:13,583
Okay, I'll do it.

1947
01:14:13,684 --> 01:14:15,684
When I minced garlic yesterday,

1948
01:14:15,814 --> 01:14:17,313
I think I was meant to do it.

1949
01:14:17,314 --> 01:14:19,123
But we need quite a lot today.

1950
01:14:19,423 --> 01:14:20,553
(Oh, I see.)

1951
01:14:20,554 --> 01:14:22,194
- We need a lot of garlic? - Yes, we do.

1952
01:14:22,293 --> 01:14:23,952
Then I'll help Je Hoon...

1953
01:14:23,953 --> 01:14:26,524
- and cook the sausages together. - All right.

1954
01:14:26,724 --> 01:14:27,934
Okay, then.

1955
01:14:28,033 --> 01:14:29,733
- Let's go cook. - Let's get to work.

1956
01:14:29,734 --> 01:14:31,032
(Let's go and cook dinner!)

1957
01:14:31,033 --> 01:14:32,404
- Let's go. Garlic. - All right, Je Hoon.

1958
01:14:32,663 --> 01:14:35,172
- Garlic is just... - It feels like we're going to war.

1959
01:14:35,173 --> 01:14:37,502
- What is garlic anyway? - Let's go.

1960
01:14:37,503 --> 01:14:38,573
- The recipe. - Right.

1961
01:14:38,743 --> 01:14:40,043
Oh, you have to take that.

1962
01:14:40,104 --> 01:14:42,614
Stir-fried sausages and vegetables. It's tasty.

1963
01:14:43,944 --> 01:14:45,444
Let's go to the kitchen.

1964
01:14:45,783 --> 01:14:47,313
- The kitchen over there? - Yes, to the kitchen.

1965
01:14:47,314 --> 01:14:48,382
Okay.

1966
01:14:48,383 --> 01:14:49,783
(They go to the outdoor kitchen since there isn't one in the room.)

1967
01:14:49,984 --> 01:14:51,323
Bring me the garlic.

1968
01:14:51,383 --> 01:14:52,654
Nice.

1969
01:14:52,783 --> 01:14:54,122
Let's eat delicious food.

1970
01:14:54,123 --> 01:14:55,253
(They get excited at the outdoor kitchen with a roof.)

1971
01:14:55,894 --> 01:14:58,024
(Impressed)

1972
01:14:58,623 --> 01:14:59,693
Awesome.

1973
01:14:59,694 --> 01:15:01,162
(The hot item that captivated the Renters, a huge gas grill)

1974
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:02,234
That's awesome.

1975
01:15:02,633 --> 01:15:04,703
(Any more firewood is a luxury.)

1976
01:15:05,304 --> 01:15:08,333
(They used to spend 30 minutes on chopping firewood.)

1977
01:15:09,133 --> 01:15:13,003
(It would take them 30 minutes to get the fire going.)

1978
01:15:13,373 --> 01:15:16,542
(They had to spend 1 hour on the fire pit in the past.)

1979
01:15:16,543 --> 01:15:18,042
(Our rented room has changed.)

1980
01:15:18,043 --> 01:15:19,212
This is it.

1981
01:15:19,213 --> 01:15:20,542
This is amazing.

1982
01:15:20,543 --> 01:15:22,453
(Thanks to the gas stove, their cooking time is greatly reduced.)

1983
01:15:22,753 --> 01:15:25,953
(Their struggles are over! Let the happiness begin?)

1984
01:15:26,453 --> 01:15:28,694
(They've been waiting for this moment!)

1985
01:15:28,793 --> 01:15:29,923
So...

1986
01:15:30,793 --> 01:15:32,793
I just need a knife.

1987
01:15:33,524 --> 01:15:36,462
- First, we need to chop everything. - Okay.

1988
01:15:36,463 --> 01:15:38,064
(They start with enthusiasm in the new kitchen.)

1989
01:15:38,963 --> 01:15:40,162
This is...

1990
01:15:40,163 --> 01:15:41,304
(But...)

1991
01:15:41,434 --> 01:15:42,473
What should I do...

1992
01:15:42,474 --> 01:15:44,333
with the onions?

1993
01:15:47,304 --> 01:15:50,173
(They face a hardship only 3 seconds into cooking.)

1994
01:15:50,314 --> 01:15:52,212
Dong Yeon. It'll all work out.

1995
01:15:52,213 --> 01:15:53,513
(He's totally nervous since he's cooking the main side dish.)

1996
01:15:53,514 --> 01:15:54,614
It'll all work out.

1997
01:15:55,413 --> 01:15:59,283
(Je Hoon started cooking for the first time during this trip.)

1998
01:15:59,554 --> 01:16:01,693
(He stirred the scrambled eggs.)

1999
01:16:01,694 --> 01:16:04,453
(He stirred the blueberry jam.)

2000
01:16:04,823 --> 01:16:08,264
(All he did was stir during both of his cooking experiences.)

2001
01:16:08,463 --> 01:16:11,434
(But for the stir-fried sausages and vegetables...)

2002
01:16:12,033 --> 01:16:13,864
(Prepping the vegetables)

2003
01:16:14,434 --> 01:16:17,073
(Cutting slits into the sausages)

2004
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:21,713
(Creating the sauce)

2005
01:16:22,274 --> 01:16:26,144
(And it's important to stir-fry so the sauce doesn't burn.)

2006
01:16:26,614 --> 01:16:31,213
(This is a huge challenge for rookie cook Je Hoon.)

2007
01:16:32,283 --> 01:16:34,723
(Will Je Hoon be able to make the stir-fried sausages and vegetables?)

2008
01:16:34,724 --> 01:16:35,893
This is...

2009
01:16:35,894 --> 01:16:37,953
(Will Je Hoon be able to make the stir-fried sausages and vegetables?)

2010
01:16:38,293 --> 01:16:39,693
(Anxious)

2011
01:16:39,694 --> 01:16:40,922
Oh, my gosh!

2012
01:16:40,923 --> 01:16:43,163
(It feels as though they had gained the gas stove but will lose dinner.)

2013
01:16:43,463 --> 01:16:44,663
Give me that.

2014
01:16:44,864 --> 01:16:47,304
I'll use this one.

2015
01:16:48,173 --> 01:16:50,573
(I have to wash the ingredients.)

2016
01:16:51,033 --> 01:16:52,372
(Now that they look around...)

2017
01:16:52,373 --> 01:16:53,604
So...

2018
01:16:54,944 --> 01:16:58,843
(In our new kitchen that has everything,)

2019
01:16:58,844 --> 01:17:00,813
(there's just one thing it doesn't have.)

2020
01:17:00,814 --> 01:17:01,853
But...

2021
01:17:01,854 --> 01:17:02,912
(There is no sink.)

2022
01:17:02,913 --> 01:17:04,114
What do we do?

2023
01:17:05,323 --> 01:17:10,153
(Do we have to go all the way to the water pump?)

2024
01:17:10,154 --> 01:17:11,393
(The kitchen, the water pump)

2025
01:17:11,394 --> 01:17:12,563
What do we do?

2026
01:17:12,564 --> 01:17:14,463
(It's quite the distance to keep going back and forth.)

2027
01:17:14,864 --> 01:17:16,763
(What do I do?)

2028
01:17:16,764 --> 01:17:19,404
Oh, then let's pull the hose closer.

2029
01:17:19,734 --> 01:17:22,474
Should we wash things by shooting the water this way?

2030
01:17:23,133 --> 01:17:24,633
- Shall we try that? - Let's try bringing it over.

2031
01:17:25,673 --> 01:17:28,713
(They set off to the water pump at Je Hoon's suggestion.)

2032
01:17:29,073 --> 01:17:31,144
Hey, will the hose be long enough to come here?

2033
01:17:31,444 --> 01:17:32,814
It's still pretty long.

2034
01:17:33,543 --> 01:17:34,583
Okay.

2035
01:17:34,644 --> 01:17:36,154
It's kind of long.

2036
01:17:36,854 --> 01:17:38,382
(The kitchen, the water pump)

2037
01:17:38,383 --> 01:17:40,153
Hey, it could go all the way.

2038
01:17:40,154 --> 01:17:42,194
(The hose keeps extending.)

2039
01:17:42,323 --> 01:17:43,524
Just a little bit more.

2040
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:45,163
Pull it!

2041
01:17:46,493 --> 01:17:48,063
(At the roar of the owner,)

2042
01:17:48,064 --> 01:17:49,493
(he grits his teeth.)

2043
01:17:49,993 --> 01:17:53,003
(The employee does his best today as well.)

2044
01:17:53,203 --> 01:17:54,532
You can do it!

2045
01:17:54,533 --> 01:17:56,833
(He's nearly at the finish line.)

2046
01:17:56,934 --> 01:17:58,173
You can do it!

2047
01:18:00,573 --> 01:18:04,173
(The younger ones are confused.)

2048
01:18:04,913 --> 01:18:06,782
Hang on. I'll try turning on the water.

2049
01:18:06,783 --> 01:18:08,083
(They arrive at the kitchen while making a ruckus.)

2050
01:18:08,354 --> 01:18:09,483
I turned it on.

2051
01:18:09,484 --> 01:18:11,383
- It's good. - Is it working?

2052
01:18:11,883 --> 01:18:14,253
(Thanks to Je Hoon, they reduced their travel distance.)

2053
01:18:14,654 --> 01:18:16,054
(Running over)

2054
01:18:17,054 --> 01:18:19,894
(I'm praising myself for my great idea.)

2055
01:18:20,323 --> 01:18:21,462
(Cheering)

2056
01:18:21,463 --> 01:18:23,163
(So full of himself)

2057
01:18:23,633 --> 01:18:25,462
(Je Hoon has always been willing to learn during their rented stay.)

2058
01:18:25,463 --> 01:18:27,063
I can wash them here.

2059
01:18:27,064 --> 01:18:31,032
(Thanks to his attitude, his household skill has improved.)

2060
01:18:31,033 --> 01:18:33,503
(Je Hoon's makeshift sink is ready.)

2061
01:18:34,474 --> 01:18:36,273
Peeling the outside?

2062
01:18:36,274 --> 01:18:37,944
(I hope he keeps it up and successfully cooks the sausages.)

2063
01:18:38,883 --> 01:18:40,212
(Stir-fried sausages and vegetables Step 1: Prep the onions.)

2064
01:18:40,213 --> 01:18:42,014
We have these onions, right?

2065
01:18:42,883 --> 01:18:45,523
(It's his first time using a knife in his life. Will he be okay?)

2066
01:18:45,524 --> 01:18:46,923
Let's get started.

2067
01:18:47,953 --> 01:18:49,293
- Oh, no way. - No.

2068
01:18:50,423 --> 01:18:51,493
Should I peel them like this?

2069
01:18:52,094 --> 01:18:54,194
Gosh, I'm so anxious about your thumb.

2070
01:18:54,963 --> 01:18:56,863
Gosh, Je Hoon. That's not right.

2071
01:18:56,864 --> 01:18:58,633
- Go like this. - Je Hoon, put it down.

2072
01:18:59,234 --> 01:19:00,404
That's not right.

2073
01:19:00,703 --> 01:19:02,533
- Go like this. - Je Hoon, put it down.

2074
01:19:02,873 --> 01:19:04,104
How should I do it?

2075
01:19:04,404 --> 01:19:06,474
(He starts malfunctioning as soon as he starts cooking.)

2076
01:19:07,573 --> 01:19:08,613
(All right, relax a little.)

2077
01:19:08,614 --> 01:19:10,014
- I mean... - All right.

2078
01:19:10,213 --> 01:19:12,683
If you show me a demonstration, I'll do it.

2079
01:19:12,684 --> 01:19:13,844
Put this down like this.

2080
01:19:14,184 --> 01:19:16,984
When using a knife, you should always fold your fingertips in.

2081
01:19:17,583 --> 01:19:18,882
Because if you do this,

2082
01:19:18,883 --> 01:19:20,153
- you'll cut yourself. - Right.

2083
01:19:20,154 --> 01:19:24,123
Make the side of the blade touch your knuckle.

2084
01:19:24,963 --> 01:19:26,292
(The late learner listens carefully.)

2085
01:19:26,293 --> 01:19:27,863
First, take the tip here.

2086
01:19:27,864 --> 01:19:29,493
- The tip... - Take that...

2087
01:19:29,864 --> 01:19:31,094
and cut it off.

2088
01:19:31,264 --> 01:19:32,804
- I cut it. - And flip it over.

2089
01:19:33,533 --> 01:19:34,603
(The student has a great attitude.)

2090
01:19:34,604 --> 01:19:37,073
- I cut it. Yes. - Then you see this part, right?

2091
01:19:38,033 --> 01:19:40,742
- Oh, it peels right off. - Yes, like that.

2092
01:19:40,743 --> 01:19:42,043
(He has excellent reactions too.)

2093
01:19:43,213 --> 01:19:45,684
- Then... - Can we use the water now?

2094
01:19:46,213 --> 01:19:49,014
I peeled it like this. Then do I...

2095
01:19:49,314 --> 01:19:50,553
wash this?

2096
01:19:50,554 --> 01:19:51,653
You can rinse it once.

2097
01:19:51,654 --> 01:19:54,554
But the veggies here are clean, so you don't have to rinse it.

2098
01:19:54,684 --> 01:19:56,623
Excuse me, chef.

2099
01:19:57,323 --> 01:19:59,163
Should I peel all five of them?

2100
01:19:59,463 --> 01:20:00,663
- Yes. - Yes.

2101
01:20:01,224 --> 01:20:04,463
But the stem of the onions...

2102
01:20:04,694 --> 01:20:05,864
Isn't this a green onion?

2103
01:20:06,463 --> 01:20:07,463
(Green onion)

2104
01:20:07,464 --> 01:20:08,804
Is that right?

2105
01:20:09,033 --> 01:20:11,072
- Can't we use this? - I... I don't...

2106
01:20:11,073 --> 01:20:12,604
I don't know.

2107
01:20:12,873 --> 01:20:13,873
- Chef. - Yes?

2108
01:20:13,874 --> 01:20:15,143
Should I wash them or not?

2109
01:20:15,144 --> 01:20:16,412
Please wash them.

2110
01:20:16,413 --> 01:20:17,743
Shall I? Yes, sir.

2111
01:20:17,844 --> 01:20:19,282
My gosh...

2112
01:20:19,283 --> 01:20:21,853
I can't believe I peeled an onion for the first time.

2113
01:20:21,854 --> 01:20:23,713
(The slowpoke cook is growing today as well, slowly but surely.)

2114
01:20:24,453 --> 01:20:27,752
(This time, he takes out the sausages, the main ingredient.)

2115
01:20:27,753 --> 01:20:30,922
(How high does it go?)

2116
01:20:30,923 --> 01:20:32,094
Why is this so long?

2117
01:20:33,493 --> 01:20:35,564
- Eun Woo, do I use all of these? - No.

2118
01:20:35,764 --> 01:20:37,393
- I think just half should be good. - Okay.

2119
01:20:37,394 --> 01:20:39,604
(After a confirmation on the number of sausages from Eun Woo,)

2120
01:20:40,804 --> 01:20:44,673
(he starts cutting slits into the sausages.)

2121
01:20:48,144 --> 01:20:49,672
- Oh, Je Hoon! - What?

2122
01:20:49,673 --> 01:20:51,014
You have to be careful.

2123
01:20:51,243 --> 01:20:54,483
Je Hoon, with this, you make the slits...

2124
01:20:54,484 --> 01:20:55,613
(Eun Woo volunteers to teach him how to cut slits.)

2125
01:20:55,614 --> 01:20:58,582
- Like this. One, diagonally. - Okay.

2126
01:20:58,583 --> 01:20:59,654
Two.

2127
01:21:00,524 --> 01:21:01,583
One.

2128
01:21:01,993 --> 01:21:03,252
Two.

2129
01:21:03,253 --> 01:21:06,123
(The student gets ahead of himself.)

2130
01:21:06,493 --> 01:21:08,863
- Je Hoon. - The opposite way. One.

2131
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:09,933
(So anxious)

2132
01:21:09,934 --> 01:21:11,133
Isn't that right?

2133
01:21:11,533 --> 01:21:12,764
Two.

2134
01:21:13,033 --> 01:21:14,532
- Je Hoon, watch your hands. - Three.

2135
01:21:14,533 --> 01:21:15,734
(Also anxious)

2136
01:21:15,873 --> 01:21:17,332
- I made four each. Is that right? - Je Hoon.

2137
01:21:17,333 --> 01:21:18,643
Like this and this.

2138
01:21:18,644 --> 01:21:20,344
- Good, Je Hoon. - Is that good?

2139
01:21:21,203 --> 01:21:25,412
(He may be clumsy, but he's very serious.)

2140
01:21:25,413 --> 01:21:26,843
You made it so cute.

2141
01:21:26,844 --> 01:21:28,413
(He may be clumsy, but he's very serious.)

2142
01:21:28,684 --> 01:21:31,014
I put five slits in this one.

2143
01:21:31,883 --> 01:21:33,153
(The cooking newbie brags about every little thing.)

2144
01:21:33,154 --> 01:21:34,882
Je Hoon is truly...

2145
01:21:34,883 --> 01:21:37,252
a fool who only knows...

2146
01:21:37,253 --> 01:21:39,223
- how to act. FKA. - FKA.

2147
01:21:39,224 --> 01:21:41,293
(How will the stir-fried sausages and vegetables turn out?)

2148
01:21:41,394 --> 01:21:43,364
- What time is it now? - It's 9pm.

2149
01:21:43,493 --> 01:21:44,594
It's 9pm?

2150
01:21:44,963 --> 01:21:47,233
- Let's finish in an hour. - Okay.

2151
01:21:47,234 --> 01:21:48,873
(They get dinner ready in the midnight sun.)

2152
01:21:49,533 --> 01:21:52,844
(Shall I get started now?)

2153
01:21:54,503 --> 01:21:57,613
(He sets off on making the green onion kimchi first.)

2154
01:21:57,614 --> 01:21:59,683
This is amazing every time I see it.

2155
01:21:59,684 --> 01:22:04,583
(With an unfamiliar ingredient called a leek,)

2156
01:22:05,253 --> 01:22:08,322
(will he be able to make green onion kimchi...)

2157
01:22:08,323 --> 01:22:12,293
(that has the spicy taste of Korean flavors?)

2158
01:22:12,894 --> 01:22:15,662
(Leek: a Western green onion, has more bitterness than Korean ones)

2159
01:22:15,663 --> 01:22:17,163
Gosh, this is...

2160
01:22:20,564 --> 01:22:22,273
(He'll try making kimchi with a Finnish green onion!)

2161
01:22:22,274 --> 01:22:25,474
- They must've washed and cut them. - But this is...

2162
01:22:26,344 --> 01:22:31,644
(He starts prepping them without hesitation.)

2163
01:22:31,673 --> 01:22:35,484
Then, you have to cut them into long pieces to make kimchi?

2164
01:22:35,583 --> 01:22:37,083
- Yes. - Okay.

2165
01:22:38,453 --> 01:22:41,554
(He adds 5 spoonfuls of anchovy extract that he brought from Korea.)

2166
01:22:42,054 --> 01:22:43,492
Oh, what's that?

2167
01:22:43,493 --> 01:22:45,593
(By using anchovy extract instead of salt,)

2168
01:22:45,594 --> 01:22:47,663
(he adds saltiness and savoriness at the same time!)

2169
01:22:48,394 --> 01:22:50,962
(His eyes are fixed.)

2170
01:22:50,963 --> 01:22:53,533
(Chef Kwak is the best indeed.)

2171
01:22:54,203 --> 01:22:56,703
(He starts making the sauce with 1.5 spoonfuls of sugar.)

2172
01:22:57,133 --> 01:23:03,713
(The sugar will cancel out the bitterness of the leeks.)

2173
01:23:04,373 --> 01:23:09,984
(He adds some spiciness with chili powder.)

2174
01:23:10,883 --> 01:23:16,154
(He increases the savoriness with sesame oil.)

2175
01:23:17,224 --> 01:23:20,764
(And some onions to add to the texture)

2176
01:23:21,123 --> 01:23:22,363
(Chef Kwak's cooking tip)

2177
01:23:22,364 --> 01:23:23,563
(Onions have moisture, so they help the sauce mix evenly.)

2178
01:23:23,564 --> 01:23:24,963
I'll take these out.

2179
01:23:25,064 --> 01:23:26,133
Your hands...

2180
01:23:26,234 --> 01:23:28,532
Our Chef Kwak's recipe...

2181
01:23:28,533 --> 01:23:31,873
(Our trustworthy man who can cook even without a recipe)

2182
01:23:32,474 --> 01:23:34,143
I need the garlic now.

2183
01:23:34,144 --> 01:23:35,243
I'll get them done soon.

2184
01:23:38,144 --> 01:23:39,483
I peeled them with my hands.

2185
01:23:39,484 --> 01:23:40,844
My hands will smell like garlic. What do I do?

2186
01:23:41,114 --> 01:23:42,184
What will you do?

2187
01:23:45,654 --> 01:23:47,023
Oh, my eyes are...

2188
01:23:47,024 --> 01:23:48,183
- Are they stinging? - Yes, it's hitting me.

2189
01:23:48,184 --> 01:23:50,154
- If you need it, it's next to you. - Okay.

2190
01:23:50,354 --> 01:23:51,492
Oh, it hit me.

2191
01:23:51,493 --> 01:23:53,622
(The spiciness really hit him hard.)

2192
01:23:53,623 --> 01:23:55,734
- Dong Hwi, do you want a tip? - Yes.

2193
01:23:55,934 --> 01:23:57,363
- When your eyes sting, - Yes?

2194
01:23:57,364 --> 01:24:00,064
hold some water in your mouth. That keeps your eyes from stinging.

2195
01:24:00,734 --> 01:24:02,532
Dong Yeon, how do you know...

2196
01:24:02,533 --> 01:24:03,974
- You made that up, right? - No, it's for real.

2197
01:24:05,404 --> 01:24:06,603
- Water... - I learned it from Mr. Paik.

2198
01:24:06,604 --> 01:24:08,473
- Oh, then I believe you. - Yes, of course.

2199
01:24:08,474 --> 01:24:09,543
(That's a credible source.)

2200
01:24:09,673 --> 01:24:11,443
I don't know how it works, but they really don't sting.

2201
01:24:11,444 --> 01:24:12,513
(Meanwhile, Eun Woo, who was washing the rice...)

2202
01:24:12,514 --> 01:24:14,944
(listens carefully.)

2203
01:24:15,854 --> 01:24:18,453
(His mischievous radar gets revved up.)

2204
01:24:18,524 --> 01:24:21,382
There's another tip. If you wink with your left eye,

2205
01:24:21,383 --> 01:24:22,623
it stings less.

2206
01:24:23,854 --> 01:24:24,893
(Like this?)

2207
01:24:24,894 --> 01:24:26,992
- There he goes again. - Winking with my left eye?

2208
01:24:26,993 --> 01:24:28,064
(Such a nice guy...)

2209
01:24:28,194 --> 01:24:29,733
Yes, like that.

2210
01:24:29,734 --> 01:24:32,163
(He cracks jokes during a short break.)

2211
01:24:32,564 --> 01:24:35,104
(Again, it's time to make the green onion kimchi.)

2212
01:24:35,673 --> 01:24:39,844
(He adds Dong Hwi's minced garlic to make the flavor deeper.)

2213
01:24:40,304 --> 01:24:41,443
Green onion kimchi.

2214
01:24:41,444 --> 01:24:43,212
(He mixes it up so the sauces get absorbed evenly.)

2215
01:24:43,213 --> 01:24:44,514
Gosh, this looks so good.

2216
01:24:45,213 --> 01:24:47,542
(That's my friend, indeed.)

2217
01:24:47,543 --> 01:24:48,752
You're so cool.

2218
01:24:48,753 --> 01:24:50,983
You're a true chef.

2219
01:24:50,984 --> 01:24:52,783
(The 28-year-old young man even makes kimchi well in Lapland.)

2220
01:24:53,554 --> 01:24:55,353
Gosh, will this work?

2221
01:24:55,354 --> 01:24:57,194
(Will it taste okay?)

2222
01:24:57,594 --> 01:24:58,992
- Nice. - Yes.

2223
01:24:58,993 --> 01:25:01,123
(Interim check)

2224
01:25:02,033 --> 01:25:03,263
(Will it taste like Korean green onion kimchi?)

2225
01:25:03,264 --> 01:25:04,992
- I'll add them now. - Yes, put them in.

2226
01:25:04,993 --> 01:25:06,333
(Will it taste like Korean green onion kimchi?)

2227
01:25:07,463 --> 01:25:09,803
(It's lacking something.)

2228
01:25:09,804 --> 01:25:11,774
- Is this enough? - No.

2229
01:25:12,644 --> 01:25:15,573
(He picks up the chili powder and adds some spiciness.)

2230
01:25:16,814 --> 01:25:21,484
(He adds vinegar to give it a tangy boost.)

2231
01:25:22,783 --> 01:25:26,783
(After mixing it up once more,)

2232
01:25:26,823 --> 01:25:29,194
(he tastes it for the 2nd time.)

2233
01:25:29,493 --> 01:25:30,493
(Exclaiming)

2234
01:25:32,293 --> 01:25:33,524
That's so good. My gosh.

2235
01:25:34,594 --> 01:25:37,594
(Chef Kwak has done it again.)

2236
01:25:37,993 --> 01:25:40,263
(He finishes making the green onion kimchi.)

2237
01:25:40,264 --> 01:25:42,234
Gosh, the green onion kimchi is totally my style.

2238
01:25:43,673 --> 01:25:47,143
Then, I'll make the sauce for the stir-fried sausages and vegetables.

2239
01:25:47,144 --> 01:25:48,243
Okay.

2240
01:25:49,213 --> 01:25:50,343
(He takes the recipe, a necessary item for Je Hoon.)

2241
01:25:50,344 --> 01:25:52,484
- Then... - Should I wash these?

2242
01:25:52,644 --> 01:25:54,742
No, just something we haven't used...

2243
01:25:54,743 --> 01:25:57,683
Sugar, ketchup, a tablespoon of gochujang.

2244
01:25:57,684 --> 01:25:59,123
(Reading it solemnly)

2245
01:25:59,453 --> 01:26:00,483
Je Hoon.

2246
01:26:00,484 --> 01:26:03,753
(You can do it, Je Hoon.)

2247
01:26:04,823 --> 01:26:07,923
(Half anxious, half rooting for him)

2248
01:26:09,564 --> 01:26:11,864
(I'll try to do a good job, guys!)

2249
01:26:12,264 --> 01:26:15,404
(He studies the recipe once more.)

2250
01:26:16,804 --> 01:26:20,043
(Serious)

2251
01:26:20,203 --> 01:26:21,242
One.

2252
01:26:21,243 --> 01:26:24,974
(A tablespoon of ketchup)

2253
01:26:25,043 --> 01:26:26,043
Two.

2254
01:26:26,044 --> 01:26:27,443
(2 tablespoons of ketchup, and checking the recipe again)

2255
01:26:27,444 --> 01:26:28,444
And...

2256
01:26:29,654 --> 01:26:31,382
What? Is that right?

2257
01:26:31,383 --> 01:26:32,383
(Already distrustful)

2258
01:26:33,024 --> 01:26:34,382
Je Hoon, is that right?

2259
01:26:34,383 --> 01:26:36,923
- I'm going by the recipe. - I honestly didn't see it.

2260
01:26:37,024 --> 01:26:38,423
- Je Hoon. - Two tablespoons...

2261
01:26:38,594 --> 01:26:39,993
Two tablespoons of ketchup, right?

2262
01:26:42,163 --> 01:26:43,763
And gochujang...

2263
01:26:43,764 --> 01:26:45,934
(The monitoring squad is here.)

2264
01:26:47,003 --> 01:26:48,133
I'll try making it.

2265
01:26:48,364 --> 01:26:49,903
The moment you add your touch to it...

2266
01:26:49,904 --> 01:26:51,434
(He adds 1 tablespoon of gochujang under the others' surveillance.)

2267
01:26:52,073 --> 01:26:53,344
(Sugar)

2268
01:26:54,173 --> 01:26:58,644
(He's only adding sugar...)

2269
01:26:59,614 --> 01:27:01,713
(but their anxiety keeps building.)

2270
01:27:02,184 --> 01:27:05,453
(Does he know how the others feel or not?)

2271
01:27:06,184 --> 01:27:08,793
(He calmly keeps doing things in his own way.)

2272
01:27:09,953 --> 01:27:12,364
Yes, that's good.

2273
01:27:13,623 --> 01:27:14,893
(He mixes it up well.)

2274
01:27:14,894 --> 01:27:16,893
(He checks the recipe while mixing it too.)

2275
01:27:16,894 --> 01:27:19,163
(He mixes it up well.)

2276
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:22,234
(Coming in for a close-up monitoring for a while)

2277
01:27:22,703 --> 01:27:24,702
(Two people monitoring him)

2278
01:27:24,703 --> 01:27:28,144
(The security is tight.)

2279
01:27:28,373 --> 01:27:30,473
Please look forward to it. My goodness.

2280
01:27:30,474 --> 01:27:31,474
(Stop worrying, guys.)

2281
01:27:31,543 --> 01:27:32,783
I'll surprise you.

2282
01:27:33,144 --> 01:27:34,983
- Is that chogochujang? - Yes.

2283
01:27:34,984 --> 01:27:36,684
(Doubting him endlessly)

2284
01:27:38,554 --> 01:27:40,882
All right. I made the sauce.

2285
01:27:40,883 --> 01:27:42,354
(He finishes the sauce amid much concern.)

2286
01:27:42,694 --> 01:27:45,863
Then, I'll make the stir-fried sausages and vegetables now.

2287
01:27:45,864 --> 01:27:47,264
(Now, it's time for all of the ingredients to go on the fire.)

2288
01:27:47,364 --> 01:27:49,263
I really hope it tastes good.

2289
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:50,434
- Gosh, of course. - Yes.

2290
01:27:50,663 --> 01:27:52,603
Goodness, please trust me.

2291
01:27:52,604 --> 01:27:53,904
(As they look on with worry in their eyes...)

2292
01:27:54,163 --> 01:27:57,603
All right. I'll go with my own version now.

2293
01:27:57,604 --> 01:27:58,604
(He's brave by himself.)

2294
01:27:58,974 --> 01:28:00,003
My gosh.

2295
01:28:00,404 --> 01:28:04,673
(He takes something out.)

2296
01:28:06,444 --> 01:28:08,382
(Butter?)

2297
01:28:08,383 --> 01:28:09,984
- What? - Je Hoon.

2298
01:28:10,413 --> 01:28:11,483
Je Hoon, butter?

2299
01:28:11,484 --> 01:28:13,223
(Was there butter in the recipe...)

2300
01:28:13,224 --> 01:28:14,953
(for stir-fried sausages and vegetables?)

2301
01:28:15,594 --> 01:28:18,193
Wait. In this version of stir-fried sausages and vegetables, honestly...

2302
01:28:18,194 --> 01:28:19,194
(To overturn the younger guys' scorn...)

2303
01:28:19,195 --> 01:28:20,822
I have my own version.

2304
01:28:20,823 --> 01:28:23,233
- Sure, do whatever you want. - Okay.

2305
01:28:23,234 --> 01:28:24,493
(I need my own kick!)

2306
01:28:25,463 --> 01:28:28,603
(He heard somewhere that butter adds a savory flavor.)

2307
01:28:28,604 --> 01:28:30,672
I'm sure he has his reasons for doing this.

2308
01:28:30,673 --> 01:28:32,444
(He heard somewhere that butter adds a savory flavor.)

2309
01:28:33,604 --> 01:28:37,372
(He makes a bold attempt to flip the tables.)

2310
01:28:37,373 --> 01:28:39,814
(Focusing harder than ever)

2311
01:28:40,783 --> 01:28:45,953
(He slowly slices a slab of butter.)

2312
01:28:45,984 --> 01:28:48,123
(It's quite a big chunk.)

2313
01:28:49,623 --> 01:28:50,653
Yes, it's good.

2314
01:28:50,654 --> 01:28:53,264
(He's putting the whole thing in?)

2315
01:28:58,293 --> 01:29:02,133
(It starts melting away at a scary speed.)

2316
01:29:02,873 --> 01:29:06,003
(The curse of the butter starts again.)

2317
01:29:06,974 --> 01:29:09,343
(His seriousness is scarier than the butter.)

2318
01:29:09,344 --> 01:29:10,672
But Je Hoon is...

2319
01:29:10,673 --> 01:29:13,242
Je Hoon, wait. This is way too much butter.

2320
01:29:13,243 --> 01:29:15,613
Gosh, don't worry.

2321
01:29:15,614 --> 01:29:16,883
Gosh, the smell of butter...

2322
01:29:18,154 --> 01:29:19,323
My goodness.

2323
01:29:19,783 --> 01:29:21,822
(Was this inevitable?)

2324
01:29:21,823 --> 01:29:22,823
Je Hoon.

2325
01:29:23,423 --> 01:29:26,263
I'll give you a big surprise.

2326
01:29:26,264 --> 01:29:27,264
(We barely forgot about the butter scrambled eggs.)

2327
01:29:27,394 --> 01:29:30,263
This whole place reeks of butter.

2328
01:29:30,264 --> 01:29:33,263
(What will become of the butter stew?)

2329
01:29:33,264 --> 01:29:34,264
Je Hoon...

2330
01:29:36,633 --> 01:29:40,844
(On the edge of the village where not very many people are,)

2331
01:29:41,604 --> 01:29:46,144
(Dong Yeon rides down a road that no one knows.)

2332
01:29:47,684 --> 01:29:51,184
(Where is he headed?)

2333
01:29:51,213 --> 01:29:53,452
(At the end of that road, he finds...)

2334
01:29:53,453 --> 01:29:56,753
(a suspicious place.)

2335
01:29:58,253 --> 01:30:00,323
(A closed school?)

2336
01:30:01,493 --> 01:30:03,663
(This village feels somewhat suspicious.)

2337
01:30:04,934 --> 01:30:08,604
(Anxiety sweeps over them.)

2338
01:30:09,573 --> 01:30:11,532
(However, we're not just scarecrows...)

2339
01:30:11,533 --> 01:30:15,043
(but skilled men!)

2340
01:30:15,073 --> 01:30:18,242
(They've landed in a rural village.)

2341
01:30:18,243 --> 01:30:20,282
(We're the Rented Room Chore Busters!)

2342
01:30:20,283 --> 01:30:22,184
(Harvesting rye?)

2343
01:30:22,684 --> 01:30:25,984
(That's nothing.)

2344
01:30:26,083 --> 01:30:28,524
(Lending a helping hand is nothing.)

2345
01:30:28,894 --> 01:30:30,693
(A village party?)

2346
01:30:30,694 --> 01:30:34,323
(They can cook easily now too.)

2347
01:30:34,463 --> 01:30:36,434
(We've grown!)

2348
01:30:36,833 --> 01:30:39,304
(But the first meeting is always nerve-racking.)

2349
01:30:39,663 --> 01:30:43,173
(Their heart-pounding first meeting with the neighbors, coming soon)

2350
01:30:48,503 --> 01:30:50,242
(Lee Je Hoon)

2351
01:30:50,243 --> 01:30:51,943
(Lee Dong Hwi)

2352
01:30:51,944 --> 01:30:53,813
(Kwak Dong Yeon)

2353
01:30:53,814 --> 01:30:55,484
(Cha Eun Woo)

2354
01:30:55,614 --> 01:30:58,413
(Rented In Finland)
