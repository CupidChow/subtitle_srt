00:00:22,507 --> 00:00:26,987
(crowded with cute animals...)

9
00:00:27,787 --> 00:00:31,187
(and neighbors to say "good morning" to)

10
00:00:32,156 --> 00:00:34,887

(There is 1 hour left.)

16
00:00:44,596 --> 00:00:48,537
(They have to cook enough food for 10 people.)

17
00:00:49,406 --> 00:00:51,875
(Even Chef Kwak is nervous at the thought of...)

18
00:00:51,876 --> 00:00:54,076

(He bought the wrong type of meat.)

24
00:01:13,196 --> 00:01:15,767
Nothing's wrong.

25
00:01:16,097 --> 00:01:21,237
(How will the bulgogi taste after the many twists and turns?)

26
00:01:21,806 --> 00:01:24,377

27

(Will they be able to blend in with the people?)

30
00:01:34,347 --> 00:01:36,017
I'm ready.

31
00:01:36,147 --> 00:01:38,885
The kitchen was a war zone, but we're almost ready.

32
00:01:38,886 --> 00:01:40,763
(It's 6:55pm, 5 minutes before the village party.)

33

(They have to get everything ready within 5 minutes.)

34
00:01:46,657 --> 00:01:49,165
Okay. I think we can leave it here.

35
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:50,436
- Okay. - Yes.

36
00:01:51,936 --> 00:01:53,867

Yes, we're ready.

38
00:01:55,606 --> 00:01:56,606
Okay.

49
00:02:20,227 --> 00:02:21,896
This is insane, Dong Yeon.

- Hey. - Hello.

54
00:02:28,167 --> 00:02:29,335
(The landlord also brings a whole bunch of food.)

55
00:02:29,336 --> 00:02:30,776
- My gosh. - Hello.

56
00:02:31,836 --> 00:02:33,237
What is it?

57
00:02:33,406 --> 00:02:35,207
- Cake? - Cake.

58
00:02:36,547 --> 00:02:40,346
(What kind of food did the landlord's family bring?)

59
00:02:40,716 --> 00:02:42,146
Thank you so much.

60
00:02:42,147 --> 00:02:43,886
What's this? What kind of pie is it?

61
00:02:43,887 --> 00:02:45,055
That is ham pie.

62
00:02:45,056 --> 00:02:46,517
- Ham pie? - That sounds tasty.

63
00:02:47,256 --> 00:02:48,555
It looks like a pizza.

- I see. - Reindeer soup?

67
00:02:57,197 --> 00:02:58,737
- Reindeer. - Reindeer.

68
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,566
It's reindeer meat.

69
00:03:01,536 --> 00:03:02,706
Is this lemon?

70
00:03:02,707 --> 00:03:04,536
Yes, it's a lemon cake.

71
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:06,136
Unbelievable.

Please sit.

78
00:03:17,957 --> 00:03:19,185
- Thank you. - Have a seat.

79

(The new husband pulls out a chair.)

80
00:03:20,526 --> 00:03:21,887
You're a sweet guy.

81
00:03:22,987 --> 00:03:24,125
Of course.

(Introducing the Choi Soo Jong of Lapland)

83
00:03:25,256 --> 00:03:26,656
Luckily mine.

84
00:03:29,727 --> 00:03:31,535
(This guy seems used to situations like this.)

85
00:03:31,536 --> 00:03:32,897
He's so sweet.

86
00:03:33,707 --> 00:03:36,836

I see someone coming.

97
00:04:02,227 --> 00:04:04,797
- Where should I put this? - What?

98
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:06,237
The food.

99
00:04:06,867 --> 00:04:08,367
We'll lay it out.

100
00:04:08,806 --> 00:04:10,335
On the table like we always do?

101
00:04:10,336 --> 00:04:11,336
Of course.

102
00:04:13,077 --> 00:04:17,917
(A couple of neighbors walk up talking among themselves.)

103
00:04:18,316 --> 00:04:20,686
It's our neighbors.

104
00:04:21,186 --> 00:04:23,617
They are each holding a bunch of stuff.

105

Nice to meet you.

108
00:04:31,027 --> 00:04:32,427
Can I take that?

109
00:04:32,797 --> 00:04:34,266
Thank you.

110
00:04:34,597 --> 00:04:35,995

111
00:04:35,996 --> 00:04:37,065
Welcome.

Let's sit down.

116
00:04:51,646 --> 00:04:53,047
- Yes. - Sit down.

117
00:04:54,186 --> 00:04:56,847
This is awkward.

118
00:04:58,186 --> 00:04:59,717
I'm nervous.

119
00:05:02,987 --> 00:05:06,696
(Silence...)

120
00:05:07,727 --> 00:05:11,467
(This elder finds the new neighbors interesting.)

121

(The city boys are very nervous.)

122
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:19,006
(They laugh when they feel awkward.)

123
00:05:19,206 --> 00:05:21,606
I've never shared a meal...

124
00:05:21,607 --> 00:05:23,607
- with my neighbors. - Me neither.

125
00:05:24,717 --> 00:05:26,515
This is so interesting.

126
00:05:26,516 --> 00:05:28,145
(They are all nervous about sharing a meal with neighbors.)

127
00:05:28,146 --> 00:05:29,186
This is awesome.

128
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,416
I never did this even in Korea.

129
00:05:31,417 --> 00:05:33,385
It's kind of like gathering with the people...

130
00:05:33,386 --> 00:05:34,825
- that live upstairs and downstairs. - Right.

131
00:05:34,826 --> 00:05:38,125
It's the first time for all of us to have this kind of dinner.

132
00:05:38,126 --> 00:05:39,325
- Really? - Okay.

133
00:05:39,326 --> 00:05:41,467
I'm kind of nervous.

134
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,667
(You guys are cute.)

135
00:05:46,237 --> 00:05:47,266
My gosh.

136

143
00:06:13,097 --> 00:06:14,695
- Jam? - Jam.

144
00:06:14,696 --> 00:06:19,266
(at the peaceful village party.)

145
00:06:20,396 --> 00:06:21,636
- My gosh. - My gosh.

146
00:06:22,066 --> 00:06:23,837
(He automatically covers his mouth.)

147
00:06:29,006 --> 00:06:30,375
It has bangs.

148
00:06:30,376 --> 00:06:32,516
(A stylish neighbor shows up.)

149
00:06:33,417 --> 00:06:38,016
(This is an unexpected event.)

150
00:06:38,087 --> 00:06:39,315
(He doesn't believe his eyes.)

151
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,357
Wait.

152
00:06:40,686 --> 00:06:41,756
Wait.

153
00:06:44,456 --> 00:06:47,056
Are they ponies? What are they?

154
00:06:48,467 --> 00:06:50,736
- Are they horses? - They're ponies.

155
00:06:50,737 --> 00:06:52,837
(Ponies show up at the village party.)

156
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:56,206
(The Renters are shocked.)

157
00:06:56,407 --> 00:06:59,576
(But the others are used to it.)

158
00:06:59,936 --> 00:07:03,107
(They calmly do their things.)

159
00:07:04,576 --> 00:07:08,446
(They watch with delight.)

160
00:07:08,717 --> 00:07:10,616
Okay.

161
00:07:10,617 --> 00:07:12,357
(They are used to the sight.)

162
00:07:13,056 --> 00:07:17,896
(The owner's soulmates go wherever she does.)

163
00:07:18,456 --> 00:07:21,496
(They are speechless...)

164
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:24,867
(at the unexpected neighbors.)

165
00:07:26,066 --> 00:07:27,337
- Hi. - Hi.

166
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:30,337
- Hi. - Hi.

167

Hi.

168
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,906
(They are too busy eating to greet the others.)

169
00:07:33,907 --> 00:07:35,206
- Hi. - Hey.

170
00:07:35,306 --> 00:07:36,575
(Walking and eating)

171
00:07:36,576 --> 00:07:39,316
(Stop eating.)

172
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,487
(He can't get over his surprise.)

173
00:07:42,746 --> 00:07:44,586
Gosh, look at the bangs.

174
00:07:44,587 --> 00:07:47,087
- They have very cute haircuts. - Yes, they do.

175
00:07:47,287 --> 00:07:48,287
So cute.

176

(They dressed up for the party.)

177
00:07:49,956 --> 00:07:52,156
- This is Nipsuk. - Nipsuk?

178
00:07:52,157 --> 00:07:53,455
And this is Ville.

179
00:07:53,456 --> 00:07:54,825
- Ville. - Yes.

180

Nipsuk.

183
00:08:01,066 --> 00:08:02,606
(They are eating endlessly.)

184
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:03,635
They started eating right away.

185
00:08:03,636 --> 00:08:06,276
Nipsuk must be hungry.

186
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,347
Yes.

187
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:09,047
They're always hungry.

188
00:08:11,117 --> 00:08:13,917
They'll eat up Juri's whole yard.

189
00:08:15,117 --> 00:08:16,987
(They've already eaten up a big part of it.)

190
00:08:17,357 --> 00:08:18,955
You can have a seat.

191
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:21,255
- Okay. - You can sit there.

192
00:08:21,256 --> 00:08:22,256
Okay.

193
00:08:22,257 --> 00:08:23,857
What is she going to do with the ponies?

194
00:08:25,256 --> 00:08:26,426
Maybe she'll tie them to a chair.

195
00:08:26,427 --> 00:08:28,826
(Will she tie them to a chair?)

196
00:08:29,326 --> 00:08:32,937
It's okay. They won't go far.

197
00:08:33,766 --> 00:08:35,866
(She drops the reigns without hesitation.)

198
00:08:35,867 --> 00:08:37,436
She just lets them run free.

199
00:08:37,437 --> 00:08:39,707
(They plan to eat freely.)

200
00:08:40,006 --> 00:08:42,307
(The party is quite casual.)

201
00:08:42,506 --> 00:08:44,545
Why don't you introduce the Korean dishes?

202
00:08:44,546 --> 00:08:47,545
Let me introduce the Korean food.

203
00:08:47,546 --> 00:08:48,846
- Yes. - Of course.

204
00:08:48,847 --> 00:08:50,987
(The neighbors look interested in Korean food.)

205
00:08:51,217 --> 00:08:53,286
- This is zucchini. - Slices of zucchini.

206
00:08:53,457 --> 00:08:56,056
- It's made with zucchini. - Yes, zucchini food.

207
00:08:56,057 --> 00:08:58,026
(The first zucchini jeon Je Hoon ever made.)

208
00:08:58,926 --> 00:09:01,626
(Everyone marvels at it.)

209
00:09:01,766 --> 00:09:02,866
It looks good.

210
00:09:02,867 --> 00:09:06,035
He flipped it nicely. I saw that.

211
00:09:06,036 --> 00:09:07,756
(They are satisfied with the presentation.)

212
00:09:07,807 --> 00:09:09,536
This is a combination...

213
00:09:10,337 --> 00:09:11,706
(Slightly nervous)

214
00:09:11,707 --> 00:09:12,776
with this one.

215
00:09:13,077 --> 00:09:14,905
(Finnish bread...)

216
00:09:14,906 --> 00:09:16,847
Try these two together.

217
00:09:17,276 --> 00:09:19,145
It's called chili pepper japchae.

218
00:09:19,146 --> 00:09:20,246
Okay.

219
00:09:20,687 --> 00:09:22,716
It looks very delicious.

220
00:09:22,717 --> 00:09:24,193
(They are also satisfied with the presentation of the second dish.)

221
00:09:24,217 --> 00:09:25,717
Try some.

222
00:09:26,487 --> 00:09:29,186
I made this.

223
00:09:29,187 --> 00:09:31,856
It's a traditional Korean food...

224
00:09:31,857 --> 00:09:33,597
- called bulgogi. - Bulgogi.

225
00:09:34,327 --> 00:09:37,737
I prepared one more thing. This is for you, Anne.

226
00:09:37,937 --> 00:09:40,035
- Thank you. - No onions, no garlic,

227
00:09:40,036 --> 00:09:41,566
and no mushrooms.

228
00:09:41,567 --> 00:09:42,736
- Yes. - Yes.

229
00:09:42,737 --> 00:09:44,183
(Dong Yeon cooked Anne's bulgogi separately due to her allergies.)

230
00:09:44,207 --> 00:09:46,376
I am so glad. Thank you.

231
00:09:48,807 --> 00:09:50,146
That was a good call.

232
00:09:51,577 --> 00:09:54,646
Okay. I think we can now start eating.

233
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:56,915
- Okay. - Yes.

234
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:57,916
- Yes. - Yes.

235
00:09:57,917 --> 00:09:59,057
(Jorma's fish fillet)

236
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:00,586
(Hanna's mashed potatoes)

237
00:10:00,587 --> 00:10:02,486
This is panna cotta.

238
00:10:02,487 --> 00:10:03,727
Panna cotta?

239
00:10:03,827 --> 00:10:05,356
With cloudberries on top.

240
00:10:05,357 --> 00:10:06,726
- Cloudberries? - Yes, cloudberries.

241
00:10:06,727 --> 00:10:07,826
(Irma's panna cotta made with hand-picked cloudberries)

242
00:10:07,827 --> 00:10:08,827
I love it.

243
00:10:09,766 --> 00:10:10,766
(They each brought a dish to put together a feast.)

244
00:10:10,767 --> 00:10:11,937
It's a dessert.

245
00:10:12,367 --> 00:10:13,597
It looks so tasty.

246
00:10:16,406 --> 00:10:18,405
- This is awesome. - It's amazing.

247
00:10:18,406 --> 00:10:19,636
- Yes. - Thank you.

248
00:10:20,376 --> 00:10:24,245
I tried Korean food several years ago...

249
00:10:24,246 --> 00:10:27,817
because my son had a girlfriend from Korea.

250
00:10:28,246 --> 00:10:29,246
- Really? - Really?

251
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,856
His son had a Korean girlfriend.

252
00:10:30,857 --> 00:10:31,956
(They loosen up a little bit after hearing the comment.)

253
00:10:31,957 --> 00:10:34,057
- She cooked food. - I see.

254
00:10:34,587 --> 00:10:35,756
It was very delicious.

255
00:10:37,857 --> 00:10:38,895
Yes.

256
00:10:38,896 --> 00:10:40,296
(I hope our food is delicious too.)

257
00:10:41,227 --> 00:10:42,295
Try some.

258
00:10:42,296 --> 00:10:43,296
(Try some.)

259
00:10:43,297 --> 00:10:44,995
Try some.

260
00:10:44,996 --> 00:10:48,067
(Jorma, who has tried Korean food, )

261
00:10:48,937 --> 00:10:52,477
(and the other neighbors who are trying it for the first time)

262
00:10:53,207 --> 00:10:55,977
(What should I try first?)

263
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,875
I'm going to try all the Korean food.

264
00:10:58,876 --> 00:10:59,876
Yes, try some.

265
00:10:59,877 --> 00:11:01,346
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

266
00:11:01,347 --> 00:11:02,787
(What will the neighbors try first?)

267
00:11:03,046 --> 00:11:04,155
I knew it.

268
00:11:04,156 --> 00:11:05,457
Try some.

269
00:11:06,386 --> 00:11:08,255
It looks good on skewers.

270
00:11:08,256 --> 00:11:10,896
(Je Hoon's zucchini jeon on skewers catches their eye.)

271
00:11:11,727 --> 00:11:12,795
I knew it.

272
00:11:12,796 --> 00:11:13,796
(He grins from ear to ear.)

273
00:11:13,797 --> 00:11:15,395
They went for Je Hoon's dish first.

274
00:11:15,396 --> 00:11:18,536
(He's so happy he doesn't know what to do.)

275
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,737
The zucchini jeon is popular.

276
00:11:20,837 --> 00:11:22,107
Yes, it is.

277
00:11:22,837 --> 00:11:24,207
My dish is quite popular.

278
00:11:25,536 --> 00:11:27,746
(I never thought this day would come.)

279
00:11:28,077 --> 00:11:29,146
Like this.

280
00:11:29,176 --> 00:11:31,977
- How nice. - Nice, isn't it? It's golden brown.

281
00:11:32,477 --> 00:11:33,477
This looks delicious.

282
00:11:33,478 --> 00:11:35,323
(Does the most popular zucchini jeon taste as good as it looks?)

283
00:11:35,347 --> 00:11:39,256
(Their first Korean food happens to be Je Hoon's dish.)

284
00:11:40,717 --> 00:11:44,796
(Does it taste okay?)

285
00:11:45,597 --> 00:11:48,326
(Previously: Salty scrambled eggs)

286
00:11:48,327 --> 00:11:51,967
(I hope it isn't too salty today.)

287
00:11:52,567 --> 00:11:53,567
I'm nervous.

288
00:11:53,568 --> 00:11:54,636
(They are also nervous.)

289
00:11:55,107 --> 00:11:57,636
(He is holding his breath.)

290
00:11:58,437 --> 00:12:00,906
- Very good. Delicious. - Yes.

291
00:12:01,506 --> 00:12:02,506
Very good.

292
00:12:02,646 --> 00:12:08,447
(Congratulations. Je Hoon, the rookie chef, did it.)

293
00:12:08,717 --> 00:12:10,987
- It's tasty, Je Hoon. - It is, isn't it?

294
00:12:12,156 --> 00:12:17,327
(They each take a skewer and enjoy the zucchini jeon.)

295
00:12:17,896 --> 00:12:19,656
Gosh, it's so delicious.

296
00:12:22,626 --> 00:12:23,967
It's tasty.

297
00:12:29,266 --> 00:12:30,535
(Zucchini and rice)

298
00:12:30,536 --> 00:12:34,006
(They enjoy it in different ways.)

299
00:12:35,376 --> 00:12:37,646
I'm so happy...

300
00:12:37,746 --> 00:12:39,546
- to see them enjoy the food. - I feel proud.

301
00:12:39,577 --> 00:12:40,746
Yes, I do too.

302
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,745
I feel emotional.

303
00:12:42,746 --> 00:12:43,785
(The tear-jerking story of the rookie chef)

304
00:12:43,786 --> 00:12:45,706
I'm not sure if this is real or if I'm dreaming.

305
00:12:46,386 --> 00:12:50,587
This was actually his first time cooking this dish.

306
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,126
He made it by himself.

307
00:12:53,426 --> 00:12:54,426
First time?

308
00:12:54,426 --> 00:12:55,426
(Surprised)

309
00:12:55,496 --> 00:12:56,496
Really?

310
00:12:57,197 --> 00:12:58,736
- There you go. - He cooked it for the first time.

311
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:00,296
- Good job. - Yes.

312
00:13:01,967 --> 00:13:05,176
(They give him a look of approval.)

313
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:07,035
You can do it. You just need confidence.

314
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,583
- That's right. - Cooking is about confidence.

315
00:13:08,607 --> 00:13:09,706
Cooking is about confidence.

316
00:13:09,707 --> 00:13:10,976
(The younger Renters give him confidence.)

317
00:13:10,977 --> 00:13:13,116
Watching them enjoy the food,

318
00:13:13,117 --> 00:13:16,346
I feel like I want to do even better...

319
00:13:16,347 --> 00:13:17,587
- next time I cook. - Goodness.

320
00:13:17,617 --> 00:13:19,056
I think you'll do better next time.

321
00:13:19,057 --> 00:13:20,616
That's right.

322
00:13:20,617 --> 00:13:21,625
(The others show Je Hoon endless support.)

323
00:13:21,626 --> 00:13:22,626
You already got approval.

324
00:13:22,627 --> 00:13:23,786
I'm grateful...

325
00:13:24,327 --> 00:13:28,895
that I was able to serve food to these foreigners today.

326
00:13:28,896 --> 00:13:31,073
(He would like to share this honor with his neighbors.)

327
00:13:31,097 --> 00:13:32,795
- Thank you so much. - Thank you.

328
00:13:32,796 --> 00:13:35,337
(It's a speech worthy of an awards ceremony.)

329
00:13:35,937 --> 00:13:37,535
(The next dish they try is...)

330
00:13:37,536 --> 00:13:39,776
- Bulgogi. - Bulgogi.

331
00:13:40,776 --> 00:13:41,776
They are digging into it.

332
00:13:43,646 --> 00:13:46,676
(Cooked with the hard effort of the Renters' main chef)

333
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:51,187
(Bulgogi, a staple at Korean celebrations)

334
00:13:52,016 --> 00:13:56,687
(He had to slice it one by one because he bought a chunk of meat.)

335
00:13:57,827 --> 00:13:59,995
(Is it seasoned well?)

336
00:13:59,996 --> 00:14:01,327
- Is it good? - Yes.

337
00:14:01,567 --> 00:14:03,226
- How is the stew? - It's delicious.

338
00:14:03,227 --> 00:14:06,266
(Worried)

339
00:14:08,036 --> 00:14:09,266
This is very good.

340
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:11,237
Yes.

341
00:14:11,876 --> 00:14:13,512
- The reindeer is very good. - Thank you.

342
00:14:13,536 --> 00:14:15,976
He's very good at cooking.

343
00:14:15,977 --> 00:14:16,977
He's really good.

344
00:14:16,978 --> 00:14:18,176
I can see that.

345
00:14:19,577 --> 00:14:20,717
Yes, this is good.

346
00:14:21,046 --> 00:14:22,817
This is very good.

347
00:14:24,146 --> 00:14:28,057
(Jorma, who has tried Korean food, also takes a bite.)

348
00:14:29,187 --> 00:14:33,155
(This hits the spot.)

349
00:14:33,156 --> 00:14:34,766
Dong Yeon, the bulgogi is tasty.

350
00:14:35,097 --> 00:14:36,795
- It's really good. - It's good as always.

351
00:14:36,796 --> 00:14:39,096
(Can I have some?)

352
00:14:39,097 --> 00:14:40,795
- You never disappoint. - Seriously.

353
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,136
(Everyone loves the zucchini jeon and bulgogi.)

354
00:14:44,437 --> 00:14:45,437
Good.

355
00:14:45,807 --> 00:14:47,076
This is so tasty.

356
00:14:47,077 --> 00:14:48,482
(Aren't they going to try my chili pepper japchae?)

357
00:14:48,506 --> 00:14:50,875
- They ate so much. - I think they like it.

358
00:14:50,876 --> 00:14:52,652
(The neighbors are still busy eating the bulgogi.)

359
00:14:52,676 --> 00:14:55,087
(Does it look spicy to the foreigners?)

360
00:14:55,886 --> 00:14:57,587
(He glances over at Eun Woo.)

361
00:14:57,987 --> 00:15:01,327
(He glances at Eun Woo again.)

362
00:15:02,987 --> 00:15:05,625
(Then he takes a huge bite of the chili pepper japchae.)

363
00:15:05,626 --> 00:15:07,146
What kind of pie did she say this was?

364
00:15:07,296 --> 00:15:08,567
- Eun Woo. - Yes?

365
00:15:10,266 --> 00:15:11,837
You're really good at stir-frying food.

366
00:15:11,867 --> 00:15:13,237
Does it taste okay?

367
00:15:14,636 --> 00:15:15,867
I could finish...

368
00:15:16,406 --> 00:15:18,106
twenty bowls of rice with it.

369
00:15:18,107 --> 00:15:19,136
- Really? - Yes.

370
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:22,022
I'd finish a bowl of rice in no time with it.

371
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,046
My gosh.

372
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,375
(Isn't it spicy?)

373
00:15:24,376 --> 00:15:26,145
- What kind of pie is this? - Ham pie.

374
00:15:26,146 --> 00:15:29,847
(He tries the chili pepper japchae.)

375
00:15:30,217 --> 00:15:32,957
(Marveling)

376
00:15:33,386 --> 00:15:34,386
Yes.

377
00:15:34,387 --> 00:15:35,625
(Feeling relieved)

378
00:15:35,626 --> 00:15:39,357
(He didn't add chili oil to keep it less spicy.)

379
00:15:39,896 --> 00:15:42,025
(He takes another bite...)

380
00:15:42,026 --> 00:15:44,567
(before he even swallows the first bite.)

381
00:15:45,496 --> 00:15:48,807
(He loves the chili pepper japchae.)

382
00:15:49,367 --> 00:15:53,436
(Eun Woo's chili pepper japchae is finally showing off its true value.)

383
00:15:53,437 --> 00:15:57,246
(Thanks to his mom's recipe)

384
00:15:57,447 --> 00:15:58,447
Good.

385
00:15:58,817 --> 00:16:00,015
This is so tasty.

386
00:16:00,016 --> 00:16:02,117
(Thanks to Dong Hwi's PR, )

387
00:16:03,217 --> 00:16:07,487
(everyone tries the chili pepper japchae.)

388
00:16:08,557 --> 00:16:12,495
(Relieved, )

389
00:16:12,496 --> 00:16:16,827
(Eun Woo takes a bite.)

390
00:16:17,996 --> 00:16:19,196
They had a lot.

391
00:16:19,197 --> 00:16:20,197
(The neighbors can't stop eating.)

392
00:16:20,198 --> 00:16:21,998
They finished half the zucchini jeon skewers.

393
00:16:22,967 --> 00:16:23,967
Okay.

394
00:16:23,968 --> 00:16:29,246
(They are enjoying sharing food.)

395
00:16:29,876 --> 00:16:33,046
(While they enjoy their dinner in this friendly atmosphere...)

396
00:16:33,676 --> 00:16:35,587
(Dong Hwi looks around.)

397
00:16:37,317 --> 00:16:39,456
Can you ask her if she lost her ponies?

398
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:40,516
Okay.

399
00:16:40,557 --> 00:16:44,727
(They realize that the ponies are gone.)

400
00:16:44,957 --> 00:16:45,995
Where are they?

401
00:16:45,996 --> 00:16:49,097
(They were busy eating. Where did they go?)

402
00:16:49,496 --> 00:16:51,097
(While the people were eating...)

403
00:16:51,296 --> 00:16:52,296
Where did they go?

404
00:16:52,297 --> 00:16:54,806
(They ran this way...)

405
00:16:54,807 --> 00:16:55,905
(and that.)

406
00:16:55,906 --> 00:16:57,266
They're nice.

407
00:16:59,276 --> 00:17:03,347
(Try to catch me.)

408
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:07,416
Do you know where your ponies are?

409
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:10,547
No.

410
00:17:11,047 --> 00:17:12,186
(Laughing)

411
00:17:13,517 --> 00:17:15,985
(That's quite a hearty laugh.)

412
00:17:15,986 --> 00:17:17,256
- Is it okay? - They ran away.

413
00:17:17,257 --> 00:17:18,556
Yes, they'll be somewhere.

414
00:17:18,557 --> 00:17:19,655
(She is unconcerned.)

415
00:17:19,656 --> 00:17:20,896
They ate too much.

416
00:17:21,827 --> 00:17:24,536
(We're over here.)

417
00:17:24,537 --> 00:17:25,736
Yes, that's right.

418
00:17:26,636 --> 00:17:29,837
(The neighbors are also used to this situation.)

419
00:17:29,867 --> 00:17:32,405
- Thank you. - Thank you.

420
00:17:32,406 --> 00:17:33,607
Enjoy.

421
00:17:34,307 --> 00:17:35,375
Looks nice.

422
00:17:35,376 --> 00:17:37,445
Juri's soup.

423
00:17:37,446 --> 00:17:38,546
(He tries Juri's reindeer soup first.)

424
00:17:38,547 --> 00:17:39,946
- Can I have some? - The stew?

425
00:17:40,317 --> 00:17:41,985
Have you tried...

426
00:17:41,986 --> 00:17:43,215
reindeer before?

427
00:17:43,216 --> 00:17:44,485
- Yes, one time. - Yes?

428
00:17:44,486 --> 00:17:45,486
(The nutritious reindeer stew is made with potatoes and carrots.)

429
00:17:45,487 --> 00:17:48,456
(It's their 3rd time having reindeer and they are quite used to it.)

430
00:17:48,886 --> 00:17:51,257
(How does Juri's reindeer stew taste?)

431
00:17:52,057 --> 00:17:54,566
(Juri is nervous too.)

432
00:17:54,567 --> 00:17:55,796
(They try the reindeer stew.)

433
00:17:55,797 --> 00:17:56,925
Bon appetit.

434
00:17:56,926 --> 00:17:58,126
- Bon appetit. - So delicious.

435
00:17:58,736 --> 00:17:59,836
- My gosh. - It's so good.

436
00:17:59,837 --> 00:18:01,736
(His eyes grow wider.)

437
00:18:02,906 --> 00:18:04,235
(The Choi Soo Jong of Lapland is also an outstanding cook.)

438
00:18:04,236 --> 00:18:05,277
It's delicious.

439
00:18:06,736 --> 00:18:08,007
Enjoy.

440
00:18:10,347 --> 00:18:11,375
(Marveling)

441
00:18:11,376 --> 00:18:12,517
So delicious.

442
00:18:13,577 --> 00:18:14,617
It's so good.

443
00:18:15,317 --> 00:18:17,517
(My husband is a pretty good cook.)

444
00:18:17,787 --> 00:18:18,857
The stew.

445
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:22,786
(He immediately tries it again.)

446
00:18:22,787 --> 00:18:23,787
Is the stew tasty?

447
00:18:24,386 --> 00:18:26,256
- How is the stew? - It's so good.

448
00:18:26,257 --> 00:18:28,867
(He has more as soon as he answers.)

449
00:18:29,827 --> 00:18:31,267
This is really good.

450
00:18:31,867 --> 00:18:34,336
It's like beef and radish soup.

451
00:18:34,337 --> 00:18:38,006
(He's become more used to reindeer than beef and radish soup.)

452
00:18:38,007 --> 00:18:39,077
You're right.

453
00:18:40,307 --> 00:18:41,307
(Juri, you're the best.)

454
00:18:41,308 --> 00:18:42,376
You're right.

455
00:18:42,406 --> 00:18:46,146
(This is the joy of potluck parties.)

456
00:18:47,146 --> 00:18:48,786
There are so many good dishes.

457
00:18:48,787 --> 00:18:50,046
(And this village's most popular dish!)

458
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:51,287
What kind of fish is this?

459
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:55,027
- I caught it from this lake. - Really?

460
00:18:56,986 --> 00:18:59,425
I seasoned it with pepper and dill.

461
00:18:59,426 --> 00:19:01,125
(He grilled it with butter and seasoned it with pepper and dill.)

462
00:19:01,126 --> 00:19:02,297
It looks amazing.

463
00:19:04,267 --> 00:19:07,396
(Jorma's simple and homely local dish)

464
00:19:07,567 --> 00:19:09,435
I'd like a lot of fish.

465
00:19:09,436 --> 00:19:10,436
Okay.

466
00:19:11,307 --> 00:19:14,676
It looks scrumptious.

467
00:19:16,547 --> 00:19:19,077
(It is definitely the neighbors' favorite dish.)

468
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:25,156
(How does the fish fillet caught fresh from the lake taste?)

469
00:19:26,087 --> 00:19:27,257
It's very tender.

470
00:19:27,486 --> 00:19:29,356
I think he added dill...

471
00:19:29,357 --> 00:19:30,955
and lemon.

472
00:19:30,956 --> 00:19:32,556
(The combination of tender fish and fragrant dill is amazing.)

473
00:19:32,557 --> 00:19:33,955
I love it. It's delicious.

474
00:19:33,956 --> 00:19:35,225
He's an outstanding cook.

475
00:19:35,226 --> 00:19:36,396
(It tastes amazing...)

476
00:19:37,097 --> 00:19:38,097
It's really good.

477
00:19:38,098 --> 00:19:39,435
(even without too much seasoning.)

478
00:19:39,436 --> 00:19:40,666
I really wanted to try this.

479
00:19:41,067 --> 00:19:42,307
- The lemon cake? - Yes.

480
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:43,966
It looks really good.

481
00:19:44,876 --> 00:19:45,935
(Anne's lemon cake)

482
00:19:45,936 --> 00:19:49,376
(There's always room for dessert.)

483
00:19:50,747 --> 00:19:51,946
- So easy. - Yes.

484
00:19:55,787 --> 00:19:59,857
(Electrified)

485
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:05,996
It's the best lemon cake that I've ever had in my life.

486
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:07,196
Really?

487
00:20:08,896 --> 00:20:12,436
(He's amazed by the lemon cake too.)

488
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:14,597
Perfect.

489
00:20:16,107 --> 00:20:17,367
- It's perfect. - Yes.

490
00:20:18,577 --> 00:20:20,806
When she made it for me for the first time,

491
00:20:20,807 --> 00:20:21,906
I asked her to marry me.

492
00:20:23,607 --> 00:20:27,415
(The love story that is sweeter than the dessert)

493
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:30,047
When she made it for the first time, he asked her to marry him.

494
00:20:30,817 --> 00:20:33,357
(What?)

495
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:37,586
(The bachelors are buzzing.)

496
00:20:37,587 --> 00:20:38,656
Lovely.

497
00:20:38,997 --> 00:20:41,726
(We remember those good old days.)

498
00:20:42,196 --> 00:20:46,037
(Their son is feeling awkward.)

499
00:20:46,466 --> 00:20:49,066
It's so lovely. I envy them.

500
00:20:49,067 --> 00:20:50,837
(He envies them.)

501
00:20:51,807 --> 00:20:53,935
Do you want me to feed you nurungji?

502
00:20:53,936 --> 00:20:55,376
No.

503
00:20:58,247 --> 00:20:59,516
- Really? Yes. - Yes.

504
00:20:59,517 --> 00:21:01,645
(A dinner in a rural village overflowing with love)

505
00:21:01,646 --> 00:21:03,686
- Basically. - Basically. Yes.

506
00:21:04,547 --> 00:21:07,016
Does everyone live in Seoul?

507
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:08,257
- Yes. Right. - Yes.

508
00:21:09,087 --> 00:21:10,485
To be honest, actually, in Seoul,

509
00:21:10,486 --> 00:21:15,166
we have many delivery services.

510
00:21:15,367 --> 00:21:16,896
So we don't cook so much.

511
00:21:17,797 --> 00:21:20,366
But in Finland, we have to cook, so...

512
00:21:20,367 --> 00:21:22,127
(But they have cooked their own meals here.)

513
00:21:22,807 --> 00:21:23,965
We made it.

514
00:21:23,966 --> 00:21:25,436
- Thank you. - Thank you.

515
00:21:26,406 --> 00:21:27,536
Thank you very much.

516
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:28,645
(It tastes better when you share it with others.)

517
00:21:28,646 --> 00:21:30,506
(I know.)

518
00:21:30,507 --> 00:21:32,577
How long have you been here?

519
00:21:34,646 --> 00:21:37,916
(For a very long time.)

520
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:41,786
(Let me see.)

521
00:21:41,787 --> 00:21:43,185
For 56 years.

522
00:21:43,186 --> 00:21:44,287
(For 56 years.)

523
00:21:44,857 --> 00:21:47,196
(Goodness. For 56 years!)

524
00:21:47,797 --> 00:21:49,695
(I've been here for a long time.)

525
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:51,096
She has lived here for a long time.

526
00:21:51,327 --> 00:21:53,665
I used to live in Rovaniemi.

527
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:54,837
Right. Rovaniemi.

528
00:21:54,936 --> 00:22:00,476
In 1990, I built a house here in the village.

529
00:22:01,307 --> 00:22:03,276
The schools and...

530
00:22:03,277 --> 00:22:05,546
I thought big cities...

531
00:22:05,547 --> 00:22:08,446
were not so good for kids.

532
00:22:09,117 --> 00:22:10,616
You thought the countryside would be better than...

533
00:22:10,617 --> 00:22:11,857
- big cities. - Yes.

534
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:14,715
And nowadays, my sons love...

535
00:22:14,716 --> 00:22:18,726
to visit here, our farm.

536
00:22:19,426 --> 00:22:22,165
They come here very often and stay for a long time.

537
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:24,286
(They come here very often and stay for a long time.)

538
00:22:26,067 --> 00:22:30,006
(And now, we understand why they do that a little.)

539
00:22:30,007 --> 00:22:31,807
This is crazy.

540
00:22:36,607 --> 00:22:38,317
I used to live in a world...

541
00:22:38,577 --> 00:22:41,316
where it was always noisy and filled with stuff.

542
00:22:41,317 --> 00:22:43,797
(A relaxed moment in nature that is different from the cities)

543
00:22:44,146 --> 00:22:49,125
I won't go back to the cities.

544
00:22:49,126 --> 00:22:50,826
Here, it's great to live with kids and animals.

545
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:53,097
(Here, it's great to live with kids and animals.)

546
00:22:53,797 --> 00:22:59,067
(They feel true happiness in nature.)

547
00:22:59,767 --> 00:23:02,235
- This place is good. - Yes.

548
00:23:02,236 --> 00:23:03,996
- It's very peaceful. - It's beautiful. Yes.

549
00:23:04,067 --> 00:23:05,406
And it's peaceful.

550
00:23:06,206 --> 00:23:09,547
There are kind people like you.

551
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:11,876
So... Yes.

552
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:13,347
It's as we expected.

553
00:23:14,646 --> 00:23:16,616
(The neighbors have shown a warm welcome to the Renters...)

554
00:23:16,617 --> 00:23:18,587
(who were unfamiliar with life here.)

555
00:23:18,787 --> 00:23:22,787
There must be many Finnish people who would want to live here too.

556
00:23:23,287 --> 00:23:24,827
- There's no doubt. - Yes.

557
00:23:25,097 --> 00:23:26,356
- Exactly. - Yes.

558
00:23:26,357 --> 00:23:28,597
- It's so charming. - Yes.

559
00:23:29,896 --> 00:23:31,195
That's right.

560
00:23:31,196 --> 00:23:33,797
(The life in Lapland resonates with them in a different way.)

561
00:23:35,007 --> 00:23:38,507
(The days may not be as fancy, )

562
00:23:39,037 --> 00:23:42,806
(but with the families and neighbors they love, )

563
00:23:42,807 --> 00:23:49,646
(the people of Lapland share their simple every day, )

564
00:23:50,317 --> 00:23:53,886
(enjoying a much greater satisfaction.)

565
00:23:55,357 --> 00:23:57,456
- I feel really good. - Right.

566
00:23:58,087 --> 00:24:00,395
(A place where a simple daily life...)

567
00:24:00,396 --> 00:24:02,695
(is absorbed with peaceful happiness)

568
00:24:02,696 --> 00:24:04,027
Why do I feel so happy?

569
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:06,236
- Right. Seriously. - I feel so happy now.

570
00:24:06,497 --> 00:24:07,767
It's so peaceful. I love it.

571
00:24:07,896 --> 00:24:12,307
(In their serene smiles, )

572
00:24:13,876 --> 00:24:16,475
- What a day to have in my life. - It feels new, right?

573
00:24:16,476 --> 00:24:19,876
(they find the color of happiness they didn't know before.)

574
00:24:20,676 --> 00:24:22,985
It's like a movie. It's fantastic.

575
00:24:22,986 --> 00:24:24,346
- Yes. It's fantastic. - To me.

576
00:24:24,347 --> 00:24:26,385
(This moment feels like a movie.)

577
00:24:26,386 --> 00:24:30,057
It was one of the most meaningful evenings of my life...

578
00:24:30,787 --> 00:24:32,096
because of...

579
00:24:32,097 --> 00:24:33,395
everybody here.

580
00:24:33,396 --> 00:24:35,125
(It moved busy workaholic Je Hoon in a special way.)

581
00:24:35,126 --> 00:24:36,926
- It's amazing. - Thank you.

582
00:24:37,297 --> 00:24:39,165
- Thank you so much. - Thank you.

583
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:41,567
(It moved busy workaholic Je Hoon in a special way.)

584
00:24:42,767 --> 00:24:46,736
Today's dinner with the guys from Korea is really special.

585
00:24:49,976 --> 00:24:52,776
- You should come in winter times. - Again?

586
00:24:52,777 --> 00:24:54,675
- In winter? I hope so. - Yes.

587
00:24:54,676 --> 00:24:56,086
- We'll welcome you. - Okay.

588
00:24:56,087 --> 00:24:59,155
I'm going to come here again in winter if you promise...

589
00:24:59,156 --> 00:25:01,087
- to make this stew for me again. - Okay.

590
00:25:01,656 --> 00:25:02,826
It's a deal.

591
00:25:02,827 --> 00:25:04,027
(It's a deal.)

592
00:25:04,557 --> 00:25:06,397
- Will he come back? - And the lemon cake too.

593
00:25:06,696 --> 00:25:08,367
- Yes. - Sure.

594
00:25:10,067 --> 00:25:12,767
Maybe next time, you could visit Korea.

595
00:25:13,466 --> 00:25:14,695
- Yes. - Yes.

596
00:25:14,696 --> 00:25:15,965
(Smiling)

597
00:25:15,966 --> 00:25:19,206
We'll make you delicious dishes again.

598
00:25:19,807 --> 00:25:21,976
(We'll go there even if you starve us.)

599
00:25:22,307 --> 00:25:23,405
It's a deal.

600
00:25:23,406 --> 00:25:25,876
(He seals the deal quickly not to lose it.)

601
00:25:26,047 --> 00:25:27,246
(We hope all deals will come true.)

602
00:25:27,247 --> 00:25:28,416
We will...

603
00:25:28,547 --> 00:25:30,986
Why don't we take a selfie all together?

604
00:25:31,216 --> 00:25:32,756
- That sounds good. - Okay.

605
00:25:32,757 --> 00:25:33,916
One more time.

606
00:25:34,186 --> 00:25:36,185
One, two, three.

607
00:25:36,186 --> 00:25:37,326
(With the neighbors from the first village, )

608
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,796
Thank you so much again.

609
00:25:38,797 --> 00:25:40,425
- Thank you. - Thank you.

610
00:25:40,426 --> 00:25:45,196
(they had a party and shared warm love.)

611
00:25:46,396 --> 00:25:47,496
That was tough.

612
00:25:47,497 --> 00:25:49,536
- Well done. - Good job.

613
00:25:49,537 --> 00:25:50,837
Good job.

614
00:25:51,337 --> 00:25:54,435
- You did great, chefs. - Come on, Dong Hwi.

615
00:25:54,436 --> 00:25:55,475
You helped us...

616
00:25:55,476 --> 00:25:56,905
- with the ingredients. - No, I just...

617
00:25:56,906 --> 00:25:58,816
- prepared garlic. - Don't say that.

618
00:25:58,817 --> 00:26:01,445
- I minced garlic this time. - Right.

619
00:26:01,446 --> 00:26:04,216
You've been doing a tough job for days.

620
00:26:04,486 --> 00:26:06,215
- Goodness. - I realized that.

621
00:26:06,216 --> 00:26:08,685
It's nothing compared to what you did.

622
00:26:08,686 --> 00:26:10,385
- That's true. - It wasn't an easy job.

623
00:26:10,386 --> 00:26:12,695
- I'll wake up early tomorrow... - Okay.

624
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:15,126
And treat you to breakfast.

625
00:26:16,327 --> 00:26:17,725
From now on,

626
00:26:17,726 --> 00:26:20,666
call me a nature boy, not a city boy.

627
00:26:21,837 --> 00:26:22,905
I love nature.

628
00:26:22,906 --> 00:26:24,966
- You've changed. - Yes.

629
00:26:25,277 --> 00:26:27,205
Why does time fly so fast?

630
00:26:27,206 --> 00:26:29,376
- That's so true. - It's running away.

631
00:26:29,646 --> 00:26:31,506
The sun is up all the time.

632
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:32,846
(The sun is up all the time.)

633
00:26:32,847 --> 00:26:35,915
It's 9... It's almost 10pm, but the sun is still up.

634
00:26:35,916 --> 00:26:38,215
- Really? - It feels like 6pm.

635
00:26:38,216 --> 00:26:40,017
It is past 9pm already?

636
00:26:40,156 --> 00:26:41,757
It's almost 10pm, Dong Hwi.

637
00:26:42,126 --> 00:26:43,456
Goodness.

638
00:26:43,827 --> 00:26:47,097
After some days, we did get used to it.

639
00:26:47,226 --> 00:26:50,027
- Humans are adaptive, indeed. - That's right.

640
00:26:50,196 --> 00:26:52,296
I feel like I'll sleep really well again tonight.

641
00:26:52,297 --> 00:26:53,912
- I'm 100 percent sure. - I'll sleep well again.

642
00:26:53,936 --> 00:26:55,235
We'll have a sound sleep.

643
00:26:55,236 --> 00:26:57,313
(They'll sleep well after rye harvesting and the village party.)

644
00:26:57,337 --> 00:27:00,807
- Let's play the last game. - Okay.

645
00:27:00,906 --> 00:27:03,676
- The loser sleeps in Ransu's house. - Should we do that?

646
00:27:04,047 --> 00:27:06,017
- You can only fit your head in. - Yes.

647
00:27:08,886 --> 00:27:10,117
He's sleeping.

648
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:13,287
- Was it sleep-talking? - Yes, it was.

649
00:27:15,587 --> 00:27:22,626
(The Renters yawn out of tiredness.)

650
00:27:24,027 --> 00:27:26,396
I'm feeling tired. Can I go wash up?

651
00:27:27,236 --> 00:27:29,567
Do you want to wash up? I want to stay with you more.

652
00:27:30,037 --> 00:27:31,106
I want to lie down.

653
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:33,388
- Let's wash and meet up again. - Should we gather again?

654
00:27:33,807 --> 00:27:34,976
Let's wash up first.

655
00:27:35,807 --> 00:27:38,676
- Was Je Hoon very lonely in Seoul? - Je Hoon is...

656
00:27:40,077 --> 00:27:41,746
Around this time, Je Hoon acts...

657
00:27:41,747 --> 00:27:43,185
- as if it's morning. - He likes to...

658
00:27:43,186 --> 00:27:44,847
He likes to be with others so much.

659
00:27:45,456 --> 00:27:47,716
- He's dancing now. - I'm sorry, but...

660
00:27:48,117 --> 00:27:50,356
- He's jumping. - I'm sorry,

661
00:27:50,357 --> 00:27:51,956
but can we stop gathering up?

662
00:27:52,557 --> 00:27:54,226
We're together 24 hours a day.

663
00:27:57,226 --> 00:28:00,396
(In the end, they pass out.)

664
00:28:01,936 --> 00:28:05,577
(It makes sense.)

665
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:11,806
(Now that they're in a village, )

666
00:28:11,807 --> 00:28:16,486
(they have twice as much work to do than in the forest.)

667
00:28:26,896 --> 00:28:31,396
(A new day begins.)

668
00:28:33,466 --> 00:28:39,635
(With the sun shining brightly up in the sky, )

669
00:28:39,636 --> 00:28:44,146
(the sky glows with a blue hue.)

670
00:28:44,706 --> 00:28:47,516
(It's a busy moving day.)

671
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:52,057
(Who are the ones that woke up first?)

672
00:28:52,456 --> 00:28:54,557
(Did you sleep well?)

673
00:28:56,857 --> 00:28:59,826
(The 1st to wake up are the mischievous lambs...)

674
00:28:59,827 --> 00:29:02,767
(that always fight each other.)

675
00:29:03,067 --> 00:29:04,925
(Taking a peek at the chicken coop as part of the morning routine)

676
00:29:04,926 --> 00:29:07,636
(Getting sick of it)

677
00:29:09,067 --> 00:29:12,277
(Ransu is having an energetic morning too!)

678
00:29:12,736 --> 00:29:18,007
(And a precious guest who paid a visit to the outdoor kitchen)

679
00:29:19,646 --> 00:29:21,945
(Is the Korean can opener still sleeping...)

680
00:29:21,946 --> 00:29:24,247
(when he said he'd make breakfast?)

681
00:29:25,757 --> 00:29:27,985
(Current time: 7:30am)

682
00:29:27,986 --> 00:29:31,426
(Where is Dong Hwi who is in charge of breakfast?)

683
00:29:32,827 --> 00:29:36,726
(He is still deep in his sleep.)

684
00:29:45,307 --> 00:29:47,905
(It's time to prepare breakfast.)

685
00:29:47,906 --> 00:29:50,646
(I have to get up now.)

686
00:29:51,347 --> 00:29:55,146
(He gets up even though he's tired.)

687
00:29:55,176 --> 00:29:57,586
(Creaking)

688
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,616
(As Dong Hwi wakes up, )

689
00:29:59,617 --> 00:30:03,587
(the 200-year-old furniture breaks the silence.)

690
00:30:03,787 --> 00:30:06,827
(Thanks to that, he wakes up automatically.)

691
00:30:07,527 --> 00:30:08,926
Did you sleep well?

692
00:30:09,367 --> 00:30:10,396
Yes.

693
00:30:13,337 --> 00:30:14,465
My gosh.

694
00:30:14,466 --> 00:30:18,607
(I haven't slept well yet.)

695
00:30:19,807 --> 00:30:21,675
(I'll get ready quietly so that he can sleep.)

696
00:30:21,676 --> 00:30:25,876
(Carefully)

697
00:30:27,747 --> 00:30:32,316
(But the wooden floor won't cooperate with him.)

698
00:30:32,317 --> 00:30:34,357
(Rustling)

699
00:30:36,827 --> 00:30:38,996
(Goodness.)

700
00:30:38,997 --> 00:30:41,726
(I want to be in a private room.)

701
00:30:43,367 --> 00:30:50,537
(The younger brothers are getting a deep sleep in quietness.)

702
00:30:51,236 --> 00:30:53,675
(I want to get a deep sleep too.)

703
00:30:53,676 --> 00:30:57,047
(Rustling)

704
00:30:58,247 --> 00:31:03,017
(When you wake up, I wake up too. They share the same destiny.)

705
00:31:04,347 --> 00:31:05,715
(He ends up getting up.)

706
00:31:05,716 --> 00:31:07,455
Je Hoon.

707
00:31:07,456 --> 00:31:09,087
(He ends up getting up.)

708
00:31:10,087 --> 00:31:11,156
I'll get going.

709
00:31:11,257 --> 00:31:12,557
Take some rest.

710
00:31:12,597 --> 00:31:14,196
Okay. I'll wash up.

711
00:31:14,696 --> 00:31:19,567
(He leaves the room after waking him up.)

712
00:31:21,166 --> 00:31:25,436
(The ingredients for breakfast are in Eun Woo's room.)

713
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:31,307
(Surprised)

714
00:31:32,216 --> 00:31:33,916
Is it okay? Can I come in?

715
00:31:35,117 --> 00:31:36,117
Yes.

716
00:31:37,617 --> 00:31:39,287
Sorry, Eun Woo.

717
00:31:39,617 --> 00:31:41,287
- Good morning. - The fridge is here.

718
00:31:41,517 --> 00:31:42,557
It's all right.

719
00:31:42,726 --> 00:31:43,956
Did you sleep okay?

720
00:31:44,057 --> 00:31:45,087
Yes.

721
00:31:46,857 --> 00:31:47,996
Do you need help?

722
00:31:47,997 --> 00:31:49,625
No. Not at all.

723
00:31:49,626 --> 00:31:52,696
(Did he grab a pizza from the fridge for breakfast?)

724
00:31:53,567 --> 00:31:57,436
(They bought a frozen pizza at the market yesterday.)

725
00:31:57,837 --> 00:32:02,445
(We've never used the microwave when we have electricity.)

726
00:32:02,446 --> 00:32:05,446
(They were super excited about the flavor of civilization.)

727
00:32:06,047 --> 00:32:08,415
(Thanks to electricity, )

728
00:32:08,416 --> 00:32:10,787
(they bought ready-made food for the first time.)

729
00:32:11,617 --> 00:32:12,787
- Dong Hwi. - Good night.

730
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:15,156
Please mince some garlic.

731
00:32:15,557 --> 00:32:16,626
What?

732
00:32:17,527 --> 00:32:21,726
(He needs more sleep.)

733
00:32:22,466 --> 00:32:23,926
You love garlic so much.

734
00:32:25,367 --> 00:32:26,396
Hey.

735
00:32:26,837 --> 00:32:28,596
(Dong Hwi runs into Je Hoon in the living room.)

736
00:32:28,597 --> 00:32:30,067
- Je Hoon. - Yes.

737
00:32:30,636 --> 00:32:32,236
Eun Woo wants me to mince garlic.

738
00:32:32,507 --> 00:32:33,675
Do you have to mince garlic?

739
00:32:33,676 --> 00:32:34,836
(Pulling 1 joke as soon as he opens his eyes)

740
00:32:34,837 --> 00:32:35,906
A garlic pizza?

741
00:32:36,906 --> 00:32:38,376
At Aleksi's house,

742
00:32:38,676 --> 00:32:39,976
I had to make a fire.

743
00:32:41,476 --> 00:32:42,886
I was in distress.

744
00:32:44,216 --> 00:32:45,415
It's simple.

745
00:32:45,416 --> 00:32:48,517
(At this moment, the microwave is the glowing hope.)

746
00:32:49,327 --> 00:32:51,885
(Laughing)

747
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:53,997
- Hey, Je Hoon. This... - Yes.

748
00:32:55,097 --> 00:32:56,195
I do it like this.

749
00:32:56,196 --> 00:32:58,936
(Je Hoon came to get some water in a lovely jar.)

750
00:33:00,567 --> 00:33:02,507
I'll wash up like a cat washing its face.

751
00:33:03,706 --> 00:33:04,837
Is there a cat?

752
00:33:06,176 --> 00:33:07,576
You meant you'd wash up like a cat.

753
00:33:07,837 --> 00:33:09,406
I thought you saw a cat.

754
00:33:10,876 --> 00:33:14,276
(It was waiting for him 10 minutes ago.)

755
00:33:14,277 --> 00:33:16,486
(And it left.)

756
00:33:17,446 --> 00:33:19,155
Come to think of it, I need to wash up too.

757
00:33:19,156 --> 00:33:21,517
(Can-opener Dong Hwi lost his chance to meet a cat.)

758
00:33:23,226 --> 00:33:26,696
(I'm going to go and wash up like a cat.)

759
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:30,465
(He glances at the wash-up place that he used.)

760
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:33,196
(Looking away)

761
00:33:34,097 --> 00:33:35,566
(Is he going into the house...)

762
00:33:35,567 --> 00:33:37,736
(where there's no restroom?)

763
00:33:39,007 --> 00:33:43,047
(Je Hoon settles in front of the mirror.)

764
00:33:43,946 --> 00:33:46,276
(He got the idea after living in the countryside.)

765
00:33:46,277 --> 00:33:50,286
(This way, he can look at the mirror while washing up.)

766
00:33:50,287 --> 00:33:51,847
It's a true cold massage.

767
00:33:53,517 --> 00:33:59,626
(The nature boy even makes a temporary sink now.)

768
00:34:00,597 --> 00:34:05,166
(Actually, one thing is missing.)

769
00:34:06,067 --> 00:34:09,235
(The pajamas he adored and wore every day...)

770
00:34:09,236 --> 00:34:12,377
(to maintain his elegance)

771
00:34:12,636 --> 00:34:18,347
(Is the city boy's last bit of pride gone?)

772
00:34:18,977 --> 00:34:22,716
(He has changed into a comfortable shirt.)

773
00:34:23,247 --> 00:34:26,756
(He wipes with the shirt too.)

774
00:34:27,287 --> 00:34:29,186
Let's get changed.

775
00:34:29,187 --> 00:34:32,296
(He has transformed perfectly from a city boy to a nature boy.)

776
00:34:33,296 --> 00:34:35,965
(The true man of nature, Dong Yeon, )

777
00:34:35,966 --> 00:34:40,767
(wakes up with a stretch.)

778
00:34:46,807 --> 00:34:53,647
(The volume of his hair increases every day.)

779
00:34:54,617 --> 00:34:57,086
(The back of his hair is flat.)

780
00:34:57,117 --> 00:35:00,457
(He slept soundly for sure.)

781
00:35:03,156 --> 00:35:07,256
(It's great to sleep in without worrying about breakfast.)

782
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:11,997
(Today, electricity is doing the cooking.)

783
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:13,835
(In 3 minutes, the pizza is ready.)

784
00:35:13,836 --> 00:35:14,997
This is actually...

785
00:35:17,367 --> 00:35:21,135
(He picks up a cutting board...)

786
00:35:21,136 --> 00:35:23,747
(and a knife.)

787
00:35:26,377 --> 00:35:29,346
(Without hesitation, )

788
00:35:29,347 --> 00:35:31,945
(he pours a pile of chips on the cutting board.)

789
00:35:31,946 --> 00:35:33,017
Is it too much?

790
00:35:36,256 --> 00:35:40,156
(He starts crushing the chips.)

791
00:35:40,727 --> 00:35:43,426
Eun Woo told me to mince garlic...

792
00:35:43,667 --> 00:35:45,566
as soon as he woke up.

793
00:35:46,566 --> 00:35:51,506
(He used it in place of seasoning at the first rented place.)

794
00:35:52,437 --> 00:35:56,247
(An unexpected result, Hwicasso's dish was received well.)

795
00:35:56,776 --> 00:36:01,347
(A surprising harmony of flavors made with an unbiased combination)

796
00:36:01,716 --> 00:36:04,287
(His creativity is ignited again.)

797
00:36:04,687 --> 00:36:05,916
It's too much.

798
00:36:05,917 --> 00:36:10,187
(He grabs the finely crushed chips and brings them to the microwave.)

799
00:36:11,057 --> 00:36:12,726
I'll sprinkle it like this.

800
00:36:12,727 --> 00:36:14,096
(Adding a crunchy topping of chips)

801
00:36:14,097 --> 00:36:15,296
Sprinkle it evenly.

802
00:36:16,267 --> 00:36:17,295
(It looks like a good combination.)

803
00:36:17,296 --> 00:36:18,327
This will be so...

804
00:36:19,066 --> 00:36:22,335
I'll warm it up for a minute.

805
00:36:22,336 --> 00:36:24,105
(Hwicasso's creative pizza)

806
00:36:24,106 --> 00:36:26,306
(Add chips to the pizza and microwave it for 1 minute.)

807
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:28,936
(A beautiful electric tone announcing it's done)

808
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:30,077
Gosh, this is so...

809
00:36:32,946 --> 00:36:35,215
Nice. It's golden.

810
00:36:35,216 --> 00:36:36,885
(Thanks to electricity, )

811
00:36:36,886 --> 00:36:37,985
I love it.

812
00:36:37,986 --> 00:36:39,856
(breakfast is made in 11 minutes.)

813
00:36:41,156 --> 00:36:42,755
(Loving the world with electricity)

814
00:36:42,756 --> 00:36:44,156
My gosh.

815
00:36:45,856 --> 00:36:47,127
Goodness. Look.

816
00:36:47,597 --> 00:36:49,367
It smells awesome.

817
00:36:49,796 --> 00:36:51,997
It's done. I can get back in now.

818
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:55,905
- Gosh, that... - Je Hoon.

819
00:36:55,906 --> 00:36:57,307
It looks great.

820
00:36:57,537 --> 00:37:00,477
From morning, we're having an explosion of high calories.

821
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:02,675
Of course. We're having high calories.

822
00:37:02,676 --> 00:37:04,045
(Frozen fries)

823
00:37:04,046 --> 00:37:05,175
It's okay to have them for one meal.

824
00:37:05,176 --> 00:37:08,746
(High voltage has resulted in a high-calorie breakfast.)

825
00:37:08,747 --> 00:37:11,346
Guys. Mr. Kwak Dong Yeon.

826
00:37:11,347 --> 00:37:12,986
- Yes. - Mr. Cha Eun Woo.

827
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,215
- Goodness. - Dong Yeon.

828
00:37:15,216 --> 00:37:18,256
- Yes, Dong Hwi. - I did my best.

829
00:37:18,356 --> 00:37:20,655
- You sprinkled it again. - No.

830
00:37:20,656 --> 00:37:22,525
- Is it that chips? - No.

831
00:37:22,526 --> 00:37:25,937
You wanted garlic, so I whipped up some flakes.

832
00:37:26,296 --> 00:37:27,796
Also, we didn't buy the chips.

833
00:37:28,497 --> 00:37:29,566
Hold on.

834
00:37:31,566 --> 00:37:33,176
(Crunchy)

835
00:37:33,506 --> 00:37:35,606
(I knew it.)

836
00:37:36,176 --> 00:37:37,977
- Come on, Dong Hwi. - Try it together.

837
00:37:38,406 --> 00:37:39,646
Please try it.

838
00:37:39,647 --> 00:37:41,516
- Thanks for the food. - Thank you.

839
00:37:41,517 --> 00:37:42,647
Thanks for the food.

840
00:37:43,117 --> 00:37:44,686
(No need to say.)

841
00:37:44,687 --> 00:37:47,355
(It's tasty!)

842
00:37:47,356 --> 00:37:48,417
(Savoring)

843
00:37:49,627 --> 00:37:51,086
It's so good.

844
00:37:51,687 --> 00:37:53,056
- It's really good. - It's tasty.

845
00:37:53,057 --> 00:37:55,227
- It's tasty. - Gosh, is it?

846
00:37:55,867 --> 00:37:58,167
- It's all right. - Is it good?

847
00:37:58,926 --> 00:38:01,097
By the way, about our next place...

848
00:38:01,136 --> 00:38:03,466
- Right. I got it. Hold on. - Okay.

849
00:38:03,867 --> 00:38:04,965
Listen.

850
00:38:04,966 --> 00:38:06,635
(Finally, here's the information...)

851
00:38:06,636 --> 00:38:08,537
(on the last place they're renting.)

852
00:38:09,147 --> 00:38:10,207
What?

853
00:38:11,776 --> 00:38:13,846
- He doesn't look good. - The photo already says...

854
00:38:13,847 --> 00:38:15,175
- Yes. - that we're in trouble.

855
00:38:15,176 --> 00:38:16,315
(A photo already shows a problem?)

856
00:38:16,316 --> 00:38:17,386
Why?

857
00:38:17,747 --> 00:38:18,986
There's a baby.

858
00:38:19,617 --> 00:38:21,186
- A baby. - A very adorable baby.

859
00:38:21,187 --> 00:38:22,307
- It's a family. - Goodness.

860
00:38:22,526 --> 00:38:23,586
The address is...

861
00:38:23,727 --> 00:38:25,286
It's in Rovaniemi.

862
00:38:25,287 --> 00:38:26,727
- Rovaniemi? - Nice.

863
00:38:27,057 --> 00:38:28,756
- That's a city. - Yes.

864
00:38:29,497 --> 00:38:30,565
This is the burger place.

865
00:38:30,566 --> 00:38:35,807
(It's a small city where they had reindeer burger on their first day.)

866
00:38:36,167 --> 00:38:38,867
I really look forward to this place.

867
00:38:39,207 --> 00:38:40,576
- Me too. - Wouldn't they even have Wi-Fi?

868
00:38:40,577 --> 00:38:42,276
- What? - Please.

869
00:38:42,776 --> 00:38:45,847
(Are we escaping the rural life now?)

870
00:38:47,417 --> 00:38:50,085
(They can't hold their laughter as they're excited about it.)

871
00:38:50,086 --> 00:38:52,516
I can't wait to see it.

872
00:38:52,517 --> 00:38:54,215
(Will their wish come true?)

873
00:38:54,216 --> 00:38:55,315
"Hello."

874
00:38:55,316 --> 00:38:57,186
"I'm happy to invite you..."

875
00:38:57,187 --> 00:38:59,085
"to our fairytale-like two-story house."

876
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:00,196
A two-story house.

877
00:39:00,997 --> 00:39:01,997
A two-story house?

878
00:39:01,998 --> 00:39:03,143
(Their anticipation increases again.)

879
00:39:03,167 --> 00:39:05,025
I work as a therapist...

880
00:39:05,026 --> 00:39:07,097
in Rovaniemi.

881
00:39:07,937 --> 00:39:09,136
A therapist?

882
00:39:09,437 --> 00:39:10,905
- A therapist. - Maybe a psychotherapist?

883
00:39:10,906 --> 00:39:12,826
(A psychotherapist living in a two-story house?)

884
00:39:13,577 --> 00:39:16,105
(In fact, at this therapy house, )

885
00:39:16,106 --> 00:39:19,776
(they'll have a very eccentric experience.)

886
00:39:21,216 --> 00:39:25,586
(A secret land out of the ordinary)

887
00:39:27,856 --> 00:39:32,426
(They've never seen anything like this before.)

888
00:39:34,256 --> 00:39:39,127
(What secret behind this house made them let go of everything?)

889
00:39:40,397 --> 00:39:42,536
Since we know where we're staying next,

890
00:39:42,537 --> 00:39:44,206
- let's clean and pack our bags. - Right.

891
00:39:44,207 --> 00:39:46,775
- All right. - Thank you for the food.

892
00:39:46,776 --> 00:39:48,236
- I'll go brush my teeth. - Okay.

893
00:39:51,406 --> 00:39:53,545
(Je Hoon makes the bed like he always does...)

894
00:39:53,546 --> 00:39:55,675
(before they leave a house.)

895
00:39:55,676 --> 00:39:59,517
(He even makes Dong Hwi's bed.)

896
00:40:01,086 --> 00:40:05,557
(The paper and pen Dong Hwi used for his caricature drawings.)

897
00:40:08,196 --> 00:40:13,335
(Je Hoon thinks for a moment...)

898
00:40:13,336 --> 00:40:17,006
(and begins writing.)

899
00:40:18,336 --> 00:40:23,446
(This house was especially memorable for Je Hoon.)

900
00:40:25,977 --> 00:40:29,847
(I'm sad that it's time for us to leave this village already.)

901
00:40:31,086 --> 00:40:32,755
(It's always been just the four of us.)

902
00:40:32,756 --> 00:40:39,526
(This house is special because it gifted us our first neighbors.)

903
00:40:40,696 --> 00:40:44,767
(The little moments we shared with the villagers...)

904
00:40:46,367 --> 00:40:48,096
(and the kind smiles on our landlords' faces...)

905
00:40:48,097 --> 00:40:55,776
(warmed our hearts in an unforgettable way.)

906
00:40:56,046 --> 00:41:00,847
(We'll also miss all the cute animals.)

907
00:41:02,147 --> 00:41:03,846
(To our first neighbors in Lapland!)

908
00:41:03,847 --> 00:41:08,016
- Thank you. - Thank you.

909
00:41:08,017 --> 00:41:12,656
(We hope your lives always remain this peaceful!)

910
00:41:16,767 --> 00:41:19,767
(The landlords came outside to see the Renters off.)

911
00:41:20,667 --> 00:41:24,167
(Ransu is looking around his new house built by the Renters.)

912
00:41:24,906 --> 00:41:28,635
(He meticulously checks the interior of the house...)

913
00:41:28,636 --> 00:41:31,807
(and even the roof.)

914
00:41:32,147 --> 00:41:33,445
Ransu.

915
00:41:33,446 --> 00:41:34,577
Good morning.

916
00:41:34,847 --> 00:41:36,085
- Good morning. - Good morning.

917
00:41:36,086 --> 00:41:37,747
- Hello. - Good morning.

918
00:41:37,946 --> 00:41:39,017
Good morning.

919
00:41:41,216 --> 00:41:43,925
Ransu is excited about the new house.

920
00:41:43,926 --> 00:41:46,655
Yes, he's already been inside.

921
00:41:46,656 --> 00:41:48,496
- Yes? - And I think he approved.

922
00:41:48,497 --> 00:41:49,926
(Ransu is very pleased!)

923
00:41:50,727 --> 00:41:51,766
Ransu.

924
00:41:51,767 --> 00:41:52,767
(We hope you stay warm in the winter.)

925
00:41:52,768 --> 00:41:53,997
He's so happy.

926
00:41:55,066 --> 00:41:56,136
Ransu.

927
00:41:56,437 --> 00:41:57,465
Ransu.

928
00:41:57,466 --> 00:41:58,466
(He runs to them immediately.)

929
00:41:58,467 --> 00:42:01,707
Goodness. You're so happy.

930
00:42:02,106 --> 00:42:03,945
And this is my gift for you.

931
00:42:03,946 --> 00:42:07,877
(Hwicasso gives them his drawing.)

932
00:42:10,586 --> 00:42:12,247
Ransu.

933
00:42:12,287 --> 00:42:14,385
Cats, lambs, and chicken.

934
00:42:14,386 --> 00:42:15,655
(Dong Hwi drew their entire family.)

935
00:42:15,656 --> 00:42:17,786
- This is nice. - Thank you very much.

936
00:42:17,787 --> 00:42:19,186
- This is really nice. - Thank you.

937
00:42:19,187 --> 00:42:21,957
(They love the drawing.)

938
00:42:22,097 --> 00:42:24,766
Thank you all for visiting us here.

939
00:42:24,767 --> 00:42:25,997
- Thank you. - Thanks.

940
00:42:26,236 --> 00:42:27,796
- Thank you. - Thank you.

941
00:42:28,196 --> 00:42:30,066
Where is one of you?

942
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:31,835
He's staying here?

943
00:42:31,836 --> 00:42:33,477
- Here? Yes. - Okay.

944
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:35,816
- He asked if Eun Woo was staying? - Yes.

945
00:42:37,406 --> 00:42:40,876
(Eun Woo is packing with no idea that they're saying goodbye.)

946
00:42:40,877 --> 00:42:43,216
And then this bag.

947
00:42:43,986 --> 00:42:46,155
(He didn't hear them leave the house.)

948
00:42:46,156 --> 00:42:48,316
(This is the consequence of having a room by himself.)

949
00:42:48,656 --> 00:42:50,085
He's living here now.

950
00:42:50,086 --> 00:42:51,227
- Yes? - Yes.

951
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:53,356
- Welcome. - That's nice.

952
00:42:53,426 --> 00:42:55,356
Can you please give that room to him?

953
00:42:55,926 --> 00:42:58,796
- Yes. - The storage or anywhere.

954
00:42:59,026 --> 00:43:00,696
He can sleep with the sheep.

955
00:43:02,597 --> 00:43:06,335
Or we've already made another home.

956
00:43:06,336 --> 00:43:07,605
- Yes, okay. - Yes.

957
00:43:07,606 --> 00:43:08,775
Sleeping with Ransu.

958
00:43:08,776 --> 00:43:11,146
True. It's nicely insulated.

959
00:43:11,147 --> 00:43:13,516
(Eun Woo built it, and he could sleep in it.)

960
00:43:13,517 --> 00:43:14,747
- Goodness. - Goodness.

961
00:43:14,847 --> 00:43:16,607
- Goodness, you're so cute. - He's adorable.

962
00:43:17,287 --> 00:43:18,546
Gosh, I really didn't know.

963
00:43:21,687 --> 00:43:24,025
- Sorry. - It's okay. Good morning.

964
00:43:24,026 --> 00:43:25,925
- We explained to them for you. - I see.

965
00:43:25,926 --> 00:43:29,155
Don't worry. We thought that you would stay with us.

966
00:43:29,156 --> 00:43:30,327
Yes.

967
00:43:30,966 --> 00:43:32,996
- Why not? - Yes, why not?

968
00:43:32,997 --> 00:43:34,166
- Yes. - Yes.

969
00:43:34,167 --> 00:43:37,065
So, thank you for inviting us.

970
00:43:37,066 --> 00:43:39,065
This is a gift for you.

971
00:43:39,066 --> 00:43:40,905
(The eldest Renter prepared a gift out of appreciation.)

972
00:43:40,906 --> 00:43:43,105
It's good for your hair.

973
00:43:43,106 --> 00:43:45,347
- Okay, thank you very much. - Okay, thank you.

974
00:43:45,446 --> 00:43:46,775
This is that shampoo.

975
00:43:46,776 --> 00:43:49,646
When you use this, you can tell it relaxes your scalp...

976
00:43:49,647 --> 00:43:51,985
- and creates volume in your hair. - Of course.

977
00:43:51,986 --> 00:43:53,385
I have so much more volume in mine.

978
00:43:53,386 --> 00:43:55,256
- Thank you very much. - Thank you so much.

979
00:43:55,486 --> 00:43:56,727
My gosh.

980
00:43:57,627 --> 00:43:58,957
I don't want to go back.

981
00:44:01,057 --> 00:44:02,255
Hope to see you again.

982
00:44:02,256 --> 00:44:03,826
- Hope so, yes. - Hope to see you again.

983
00:44:03,827 --> 00:44:05,327
Hope to see you all again.

984
00:44:05,426 --> 00:44:07,965
And you're always welcome to come back.

985
00:44:07,966 --> 00:44:09,065
Thank you so much.

986
00:44:09,066 --> 00:44:10,406
Bye, Ransu.

987
00:44:10,466 --> 00:44:12,366
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

988
00:44:12,367 --> 00:44:14,076
- Bye. - Bye.

989
00:44:14,077 --> 00:44:15,336
Good luck with everything.

990
00:44:15,406 --> 00:44:16,706
- Good luck. - Thank you.

991
00:44:16,707 --> 00:44:18,707
- See you. - See you.

992
00:44:19,077 --> 00:44:20,275
I don't want to leave.

993
00:44:20,276 --> 00:44:22,046
We're so used to this house.

994
00:44:23,017 --> 00:44:24,886
- Bye. - Bye.

995
00:44:25,517 --> 00:44:26,617
Goodbye.

996
00:44:26,886 --> 00:44:27,957
Bye.

997
00:44:31,787 --> 00:44:34,057
- Bye. - Bye.

998
00:44:34,497 --> 00:44:37,097
Goodness, we're headed to our last house now.

999
00:44:42,336 --> 00:44:44,065
It's about 200km away.

1000
00:44:44,066 --> 00:44:46,476
That's a little more than 1 hour and 30 minutes.

1001
00:44:46,477 --> 00:44:48,637
(The city of Rovaniemi is 1 hour and 30 minutes away.)

1002
00:44:49,847 --> 00:44:54,917
(They're now used to driving such a long distance.)

1003
00:44:55,546 --> 00:44:56,945
There aren't any traffic lights...

1004
00:44:56,946 --> 00:44:59,216
or cars on this road. I love it.

1005
00:44:59,957 --> 00:45:01,516
Right. Driving would be fun on this road.

1006
00:45:01,517 --> 00:45:04,132
(They're driving on a road that is taking them straight to the city.)

1007
00:45:04,156 --> 00:45:07,127
(They must have good food there since it's a city.)

1008
00:45:08,026 --> 00:45:09,057
I'm hungry, though.

1009
00:45:09,627 --> 00:45:10,696
Right.

1010
00:45:11,267 --> 00:45:13,267
- Jinx. - Jinx.

1011
00:45:14,466 --> 00:45:15,596
Or...

1012
00:45:15,597 --> 00:45:16,605
(In that case...)

1013
00:45:16,606 --> 00:45:18,135
should we make a stop on the way and eat?

1014
00:45:18,136 --> 00:45:19,167
That sounds great.

1015
00:45:19,707 --> 00:45:21,076
(It happens to be move-in day, so they get to eat out!)

1016
00:45:21,077 --> 00:45:24,376
- What should we eat? - Are you craving anything?

1017
00:45:24,377 --> 00:45:25,405
I'll search for some options online.

1018
00:45:25,406 --> 00:45:26,953
(They have access to the Internet, so they search on their phones.)

1019
00:45:26,977 --> 00:45:28,215
I want...

1020
00:45:28,216 --> 00:45:30,585
I'm fine with everything.

1021
00:45:30,586 --> 00:45:32,246
I'm fine with everything that Dong Yeon does.

1022
00:45:32,247 --> 00:45:33,962
(Planner Kwak can't accept going to restaurants that aren't good.)

1023
00:45:33,986 --> 00:45:37,026
(He's trying to choose one based on different factors.)

1024
00:45:37,086 --> 00:45:40,056
(Price, how special it is, taste, ambiance)

1025
00:45:40,057 --> 00:45:45,897
(Which factor does Planner Kwak deem the most important?)

1026
00:45:46,966 --> 00:45:49,736
- This one. - Did you find a nice one nearby?

1027
00:45:49,807 --> 00:45:53,105
A restaurant near the house we're headed to...

1028
00:45:53,106 --> 00:45:54,175
seems quite nice.

1029
00:45:54,176 --> 00:45:55,307
Really?

1030
00:45:56,776 --> 00:45:59,406
All right. Let's trust Dong Yeon and go there.

1031
00:46:00,017 --> 00:46:01,275
Have faith in me.

1032
00:46:01,276 --> 00:46:02,377
Of course.

1033
00:46:02,816 --> 00:46:05,016
You said it seemed quite nice.

1034
00:46:05,017 --> 00:46:07,337
(Their destination is now the restaurant Dong Yeon chose.)

1035
00:46:11,086 --> 00:46:16,097
(Kemijarvi was full of nature with its lake and trees.)

1036
00:46:17,327 --> 00:46:19,635
I think we're driving toward the center of the city.

1037
00:46:19,636 --> 00:46:22,036
We're getting closer to Rovaniemi.

1038
00:46:22,037 --> 00:46:24,005
We're driving toward downtown.

1039
00:46:24,006 --> 00:46:25,437
- The city. - This is a city.

1040
00:46:26,506 --> 00:46:27,506
My gosh.

1041
00:46:27,507 --> 00:46:29,376
- This is insane. - There's a clothing store here.

1042
00:46:29,377 --> 00:46:30,945
- What is this? - There's a shopping center.

1043
00:46:30,946 --> 00:46:32,945
(Welcome. It's been so long since you've seen a shopping center.)

1044
00:46:32,946 --> 00:46:34,077
Let's stop here.

1045
00:46:35,077 --> 00:46:36,545
There's a shopping center here.

1046
00:46:36,546 --> 00:46:39,416
(The four are busy looking around after being in the countryside.)

1047
00:46:39,417 --> 00:46:40,586
It feels extravagant.

1048
00:46:41,086 --> 00:46:42,116
(Looking this way)

1049
00:46:42,117 --> 00:46:43,286
(Looking that way)

1050
00:46:43,287 --> 00:46:44,885
(Looking this way and that way)

1051
00:46:44,886 --> 00:46:47,156
- This is amazing. - Look at how many cars there are.

1052
00:46:47,557 --> 00:46:48,827
I feel faint.

1053
00:46:49,127 --> 00:46:51,497
(One, two, three cars)

1054
00:46:51,867 --> 00:46:54,696
(Don't you remember the roads in Seoul?)

1055
00:46:55,767 --> 00:46:58,766
Gosh, we're driving underground, and there are huge buildings.

1056
00:46:58,767 --> 00:46:59,836
This is too much.

1057
00:47:00,006 --> 00:47:02,606
(They feel as if they're at the center of Gangnam.)

1058
00:47:03,207 --> 00:47:06,747
(But here, huge buildings aren't even five stories tall.)

1059
00:47:06,977 --> 00:47:08,646
I just saw a traffic light for the first time here.

1060
00:47:08,647 --> 00:47:10,287
- A traffic light. - Amazing.

1061
00:47:11,586 --> 00:47:14,216
(They're even amazed about a traffic light.)

1062
00:47:15,656 --> 00:47:16,656
It feels nice to see one.

1063
00:47:18,026 --> 00:47:19,085
(The Renters are...)

1064
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:20,456
I feel like a country mouse.

1065
00:47:20,457 --> 00:47:22,597
(acting like four country mice.)

1066
00:47:22,897 --> 00:47:25,626
(While they were preoccupied with looking at the city...)

1067
00:47:25,627 --> 00:47:27,296
Gosh, we're almost there.

1068
00:47:28,537 --> 00:47:31,167
- We're here. - Yes.

1069
00:47:32,207 --> 00:47:36,377
(They arrived at the restaurant where Dong Yeon made a reservation.)

1070
00:47:37,006 --> 00:47:39,847
Did you not make a reservation at a restaurant? It's a safari.

1071
00:47:41,017 --> 00:47:42,017
It is.

1072
00:47:42,377 --> 00:47:43,646
(A safari?)

1073
00:47:43,647 --> 00:47:44,787
What is that?

1074
00:47:45,986 --> 00:47:46,986
What is this place?

1075
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:48,917
(Are we really at a restaurant?)

1076
00:47:49,457 --> 00:47:51,986
(Smirking)

1077
00:47:52,656 --> 00:47:53,925
This is a restaurant?

1078
00:47:53,926 --> 00:47:55,103
(Meanwhile, Dong Hwi is scared of bears, )

1079
00:47:55,127 --> 00:47:57,227
(so he looks nervous.)

1080
00:47:57,296 --> 00:48:00,096
(The restaurant's name is scaring him.)

1081
00:48:00,097 --> 00:48:01,536
Is this the restaurant, Dong Yeon?

1082
00:48:01,537 --> 00:48:02,777
Let's get out of the car first.

1083
00:48:03,037 --> 00:48:04,366
What are you up to, Dong Yeon?

1084
00:48:04,367 --> 00:48:05,636
Let's go.

1085
00:48:05,767 --> 00:48:09,077
(They're nervous even as they get out of the car.)

1086
00:48:09,406 --> 00:48:10,406
Let's go.

1087
00:48:10,407 --> 00:48:11,545
Open the door.

1088
00:48:11,546 --> 00:48:13,576
(They follow Dong Yeon into the building.)

1089
00:48:13,577 --> 00:48:14,816
"Bookings and shop?"

1090
00:48:16,546 --> 00:48:18,266
This doesn't look like a restaurant at all.

1091
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:23,526
This is a safari shop.

1092
00:48:24,187 --> 00:48:27,597
He got us. This isn't a restaurant.

1093
00:48:27,756 --> 00:48:28,756
Hello.

1094
00:48:28,757 --> 00:48:30,065
- Hello. - Hello.

1095
00:48:30,066 --> 00:48:33,025
I made a reservation to Kotisaari.

1096
00:48:33,026 --> 00:48:34,166
- Kotisaari? - Yes.

1097
00:48:34,167 --> 00:48:35,235
Okay, very good.

1098
00:48:35,236 --> 00:48:36,465
I can take you there.

1099
00:48:36,466 --> 00:48:37,707
Okay, thank you.

1100
00:48:37,736 --> 00:48:38,966
Please follow me.

1101
00:48:39,336 --> 00:48:40,405
Let's go.

1102
00:48:40,406 --> 00:48:41,476
- What's going on? - What's going on?

1103
00:48:41,477 --> 00:48:43,445
(Where are we going now?)

1104
00:48:43,446 --> 00:48:44,476
Are we not eating?

1105
00:48:44,477 --> 00:48:47,877
(Are we not eating?)

1106
00:48:47,977 --> 00:48:50,086
(Don't say anything and follow me.)

1107
00:48:50,517 --> 00:48:51,585
(Since they don't know anything, they just trail after Dong Yeon.)

1108
00:48:51,586 --> 00:48:56,287
(Following Dong Yeon)

1109
00:48:57,327 --> 00:48:59,187
(Anxious)

1110
00:48:59,856 --> 00:49:02,097
(Kwak Dong Yeon, what are you up to?)

1111
00:49:03,997 --> 00:49:06,695
The first step is going to be getting some life jackets on.

1112
00:49:06,696 --> 00:49:08,436
- Yes. - We're getting on a boat?

1113
00:49:08,437 --> 00:49:09,466
Yes.

1114
00:49:10,767 --> 00:49:11,807
Wait.

1115
00:49:11,836 --> 00:49:13,275
We're riding a boat to get to the restaurant?

1116
00:49:13,276 --> 00:49:14,276
(They'd never have guessed this.)

1117
00:49:14,277 --> 00:49:16,077
We're riding a boat to get to the restaurant?

1118
00:49:16,477 --> 00:49:19,946
(There's a boat waiting for them.)

1119
00:49:20,147 --> 00:49:22,175
(Shocked)

1120
00:49:22,176 --> 00:49:23,417
Really?

1121
00:49:24,847 --> 00:49:29,787
(They just arrived at the city, but now they have to cross a river?)

1122
00:49:30,586 --> 00:49:32,146
We're getting on a boat out of nowhere.

1123
00:49:32,227 --> 00:49:35,856
(Dong Yeon made a reservation at a special restaurant.)

1124
00:49:36,156 --> 00:49:38,195
(Confused)

1125
00:49:38,196 --> 00:49:40,096
- Just trust me. - Okay.

1126
00:49:40,097 --> 00:49:44,506
(They get on the boat as Dong Yeon told them to.)

1127
00:49:45,307 --> 00:49:48,077
(Je Hoon can't believe this.)

1128
00:49:48,606 --> 00:49:50,605
(Is this really happening?)

1129
00:49:50,606 --> 00:49:53,077
I'm so curious to see the menu.

1130
00:49:53,716 --> 00:49:56,617
We're on our way to eat something we haven't had so far.

1131
00:49:56,647 --> 00:49:58,928
Something we haven't had? Do you know what's on the menu?

1132
00:49:59,716 --> 00:50:00,787
Bye.

1133
00:50:02,216 --> 00:50:03,557
Bye.

1134
00:50:03,856 --> 00:50:05,326
He's sending us off?

1135
00:50:05,327 --> 00:50:07,296
(Are we just leaving like this?)

1136
00:50:07,356 --> 00:50:08,596
Bye.

1137
00:50:08,597 --> 00:50:10,227
(Farewell, everyone on the shore.)

1138
00:50:11,897 --> 00:50:15,497
Just trust me this once and cross the river.

1139
00:50:15,966 --> 00:50:17,936
My dear, please don't cross that river.

1140
00:50:17,937 --> 00:50:19,057
(There's no going back now.)

1141
00:50:19,606 --> 00:50:21,775
We're riding a boat to get food.

1142
00:50:21,776 --> 00:50:22,977
- My gosh. - Right.

1143
00:50:23,307 --> 00:50:24,505
- I'd never have guessed. - It's extraordinary, right?

1144
00:50:24,506 --> 00:50:26,077
- It's extraordinary, right? - Yes.

1145
00:50:26,676 --> 00:50:27,945
Goodness.

1146
00:50:27,946 --> 00:50:29,316
(I made this happen.)

1147
00:50:30,446 --> 00:50:33,517
(Looking around)

1148
00:50:34,216 --> 00:50:35,457
Guys.

1149
00:50:35,656 --> 00:50:37,155
I don't see anything...

1150
00:50:37,156 --> 00:50:39,057
- that looks like a restaurant. - Exactly.

1151
00:50:40,156 --> 00:50:42,956
(They left the dock...)

1152
00:50:42,957 --> 00:50:45,295
(and rode the boat...)

1153
00:50:45,296 --> 00:50:48,867
(and rode the boat some more.)

1154
00:50:49,736 --> 00:50:52,735
(But...)

1155
00:50:52,736 --> 00:50:53,905
We're traveling quite far.

1156
00:50:53,906 --> 00:50:55,505
(they're still in the middle of the river.)

1157
00:50:55,506 --> 00:50:56,945
This river is huge.

1158
00:50:56,946 --> 00:50:58,775
(They're still in the middle of the river.)

1159
00:50:58,776 --> 00:51:00,716
- It's endless. - Right.

1160
00:51:02,077 --> 00:51:03,985
What if it turns out that we're eating...

1161
00:51:03,986 --> 00:51:05,506
- lunch boxes on this boat? - My gosh.

1162
00:51:05,716 --> 00:51:07,256
They might say, "Eat your food here."

1163
00:51:07,486 --> 00:51:10,227
Gosh, that's funny.

1164
00:51:11,086 --> 00:51:13,896
(They're making all sorts of speculations.)

1165
00:51:13,897 --> 00:51:16,296
- Gosh, over there. - Over there.

1166
00:51:16,926 --> 00:51:18,396
My gut tells me that's where we're going.

1167
00:51:18,397 --> 00:51:20,536
Isn't that an island?

1168
00:51:20,537 --> 00:51:21,857
(What is the special restaurant?)

1169
00:51:22,566 --> 00:51:24,606
We're here.

1170
00:51:24,736 --> 00:51:26,706
(This island is where they'll be eating today!)

1171
00:51:26,707 --> 00:51:28,135
I see a cottage.

1172
00:51:28,136 --> 00:51:29,576
Is there a restaurant on the island?

1173
00:51:29,577 --> 00:51:31,646
- It's unique, right? - Gosh, how did you...

1174
00:51:31,647 --> 00:51:33,476
The restaurant is on an island that's on a river.

1175
00:51:33,477 --> 00:51:35,647
- Right. - How did you find this place?

1176
00:51:36,276 --> 00:51:37,585
Google knows everything.

1177
00:51:37,586 --> 00:51:40,985
(Dong Yeon found a special restaurant on an island.)

1178
00:51:40,986 --> 00:51:42,086
We're here.

1179
00:51:43,457 --> 00:51:44,627
Let's go.

1180
00:51:44,787 --> 00:51:47,925
(They're finally on the island!)

1181
00:51:47,926 --> 00:51:51,196
I'm starving.

1182
00:51:52,066 --> 00:51:53,735
Welcome to Kotisaari.

1183
00:51:53,736 --> 00:51:55,466
(Welcome to Kotisaari.)

1184
00:51:56,097 --> 00:51:57,306
Isn't this beautiful?

1185
00:51:57,307 --> 00:51:58,465
(Isn't this beautiful?)

1186
00:51:58,466 --> 00:51:59,835
- It's so beautiful. - What is this?

1187
00:51:59,836 --> 00:52:01,437
This is amazing.

1188
00:52:03,236 --> 00:52:06,175
There's a grass field and a forest on an island.

1189
00:52:06,176 --> 00:52:08,176
(There's a grass field and a forest on an island.)

1190
00:52:08,847 --> 00:52:10,017
Beautiful.

1191
00:52:11,517 --> 00:52:15,586
(Downtown Rovaniemi)

1192
00:52:16,517 --> 00:52:21,256
(A lone island located not too far from the center of the city)

1193
00:52:26,636 --> 00:52:30,736
(The island is on the Kemi River, the longest river in Finland.)

1194
00:52:30,966 --> 00:52:32,905
(Kotisaari)

1195
00:52:32,906 --> 00:52:34,976
(The island was used as a rest stop by lumberjacks...)

1196
00:52:34,977 --> 00:52:37,457
(who used the Kemi River for log transportation in the 1980s.)

1197
00:52:42,276 --> 00:52:48,356
(They preserved the house the lumberjacks used to stay in!)

1198
00:52:50,287 --> 00:52:52,585
(Now, the house is run as a restaurant.)

1199
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:53,957
Can we go inside?

1200
00:52:54,457 --> 00:52:55,695
- Let's go inside. - Let's go inside.

1201
00:52:55,696 --> 00:52:56,925
Gosh, guys. This is so...

1202
00:52:56,926 --> 00:52:58,367
(They walk into the restaurant.)

1203
00:53:00,236 --> 00:53:01,536
What is this place?

1204
00:53:01,537 --> 00:53:02,866
(It preserved most of the charm of the traditional wooden building.)

1205
00:53:02,867 --> 00:53:05,736
- I feel like we're here for drinks. - Right.

1206
00:53:08,136 --> 00:53:12,077
(Have you seen a restaurant use wine bottles as candle holders?)

1207
00:53:12,176 --> 00:53:14,445
- Thanks, Dong Yeon. - Dong Yeon.

1208
00:53:14,446 --> 00:53:15,516
(This place feels special.)

1209
00:53:15,517 --> 00:53:17,747
- The food is going to be good. - Right?

1210
00:53:19,147 --> 00:53:21,256
- I'm so hungry. I'm starving. - Same.

1211
00:53:22,216 --> 00:53:23,525
I'm excited about the food.

1212
00:53:23,526 --> 00:53:25,046
(They're looking forward to the food.)

1213
00:53:28,557 --> 00:53:29,997
And here we are.

1214
00:53:30,667 --> 00:53:32,195
I think we're having a course meal.

1215
00:53:32,196 --> 00:53:34,316
(What's the first course of Dong Yeon's reservation?)

1216
00:53:34,897 --> 00:53:36,096
Fish soup?

1217
00:53:36,097 --> 00:53:37,807
(What kind of soup is this?)

1218
00:53:38,207 --> 00:53:39,735
(Sniffing)

1219
00:53:39,736 --> 00:53:42,276
I smell butter.

1220
00:53:43,877 --> 00:53:46,405
I think the soup has potatoes and salmon.

1221
00:53:46,406 --> 00:53:47,816
Gosh, salmon.

1222
00:53:48,847 --> 00:53:52,747
(They caught the Finnish salmon themselves.)

1223
00:53:54,617 --> 00:53:56,727
(Fresh)

1224
00:53:57,957 --> 00:54:02,227
(The Finnish traditional soup is cooked for a long time.)

1225
00:54:03,026 --> 00:54:05,195
(It has a smooth and creamy texture...)

1226
00:54:05,196 --> 00:54:09,296
(with salmon, potatoes, and dill.)

1227
00:54:10,167 --> 00:54:14,477
(The consistency of the soup isn't thick at all.)

1228
00:54:14,537 --> 00:54:15,835
Thank you for the food.

1229
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:17,706
- Enjoy. - Enjoy. Thank you for the food.

1230
00:54:17,707 --> 00:54:18,867
(Will the city boys like it?)

1231
00:54:20,077 --> 00:54:21,347
This is salmon.

1232
00:54:21,676 --> 00:54:22,977
Gosh, it has a deep flavor.

1233
00:54:23,347 --> 00:54:25,386
This is great.

1234
00:54:27,057 --> 00:54:28,216
(Humming)

1235
00:54:29,417 --> 00:54:30,885
Gosh, I like this.

1236
00:54:30,886 --> 00:54:32,557
(Gosh, I like this.)

1237
00:54:33,356 --> 00:54:35,855
(Dong Hwi is in love with the soup.)

1238
00:54:35,856 --> 00:54:38,896
Finnish salmon is especially tasty.

1239
00:54:38,897 --> 00:54:40,996
(The rich soup goes well with the nuttiness of Finnish salmon!)

1240
00:54:40,997 --> 00:54:42,196
This is really good.

1241
00:54:42,466 --> 00:54:43,905
(The warm soup is...)

1242
00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:45,235
- This is good. - Yes.

1243
00:54:45,236 --> 00:54:47,005
(heating their stomachs.)

1244
00:54:47,006 --> 00:54:48,307
- It's coming. - What's that?

1245
00:54:49,406 --> 00:54:51,146
(The main course is finally being served!)

1246
00:54:51,147 --> 00:54:52,377
It's finally here.

1247
00:54:52,406 --> 00:54:55,216
(It's finally here.)

1248
00:54:58,417 --> 00:54:59,916
(The main course is a barbecue platter.)

1249
00:54:59,917 --> 00:55:02,287
- This is insane. - It really is insane.

1250
00:55:02,687 --> 00:55:05,227
(On an outdoor grill in the middle of the island, )

1251
00:55:06,526 --> 00:55:09,656
(using locally sourced birch logs, )

1252
00:55:10,227 --> 00:55:12,626
(the meat is smoked...)

1253
00:55:12,627 --> 00:55:15,997
(for 6 to 7 hours at 250°C.)

1254
00:55:16,966 --> 00:55:19,436
(Cooking slowly for a long time...)

1255
00:55:19,437 --> 00:55:23,076
(gives the meat a rich flavor and makes it soft.)

1256
00:55:23,077 --> 00:55:25,146
(Along with the birch wood barbecue...)

1257
00:55:25,147 --> 00:55:28,117
(come three side dishes.)

1258
00:55:28,977 --> 00:55:31,646
(Braised beans in tomato sauce)

1259
00:55:31,647 --> 00:55:34,516
(Mac and cheese)

1260
00:55:34,517 --> 00:55:36,655
(Roasted potatoes with butter)

1261
00:55:36,656 --> 00:55:37,926
Those potatoes look great.

1262
00:55:38,886 --> 00:55:41,355
(The barbecue meal Dong Yeon chose for them is full of protein.)

1263
00:55:41,356 --> 00:55:42,525
We're eating meat.

1264
00:55:42,526 --> 00:55:44,172
(The barbecue meal Dong Yeon chose for them is full of protein.)

1265
00:55:44,196 --> 00:55:47,436
Gosh, this is insane.

1266
00:55:47,437 --> 00:55:48,566
It really is.

1267
00:55:48,796 --> 00:55:51,906
(They're pleased with the meal.)

1268
00:55:52,367 --> 00:55:53,876
Let's fully enjoy this.

1269
00:55:53,877 --> 00:55:57,147
(Eun Woo takes a bite of the meat smoked with birch wood first.)

1270
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:00,347
It's soft.

1271
00:56:03,077 --> 00:56:04,397
I can just tear through the meat.

1272
00:56:08,917 --> 00:56:10,085
(This is so...)

1273
00:56:10,086 --> 00:56:12,057
- It's so good. - It's really good.

1274
00:56:15,957 --> 00:56:17,066
(Amazed)

1275
00:56:17,227 --> 00:56:18,525
The flavor is making me emotional.

1276
00:56:18,526 --> 00:56:20,406
(The food is so good that they feel emotional.)

1277
00:56:21,167 --> 00:56:23,065
We just came from an agricultural village.

1278
00:56:23,066 --> 00:56:24,826
(We just came from an agricultural village.)

1279
00:56:25,236 --> 00:56:27,706
(This is their first time eating city food in a while.)

1280
00:56:27,707 --> 00:56:30,077
We're eating so much like Dong Yeon said.

1281
00:56:30,506 --> 00:56:32,346
- This is really good. - It's really good.

1282
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:34,346
(The country mice are eating nonstop.)

1283
00:56:34,347 --> 00:56:36,886
Try the mac and cheese too.

1284
00:56:37,216 --> 00:56:39,616
Gosh, mac and cheese.

1285
00:56:39,617 --> 00:56:42,256
(Je Hoon's excitement is at an all-time high.)

1286
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:44,385
Dong Yeon, you did a great job finding this place.

1287
00:56:44,386 --> 00:56:46,385
- Right. - The food is good, right?

1288
00:56:46,386 --> 00:56:47,557
Yes, it's good.

1289
00:56:47,627 --> 00:56:49,096
It's worth crossing the river.

1290
00:56:49,097 --> 00:56:50,695
(The food is worth crossing the river!)

1291
00:56:50,696 --> 00:56:52,827
Crossing a river is a must to eat food this good.

1292
00:56:54,667 --> 00:56:56,536
I should stop eating, but I can't.

1293
00:56:56,537 --> 00:56:58,307
(I should stop eating, but I can't.)

1294
00:56:59,537 --> 00:57:04,545
(Everything tastes good, but...)

1295
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:07,417
- I wish we had kimchi. - Green onion kimchi.

1296
00:57:08,747 --> 00:57:09,815
(I'm thinking what you're thinking.)

1297
00:57:09,816 --> 00:57:11,086
- Eun Woo. - Yes?

1298
00:57:11,347 --> 00:57:12,646
Stop copying me.

1299
00:57:12,647 --> 00:57:13,886
(Eun Woo, stop copying me.)

1300
00:57:14,057 --> 00:57:16,287
Why do you keep taking the words out of my mouth?

1301
00:57:16,926 --> 00:57:19,386
- I thought of that myself. - No.

1302
00:57:20,457 --> 00:57:21,996
It was so funny in the car earlier.

1303
00:57:21,997 --> 00:57:24,366
We sang "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" at the same time.

1304
00:57:24,367 --> 00:57:27,065
- Right. - At the same time.

1305
00:57:27,066 --> 00:57:28,672
(Kimchi wasn't the only thought they shared.)

1306
00:57:28,696 --> 00:57:31,267
(On their way to the restaurant)

1307
00:57:32,937 --> 00:57:35,806
- Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer - Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer

1308
00:57:35,807 --> 00:57:38,376
Why did you suddenly sing that at the same time?

1309
00:57:38,377 --> 00:57:40,377
- Stop playing. - What are you doing?

1310
00:57:40,847 --> 00:57:43,077
(What's going on between you two?)

1311
00:57:43,446 --> 00:57:46,416
(Even when they were looking out the windows downtown...)

1312
00:57:46,417 --> 00:57:50,585
(Turning their heads)

1313
00:57:50,586 --> 00:57:53,426
(They even unconsciously acted in sync.)

1314
00:57:53,997 --> 00:57:55,227
How are we...

1315
00:57:56,097 --> 00:57:57,965
the same person aside from our faces?

1316
00:57:57,966 --> 00:57:59,966
(How are we the same person aside from our faces?)

1317
00:57:59,997 --> 00:58:01,335
I guess hanging out for a long time...

1318
00:58:01,336 --> 00:58:02,896
(I guess hanging out for a long time...)

1319
00:58:02,897 --> 00:58:04,136
made us similar people.

1320
00:58:04,207 --> 00:58:05,487
- You think? - That makes sense.

1321
00:58:05,707 --> 00:58:07,076
- I think it happens. - Right.

1322
00:58:07,077 --> 00:58:08,476
(The Renters are gradually resembling each other.)

1323
00:58:08,477 --> 00:58:09,877
That really gave me chills.

1324
00:58:11,307 --> 00:58:14,076
I can't believe we're relaxing on an island like this.

1325
00:58:14,077 --> 00:58:15,775
(We're the only people in the middle of the island.)

1326
00:58:15,776 --> 00:58:18,286
In this forest that's on an island...

1327
00:58:18,287 --> 00:58:20,527
(In a forest on an island, we're resembling each other.)

1328
00:58:20,917 --> 00:58:23,287
- I am now really full. - I'm full now.

1329
00:58:23,356 --> 00:58:26,025
- Gosh, let's go to the house now. - My gosh.

1330
00:58:26,026 --> 00:58:27,057
Okay.

1331
00:58:27,597 --> 00:58:28,727
This is nice.

1332
00:58:29,356 --> 00:58:31,026
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1333
00:58:31,667 --> 00:58:36,336
(Bursting with excitement, they head to their fourth house.)

1334
00:58:37,236 --> 00:58:38,866
(Looking forward to the house in the center of the city)

1335
00:58:38,867 --> 00:58:41,577
- Is this your playlist, Dong Yeon? - No, it's Eun Woo's.

1336
00:58:42,077 --> 00:58:44,545
- I usually like country music. - Really?

1337
00:58:44,546 --> 00:58:46,853
(They can afford this luxury thanks to an Internet connection.)

1338
00:58:46,877 --> 00:58:48,016
All right.

1339
00:58:48,017 --> 00:58:49,346
Let's guess what the song is after hearing one second of it.

1340
00:58:49,347 --> 00:58:50,386
Okay.

1341
00:58:50,886 --> 00:58:52,186
The volume is too low, though.

1342
00:58:52,187 --> 00:58:54,393
(Having access to the Internet means upgrading the games they play.)

1343
00:58:54,417 --> 00:58:56,715
(Music playing)

1344
00:58:56,716 --> 00:58:58,155
I got it. "You Were Beautiful" by DAY6.

1345
00:58:58,156 --> 00:58:59,227
- Correct. - My gosh.

1346
00:58:59,687 --> 00:59:03,057
(Dong Yeon got it right after only hearing the guitar.)

1347
00:59:03,097 --> 00:59:04,627
I love this song.

1348
00:59:04,696 --> 00:59:07,367
This one's for Dong Hwi and Je Hoon.

1349
00:59:07,897 --> 00:59:11,005
We'll go with a song from the 2000s.

1350
00:59:11,006 --> 00:59:12,707
Gosh, that sounds good.

1351
00:59:18,046 --> 00:59:19,046
Wait.

1352
00:59:19,506 --> 00:59:20,816
"Playboy?"

1353
00:59:21,276 --> 00:59:22,917
I know what it is. "Playboy."

1354
00:59:23,276 --> 00:59:25,585
- Wrong. - I know. "I Don't Care" by 2NE1.

1355
00:59:25,586 --> 00:59:27,156
Correct.

1356
00:59:28,216 --> 00:59:29,216
No way.

1357
00:59:29,217 --> 00:59:30,885
(The older members are stunned.)

1358
00:59:30,886 --> 00:59:31,986
Dong Yeon is awesome.

1359
00:59:32,086 --> 00:59:33,627
- Next one. - Okay.

1360
00:59:35,656 --> 00:59:37,195
(I might die without you.)

1361
00:59:37,196 --> 00:59:38,327
I got it.

1362
00:59:38,497 --> 00:59:39,827
"I Might Die Without You."

1363
00:59:40,296 --> 00:59:42,997
- Wrong. - Haha and SKULL.

1364
00:59:43,336 --> 00:59:45,207
Haha did the narration.

1365
00:59:45,937 --> 00:59:47,037
But the title...

1366
00:59:47,577 --> 00:59:48,706
Gosh, it's Davichi's song.

1367
00:59:48,707 --> 00:59:50,206
- Gosh, you're right. - Goodness.

1368
00:59:50,207 --> 00:59:51,676
Dong Yeon really is...

1369
00:59:52,006 --> 00:59:53,246
a contemporary musician.

1370
00:59:53,247 --> 00:59:54,576
I can't remember its title.

1371
00:59:54,577 --> 00:59:56,417
- Me. "1818." - I can sing along, though.

1372
00:59:56,647 --> 00:59:58,017
- "8282?" - Wrong.

1373
00:59:58,147 --> 00:59:59,945
- It's not "8282." - Excuse me,

1374
00:59:59,946 --> 01:00:02,117
- but "1818" is like a swear word. - "1818."

1375
01:00:02,486 --> 01:00:04,425
- It sounds more like it. - "Darn it, darn it."

1376
01:00:04,426 --> 01:00:06,687
(Very flustered)

1377
01:00:07,897 --> 01:00:09,727
It's "Love and" something.

1378
01:00:10,026 --> 01:00:11,097
- Me. - Me.

1379
01:00:11,227 --> 01:00:12,425
- Me. - "Love and War."

1380
01:00:12,426 --> 01:00:13,896
- Correct. - Yes!

1381
01:00:13,897 --> 01:00:15,617
- I couldn't remember the title. - Davichi.

1382
01:00:17,606 --> 01:00:20,807
Oh, Haha featured this song?

1383
01:00:22,537 --> 01:00:23,775
(The Internet works so well in Rovaniemi.)

1384
01:00:23,776 --> 01:00:25,006
It's a nice song.

1385
01:00:25,906 --> 01:00:28,417
(It's good to be in a city.)

1386
01:00:28,647 --> 01:00:30,617
(Excited)

1387
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:34,186
(Driving all excitedly, )

1388
01:00:34,187 --> 01:00:36,815
(they have 10 minutes before arrival.)

1389
01:00:36,816 --> 01:00:38,385
We're arriving in ten minutes.

1390
01:00:38,386 --> 01:00:39,627
We're almost there.

1391
01:00:41,026 --> 01:00:43,326
(But then, )

1392
01:00:43,327 --> 01:00:45,667
(hold on a second.)

1393
01:00:45,796 --> 01:00:47,296
It's beginning.

1394
01:00:48,966 --> 01:00:51,436
I knew we'd meet some unpaved roads.

1395
01:00:51,437 --> 01:00:53,167
(An unpaved road in Rovaniemi?)

1396
01:00:53,906 --> 01:00:56,836
(Sensing something uneasy)

1397
01:00:58,247 --> 01:01:02,117
(Will they be betrayed by Rovaniemi?)

1398
01:01:02,176 --> 01:01:03,215
(Downtown)

1399
01:01:03,216 --> 01:01:08,457
(Compared to the big land, its downtown is very small.)

1400
01:01:09,417 --> 01:01:11,986
(Still, it's Rovaniemi.)

1401
01:01:12,057 --> 01:01:14,226
I hope it has a shower room.

1402
01:01:14,227 --> 01:01:16,626
- If then... - It's likely to have a boiler.

1403
01:01:16,627 --> 01:01:17,925
- Right. - Highly likely.

1404
01:01:17,926 --> 01:01:19,295
Would it have warm water available?

1405
01:01:19,296 --> 01:01:21,066
It's highly likely to have it.

1406
01:01:21,236 --> 01:01:23,295
I hope the toilet has a flushing system there.

1407
01:01:23,296 --> 01:01:24,906
Me too.

1408
01:01:25,937 --> 01:01:29,536
I saw a lot of pictures of children earlier.

1409
01:01:29,537 --> 01:01:30,847
- Children? - Yes.

1410
01:01:31,877 --> 01:01:34,647
Maybe they live with children. I'd like to see them.

1411
01:01:36,316 --> 01:01:38,917
I'm really bad with children.

1412
01:01:39,886 --> 01:01:42,216
I don't know what to do.

1413
01:01:42,756 --> 01:01:44,026
- Dong Yeon. - Yes?

1414
01:01:44,327 --> 01:01:47,327
Treat them like I treat you and Eun Woo.

1415
01:01:48,227 --> 01:01:50,096
- You mean, grill them? - No.

1416
01:01:50,097 --> 01:01:51,767
- And discipline them? - No.

1417
01:01:52,897 --> 01:01:54,096
Oh, when the cameras are off?

1418
01:01:54,097 --> 01:01:55,097
(It might've been better if he didn't say anything.)

1419
01:01:55,098 --> 01:01:56,866
- And punish them. - I'm sorry for the trouble.

1420
01:01:56,867 --> 01:01:58,166
(It's become his habit to tease the older member.)

1421
01:01:58,167 --> 01:01:59,307
But really...

1422
01:02:00,236 --> 01:02:02,406
Should I give you a tip?

1423
01:02:02,506 --> 01:02:03,706
(Interested)

1424
01:02:03,707 --> 01:02:04,976
Just smile and laugh.

1425
01:02:04,977 --> 01:02:06,376
(Just smile and laugh when you're with children.)

1426
01:02:06,377 --> 01:02:07,977
Whatever I do,

1427
01:02:08,147 --> 01:02:10,276
I laugh nonstop from start to finish.

1428
01:02:11,086 --> 01:02:13,886
(A bright face is the key.)

1429
01:02:14,057 --> 01:02:16,485
Then, they laugh along with you before you realize it.

1430
01:02:16,486 --> 01:02:17,627
- I see. - Yes.

1431
01:02:17,926 --> 01:02:19,326
Approach them with a smile on my face?

1432
01:02:19,327 --> 01:02:20,826
(That's a good lesson.)

1433
01:02:20,827 --> 01:02:22,667
(Approach children with a smile on your face.)

1434
01:02:22,696 --> 01:02:24,097
We're almost there.

1435
01:02:24,627 --> 01:02:26,027
- We're here. - I think it's there.

1436
01:02:26,966 --> 01:02:29,036
The road is totally unpaved.

1437
01:02:29,037 --> 01:02:31,937
(They're here at the fourth rented house.)

1438
01:02:32,767 --> 01:02:33,806
What on earth?

1439
01:02:33,807 --> 01:02:37,606
(Something seems strange.)

1440
01:02:38,406 --> 01:02:40,045
(They only see people by the lake, not the buildings.)

1441
01:02:40,046 --> 01:02:41,676
The lake is right nearby.

1442
01:02:42,676 --> 01:02:44,247
- What? - I don't see any buildings.

1443
01:02:44,816 --> 01:02:47,046
- What's going on? - What...

1444
01:02:47,287 --> 01:02:49,215
- Oh, my gosh. - I don't see any buildings.

1445
01:02:49,216 --> 01:02:50,416
Do we get out here?

1446
01:02:50,417 --> 01:02:51,726
(Feeling uneasy)

1447
01:02:51,727 --> 01:02:53,687
- What in the... No way. - What's going on?

1448
01:02:55,227 --> 01:02:56,295
Could it be another...

1449
01:02:56,296 --> 01:02:58,266
(Will they be isolated again?)

1450
01:02:58,267 --> 01:02:59,867
Should we get out to say hello?

1451
01:03:00,867 --> 01:03:01,896
Let's go.

1452
01:03:01,897 --> 01:03:03,266
(Are they the landlords?)

1453
01:03:03,267 --> 01:03:04,267
Hello.

1454
01:03:04,268 --> 01:03:05,505
- Hello. - Hello.

1455
01:03:05,506 --> 01:03:07,236
- Hi. - Hi.

1456
01:03:07,336 --> 01:03:08,675
- Hello. - Nice to meet you.

1457
01:03:08,676 --> 01:03:11,675
(They don't see any buildings, but they head to the dock first.)

1458
01:03:11,676 --> 01:03:13,346
- Welcome. Hi. - Beautiful.

1459
01:03:13,347 --> 01:03:15,146
- Hello. - My name is Yeon.

1460
01:03:15,147 --> 01:03:16,715
- Yeon, welcome. - I'm Jonni.

1461
01:03:16,716 --> 01:03:18,847
- Jonni. I'm Yeon. - Hello.

1462
01:03:19,517 --> 01:03:21,016
My name is Katja Kiuru.

1463
01:03:21,017 --> 01:03:23,355
I'm a psychotherapist,

1464
01:03:23,356 --> 01:03:25,886
a mother, and a horsewoman from Finland.

1465
01:03:26,656 --> 01:03:28,426
I live here with my husband.

1466
01:03:28,627 --> 01:03:29,796
I'm Jonni Kiuru.

1467
01:03:31,267 --> 01:03:35,195
(They also have adorable grandsons and granddaughters.)

1468
01:03:35,196 --> 01:03:38,906
(They're a big family full of love.)

1469
01:03:40,106 --> 01:03:42,036
I'd like them to feel the leisure and power of nature...

1470
01:03:42,037 --> 01:03:44,747
as well as small joy like children during their stay here.

1471
01:03:47,517 --> 01:03:52,787
(Welcome to the rented house of Katja and her big family.)

1472
01:03:52,986 --> 01:03:54,286
Katja and Jonni.

1473
01:03:54,287 --> 01:03:56,716
- Katja and Jonni. - Yes.

1474
01:03:57,457 --> 01:03:58,486
Welcome.

1475
01:03:58,957 --> 01:04:01,025
Is that your house?

1476
01:04:01,026 --> 01:04:02,026
Yes.

1477
01:04:02,597 --> 01:04:03,855
- Across the river? - Yes.

1478
01:04:03,856 --> 01:04:04,866
- My gosh. - Goodness.

1479
01:04:04,867 --> 01:04:06,266
(Rented house)

1480
01:04:06,267 --> 01:04:08,266
- Are we riding a boat there? - Yes.

1481
01:04:08,267 --> 01:04:09,436
(Current location)

1482
01:04:09,437 --> 01:04:11,006
It takes a boat ride to get there.

1483
01:04:11,106 --> 01:04:13,106
It's actually a lake.

1484
01:04:13,136 --> 01:04:15,006
- Yes, a lake. - Right.

1485
01:04:15,877 --> 01:04:18,906
(The unexpected situation makes them speechless.)

1486
01:04:19,406 --> 01:04:20,445
(Could it be...)

1487
01:04:20,446 --> 01:04:22,077
Do we have to go there by...

1488
01:04:23,377 --> 01:04:24,416
Rowing, yes.

1489
01:04:24,417 --> 01:04:26,287
- I see. - We actually have to row.

1490
01:04:26,316 --> 01:04:27,456
- I see. - Yes.

1491
01:04:27,457 --> 01:04:29,586
(The boats have no engines.)

1492
01:04:29,756 --> 01:04:30,786
Do you know how to row?

1493
01:04:30,787 --> 01:04:32,255
- Yes, sure. - Yes.

1494
01:04:32,256 --> 01:04:33,656
We're rowing masters.

1495
01:04:33,856 --> 01:04:37,096
Will you row yourselves? Or do you want us to...

1496
01:04:37,097 --> 01:04:38,127
- Well... - How many?

1497
01:04:38,227 --> 01:04:39,626
We can do it.

1498
01:04:39,627 --> 01:04:40,736
- Okay. - Yes.

1499
01:04:40,897 --> 01:04:42,795
(They say it with confidence, )

1500
01:04:42,796 --> 01:04:45,266
(but it's their first time rowing to travel a long distance.)

1501
01:04:45,267 --> 01:04:47,675
- Actually, we have a lot of stuff. - Yes, a lot.

1502
01:04:47,676 --> 01:04:49,506
- Okay. - We have to bring our luggage.

1503
01:04:49,977 --> 01:04:51,606
- Okay. - Just a moment, please.

1504
01:04:51,676 --> 01:04:54,005
- It might be quite heavy. - I hope we can bring it all.

1505
01:04:54,006 --> 01:04:55,752
(Will they be able to bring all their stuff?)

1506
01:04:55,776 --> 01:04:57,016
Right. It might be quite heavy.

1507
01:04:57,017 --> 01:04:58,216
(A whole load of stuff)

1508
01:04:58,247 --> 01:05:00,917
I wonder if we can bring our luggage...

1509
01:05:01,557 --> 01:05:02,855
and the groceries we bought.

1510
01:05:02,856 --> 01:05:05,127
(Backpacks and even a suitcase)

1511
01:05:06,057 --> 01:05:08,695
It's our first time leaving our car behind.

1512
01:05:08,696 --> 01:05:10,655
We ride boats so many times.

1513
01:05:10,656 --> 01:05:12,796
- Goodness. - It's a boat day today.

1514
01:05:13,066 --> 01:05:14,096
A boat day.

1515
01:05:14,097 --> 01:05:16,367
We're riding a boat to our lodging.

1516
01:05:18,707 --> 01:05:19,707
Okay.

1517
01:05:19,708 --> 01:05:24,877
(Loading the boats first)

1518
01:05:25,176 --> 01:05:26,576
(Swaying)

1519
01:05:26,577 --> 01:05:28,516
Sit down against the suitcase.

1520
01:05:28,517 --> 01:05:29,846
Sit down here.

1521
01:05:29,847 --> 01:05:31,417
(They get aboard one after another.)

1522
01:05:32,247 --> 01:05:33,347
(The remaining people...)

1523
01:05:33,946 --> 01:05:37,086
I guess the last ones have to push the boats.

1524
01:05:37,526 --> 01:05:39,086
Push us a little bit.

1525
01:05:39,227 --> 01:05:40,727
Push out and jump in.

1526
01:05:40,856 --> 01:05:41,926
Okay.

1527
01:05:42,097 --> 01:05:44,597
We have to push and jump in.

1528
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:46,626
- Jump big. - All right.

1529
01:05:46,627 --> 01:05:47,667
I'll go.

1530
01:05:48,367 --> 01:05:50,396
(Pushing the boat first)

1531
01:05:50,397 --> 01:05:51,936
And then, jump in.

1532
01:05:51,937 --> 01:05:52,937
Jump in.

1533
01:05:52,938 --> 01:05:54,405
(He pushes the boat first and jumps in!)

1534
01:05:54,406 --> 01:05:55,477
Sorry.

1535
01:05:57,106 --> 01:05:58,576
(What a fussy jump.)

1536
01:05:58,577 --> 01:06:01,215
Je Hoon, I'm scared.

1537
01:06:01,216 --> 01:06:03,747
Okay, wait. I'll help you.

1538
01:06:05,187 --> 01:06:06,786
(Meanwhile, Dong Yeon, the man of nature, )

1539
01:06:06,787 --> 01:06:08,517
(jumps lightly.)

1540
01:06:09,156 --> 01:06:13,356
(He's got the most experience of boat-riding indeed.)

1541
01:06:14,057 --> 01:06:15,997
We should go that way, right?

1542
01:06:16,227 --> 01:06:17,565
We have to go that way, right?

1543
01:06:17,566 --> 01:06:19,195
Yes, we're going that way.

1544
01:06:19,196 --> 01:06:21,635
And now, we'll start rowing...

1545
01:06:21,636 --> 01:06:23,966
like this. Backward.

1546
01:06:24,606 --> 01:06:26,566
(Clumsy)

1547
01:06:27,437 --> 01:06:30,276
Like that. At the same time.

1548
01:06:30,577 --> 01:06:33,276
Row at the same time.

1549
01:06:34,377 --> 01:06:36,116
- There you go. - Exactly.

1550
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:37,647
Yes, exactly.

1551
01:06:38,147 --> 01:06:39,546
Let's go, Je Hoon.

1552
01:06:40,187 --> 01:06:41,885
It's quite heavy. You need to be...

1553
01:06:41,886 --> 01:06:43,216
I used to do it with someone.

1554
01:06:44,557 --> 01:06:46,856
It's a bit hard to do it alone.

1555
01:06:47,827 --> 01:06:49,296
Use that one more.

1556
01:06:50,097 --> 01:06:51,697
She's telling you to row this side more.

1557
01:06:52,227 --> 01:06:53,766
No, the other way.

1558
01:06:53,767 --> 01:06:55,296
(He's rowing the opposite way.)

1559
01:06:56,597 --> 01:06:57,635
Yes.

1560
01:06:57,636 --> 01:06:59,105
No, we need to go that way.

1561
01:06:59,106 --> 01:07:00,635
Je Hoon, we have to go that way.

1562
01:07:00,636 --> 01:07:02,536
(They're going the opposite way from the destination.)

1563
01:07:02,537 --> 01:07:04,077
- Sorry. - No problem.

1564
01:07:06,207 --> 01:07:07,376
- Yes. - Can you...

1565
01:07:07,377 --> 01:07:11,086
(He's faced with the biggest crisis in the world.)

1566
01:07:12,316 --> 01:07:13,985
Can you see how he's doing?

1567
01:07:13,986 --> 01:07:15,085
Like Dong Yeon.

1568
01:07:15,086 --> 01:07:16,617
Dong Yeon, you're so good.

1569
01:07:17,086 --> 01:07:18,687
You know I've done this many times.

1570
01:07:20,426 --> 01:07:23,796
(Quite relaxed)

1571
01:07:24,597 --> 01:07:26,127
This is actually my...

1572
01:07:26,296 --> 01:07:29,465
Maybe 3rd or 4th time rowing a boat.

1573
01:07:29,466 --> 01:07:31,736
- Okay. - I feel like I'm getting better.

1574
01:07:32,207 --> 01:07:34,636
Yes, you're doing okay.

1575
01:07:35,537 --> 01:07:37,545
(The man of nature is quickly improving.)

1576
01:07:37,546 --> 01:07:39,406
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1577
01:07:39,477 --> 01:07:40,506
Nice.

1578
01:07:41,546 --> 01:07:42,816
Good.

1579
01:07:43,347 --> 01:07:44,646
Je Hoon, good.

1580
01:07:44,647 --> 01:07:46,567
(Putting the expectations about Rovaniemi aside)

1581
01:07:47,046 --> 01:07:48,916
(No matter how remote it was, )

1582
01:07:48,917 --> 01:07:55,127
(there were roads to a rented house.)

1583
01:07:57,397 --> 01:08:00,465
(Instead of unpaved roads, )

1584
01:08:00,466 --> 01:08:04,267
(they're taking a waterway this time.)

1585
01:08:04,667 --> 01:08:06,036
If you use that one...

1586
01:08:06,037 --> 01:08:08,906
Je Hoon, you need to use this row.

1587
01:08:09,776 --> 01:08:11,647
- Again. - Again?

1588
01:08:12,406 --> 01:08:13,406
Again.

1589
01:08:13,776 --> 01:08:15,377
Only the left one.

1590
01:08:16,247 --> 01:08:18,145
Just the left one.

1591
01:08:18,146 --> 01:08:20,316
- Don't use the right one. - Again.

1592
01:08:20,686 --> 01:08:22,556
Again. Good.

1593
01:08:24,927 --> 01:08:27,797
- And now, both. - Now, both of them.

1594
01:08:28,127 --> 01:08:29,127
Yes.

1595
01:08:29,128 --> 01:08:30,968
(Rowing a boat is harder than driving a taxi.)

1596
01:08:31,427 --> 01:08:33,566
- Let's go. - Now, only the left one.

1597
01:08:34,736 --> 01:08:36,167
- Only the left one. - Left.

1598
01:08:37,167 --> 01:08:38,605
Left. Now, both.

1599
01:08:38,606 --> 01:08:39,636
- Now, both. - Both.

1600
01:08:39,637 --> 01:08:40,717
(Gas stove, refrigerator, )

1601
01:08:41,106 --> 01:08:42,106
(boiler, hot water)

1602
01:08:42,236 --> 01:08:43,236
Good.

1603
01:08:43,237 --> 01:08:45,877
(Civilization, please welcome me at the end of this ride.)

1604
01:08:46,976 --> 01:08:48,217
It's pretty far.

1605
01:08:52,287 --> 01:08:55,815
So you have to cross the lake like this...

1606
01:08:55,816 --> 01:08:57,217
when you want to go out?

1607
01:08:58,186 --> 01:08:59,827
Yes, mostly.

1608
01:08:59,957 --> 01:09:01,327
Really?

1609
01:09:02,526 --> 01:09:04,996
But in winter, it freezes.

1610
01:09:04,997 --> 01:09:07,896
- I see. - We don't need a boat, then.

1611
01:09:08,797 --> 01:09:11,105
It gets easy.

1612
01:09:11,106 --> 01:09:12,306
I see.

1613
01:09:15,577 --> 01:09:17,475
Isn't it a beautiful lake?

1614
01:09:17,476 --> 01:09:19,206
Yes, definitely.

1615
01:09:19,207 --> 01:09:20,377
It's very beautiful.

1616
01:09:21,846 --> 01:09:23,775
I think this lake is really big.

1617
01:09:23,776 --> 01:09:26,217
Yes, it's 11km long.

1618
01:09:26,986 --> 01:09:29,485
It seems like a river, but it's a lake.

1619
01:09:29,486 --> 01:09:30,486
Right.

1620
01:09:30,816 --> 01:09:32,056
(Glancing)

1621
01:09:32,257 --> 01:09:33,985
Je Hoon, should we switch?

1622
01:09:33,986 --> 01:09:35,156
Should we?

1623
01:09:35,457 --> 01:09:36,497
Can we change?

1624
01:09:36,627 --> 01:09:38,296
Okay, yes.

1625
01:09:38,297 --> 01:09:40,497
- Never stand up. - All right.

1626
01:09:40,867 --> 01:09:42,066
Without standing up.

1627
01:09:42,266 --> 01:09:43,896
- Okay. - Move this way.

1628
01:09:44,167 --> 01:09:45,167
I got it.

1629
01:09:45,707 --> 01:09:46,805
Let me...

1630
01:09:46,806 --> 01:09:51,246
(The Renters listen to her well.)

1631
01:09:51,247 --> 01:09:52,276
Great.

1632
01:09:53,406 --> 01:09:54,476
Okay.

1633
01:09:55,316 --> 01:09:56,376
Was it heavy?

1634
01:09:56,377 --> 01:09:58,046
(Sighing)

1635
01:09:58,047 --> 01:09:59,345
I'm such a terrible driver.

1636
01:09:59,346 --> 01:10:00,846
(He's supposed to be a model driver.)

1637
01:10:00,986 --> 01:10:02,556
Dong Yeon, you're good.

1638
01:10:02,717 --> 01:10:03,786
Okay.

1639
01:10:03,787 --> 01:10:04,827
You're good.

1640
01:10:05,726 --> 01:10:06,787
Take it slow.

1641
01:10:07,087 --> 01:10:08,226
Let's just go safely.

1642
01:10:10,497 --> 01:10:11,803
Dong Yeon, tell me if you're tired.

1643
01:10:11,827 --> 01:10:13,026
- We're almost there. - Okay.

1644
01:10:13,367 --> 01:10:14,436
Thank you.

1645
01:10:17,667 --> 01:10:20,167
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

1646
01:10:21,236 --> 01:10:22,337
I'm totally...

1647
01:10:22,537 --> 01:10:24,006
You're totally fine.

1648
01:10:24,007 --> 01:10:25,007
- Fine. - Over there.

1649
01:10:25,008 --> 01:10:26,577
(Giving all his might)

1650
01:10:26,806 --> 01:10:27,877
- Hey. - Hey.

1651
01:10:28,717 --> 01:10:29,776
Hello.

1652
01:10:30,446 --> 01:10:32,946
- Okay. - That's my daughter.

1653
01:10:33,117 --> 01:10:34,516
Oh, is she your daughter?

1654
01:10:34,917 --> 01:10:35,957
My gosh.

1655
01:10:36,087 --> 01:10:37,515
- Hello. - Hi.

1656
01:10:37,516 --> 01:10:38,855
(Jenna, their eldest daughter, is out to welcome the Renters.)

1657
01:10:38,856 --> 01:10:40,226
Thank you.

1658
01:10:40,327 --> 01:10:43,126
(They safely arrive at their destination.)

1659
01:10:43,127 --> 01:10:46,297
- We've arrived alive. - Thank you.

1660
01:10:46,667 --> 01:10:48,566
Welcome to our home.

1661
01:10:50,396 --> 01:10:52,366
- This is a sauna. - A sauna?

1662
01:10:52,367 --> 01:10:53,506
- Yes. - A sauna?

1663
01:10:53,507 --> 01:10:55,137
- This is a sauna? - This is a sauna.

1664
01:10:56,806 --> 01:10:59,006
(In front of the open lake, )

1665
01:10:59,007 --> 01:11:02,916
(the sauna building stands like a gatekeeper.)

1666
01:11:02,917 --> 01:11:03,917
It's big.

1667
01:11:05,417 --> 01:11:07,416
(Each family has a sauna at home.)

1668
01:11:07,417 --> 01:11:09,386
(It's the most loved place for people in Lapland.)

1669
01:11:09,387 --> 01:11:10,616
There's a sauna.

1670
01:11:10,617 --> 01:11:12,025
- My gosh. - Oh, yes.

1671
01:11:12,026 --> 01:11:15,927
(They can share warm conversations with their family members...)

1672
01:11:16,726 --> 01:11:19,696
(at the end of each day.)

1673
01:11:21,497 --> 01:11:23,095
It's a dressing room.

1674
01:11:23,096 --> 01:11:25,966
(A cozy place to embrace their exhausted bodies and souls)

1675
01:11:25,967 --> 01:11:27,037
It's nice here too.

1676
01:11:27,106 --> 01:11:28,206
It has a second floor.

1677
01:11:28,207 --> 01:11:30,337
You can eat and sleep up there if you want.

1678
01:11:30,537 --> 01:11:31,806
- I see. - My gosh.

1679
01:11:33,077 --> 01:11:36,546
(This place is full of warmth.)

1680
01:11:36,547 --> 01:11:37,916
This is actually...

1681
01:11:37,917 --> 01:11:40,016
my favorite place in the world.

1682
01:11:40,486 --> 01:11:41,486
Here.

1683
01:11:42,287 --> 01:11:46,026
All the Finnish people we've met before...

1684
01:11:46,486 --> 01:11:47,927
have said the same.

1685
01:11:48,457 --> 01:11:50,456
"A sauna is my favorite."

1686
01:11:50,457 --> 01:11:52,196
It's our favorite. But it is.

1687
01:11:53,327 --> 01:11:56,396
But it's one of the things that make us happy.

1688
01:11:57,167 --> 01:11:58,466
- Why not? - Why not?

1689
01:11:58,467 --> 01:11:59,935
Everybody says the same.

1690
01:11:59,936 --> 01:12:00,936
(Maybe the secret to being the happiest country...)

1691
01:12:00,937 --> 01:12:02,217
(is to enjoy a sauna every day.)

1692
01:12:03,806 --> 01:12:06,677
- Okay. It's time to go up. - Goodness.

1693
01:12:06,906 --> 01:12:08,116
- Yes. - Okay.

1694
01:12:08,117 --> 01:12:09,117
Let's go.

1695
01:12:10,446 --> 01:12:11,486
What on earth?

1696
01:12:14,316 --> 01:12:16,816
(Other family members welcome them.)

1697
01:12:19,427 --> 01:12:22,257
(They're so adorable.)

1698
01:12:24,196 --> 01:12:26,095
- The big one is Hemmu. - Hemmu?

1699
01:12:26,096 --> 01:12:28,765
He's ten months old.

1700
01:12:28,766 --> 01:12:31,336
- He's a baby dog. - He's a puppy.

1701
01:12:31,337 --> 01:12:35,077
He's a water rescue dog. So maybe if you go swimming...

1702
01:12:35,377 --> 01:12:36,435
Okay.

1703
01:12:36,436 --> 01:12:38,006
- She's Thanos. - Thanos?

1704
01:12:38,007 --> 01:12:40,006
- The name may sound familiar. - Yes.

1705
01:12:40,007 --> 01:12:42,345
She's a female, but her name is Thanos.

1706
01:12:42,346 --> 01:12:44,217
(There's a story behind her name.)

1707
01:12:45,287 --> 01:12:46,515
(Going up a bit more)

1708
01:12:46,516 --> 01:12:49,386
You have horses?

1709
01:12:49,387 --> 01:12:50,756
- Yes. - There are horses too.

1710
01:12:50,757 --> 01:12:52,026
What beautiful horses.

1711
01:12:52,627 --> 01:12:53,685
(They have as many as 7 Finnish horses.)

1712
01:12:53,686 --> 01:12:55,096
They have a lot of horses.

1713
01:12:55,556 --> 01:12:57,055
There are several.

1714
01:12:57,056 --> 01:12:58,065
- Goodness. - What the...

1715
01:12:58,066 --> 01:13:00,296
(Welcome. Is it your first time seeing Finnish horses?)

1716
01:13:00,297 --> 01:13:02,095
They look so fine.

1717
01:13:02,096 --> 01:13:05,136
They're different from the ones that Hanna brought.

1718
01:13:05,137 --> 01:13:06,236
- The donkeys. - Right.

1719
01:13:06,306 --> 01:13:07,905
They're different from those donkeys.

1720
01:13:07,906 --> 01:13:09,106
(The only horses they've seen)

1721
01:13:09,476 --> 01:13:10,577
They're Finnish horses.

1722
01:13:10,776 --> 01:13:12,046
- They're the Finnish breed. - Really?

1723
01:13:12,047 --> 01:13:13,845
- I guess so. - Her name is Monica.

1724
01:13:13,846 --> 01:13:15,546
- Monica? - Monica.

1725
01:13:15,547 --> 01:13:17,945
- Monica. - She's a Finnish breed.

1726
01:13:17,946 --> 01:13:19,917
- Finnish. - A national breed.

1727
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:22,786
So this is what Finnish horses look like.

1728
01:13:22,787 --> 01:13:24,492
(The youngest members seem very much interested.)

1729
01:13:24,516 --> 01:13:27,127
If I could have a chance, I want to try...

1730
01:13:28,526 --> 01:13:29,895
- horse riding. - You want to ride it?

1731
01:13:29,896 --> 01:13:30,896
- Yes. - Okay.

1732
01:13:30,897 --> 01:13:32,565
- It's possible. - My gosh.

1733
01:13:32,566 --> 01:13:35,166
If you want to, it's possible.

1734
01:13:35,167 --> 01:13:38,435
But maybe you want to see where you'll be sleeping.

1735
01:13:38,436 --> 01:13:39,866
- Yes. - Yes, I want to.

1736
01:13:39,867 --> 01:13:41,906
- And maybe get some rest. - Yes.

1737
01:13:42,377 --> 01:13:44,206
Follow me. I'll show you.

1738
01:13:44,207 --> 01:13:45,376
- Okay. - How exciting.

1739
01:13:45,377 --> 01:13:47,452
(They haven't given up on their hopes for civilization.)

1740
01:13:47,476 --> 01:13:48,945
- Hi. - Hello.

1741
01:13:48,946 --> 01:13:51,145
- Hello. - Hello.

1742
01:13:51,146 --> 01:13:52,146
Hello.

1743
01:13:53,217 --> 01:13:54,416
- My gosh. - She's Vera, my younger daughter.

1744
01:13:54,417 --> 01:13:55,616
- Vera. - And that's her daughter,

1745
01:13:55,617 --> 01:13:56,756
- Lampi. - Nice to meet you.

1746
01:13:56,757 --> 01:13:57,887
Lampi, say hello.

1747
01:13:58,526 --> 01:14:00,185
(She's still shy.)

1748
01:14:00,186 --> 01:14:01,827
- Lampi. - She's a bit shy.

1749
01:14:02,757 --> 01:14:03,856
Aders.

1750
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:06,195
- Hello. - Hello.

1751
01:14:06,196 --> 01:14:07,196
Hello.

1752
01:14:07,867 --> 01:14:08,867
Welcome.

1753
01:14:09,196 --> 01:14:11,037
(Whispering)

1754
01:14:11,967 --> 01:14:14,167
(Is he looking at me?)

1755
01:14:15,806 --> 01:14:17,946
He was admiring your knife.

1756
01:14:18,677 --> 01:14:20,046
(Has he gained the child's favor?)

1757
01:14:20,047 --> 01:14:21,106
You want to see?

1758
01:14:21,547 --> 01:14:23,047
(It's all right.)

1759
01:14:24,516 --> 01:14:25,786
Just smile and laugh.

1760
01:14:25,787 --> 01:14:27,122
(He's learned this tip from Dong Hwi.)

1761
01:14:27,146 --> 01:14:28,155
No?

1762
01:14:28,156 --> 01:14:29,486
(Laughing)

1763
01:14:29,887 --> 01:14:31,555
(They can't even...)

1764
01:14:31,556 --> 01:14:33,726
(make eye contact as it's their first encounter.)

1765
01:14:33,927 --> 01:14:35,326
- Maybe later. - Yes.

1766
01:14:35,327 --> 01:14:36,327
(Let's hope they'll get along.)

1767
01:14:36,328 --> 01:14:38,166
Okay. Are we ready to go inside?

1768
01:14:38,167 --> 01:14:39,667
- Yes. - Perfect.

1769
01:14:40,066 --> 01:14:41,667
Mom, can you hold her for me?

1770
01:14:43,297 --> 01:14:44,967
(Leave me be.)

1771
01:14:45,367 --> 01:14:47,036
- "Leave me be." - "Leave me be."

1772
01:14:47,037 --> 01:14:48,176
- "Leave me be." - "Leave me be."

1773
01:14:48,177 --> 01:14:49,605
"No, I'm not going in."

1774
01:14:49,606 --> 01:14:50,853
(Will they get to get along with the children?)

1775
01:14:50,877 --> 01:14:53,775
From the way it looks,

1776
01:14:53,776 --> 01:14:55,345
- it's like... - It seems no different.

1777
01:14:55,346 --> 01:14:56,516
It's similar.

1778
01:14:57,516 --> 01:14:59,216
(Please have electricity, water supply, and the Internet.)

1779
01:14:59,217 --> 01:15:01,287
So, here's the entrance.

1780
01:15:01,686 --> 01:15:03,417
Oh, we have to take off our shoes here.

1781
01:15:07,686 --> 01:15:08,757
Please come in.

1782
01:15:11,766 --> 01:15:12,896
There's a television.

1783
01:15:13,896 --> 01:15:15,235
(What's all this?)

1784
01:15:15,236 --> 01:15:16,337
There's a television.

1785
01:15:17,396 --> 01:15:23,007
(Full of various electronics and modern civilized goods)

1786
01:15:23,577 --> 01:15:24,646
(His jaw drops.)

1787
01:15:24,846 --> 01:15:26,076
(It's been such a long time for them to meet modern civilization.)

1788
01:15:26,077 --> 01:15:27,246
- There's a television. - This is...

1789
01:15:27,247 --> 01:15:28,816
You have electronics...

1790
01:15:29,377 --> 01:15:30,716
- here. - Yes.

1791
01:15:30,717 --> 01:15:31,816
(What's with these people?)

1792
01:15:33,217 --> 01:15:36,456
This is an old traditional Finnish house.

1793
01:15:36,457 --> 01:15:37,887
(They can't hear anything.)

1794
01:15:38,026 --> 01:15:39,363
- There's an air conditioner too. - Yes.

1795
01:15:39,387 --> 01:15:41,156
They have a game console.

1796
01:15:42,627 --> 01:15:43,895
- They have everything. - Okay.

1797
01:15:43,896 --> 01:15:45,725
You also have Wi-Fi here.

1798
01:15:45,726 --> 01:15:47,595
- Yes. - They have Wi-Fi.

1799
01:15:47,596 --> 01:15:48,636
(They can't believe it.)

1800
01:15:48,637 --> 01:15:49,967
(Excited)

1801
01:15:50,066 --> 01:15:51,195
Oh, my gosh.

1802
01:15:51,196 --> 01:15:52,266
Guys.

1803
01:15:53,207 --> 01:15:54,236
Oh, my.

1804
01:15:55,406 --> 01:15:56,836
(What's all this?)

1805
01:15:56,837 --> 01:15:57,936
Yes, it's...

1806
01:15:58,007 --> 01:15:59,106
What is...

1807
01:16:02,077 --> 01:16:04,016
They have a fridge this huge.

1808
01:16:05,217 --> 01:16:06,316
Is it a refrigerator?

1809
01:16:06,516 --> 01:16:08,685
- Yes, it is. - Goodness.

1810
01:16:08,686 --> 01:16:09,756
(They're shocked to see a built-in fridge.)

1811
01:16:09,757 --> 01:16:10,757
It's awesome.

1812
01:16:11,457 --> 01:16:13,257
We have...

1813
01:16:13,827 --> 01:16:15,055
- Thank you. - Yes.

1814
01:16:15,056 --> 01:16:16,225
Thank you so much.

1815
01:16:16,226 --> 01:16:17,927
- An oven. - There's an oven.

1816
01:16:18,627 --> 01:16:20,966
You can also make...

1817
01:16:20,967 --> 01:16:22,887
- It's an induction stove. - An induction stove.

1818
01:16:24,867 --> 01:16:27,506
(No more fire issues...)

1819
01:16:27,507 --> 01:16:30,436
(and poorly-made brazier issues!)

1820
01:16:31,577 --> 01:16:35,877
(A pleasant and convenient electronic induction stove)

1821
01:16:36,617 --> 01:16:39,986
(A sink for the first time in Lapland)

1822
01:16:41,117 --> 01:16:43,315
(It's taken them so much to meet an ordinary life again.)

1823
01:16:43,316 --> 01:16:44,316
It's unbelievable.

1824
01:16:44,317 --> 01:16:46,686
I've never seen anybody so happy about the kitchen.

1825
01:16:47,587 --> 01:16:49,996
It's because our last stay...

1826
01:16:49,997 --> 01:16:52,867
They had...

1827
01:16:53,127 --> 01:16:54,297
Gosh, I can't even speak.

1828
01:16:54,427 --> 01:16:57,136
We had to make a fire to cook.

1829
01:16:57,137 --> 01:16:58,866
- Only fire. - Only fire.

1830
01:16:58,867 --> 01:16:59,966
I see.

1831
01:16:59,967 --> 01:17:03,006
- This is crazy. - Everything over here is for you.

1832
01:17:03,007 --> 01:17:05,747
(They realize how precious an ordinary life is.)

1833
01:17:06,406 --> 01:17:08,775
(Could there be...)

1834
01:17:08,776 --> 01:17:10,516
It'll be perfect...

1835
01:17:10,877 --> 01:17:13,287
if they have a decent bathroom.

1836
01:17:13,986 --> 01:17:16,516
(They had better rented houses, )

1837
01:17:17,516 --> 01:17:21,056
(but the bathroom was always traditional.)

1838
01:17:21,186 --> 01:17:22,297
Yes, that's the toilet.

1839
01:17:22,957 --> 01:17:24,026
Please.

1840
01:17:24,127 --> 01:17:25,466
- Should I open it? - Yes.

1841
01:17:25,467 --> 01:17:27,227
(They're grateful enough that it's indoors.)

1842
01:17:28,766 --> 01:17:31,195
(Make some noise!)

1843
01:17:31,196 --> 01:17:32,467
- Oh, my gosh. - Guys.

1844
01:17:33,766 --> 01:17:37,306
(It's a long-wanted toilet bowl.)

1845
01:17:38,507 --> 01:17:40,577
(A basin with good water pressure)

1846
01:17:41,446 --> 01:17:42,475
(And a shower that they've longed so much for)

1847
01:17:42,476 --> 01:17:43,646
No way.

1848
01:17:45,247 --> 01:17:46,717
- Oh, my gosh. - It's perfect.

1849
01:17:47,287 --> 01:17:48,316
This is over.

1850
01:17:48,717 --> 01:17:51,355
I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying here.

1851
01:17:51,356 --> 01:17:52,716
(Getting emotional and choking up)

1852
01:17:53,526 --> 01:17:54,627
Oh, my gosh.

1853
01:17:55,356 --> 01:17:57,496
(She's taken aback to see these weird Renters.)

1854
01:17:57,497 --> 01:17:59,167
- Shower... - Don't cry.

1855
01:17:59,467 --> 01:18:01,026
- Goodness. - A flush toilet.

1856
01:18:01,467 --> 01:18:04,696
We've taken a shower at the lakes for four days.

1857
01:18:05,806 --> 01:18:06,806
This is...

1858
01:18:06,807 --> 01:18:07,866
(She deeply understands.)

1859
01:18:07,867 --> 01:18:09,306
- This is over. - Okay.

1860
01:18:09,707 --> 01:18:11,036
(Thank you.)

1861
01:18:11,037 --> 01:18:12,446
- Thank you. - That's good.

1862
01:18:12,846 --> 01:18:16,945
We have two bedrooms prepared for you.

1863
01:18:16,946 --> 01:18:19,246
- You can decide which one to use. - Can we see?

1864
01:18:19,247 --> 01:18:20,445
Is she saying there's one more?

1865
01:18:20,446 --> 01:18:22,457
No, there are two bedrooms.

1866
01:18:22,856 --> 01:18:25,126
- Upstairs. - Upstairs?

1867
01:18:25,127 --> 01:18:26,286
Yes.

1868
01:18:26,287 --> 01:18:27,485
(Before we go upstairs, let me tell you something.)

1869
01:18:27,486 --> 01:18:28,626
In there...

1870
01:18:28,627 --> 01:18:30,595
behind the back doors is our private space.

1871
01:18:30,596 --> 01:18:32,225
- Okay. - Our private place.

1872
01:18:32,226 --> 01:18:33,327
- All right. - So...

1873
01:18:33,726 --> 01:18:35,436
There's a bedroom on the second floor.

1874
01:18:35,637 --> 01:18:38,337
- Here is... - It smells nice.

1875
01:18:39,406 --> 01:18:41,137
She lit an aromatic candle.

1876
01:18:41,236 --> 01:18:43,707
(Dong Hwi is like a fish in water.)

1877
01:18:44,106 --> 01:18:45,275
(Amazed)

1878
01:18:45,276 --> 01:18:47,047
Here, you have...

1879
01:18:48,417 --> 01:18:50,976
three beds. You can decide...

1880
01:18:52,747 --> 01:18:53,985
- My gosh. - Goodness.

1881
01:18:53,986 --> 01:18:57,055
(This adorable attic is Lampi's favorite place.)

1882
01:18:57,056 --> 01:18:59,225
It's like an attic in a cabin...

1883
01:18:59,226 --> 01:19:01,927
- that you see in fairy tales. - I know, right?

1884
01:19:02,327 --> 01:19:05,266
Then, if it's too hot, you can open the window.

1885
01:19:05,566 --> 01:19:08,066
- It's very beautiful. - There's a mosquito screen.

1886
01:19:08,367 --> 01:19:09,696
There's a screen on the window.

1887
01:19:11,096 --> 01:19:14,236
(Is their struggle with the fly swatter over now?)

1888
01:19:14,367 --> 01:19:17,236
(The guy in charge of the fly swatter is the most excited.)

1889
01:19:17,276 --> 01:19:20,707
You can have... One can sleep here or two.

1890
01:19:20,806 --> 01:19:22,816
Oh, now, I'm speechless.

1891
01:19:23,217 --> 01:19:24,747
Speechless. Okay.

1892
01:19:25,587 --> 01:19:27,746
You're welcome. And welcome to our home.

1893
01:19:27,747 --> 01:19:29,316
- Yes. - Thank you.

1894
01:19:29,457 --> 01:19:31,387
Let's go downstairs. My gosh.

1895
01:19:31,787 --> 01:19:35,095
- Then, since there are four of us, - Good.

1896
01:19:35,096 --> 01:19:37,526
How about one person sleep downstairs...

1897
01:19:37,696 --> 01:19:40,525
- and three... Yes. - Wherever is fine here.

1898
01:19:40,526 --> 01:19:43,136
- Let's decide with a game later. - Yes, we should do something.

1899
01:19:43,137 --> 01:19:44,565
- All right. - Yes.

1900
01:19:44,566 --> 01:19:46,306
- Watch your heads. - Watch your heads.

1901
01:19:47,667 --> 01:19:50,605
(When they open the 2nd-floor window, )

1902
01:19:50,606 --> 01:19:54,377
(kids are running and playing outside.)

1903
01:19:54,877 --> 01:19:56,945
(Hi, Uncle!)

1904
01:19:56,946 --> 01:19:58,217
Are you looking at me?

1905
01:20:03,056 --> 01:20:05,386
(A peaceful front yard...)

1906
01:20:05,387 --> 01:20:10,457
(where kids, dogs, and horses run and play)

1907
01:20:11,026 --> 01:20:14,696
(Uncles, come on down.)

1908
01:20:15,066 --> 01:20:16,195
(A rented room that feels like it's from a fairy tale)

1909
01:20:16,196 --> 01:20:17,695
My fantasy of living in a two-story house...

1910
01:20:17,696 --> 01:20:19,036
is coming true here.

1911
01:20:19,037 --> 01:20:22,076
(Surrounded by the forest and lake where you can find your inner child)

1912
01:20:22,077 --> 01:20:23,136
Let's go down.

1913
01:20:23,137 --> 01:20:25,877
(Let's go down to the yard too.)

1914
01:20:26,707 --> 01:20:32,946
(It's bustling but not noisy.)

1915
01:20:34,747 --> 01:20:37,685
(They are so immersed in the peaceful vibe...)

1916
01:20:37,686 --> 01:20:41,587
(of the big family's house.)

1917
01:20:41,957 --> 01:20:44,096
The horses look so nicely brushed.

1918
01:20:44,726 --> 01:20:47,296
- They must always brush them. - Right.

1919
01:20:47,297 --> 01:20:49,137
(This place, where even the horses seem happy)

1920
01:20:52,167 --> 01:20:53,967
I haven't played with this in years.

1921
01:20:54,037 --> 01:20:57,507
I think it's my first time throwing one since elementary school.

1922
01:21:00,306 --> 01:21:01,476
I'm sorry.

1923
01:21:02,047 --> 01:21:03,916
(Let's play together.)

1924
01:21:03,917 --> 01:21:05,087
He's saying it's his.

1925
01:21:07,787 --> 01:21:09,355
(Ten-month-old Hemmu is pretty possessive.)

1926
01:21:09,356 --> 01:21:10,617
He's fighting with a dog.

1927
01:21:10,957 --> 01:21:13,586
He won't give it up.

1928
01:21:13,587 --> 01:21:14,856
(It's mine!)

1929
01:21:15,427 --> 01:21:16,725
- He wants it. - Do you want to play?

1930
01:21:16,726 --> 01:21:18,695
(Hemmu wants to play together.)

1931
01:21:18,696 --> 01:21:19,895
(Me too!)

1932
01:21:19,896 --> 01:21:21,096
She's joining in too.

1933
01:21:22,537 --> 01:21:23,667
Here it comes.

1934
01:21:26,606 --> 01:21:28,536
She knows how to control people.

1935
01:21:28,537 --> 01:21:30,077
Yes.

1936
01:21:30,577 --> 01:21:32,576
She's being kind and waiting.

1937
01:21:32,577 --> 01:21:35,547
(That vibe of running around and having fun with friends as a child)

1938
01:21:38,387 --> 01:21:40,216
The dogs like the Frisbee.

1939
01:21:40,217 --> 01:21:42,656
(It's my toy!)

1940
01:21:43,316 --> 01:21:46,055
(They don't even care about the Frisbee.)

1941
01:21:46,056 --> 01:21:47,726
- They're fighting. - The two of them.

1942
01:21:48,026 --> 01:21:49,797
- It ended up in my hand. - Right.

1943
01:21:50,156 --> 01:21:51,596
Gosh, this is fun.

1944
01:21:52,726 --> 01:21:53,796
(As they run and play, it's 5pm.)

1945
01:21:53,797 --> 01:21:55,265
It's already 5pm when we haven't done much.

1946
01:21:55,266 --> 01:21:56,837
(As they run and play, it's 5pm.)

1947
01:21:58,667 --> 01:22:03,476
(Eun Woo gets the single room after winning in rock-paper-scissors.)

1948
01:22:07,247 --> 01:22:10,845
(First, even before unpacking his stuff, )

1949
01:22:10,846 --> 01:22:15,287
(he goes to the bathroom.)

1950
01:22:16,686 --> 01:22:23,056
(Eun Woo enjoys the benefits of civilization first.)

1951
01:22:23,827 --> 01:22:25,095
(The things from civilization that city boys look for first)

1952
01:22:25,096 --> 01:22:28,967
(1. Running water)

1953
01:22:29,196 --> 01:22:32,765
(I should wash up quickly before the others come.)

1954
01:22:32,766 --> 01:22:34,066
Are you using the bathroom?

1955
01:22:34,637 --> 01:22:35,776
Yes.

1956
01:22:36,577 --> 01:22:41,007
(There's already a line for the bathroom with running water.)

1957
01:22:42,377 --> 01:22:44,845
(He looks like he urgently needs to go.)

1958
01:22:44,846 --> 01:22:46,816
This is what I dreamed of and hoped for.

1959
01:22:47,387 --> 01:22:49,257
It wasn't as specific as this,

1960
01:22:50,186 --> 01:22:52,986
but there's everything we need...

1961
01:22:53,486 --> 01:22:55,126
- in this resting place. - Yes.

1962
01:22:55,127 --> 01:22:56,496
(Yes.)

1963
01:22:56,497 --> 01:22:58,256
(For Dong Hwi, 1 minute feels like 1 hour in this agonizing time.)

1964
01:22:58,257 --> 01:22:59,426
Eun Woo.

1965
01:22:59,427 --> 01:23:00,966
(For Dong Hwi, 1 minute feels like 1 hour in this agonizing time.)

1966
01:23:00,967 --> 01:23:02,497
- Eun Woo. - Yes?

1967
01:23:02,997 --> 01:23:04,236
Will it take you a while?

1968
01:23:04,297 --> 01:23:05,467
No.

1969
01:23:08,167 --> 01:23:09,836
(Oh, thank goodness.)

1970
01:23:09,837 --> 01:23:10,975
Oh, were you washing up?

1971
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:12,846
- Yes, I washed my face. - Good.

1972
01:23:13,047 --> 01:23:14,405
(The things from civilization that city boys look for first)

1973
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:16,015
(1. Running water, 2. TV)

1974
01:23:16,016 --> 01:23:17,076
It turned on.

1975
01:23:17,077 --> 01:23:18,486
(1. Running water, 2. TV)

1976
01:23:19,346 --> 01:23:21,146
Hey, isn't it fascinating?

1977
01:23:22,087 --> 01:23:23,555
I'll turn on YouTube.

1978
01:23:23,556 --> 01:23:25,016
Gosh, there's a working TV?

1979
01:23:25,686 --> 01:23:27,055
Oh, this is making me excited.

1980
01:23:27,056 --> 01:23:28,556
(This is making me excited.)

1981
01:23:28,627 --> 01:23:30,195
Je Hoon, do you want to watch a movie before bed later?

1982
01:23:30,196 --> 01:23:31,196
That sounds good.

1983
01:23:31,457 --> 01:23:34,025
Right, in the back,

1984
01:23:34,026 --> 01:23:35,836
we could have a fire going.

1985
01:23:35,837 --> 01:23:37,565
- Yes, and talking. - Yes.

1986
01:23:37,566 --> 01:23:40,305
And with a can of beer? That sounds amazing.

1987
01:23:40,306 --> 01:23:42,275
(While everyone is enjoying civilization, )

1988
01:23:42,276 --> 01:23:44,305
(where is Man of Nature Kwak?)

1989
01:23:44,306 --> 01:23:47,646
(He's trudging along somewhere.)

1990
01:23:48,516 --> 01:23:53,686
(Mr. Kwak turns his back on the TV and goes to the sauna.)

1991
01:23:55,087 --> 01:24:01,856
(He lies back in the hammock.)

1992
01:24:04,297 --> 01:24:09,337
(It must be awkward for him to suddenly be back in civilization.)

1993
01:24:11,196 --> 01:24:16,877
(I still like nature.)

1994
01:24:21,177 --> 01:24:23,916
(The quiet sound of nature...)

1995
01:24:23,917 --> 01:24:28,346
(is better than the sounds from TV, indeed.)

1996
01:24:30,856 --> 01:24:34,226
Oh, she even made pie for us.

1997
01:24:34,927 --> 01:24:36,226
It must be blueberry pie.

1998
01:24:36,396 --> 01:24:39,695
Please take the pie and stuff I've prepared.

1999
01:24:39,696 --> 01:24:41,095
- Oh, thank you. - Oh, thank you so much.

2000
01:24:41,096 --> 01:24:43,236
You're welcome. And welcome to our home.

2001
01:24:43,396 --> 01:24:44,566
Oh, my.

2002
01:24:45,096 --> 01:24:48,235
(A pie baked with blueberries from the backyard)

2003
01:24:48,236 --> 01:24:49,975
(Review: Everyman's right)

2004
01:24:49,976 --> 01:24:51,676
(Wild berries all throughout Finland...)

2005
01:24:51,677 --> 01:24:53,476
(are free to anyone according to the law.)

2006
01:24:53,776 --> 01:24:55,845
(This rented room is also surrounded by berries!)

2007
01:24:55,846 --> 01:24:58,047
(Berries everywhere)

2008
01:24:59,316 --> 01:25:00,747
- Do you want some? - No, thanks.

2009
01:25:05,087 --> 01:25:10,826
(Finnish berry pie is always tasty.)

2010
01:25:10,827 --> 01:25:12,466
(At this rate, he's almost a berry-eating ghost.)

2011
01:25:12,467 --> 01:25:13,997
The blueberry pie is so good.

2012
01:25:15,066 --> 01:25:18,967
(YouTube, on!)

2013
01:25:20,066 --> 01:25:24,537
(The eldest and youngest enjoy some culture in peace.)

2014
01:25:28,577 --> 01:25:31,475
(They look like they're about to get sucked into the TV...)

2015
01:25:31,476 --> 01:25:34,417
(and get a smack on the back from Mom.)

2016
01:25:37,217 --> 01:25:39,356
(I see.)

2017
01:25:39,556 --> 01:25:43,457
(The first time turning on a TV since coming to Finland)

2018
01:25:43,656 --> 01:25:48,166
(Like that, they watch TV for 5 minutes.)

2019
01:25:48,167 --> 01:25:52,936
(Like that, they watch TV for 10 minutes.)

2020
01:25:54,037 --> 01:25:57,906
(He loses focus soon and looks around.)

2021
01:25:58,377 --> 01:26:02,547
(He takes a refill of the berry pie.)

2022
01:26:04,547 --> 01:26:07,787
(Let me see.)

2023
01:26:08,816 --> 01:26:11,516
(Getting up?)

2024
01:26:12,856 --> 01:26:17,297
(Where is he suddenly going while watching TV?)

2025
01:26:18,196 --> 01:26:20,195
There are some here too.

2026
01:26:20,196 --> 01:26:22,066
(The forest?)

2027
01:26:22,167 --> 01:26:23,667
Nice.

2028
01:26:24,936 --> 01:26:29,735
(He only watched TV for 10 minutes after looking forward to it...)

2029
01:26:29,736 --> 01:26:34,547
(and is now back to nature picking berries.)

2030
01:26:36,016 --> 01:26:38,616
Not the ones that aren't ripe. Only the ones that are red.

2031
01:26:38,617 --> 01:26:40,586
(Along with Man of Nature Kwak, )

2032
01:26:40,587 --> 01:26:42,516
(is he refusing civilization as well?)

2033
01:26:43,856 --> 01:26:46,256
(He got bored soon and came back to nature.)

2034
01:26:46,257 --> 01:26:48,856
(By the way, nobody made him do this.)

2035
01:26:49,497 --> 01:26:51,855
(He came to pick the berries he likes to be self-sufficient.)

2036
01:26:51,856 --> 01:26:53,367
Gosh, that one is so red.

2037
01:26:56,037 --> 01:27:00,066
(How does the red lingonberry taste?)

2038
01:27:00,306 --> 01:27:01,537
Oh, it tastes so fresh.

2039
01:27:02,976 --> 01:27:05,475
Shall I make some lingonberry jam?

2040
01:27:05,476 --> 01:27:07,507
(Today's goal: Lingonberry jam?)

2041
01:27:08,846 --> 01:27:14,446
(Indeed, does Eun Woo, the youngest, prefer TV over nature?)

2042
01:27:24,396 --> 01:27:25,696
Shall I go too?

2043
01:27:25,896 --> 01:27:29,866
Shall I go with Je Hoon?

2044
01:27:29,867 --> 01:27:33,106
(Eun Woo also couldn't get past 15 minutes.)

2045
01:27:34,007 --> 01:27:35,775
- Je Hoon. - Yes?

2046
01:27:35,776 --> 01:27:37,637
- I came to join you. - Good.

2047
01:27:38,106 --> 01:27:41,577
- What is it? Is it lingonberry? - Yes.

2048
01:27:41,806 --> 01:27:43,177
- The red ones? - Yes.

2049
01:27:43,617 --> 01:27:46,747
I was thinking about making lingonberry jam.

2050
01:27:46,816 --> 01:27:49,855
Je Hoon, you're becoming the egg master and jam master.

2051
01:27:49,856 --> 01:27:52,015
(Master Chef Je Hoon?)

2052
01:27:52,016 --> 01:27:53,933
I'm mastering all sorts of berries before going back.

2053
01:27:53,957 --> 01:27:55,327
Try it. It's good.

2054
01:27:56,957 --> 01:27:58,156
Oh, it's sour.

2055
01:27:58,196 --> 01:27:59,395
(Surprised)

2056
01:27:59,396 --> 01:28:01,497
- Gosh, Je Hoon, it's kind of sour. - Yes.

2057
01:28:01,627 --> 01:28:03,265
When I make jam,

2058
01:28:03,266 --> 01:28:07,167
I'll be adding some sugar, so...

2059
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:09,676
- It will taste really good. - There it goes.

2060
01:28:09,677 --> 01:28:10,805
(The eldest and youngest chose to spend time in nature over TV.)

2061
01:28:10,806 --> 01:28:12,247
There are so many.

2062
01:28:12,906 --> 01:28:15,877
In Finland, you wouldn't have to worry about food.

2063
01:28:16,177 --> 01:28:17,646
- Gifts from nature. - Yes.

2064
01:28:17,976 --> 01:28:19,946
Gosh, over here. Gosh, this one...

2065
01:28:20,986 --> 01:28:22,417
- Are there many? - Yes.

2066
01:28:22,717 --> 01:28:24,456
They're practically asking me...

2067
01:28:24,457 --> 01:28:26,186
- to pick them. - Oh, really?

2068
01:28:26,957 --> 01:28:29,757
Gosh, these guys keep asking me to pick them.

2069
01:28:30,356 --> 01:28:31,656
Then you should pick them.

2070
01:28:32,297 --> 01:28:34,966
Goodness, how bountiful.

2071
01:28:34,967 --> 01:28:35,996
(They're more used to feeling nature in person...)

2072
01:28:35,997 --> 01:28:37,157
(rather than on a TV screen.)

2073
01:28:37,867 --> 01:28:39,606
It's a big catch.

2074
01:28:41,007 --> 01:28:42,905
If we pick too many of these,

2075
01:28:42,906 --> 01:28:44,275
they won't have any left to eat.

2076
01:28:44,276 --> 01:28:45,507
(The owner's family)

2077
01:28:45,606 --> 01:28:47,776
- We practically clean the place up. - Right.

2078
01:28:48,146 --> 01:28:49,476
We take things to the end.

2079
01:28:53,117 --> 01:28:56,587
(What was that noise?)

2080
01:28:57,556 --> 01:29:02,327
(The sound of Man of Nature Kwak jumping on a trampoline)

2081
01:29:04,096 --> 01:29:05,626
- Hey, Dong Yeon. - Yes?

2082
01:29:05,627 --> 01:29:08,367
That's for kids. You shouldn't be riding it.

2083
01:29:09,537 --> 01:29:11,435
I don't think they're that much younger than me.

2084
01:29:11,436 --> 01:29:13,082
(Dong Yeon, the grown-up kid, is simply having fun.)

2085
01:29:13,106 --> 01:29:14,207
Is it fun?

2086
01:29:15,606 --> 01:29:17,046
What are you doing? Picking berries?

2087
01:29:17,507 --> 01:29:19,207
Yes, lingonberries.

2088
01:29:19,606 --> 01:29:20,877
Are you picking berries again?

2089
01:29:21,747 --> 01:29:24,345
Hey, I'll make lingonberry jam for you.

2090
01:29:24,346 --> 01:29:25,917
Gosh, I picked a whole bunch.

2091
01:29:26,486 --> 01:29:28,917
- Hey, this much is... - We picked a lot, right?

2092
01:29:29,186 --> 01:29:30,486
We picked so much.

2093
01:29:31,156 --> 01:29:32,926
We can eat these for several days.

2094
01:29:32,927 --> 01:29:34,807
(They harvested berries to eat for a few days.)

2095
01:29:34,986 --> 01:29:36,466
We should get on the trampoline once.

2096
01:29:37,497 --> 01:29:39,065
- Shall we? - Okay.

2097
01:29:39,066 --> 01:29:40,695
(The eldest was actually kind of envious of Dong Yeon.)

2098
01:29:40,696 --> 01:29:42,096
It's been so long.

2099
01:29:43,696 --> 01:29:44,736
Hey.

2100
01:29:46,037 --> 01:29:47,266
Let's jump for each other.

2101
01:29:47,406 --> 01:29:48,905
(I love this so much!)

2102
01:29:48,906 --> 01:29:50,976
Je Hoon, just lie down, okay?

2103
01:29:53,177 --> 01:29:55,975
(The grown-up kids, whose combined age is 67)

2104
01:29:55,976 --> 01:29:59,716
(are exploding with dopamine as they jump around.)

2105
01:29:59,717 --> 01:30:00,717
Hey.

2106
01:30:02,087 --> 01:30:06,026
(The 40-year-old eldest is especially having fun.)

2107
01:30:06,387 --> 01:30:07,756
(Dopamine)

2108
01:30:07,757 --> 01:30:09,096
Hey, gosh.

2109
01:30:09,627 --> 01:30:10,627
(Dopamine)

2110
01:30:11,656 --> 01:30:13,065
(They must be having fun.)

2111
01:30:13,066 --> 01:30:14,306
I feel like I'm getting taller.

2112
01:30:17,236 --> 01:30:18,596
Let's jump together.

2113
01:30:18,967 --> 01:30:20,037
Come here.

2114
01:30:20,337 --> 01:30:21,605
- No? - He doesn't want to.

2115
01:30:21,606 --> 01:30:22,906
Come here. Let's play together.

2116
01:30:25,077 --> 01:30:26,476
Is he scared?

2117
01:30:28,646 --> 01:30:31,946
(I'm still a bit shy.)

2118
01:30:32,986 --> 01:30:37,656
(The trampoline is 100 times more fun than the TV.)

2119
01:30:38,186 --> 01:30:39,286
Oh, this is fun.

2120
01:30:39,287 --> 01:30:41,656
(By the way, where is our city boy Dong Hwi?)

2121
01:30:43,896 --> 01:30:48,096
(The firewood chopper has naturally found his place too.)

2122
01:30:50,637 --> 01:30:55,236
(He has come outside and is chopping wood for the fireplace.)

2123
01:30:57,406 --> 01:31:00,746
(An ironic phenomenon where they've gone back to nature...)

2124
01:31:00,747 --> 01:31:04,047
(after arriving in civilization)

2125
01:31:04,177 --> 01:31:06,116
Gosh, but it's so big.

2126
01:31:06,117 --> 01:31:07,786
(A horse?)

2127
01:31:07,787 --> 01:31:09,816
- You can use this. - Yes, thank you.

2128
01:31:10,016 --> 01:31:12,786
I can also hold her, if you want to...

2129
01:31:12,787 --> 01:31:14,086
- Oh, yes. - Yes, I can take this.

2130
01:31:14,087 --> 01:31:15,456
(Dong Yeon is going to join the family on a horseback ride.)

2131
01:31:15,457 --> 01:31:16,525
And chest.

2132
01:31:16,526 --> 01:31:18,526
(It's a daily activity for the landlord's family.)

2133
01:31:19,167 --> 01:31:23,637
(First, he brushes the horse to connect with it.)

2134
01:31:24,797 --> 01:31:29,377
(He's used to horses since he has experience in historical dramas.)

2135
01:31:30,577 --> 01:31:31,577
So...

2136
01:31:31,578 --> 01:31:32,645
(Dong Yeon places the saddle himself too.)

2137
01:31:32,646 --> 01:31:33,707
Yes.

2138
01:31:35,306 --> 01:31:36,617
- What? - What?

2139
01:31:37,617 --> 01:31:38,775
- Are you finished? - Are you going for a ride?

2140
01:31:38,776 --> 01:31:40,496
- I'm about to go now. - Are you going now?

2141
01:31:40,917 --> 01:31:42,417
I'll go to Seoul on the horse.

2142
01:31:42,457 --> 01:31:43,716
- On the horse? - Be back soon.

2143
01:31:43,717 --> 01:31:44,837
(I'm going to follow Katja.)

2144
01:31:45,957 --> 01:31:47,056
My gosh.

2145
01:31:48,726 --> 01:31:51,395
- My goodness. - But it was so big when I got here.

2146
01:31:51,396 --> 01:31:52,667
It's really big.

2147
01:31:53,127 --> 01:31:55,266
- Like a horse in historical dramas. - Yes.

2148
01:31:55,396 --> 01:31:56,636
She wants to eat.

2149
01:31:56,637 --> 01:31:58,565
- Eat more. - Okay.

2150
01:31:58,566 --> 01:32:00,506
She's so busy eating.

2151
01:32:00,507 --> 01:32:01,787
(Let's go once I get some food.)

2152
01:32:02,137 --> 01:32:05,306
So, I don't know if Vera told you, but this is Venla.

2153
01:32:05,476 --> 01:32:08,377
Venla is... I've had her since she was born.

2154
01:32:08,507 --> 01:32:11,046
So, I was there when she was...

2155
01:32:11,047 --> 01:32:12,485
(I'm going to eat.)

2156
01:32:12,486 --> 01:32:13,746
When her mom delivered her.

2157
01:32:13,747 --> 01:32:15,216
Hey.

2158
01:32:15,217 --> 01:32:19,026
(The Lapland troublemaker horse is acting like a child.)

2159
01:32:19,287 --> 01:32:21,185
- Yes, she is kind, but now, - Yes.

2160
01:32:21,186 --> 01:32:23,395
I think there's a lot going on.

2161
01:32:23,396 --> 01:32:25,056
- So, she's a bit... - Yes.

2162
01:32:26,127 --> 01:32:27,327
She is very kind.

2163
01:32:27,696 --> 01:32:28,766
Hey, up.

2164
01:32:28,997 --> 01:32:31,096
I've been on horses during historical dramas too,

2165
01:32:31,236 --> 01:32:32,707
but it's so...

2166
01:32:33,707 --> 01:32:35,167
It seems okay,

2167
01:32:35,266 --> 01:32:36,836
- but if you let your guard down... - Once in a while,

2168
01:32:36,837 --> 01:32:38,836
- you can get in trouble. - You can't let your guard down.

2169
01:32:38,837 --> 01:32:40,047
You really have to be careful.

2170
01:32:40,146 --> 01:32:41,146
Oh, helmet.

2171
01:32:42,146 --> 01:32:43,676
Dong Yeon, you should try it.

2172
01:32:43,677 --> 01:32:44,776
He's going to ride a horse.

2173
01:32:45,047 --> 01:32:46,516
Oh, is Dong Yeon riding a horse?

2174
01:32:47,486 --> 01:32:49,985
- Yes. You're a professional. - Oh, Dong Yeon.

2175
01:32:49,986 --> 01:32:51,856
Yes, get on there.

2176
01:32:52,056 --> 01:32:53,257
Is it okay?

2177
01:32:53,627 --> 01:32:55,056
- Do you feel okay? - Yes.

2178
01:32:55,156 --> 01:32:57,156
- Yes, start walking. - You seem so used to it.

2179
01:32:57,927 --> 01:32:59,166
- Hey. - Nice.

2180
01:32:59,167 --> 01:33:01,395
- Hey, you're good. - Nice.

2181
01:33:01,396 --> 01:33:04,196
(Has he successfully connected with the troublemaker horse?)

2182
01:33:04,667 --> 01:33:06,736
(Rumbling)

2183
01:33:07,667 --> 01:33:08,806
She farted.

2184
01:33:10,276 --> 01:33:12,946
(Did I eat too much?)

2185
01:33:13,406 --> 01:33:14,546
Oh, Dong Yeon.

2186
01:33:14,547 --> 01:33:16,177
I want to ride one too.

2187
01:33:18,177 --> 01:33:21,217
Is there one more horse that I can ride together?

2188
01:33:21,287 --> 01:33:22,417
- Together? - Yes.

2189
01:33:22,717 --> 01:33:24,257
- Yes. - Is that okay?

2190
01:33:25,056 --> 01:33:26,556
- Dong Yeon. - Yes?

2191
01:33:26,686 --> 01:33:30,256
I'm going to ride one too. She says we can go to the road.

2192
01:33:30,257 --> 01:33:31,756
- Really? Shall we ride together? - Do you want to go?

2193
01:33:31,757 --> 01:33:33,427
- Okay, I told her too. - All right.

2194
01:33:34,627 --> 01:33:35,837
I'll get to know my horse.

2195
01:33:36,467 --> 01:33:38,167
Hey, easy.

2196
01:33:38,396 --> 01:33:40,466
She doesn't care if Dong Yeon wants to ride and just keeps eating.

2197
01:33:40,467 --> 01:33:41,467
Yes.

2198
01:33:41,637 --> 01:33:43,507
I don't think she has a bad temper.

2199
01:33:46,606 --> 01:33:47,646
Or not?

2200
01:33:49,516 --> 01:33:51,417
(Sputtering)

2201
01:33:52,587 --> 01:33:53,645
Why are you doing that?

2202
01:33:53,646 --> 01:33:54,787
(Slightly scared?)

2203
01:33:55,247 --> 01:33:56,986
Hey, here comes a black horse.

2204
01:33:57,656 --> 01:33:59,656
- A black horse? - Over there, from the left.

2205
01:34:01,757 --> 01:34:06,026
(A horse appears with strong charisma.)

2206
01:34:07,766 --> 01:34:10,797
(The black horse looks cool.)

2207
01:34:11,896 --> 01:34:14,337
- Hi. - So, Radda is also...

2208
01:34:14,507 --> 01:34:15,805
- Radda? - Radda.

2209
01:34:15,806 --> 01:34:17,806
- Radda. - Yes.

2210
01:34:19,346 --> 01:34:21,747
Gosh, she has such a big bottom.

2211
01:34:23,077 --> 01:34:24,815
(Patting her on the bottom)

2212
01:34:24,816 --> 01:34:25,846
Are you okay?

2213
01:34:25,986 --> 01:34:26,986
You can try.

2214
01:34:26,987 --> 01:34:28,217
- Go up? - Yes.

2215
01:34:28,986 --> 01:34:30,515
And then... Okay.

2216
01:34:30,516 --> 01:34:32,156
Yes, that was cool.

2217
01:34:32,356 --> 01:34:34,786
- Gentle hand, here. - Yes.

2218
01:34:34,787 --> 01:34:36,627
Then, you can have a gentle ride.

2219
01:34:36,656 --> 01:34:37,726
All right.

2220
01:34:38,696 --> 01:34:39,896
We have to go now.

2221
01:34:41,827 --> 01:34:44,637
(Have they gotten close already? Oh, he can control the horse.)

2222
01:34:44,837 --> 01:34:45,866
Venla.

2223
01:34:45,867 --> 01:34:47,435
(You want to go?)

2224
01:34:47,436 --> 01:34:49,537
(And who are you?)

2225
01:34:50,007 --> 01:34:51,236
She's walking backward.

2226
01:34:53,606 --> 01:34:54,677
Let's go.

2227
01:34:56,077 --> 01:34:57,146
Come on.

2228
01:34:57,177 --> 01:35:00,645
(Finally, she obediently sets off.)

2229
01:35:00,646 --> 01:35:01,786
Venla, up.

2230
01:35:01,787 --> 01:35:03,786
(Or so they thought.)

2231
01:35:03,787 --> 01:35:05,956
I'll help you. That's how we'll get started.

2232
01:35:05,957 --> 01:35:06,957
Yes.

2233
01:35:06,958 --> 01:35:08,155
(Hey, you troublemaker horse.)

2234
01:35:08,156 --> 01:35:10,225
She's saying... Venla, this way.

2235
01:35:10,226 --> 01:35:12,496
(Master Katja to the rescue!)

2236
01:35:12,497 --> 01:35:13,596
Let's go.

2237
01:35:16,896 --> 01:35:18,896
- All right. - Let's go, Dong Yeon.

2238
01:35:19,207 --> 01:35:20,236
Okay.

2239
01:35:21,606 --> 01:35:23,435
She doesn't want to leave right now.

2240
01:35:23,436 --> 01:35:24,536
(I hope you two grow closer on your walk.)

2241
01:35:24,537 --> 01:35:25,876
She keeps walking backward.

2242
01:35:25,877 --> 01:35:27,877
I've never seen a horse walk backward before.

2243
01:35:30,577 --> 01:35:36,787
(Let's go for a walk together.)

2244
01:35:38,287 --> 01:35:39,926
Very well. How does it feel?

2245
01:35:39,927 --> 01:35:41,526
- Perfect. - Yes.

2246
01:35:43,726 --> 01:35:47,367
I think being around nature and around animals,

2247
01:35:47,497 --> 01:35:49,667
- especially horses, is so relaxing. - Yes.

2248
01:35:50,096 --> 01:35:52,095
Okay, they do something...

2249
01:35:52,096 --> 01:35:54,266
sometimes, and that's a lot of work, but...

2250
01:35:56,736 --> 01:35:58,506
Yes, I'm actually...

2251
01:35:58,507 --> 01:36:01,145
They are also therapy horses. I'm a therapist,

2252
01:36:01,146 --> 01:36:03,775
so I do animal and nature-assisted therapy.

2253
01:36:03,776 --> 01:36:05,476
- Oh, I see. - At this place...

2254
01:36:07,016 --> 01:36:08,945
All right. But I'm okay right now.

2255
01:36:08,946 --> 01:36:10,355
(Feeling the horse's warmth...)

2256
01:36:10,356 --> 01:36:12,485
Venla. Yes.

2257
01:36:12,486 --> 01:36:14,627
(They walk down the path while smelling nature.)

2258
01:36:14,726 --> 01:36:16,056
- Radda. - Yes.

2259
01:36:17,026 --> 01:36:18,056
Nice.

2260
01:36:18,297 --> 01:36:20,065
Oh, she's nice.

2261
01:36:20,066 --> 01:36:21,066
(Calm)

2262
01:36:21,127 --> 01:36:22,766
Gosh, I want to start running.

2263
01:36:25,367 --> 01:36:26,836
And not think about the consequences.

2264
01:36:26,837 --> 01:36:28,766
(Do you want to run?)

2265
01:36:30,207 --> 01:36:31,476
Oh, watch out.

2266
01:36:34,846 --> 01:36:36,547
- No, Venla! - Dong Yeon.

2267
01:36:37,177 --> 01:36:38,346
Hey.

2268
01:36:38,877 --> 01:36:40,387
- Hey. - Stop.

2269
01:36:42,816 --> 01:36:43,917
Dong Yeon!

2270
01:36:44,656 --> 01:36:47,355
(My friend keeps going farther away.)

2271
01:36:47,356 --> 01:36:48,387
Dong Yeon!

2272
01:36:49,226 --> 01:36:50,556
Dong Yeon, where are you going?

2273
01:36:52,096 --> 01:36:53,096
Come back!

2274
01:36:53,097 --> 01:36:54,595
(The troublemaker horse wanders off into the forest.)

2275
01:36:54,596 --> 01:36:56,096
Pull the reins.

2276
01:36:56,936 --> 01:36:58,167
Pull the reins.

2277
01:36:58,467 --> 01:37:01,105
(Where Dong Yeon was kidnapped)

2278
01:37:01,106 --> 01:37:02,266
With all your strength.

2279
01:37:03,207 --> 01:37:04,677
Dong Yeon, no!

2280
01:37:05,476 --> 01:37:06,975
Hey.

2281
01:37:06,976 --> 01:37:10,547
(Where Dong Yeon is headed, there's nothing but forest.)

2282
01:37:10,877 --> 01:37:12,845
(Their life in rented rooms...)

2283
01:37:12,846 --> 01:37:16,486
(has been strewn with new experiences.)

2284
01:37:16,717 --> 01:37:19,193
It was a sentimental experience I will never be able to forget.

2285
01:37:19,217 --> 01:37:21,155
(A moment...)

2286
01:37:21,156 --> 01:37:26,467
(that surpasses everything they've experienced is coming.)

2287
01:37:26,726 --> 01:37:28,726
(Gosh, I've never seen anything like this before.)

2288
01:37:28,867 --> 01:37:33,236
(The thrill that you get from an unfamiliar experience)

2289
01:37:33,306 --> 01:37:37,436
(The freedom that you get from an unfamiliar experience)

2290
01:37:41,146 --> 01:37:43,275
(Je Hoon carefully reveals...)

2291
01:37:43,276 --> 01:37:47,346
(his inner thoughts.)

2292
01:37:48,047 --> 01:37:51,056
(A good grown-up kid shouldn't cry!)

2293
01:37:51,656 --> 01:37:53,356
(It's too early to go to bed!)

2294
01:37:53,757 --> 01:37:55,086
(They stay up all night...)

2295
01:37:55,087 --> 01:37:56,896
(until the break of dawn.)

2296
01:37:56,927 --> 01:37:59,666
(The stories from the rented room...)

2297
01:37:59,667 --> 01:38:01,696
(don't die down.)

2298
01:38:01,766 --> 01:38:05,367
(Let's really go to bed now.)

2299
01:38:06,606 --> 01:38:08,235
(Their life in the rented room doesn't shut off...)

2300
01:38:08,236 --> 01:38:09,877
(even when it gets unplugged!)

2301
01:38:09,976 --> 01:38:11,677
(And...)

2302
01:38:12,406 --> 01:38:14,223
Gosh, this feels like we're going into a strange land.

2303
01:38:14,247 --> 01:38:16,576
(Going to find...)

2304
01:38:16,577 --> 01:38:18,776
(the most famous person in Lapland)

2305
01:38:19,047 --> 01:38:21,416
(Who is the owner of this place...)

2306
01:38:21,417 --> 01:38:27,427
(who spreads joy to the whole world?)

2307
01:38:32,867 --> 01:38:34,666
(Lee Je Hoon)

2308
01:38:34,667 --> 01:38:36,366
(Lee Dong Hwi)

2309
01:38:36,367 --> 01:38:38,235
(Kwak Dong Yeon)

2310
01:38:38,236 --> 01:38:39,867
