1
00:00:05,139 --> 00:00:06,909
(Lee Je Hoon)

2
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:08,549
(Lee Dong Hwi)

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,518
(Kwak Dong Yeon)

4
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:12,080
(Cha Eun Woo)

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,849
(Rented In Finland)

6
00:00:14,949 --> 00:00:17,690
(The Renters visit a husky house.)

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,329
(They will be taking care of huskies for a day.)

8
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:24,059
(I've never seen anything like that.)

9
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:26,898
(The huskies that pull sleds...)

10
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:30,570
(are essential in Lapland.)

11
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:34,209
(After receiving help in the winter, )

12
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:39,280
(taking care of huskies is part of their life during the summer.)

13
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:40,449
Doesn't that feel good?

14
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,380
(The Renters fall in love with the huskies.)

15
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:45,179
(Or it seemed that way.)

16
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,849
(Not only do they try to escape, )

17
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,019
(but they also push you with their bodies.)

18
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,420
(It's impossible to match their energy.)

19
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,459
(An essential part of the husky house schedule)

20
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,060
(We're going hiking.)

21
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,560
(Hiking with them?)

22
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,699
(They go crazy even before they leave.)

23
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,000
(Hurry! Let's go for a walk!)

24
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:09,510
(They are soon left dazed.)

25
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,480
(Getting dragged away)

26
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:15,950
(An uncomfortable journey begins.)

27
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,649
Skeef.

28
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,119
- Yelka. - Skeef.

29
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,389
- Skeef. - Miyu.

30
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,689
Sakha.

31
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,048
- Yelka. - Miyu.

32
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:25,488
(They try Lapland-style husky hiking.)

33
00:01:25,489 --> 00:01:27,060
- Wait, Yelka. - Skeef.

34
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,658
They're all barking because they want to go fast.

35
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:33,670
Yes?

36
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,200
(Hurry.)

37
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,540
(A barking surround sound system)

38
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,309
(Feeling dazed)

39
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,608
(Going crazy)

40
00:01:42,609 --> 00:01:44,209
You can see she's strong.

41
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:45,810
Yes.

42
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,780
(Huskies get physically and mentally stressed when they hold energy in.)

43
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,549
(During the summer when they can't pull sleds, )

44
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:58,319
(hikes are essential for them to let out their energy.)

45
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,689
Look at Miyuki.

46
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,098
(She was so calm before.)

47
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:05,358
She wants to follow the dog in front.

48
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,128
(They go wild as they go for a walk.)

49
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:08,869
(Miyuki)

50
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,300
- Miyuki. - You have veered off route.

51
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:13,539
- Finding a new route. - Miyuki.

52
00:02:13,669 --> 00:02:15,068
This is unbelievable.

53
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:17,539
(Even Dongdong's owner, who has experience, is confused.)

54
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,179
(Sakha)

55
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,209
Sakha.

56
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,810
(Another dog veers off route.)

57
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,780
When we arrive...

58
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:26,279
- Sakha. - Sakha, this way.

59
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,250
(It's impossible to hold a conversation.)

60
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,989
(Sakha)

61
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,119
No.

62
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,990
(Sakha loves to stray off course.)

63
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,959
Wait.

64
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,158
Stop.

65
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:37,159
(He's being dragged around.)

66
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,599
- Super. - Sakha.

67
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,399
It looks like you're being dragged around.

68
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,168
(We'll walk you.)

69
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:47,240
Gosh, it must be challenging for her to walk all of them.

70
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:48,638
I know.

71
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:49,639
(Not even taking a walk is easy in Lapland.)

72
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:52,180
- Skeef calmed down. - I see.

73
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:53,508
Now it's quieter.

74
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:54,979
(The huskies have calmed down after 10 minutes.)

75
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,620
Skeef doesn't go off course at all.

76
00:02:58,349 --> 00:02:59,419
It's like autonomous cruising.

77
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,749
Skeef, autopilot.

78
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,689
(Skeef's autopilot mode is on.)

79
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,158
Skeef.

80
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:06,519
(Input, Output)

81
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,559
Skeef.

82
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,990
Good dog, Skeef.

83
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,159
Turn left, Skeef.

84
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,469
He's good at taking instructions.

85
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,339
He doesn't go off course.

86
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,400
(He passes the lane-changing test.)

87
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,839
(It's a calm drive with autopilot Skeef.)

88
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,110
He's so cute.

89
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,840
All right.

90
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,409
(There is a couple that is enjoying their date.)

91
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:32,280
Does that make you happy?

92
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,519
Let's go slowly.

93
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,550
(I love taking walks.)

94
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,460
Is that so?

95
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,860
Okay.

96
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:42,789
No.

97
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:44,199
Stop.

98
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,469
- She's so nice. - Yes.

99
00:03:47,969 --> 00:03:49,668
Je Hoon's dog is the nicest.

100
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:50,870
Yes, she is.

101
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,439
She probably doesn't walk them by herself, right?

102
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,439
- I'm sure she has employees. - Right?

103
00:03:57,539 --> 00:04:00,549
I walk all the dogs..

104
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,349
And do their training.

105
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,020
- What? - All of them?

106
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,020
- Alone? - Yes.

107
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:09,819
So it's nice to have help.

108
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:12,360
That's a relief.

109
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,520
Much better.

110
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,628
We're going to arrive at a lake soon.

111
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:19,660
- Yes. - Okay.

112
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:26,100
(Where is the destination of their husky hike?)

113
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:28,009
Look at that lake.

114
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,768
It's a huge lake.

115
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:34,149
(The lake is part of the hiking course?)

116
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,750
They know where we are going and are so happy.

117
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:39,220
Yes, she's so happy.

118
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,889
(They get happier as they approach the lake.)

119
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:46,420
- Just stop here. - Okay.

120
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,759
Sakha.

121
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,360
Miyu.

122
00:04:49,361 --> 00:04:50,859
(The huskies see the lake.)

123
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,060
I'm going to check.

124
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:53,629
What?

125
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:54,969
- Gosh. - Gosh.

126
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:58,839
(Jumping in boldly)

127
00:04:58,939 --> 00:05:01,469
He looks so excited.

128
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,639
(Swimming in the lake?)

129
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:04,939
Miyuki.

130
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:06,409
(I can't stand this.)

131
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,709
Miyuki, stop.

132
00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:11,278
Okay. 1, 2, 3, let's go.

133
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:13,549
(Miyuki...)

134
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,990
(jumps in too.)

135
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:19,489
Come on, Mimi.

136
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,459
(Miyuki boldly swims forward.)

137
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:25,230
(This is why I enjoy swimming.)

138
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:27,569
(Proud)

139
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:28,769
Gosh.

140
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,399
- Okay. - Go on.

141
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,699
They're excited.

142
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,508
Look at how excited they are.

143
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:38,008
- They want to play. - Gosh.

144
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:39,378
(The huskies give off happy energy in the lake instead of the snow.)

145
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:40,750
It's okay. Come.

146
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,209
I didn't know dogs loved water this much.

147
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:46,379
- Gosh. - They look so happy.

148
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:48,318
They look really happy.

149
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:50,319
(They look so happy.)

150
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:54,060
(Lapland is the happiest country for both people and animals.)

151
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,028
We go along this.

152
00:05:56,029 --> 00:05:58,699
- This is a big island. - Okay.

153
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:02,569
We'll go behind it, around it, and everywhere.

154
00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:06,339
- Really? That island? - Yes.

155
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,708
How? By boat?

156
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:13,540
No, during wintertime, we sled.

157
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,379
- I see. It's ice during wintertime. - Ice.

158
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,878
(On the vast snow-covered lake, )

159
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,388
- That would be awesome. - On the ice.

160
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:24,889
(the huskies run fiercely.)

161
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:28,689
(Proud)

162
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:34,099
It must be beautiful.

163
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,170
(Visit again in winter.)

164
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:37,439
You can catch the dogs.

165
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:39,568
Take your own dogs.

166
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:40,609
(Now it's time to go home.)

167
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,369
- Let's go. - Yelka likes swimming.

168
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,508
(Yelka looks comfortable.)

169
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:45,109
You have to come back, Yelka.

170
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,639
- Yelka. - Let's go home.

171
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:48,410
- Here, Yelka. - Yelka.

172
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:51,579
She even refuses a snack.

173
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:54,888
Yelka, it's a snack.

174
00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:56,089
(She prefers swimming over snacks.)

175
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,490
What are you going to do?

176
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,660
Yelka.

177
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,328
- Good job. - Yelka.

178
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:04,559
(She finally comes out after Je Hoon desperately calls her.)

179
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,599
Stop it.

180
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,230
- Let's go. - Let's go.

181
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,969
(Barking)

182
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,369
They're at it again. They are full of energy.

183
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,939
- Yes. - Skeef.

184
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,609
Skeef.

185
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,639
They'll have a good nap when they go home.

186
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:26,980
(Passing out after letting out their energy)

187
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,188
(The Renters are about to pass out too.)

188
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:30,319
- Je Hoon. - Yes?

189
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,659
I'm suddenly exhausted.

190
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,689
Dogs are different here.

191
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,959
Wait. Since you're tired...

192
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:39,458
(I brought this knowing we'd need it.)

193
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,729
- I brought this. - What is it?

194
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:41,970
What is that?

195
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,899
It's Kopiko.

196
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:47,339
You'll feel less tired if you have it.

197
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,470
That's interesting.

198
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:50,910
I eat it when I'm tired.

199
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:53,949
Do I just leave it in my mouth?

200
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:58,019
Yes, you let it melt.

201
00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:00,279
- It's energizing. - Yes, it is.

202
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,319
After having this...

203
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:06,620
You can leave first. I think I can walk more dogs.

204
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:11,559
(The Renters get another taste of Lapland life through the huskies.)

205
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,898
- That was nice. - It was nice.

206
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:15,268
- I loved it. - I feel good.

207
00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:18,170
(Let's meet again.)

208
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,800
Let's go.

209
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,970
- Let's go. - Let's go.

210
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:26,279
Walking the dogs is a lot of work.

211
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:32,379
(How does she walk 30 dogs daily?)

212
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,690
(The Renters are overwhelmed by the energy of the huskies.)

213
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,259
(Wait a second.)

214
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,399
(If they continue driving down this road...)

215
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,898
It's deep in the forest.

216
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:53,169
Yes, it is. We've been driving down this path for ten minutes.

217
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,369
Was it this far?

218
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,038
(They drive down the rough unpaved road for 1 hour.)

219
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:00,610
- This road seems endless. - I know.

220
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:03,110
- We have to go even further? - Gosh.

221
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:05,548
It feels like we're entering...

222
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:08,850
a part of the world nature is trying to keep us out of.

223
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:11,820
My phone has no reception.

224
00:09:12,289 --> 00:09:13,619
I lost signal.

225
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,859
(No reception, no neighbors)

226
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,658
There must be bears here.

227
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:17,759
(Rented room in the woods)

228
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:22,100
(They can't even imagine going out.)

229
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,369
We'll have to scream for help.

230
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,638
(They will be secluded deep in the forest until they move out.)

231
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:28,740
We're in trouble.

232
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:33,979
We don't have anything to eat at home.

233
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,979
Should we stop by a supermarket to buy a few things?

234
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:36,980
Yes, we should do that.

235
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,250
(We'll starve if we go home like this.)

236
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,189
What should we eat today?

237
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,820
(The city boys always ordered food when in the city.)

238
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,128
For dinner...

239
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:51,360
(They worry about every meal in the countryside of Lapland.)

240
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,970
Dinner? There is a food that's recently become my favorite.

241
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:00,099
I like kimchi, but we didn't have it at all.

242
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,138
- That's right. - Yes.

243
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:04,240
I thought everyone would ask for kimchi.

244
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,709
- So I brought plenty of it. - That's right.

245
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:07,750
I have kimchi too.

246
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,149
You do?

247
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,979
- Did you bring it? - Yes, I did.

248
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,119
(He leans forward when he hears about kimchi.)

249
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,449
I feel like kimchi and pork belly.

250
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,590
(I want kimchi and pork belly.)

251
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,258
(Pork belly and kimchi, Koreans' soul food)

252
00:10:18,259 --> 00:10:19,419
Kimchi and pork belly.

253
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:22,730
My mouth is watering.

254
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,059
Should we have a barbecue today?

255
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,168
(Say no more.)

256
00:10:29,169 --> 00:10:30,169
Let's do it.

257
00:10:30,169 --> 00:10:31,169
Sounds good.

258
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,039
(He applauds the decision.)

259
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:34,408
As we have plenty of kimchi,

260
00:10:34,409 --> 00:10:36,369
- we can also make stew. - Sounds good.

261
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,379
That's more than enough.

262
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:41,950
(Kimchi stew, the life of Koreans)

263
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:43,409
Master Kwak.

264
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,048
I've suddenly been promoted to master.

265
00:10:47,049 --> 00:10:48,049
(Congratulations on being promoted from Mr. Kwak to Master Kwak.)

266
00:10:48,049 --> 00:10:49,049
You went from Mr. Kwak to Master Kwak.

267
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,989
(He boosts the energy of the chef before he starts cooking.)

268
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,059
Master Kwak.

269
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:54,029
This will be the best feast ever.

270
00:10:54,929 --> 00:10:57,360
(Look forward to it.)

271
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:00,199
But will they have...

272
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,970
pork belly at the supermarket?

273
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,768
They should have it, right?

274
00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:06,799
(Will they have pork belly in the countryside?)

275
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:11,009
I was talking to Mailys earlier.

276
00:11:12,309 --> 00:11:14,749
- We're staying in Posio, right? - Yes.

277
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,750
She said it was a city.

278
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,209
- It is? - It's the busiest area?

279
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,219
It's practically considered a city.

280
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,779
- Downtown? - Yes, it's downtown.

281
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:21,419
That's right.

282
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:25,388
It's downtown Posio.

283
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:26,459
- Yes. - That's right.

284
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,590
(This small area with a radius of 50km is the busiest area.)

285
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:34,500
(The city boys head downtown as a group for the first time.)

286
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:36,869
(They start seeing it.)

287
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:37,939
This is downtown.

288
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,239
It's downtown.

289
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,709
I feel energized.

290
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,940
It's like my HP is being charged.

291
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:46,808
(Welcome to downtown Posio.)

292
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:48,980
Look at that couple walking hand in hand.

293
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,249
- Yes. - It's so sweet.

294
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,820
(They feel jealous of the people in town for some reason.)

295
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:55,619
It seems busy today.

296
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,119
(They are surprised to see a crowd for a change.)

297
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,120
We're here.

298
00:11:59,121 --> 00:12:02,329
(The city boys have arrived in town.)

299
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:05,128
I hope we're allowed to park here. Let's park here.

300
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:06,658
(They park as soon as they see a parking lot.)

301
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,269
- Thanks for driving. - Don't worry about it.

302
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:10,529
Goodness.

303
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:14,509
(What is in the countryside town of Finland?)

304
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,940
Isn't that building pretty?

305
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,579
Yes, it is.

306
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,339
It has a pharmacy and police station.

307
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,749
(It's a public building with a pharmacy and police station.)

308
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,450
The police station opens only three days a week.

309
00:12:23,649 --> 00:12:25,548
Really? Not every day?

310
00:12:25,549 --> 00:12:26,549
No.

311
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,850
- How is that possible? - That's amazing.

312
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,250
I like the size of this town.

313
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,089
I see a cafe. Why don't we have coffee...

314
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:34,129
before we go home?

315
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,428
We have nothing at home.

316
00:12:36,429 --> 00:12:38,100
- You're right. Should we buy some? - Yes.

317
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,970
Let's stop by the cafe before going to the supermarket?

318
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,099
- Should we have something to drink? - Let's have coffee.

319
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,700
- Should we have some coffee? - Sounds good.

320
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,840
- Why don't we cross here? - Okay.

321
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,470
- Let's use the crosswalk. - Okay.

322
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,070
It'd be great if they had donuts.

323
00:12:50,309 --> 00:12:51,509
Yes, that'd be great.

324
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,940
They wouldn't have iced Americano, would they?

325
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,349
I don't think they have it.

326
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,350
(They lose their minds at the first sighting of a cafe.)

327
00:12:56,351 --> 00:12:57,980
- Iced Americano. - You're right.

328
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,549
I'm sure they have ice.

329
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,089
You can add it.

330
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,789
(What do they have at a cafe in the European countryside?)

331
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:07,190
I cross like the Beatles.

332
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,529
One at a time?

333
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:15,870
(The Renters)

334
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:21,340
(They're so excited.)

335
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:25,080
You know what?

336
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,850
I prefer places with stores...

337
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:29,648
(Laughing)

338
00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:32,120
than the countryside...

339
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:33,850
with nothing but nature.

340
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,919
Je Hoon, that's what I mean.

341
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:39,289
I wish we could stay longer.

342
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:42,788
Let's enjoy downtown while we're here.

343
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:44,059
Enjoy civilization.

344
00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:47,399
Cafe Sorrento.

345
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,668
(Happy to find a cafe in the countryside)

346
00:13:49,669 --> 00:13:50,940
Dong Hwi looks ecstatic.

347
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,269
Look at this.

348
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:55,669
(Skipping)

349
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:59,309
(The youngest skips out of excitement.)

350
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:02,750
Ice cream?

351
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,009
They have ice cream?

352
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,579
(The ice cream sign triggers a dopamine explosion.)

353
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,749
- They have ice cream. - We chose the right place.

354
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,419
(What is the only cafe downtown that excited the Renters like?)

355
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,788
- It's nice. - I like the cafe's vibe.

356
00:14:12,789 --> 00:14:14,059
(It has a vintage vibe.)

357
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,429
(It's where people from all over town gather.)

358
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:18,758
Good morning.

359
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:21,570
(They are surprised to see the splendid civilization.)

360
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:24,899
(There is so much to see.)

361
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,768
- It looks like a Western movie. - It's American-style.

362
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:27,769
- It looks like a movie set. - Chevrolet.

363
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:28,839
(They haven't been at a place with electricity for a long time.)

364
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,308
The bread looks tasty.

365
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:31,509
They seem to bake it here.

366
00:14:31,909 --> 00:14:32,909
Here?

367
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:33,980
(Really?)

368
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,720
(He approaches the baked goods.)

369
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,148
They also have cookies.

370
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:40,849
(Homemade cookies and bread)

371
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:41,889
Have one.

372
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:43,950
They have a set menu.

373
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,620
Over here.

374
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,429
This is insane.

375
00:14:49,429 --> 00:14:52,200
(They marvel at the ice cream and coffee set.)

376
00:14:52,429 --> 00:14:53,528
How did they come up with that set?

377
00:14:53,529 --> 00:14:55,500
(Even small things seem interesting after time in the countryside.)

378
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,230
- I need to have that ice cream. - Me too.

379
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,769
- Me too. - Nice.

380
00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:01,470
(Even frugal Dong Yeon can't think straight right now.)

381
00:15:01,539 --> 00:15:02,668
I want this.

382
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:04,210
(Swallowing hard)

383
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,479
(Are they from the forest?)

384
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,209
Three of this combination,

385
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:12,319
and 1 coffee, 2 vanillas,

386
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,450
- and one of these. - Okay.

387
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,950
(I'm excited.)

388
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,719
(Here comes the ice cream.)

389
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,989
They have an ice cream machine.

390
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:25,200
- They use a machine. - It's an ice cream dispenser.

391
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,898
I'll have vanilla too.

392
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:28,769
Dong Yeon, can you pay?

393
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:31,200
(Did something urgent come up?)

394
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,268
(While they're in town, )

395
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:33,439
I need to use the restroom.

396
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,370
(he uses the restroom.)

397
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,609
I need to pee but don't want to go to the bathroom.

398
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:42,949
(The sawdust bathroom makes them hold it in.)

399
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:46,850
(How long has it been since they had a flushing toilet?)

400
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,089
(He looks much brighter.)

401
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,120
Is our order ready?

402
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,918
I need to use the restroom too.

403
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:52,388
(They take turns using the flushing toilet.)

404
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:53,519
- I'll use the restroom. - Okay.

405
00:15:53,889 --> 00:15:55,029
Me too.

406
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:00,529
(The atmosphere has gotten lighter.)

407
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:04,569
(They now fully enjoy civilization.)

408
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:05,600
Who wants this?

409
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:12,239
Isn't this Eric Clapton, one of Dong Yeon's favorite singers?

410
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,009
(That's right.)

411
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,579
(While the duet...)

412
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,979
(is busy singing)

413
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,350
I want either one of these.

414
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:23,249
- This one? - No, this.

415
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,058
(The snack-loving duo are in their element.)

416
00:16:25,059 --> 00:16:27,590
- What about this? - No. Maybe a muffin?

417
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,529
Do you feel like a muffin?

418
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,299
(They carefully pile the plate up with baked goods.)

419
00:16:31,929 --> 00:16:33,028
Let's have one of each.

420
00:16:33,029 --> 00:16:35,830
(What?)

421
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,499
Wait a second.

422
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,469
- Do you take 1 of each? - Yes, just 1.

423
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,139
We didn't choose that much.

424
00:16:41,309 --> 00:16:42,340
One vanilla.

425
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,370
Thank you.

426
00:16:43,371 --> 00:16:45,039
- The coffee is here. - Okay.

427
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:48,179
This is how it works.

428
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:50,749
You can just pour the coffee.

429
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,450
(Coffee made with an electrical device)

430
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,749
(At their rented room, he had to grind the beans...)

431
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:59,719
(and start a fire.)

432
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,360
(It took 1 hour to make coffee.)

433
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:09,200
(All it takes is 10 seconds here.)

434
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,538
It's the technology of modern civilization.

435
00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:14,039
(He feels sad and disappointed at the same time.)

436
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:17,240
(They also pay at an electronic cash register.)

437
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:18,940
Let's go.

438
00:17:18,941 --> 00:17:21,108
- Thank you. - Thank you.

439
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:22,509
(They spend 45 dollars at the cafe detour.)

440
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:24,579
- This is so tasty. - I'm so happy right now.

441
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:26,220
It's so nice.

442
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,788
This is nice.

443
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:28,818
(They sit at the terrace of the cafe.)

444
00:17:28,819 --> 00:17:30,190
The weather is really nice.

445
00:17:30,589 --> 00:17:33,089
This is the Finland I imagined before coming here.

446
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,528
- Me too. - Right?

447
00:17:35,529 --> 00:17:36,659
(The city duo misses the city after visiting a cafe.)

448
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,900
Dong Hwi really does look happy.

449
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:43,869
(Same coffee, different face)

450
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,868
This is what I wanted.

451
00:17:45,869 --> 00:17:48,809
A cup of coffee in the city.

452
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:54,279
(He didn't expect to be 100 percent in nature.)

453
00:17:54,849 --> 00:17:57,880
(Counting their money in the midst of this joyous event)

454
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:05,220
(The Renters' mom suddenly starts counting their money.)

455
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,258
Dong Yeon is checking our expenses again.

456
00:18:07,259 --> 00:18:09,359
(Dong Hwi is flustered.)

457
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:13,059
Do you have a ledger?

458
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,200
(Audit: Do you have a ledger?)

459
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,930
(The air suddenly turns cold.)

460
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:20,839
(Answer wisely.)

461
00:18:22,609 --> 00:18:23,670
(Glancing at him)

462
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,640
(They're like an angry mom...)

463
00:18:26,009 --> 00:18:27,108
It's in my head.

464
00:18:27,109 --> 00:18:28,109
(and anxious dad.)

465
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:30,709
We have 460 dollars left.

466
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:34,519
(They spent over half the money in less than half their stay.)

467
00:18:34,819 --> 00:18:35,990
Isn't that fine?

468
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,119
(How dare you!)

469
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,789
(Trying to read Dong Yeon's face)

470
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:44,160
- Did you donate the money? - No.

471
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:47,130
Did you toss it in the lake to make a wish?

472
00:18:47,869 --> 00:18:49,900
I know you don't have it. I'm just asking.

473
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:52,470
(The youngest son is uncomfortable while his parents argue.)

474
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,740
- Actually, - Yes.

475
00:18:54,269 --> 00:18:57,768
- I gave Frida... - Frida?

476
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:59,439
Some money to buy herself snacks.

477
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,750
(The youngest son comes up with an idea.)

478
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,519
Do we get free refills?

479
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,189
I think the cafe owner...

480
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,249
(That's a good idea, Eun Woo.)

481
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,990
will be generous about refills.

482
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:15,059
Let's play rock, paper, scissors to see who will go and ask.

483
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:17,529
- Yes, let's ask. - That's embarrassing.

484
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,359
Rock, paper, scissors.

485
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,798
- Rock, paper, scissors. - Please let me win.

486
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:23,328
Goodness.

487
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,368
Goodness, please.

488
00:19:24,369 --> 00:19:25,669
(The youngest one who brought up about it got picked!)

489
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:27,769
- The one who wanted it got picked. - That's true.

490
00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:29,038
- I'll go and ask. - Okay.

491
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,410
- If they do, we'll get it refilled. - Yes.

492
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,479
Am I really going?

493
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,450
(Am I really going?)

494
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,419
What should I say?

495
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,719
"Refill" is an English word, right?

496
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,219
(Laughing)

497
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,789
- It's re-fill. - Right?

498
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,690
Do not use the word "refill," just in case.

499
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:47,259
- Don't say "refill." - Right. Refill...

500
00:19:47,859 --> 00:19:49,258
- Get a lot of coffee. - This is a little...

501
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:50,989
(Will he be able to refill it without saying the word?)

502
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,160
Is there a path over there?

503
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:54,500
Isn't that the way to the kitchen?

504
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:57,400
- This is the kitchen. - Come this way.

505
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,140
Eun Woo is uncomfortable at doing something like this.

506
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,709
Will you just...

507
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,239
(Reaching)

508
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,809
- Hey! - You can't do that.

509
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,578
(How dare you have your eye on the money?)

510
00:20:08,579 --> 00:20:09,680
It's for a refill.

511
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:10,979
- This is fun. - Yes.

512
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,279
Is "refill" an English word?

513
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,450
This is going to be fun.

514
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:18,758
He got really embarrassed at the restaurant yesterday too.

515
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:19,819
- That's right. - Well.

516
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,758
Refill...

517
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:23,690
(He is still thinking.)

518
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:25,960
(Completely nervous)

519
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:28,669
Can I have a little more coffee?

520
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:31,539
(He did it without saying the word refill!)

521
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:33,568
(Can he?)

522
00:20:33,569 --> 00:20:34,710
Yes.

523
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:38,579
(Fortunately, it's possible to get a free refill.)

524
00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:41,579
They are generous, indeed.

525
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,049
I'll fill it up.

526
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:48,819
(He fills it up, so he won't have to come back for it.)

527
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,119
Thanks.

528
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:54,589
It tastes good.

529
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:55,959
(He suddenly compliments it out of embarrassment.)

530
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,430
(Compressing his lips)

531
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:01,000
Eun Woo might say,

532
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,269
"Can we just eat what we have?"

533
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,199
Dong Hwi.

534
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,539
- He did it. - What?

535
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,009
What did you say to get it?

536
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:13,339
You got it secretly without asking him.

537
00:21:13,509 --> 00:21:15,710
- You didn't tell him, did you? - He got it without telling him?

538
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,509
Did you not ask for it?

539
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,619
- Dong Hwi, I'm not like that. - Is that so?

540
00:21:21,789 --> 00:21:24,048
- It's really hot. Let it cool down. - You filled up the cup.

541
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:25,419
Yes. To share with you.

542
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,660
- Good. - Thank you.

543
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:28,259
I didn't use the word, "refill."

544
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,529
- You didn't. - No.

545
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:32,959
- Let's get going now. - Let's go.

546
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,559
- It'll get cold soon. Let's go. - Right.

547
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,028
- Dong Yeon, - Yes?

548
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:37,769
- do we really have to go? - We do, Dong Hwi.

549
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,099
I love it here, though.

550
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,809
Honestly,

551
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,109
I love this place the most.

552
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,538
Dong Hwi and Eun Woo, you two stay and live here, then.

553
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:46,609
We're leaving.

554
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,909
I love it here. I want to stay and listen to music.

555
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,109
You can live here, but we're going to leave.

556
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,548
- Let's go. - I'm recharged.

557
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:53,778
Yes. Very much so.

558
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:54,789
(A dreamy moment comes to an end! It's time to go back!)

559
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:57,989
Gosh. When I think about going back, it feels...

560
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:59,319
(When I think about going back, it feels...)

561
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:05,159
(The man of nature hums as they return to the cottage.)

562
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,929
- Dong Yeon, are you happy? - Yes?

563
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,200
(Dong Yeon, are you happy?)

564
00:22:08,569 --> 00:22:10,568
(The man of nature is feeling good!)

565
00:22:10,569 --> 00:22:12,469
I can really live here...

566
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:13,470
(I can really live here.)

567
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,639
if there's a water supply.

568
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,869
(If there's a water supply)

569
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:18,539
I washed my hands and face back there.

570
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:21,979
I thought they had water supply because they had a faucet.

571
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,078
But that wasn't true.

572
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:26,980
They filled up the container and attached a faucet.

573
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:30,189
- But the water from the river... - It's so clean.

574
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,889
Is unbelievably clean here.

575
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,088
(The lake's water is clean, so it's okay without the waterworks!)

576
00:22:33,089 --> 00:22:34,828
(After talking for a while, )

577
00:22:34,829 --> 00:22:36,659
This is the place where we lose our signals.

578
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,729
(they are at the entrance of the no-signal zone.)

579
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:38,858
Are we already here?

580
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:40,430
(Laughing)

581
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:45,068
(They face the off-road forest again.)

582
00:22:45,069 --> 00:22:47,298
(They confine themselves in the deep forest again.)

583
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,539
We're almost there.

584
00:22:55,309 --> 00:22:56,779
- We're here. - We're here.

585
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:58,819
But we still have to walk quite a bit.

586
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,549
My goodness.

587
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:05,818
I feel like I got a little used to this lifestyle.

588
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:07,720
(I feel like I got a little used to this lifestyle.)

589
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:10,889
It's really pretty, though.

590
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,099
- That's right. - Yes.

591
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,358
Should I go for a boat ride?

592
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:15,868
(They are amazed by the unreal view of the front yard...)

593
00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:17,369
(whenever they see it.)

594
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,338
(In this uninhabited place...)

595
00:23:21,339 --> 00:23:26,009
(exists only nature and the renters.)

596
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,549
We came back.

597
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:29,849
I love it.

598
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:31,879
Now that it's our second day here,

599
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,479
- it feels like home. - Right.

600
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,149
- It feels familiar. - Right.

601
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,518
(It's really cozy like home.)

602
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:38,018
Should we get some rest...

603
00:23:38,019 --> 00:23:39,959
- before getting ready to cook? - Yes.

604
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,420
I'll zone out a bit.

605
00:23:42,289 --> 00:23:44,229
(Current time: 4pm)

606
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:49,599
(What can the city boys do to have fun in the no-signal zone?)

607
00:23:51,369 --> 00:23:55,868
(Shaking)

608
00:23:55,869 --> 00:23:58,179
(The oldest brother shakes off the dust in the pastoral scenery.)

609
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,909
Hey. It'd feel great...

610
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:03,349
to wash clothes and shake them off in this view.

611
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:07,519
(Meanwhile, Eun Woo, who said he'd zone out, )

612
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:11,420
(sits at the edge of the dock, the 1st row to the lake view.)

613
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:15,789
(It's his first time to relax since he arrived in Finland.)

614
00:24:17,529 --> 00:24:20,630
(He indulges the panoramic view of the lake in front of the house.)

615
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,309
(He takes off his socks!)

616
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:36,450
(Then he rolls up his pants.)

617
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:41,588
(A foot bath in the cold lake)

618
00:24:41,589 --> 00:24:42,890
It's so cold.

619
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:49,159
(He's more used to the lake than a shower head.)

620
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,159
(It's peaceful and quiet in front of the lake.)

621
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,799
Did my phone lose signal again?

622
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,999
(He turns on his phone again.)

623
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,069
It doesn't have a signal.

624
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:02,209
I used up the portable charger I brought with me.

625
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,409
(I used up the portable charger.)

626
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,108
(City Dong Hwi is going crazy because he wants to know...)

627
00:25:05,109 --> 00:25:06,808
(what's going on around the world.)

628
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:10,250
(He whistles to relieve the boredom.)

629
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,179
(Zoning out)

630
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,250
Gosh. At this place,

631
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:17,689
no one will hear me even if I scream.

632
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:20,990
(There are only 4 of us within 20km radius.)

633
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:25,429
(No-signal zone)

634
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,930
(What will they do now in the vast wilderness?)

635
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:32,769
(Meanwhile, the man of nature wanders toward the forest.)

636
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,709
(He lets his feet lead him...)

637
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:40,109
(to a lonesome place.)

638
00:25:40,579 --> 00:25:44,210
(He must have found a spot that suits him.)

639
00:25:45,549 --> 00:25:48,119
(Cracking)

640
00:25:48,289 --> 00:25:52,118
(He enjoys the taste of the civilization in nature.)

641
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:55,758
(The man of nature is following the stream of consciousness again.)

642
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:59,328
(Meanwhile, the city boys in front of the lake...)

643
00:25:59,329 --> 00:26:05,700
(The city boy plays the cassette as he couldn't take it anymore.)

644
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,339
(This song is...)

645
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:12,239
(A K-ballad song spreads...)

646
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,440
(across the cottage at the end of the world.)

647
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:18,180
(Gazing gently)

648
00:26:19,349 --> 00:26:20,779
Dong Hwi, what was this song?

649
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:25,160
"Fool" by Park Hyo Shin.

650
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:26,460
"Pool?"

651
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:28,859
(Laughing)

652
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:31,359
(Laughing)

653
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,529
Hey.

654
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,430
- "Pool?" - Come on.

655
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:35,970
Hold on.

656
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,299
Time out.

657
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:39,769
- Eun Woo. - Yes?

658
00:26:40,069 --> 00:26:41,970
You're just like the title of the song.

659
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:45,479
It's such a heartrending ballad.

660
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,809
It can't be a "Pool."

661
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:48,909
"Fool."

662
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,649
(Come on.)

663
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,720
(The fool gets a small revenge.)

664
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:55,749
(This is crazy. He's just pure and happy.)

665
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,889
You're doing it again.

666
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:58,588
- You might break it. - Okay.

667
00:26:58,589 --> 00:26:59,759
I'll break too.

668
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,588
(Looking around)

669
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:06,160
Dong Yeon is really by himself, right?

670
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,400
Where did he go?

671
00:27:08,529 --> 00:27:11,068
I think he went in somewhere like there.

672
00:27:11,069 --> 00:27:12,868
(Dong Yeon is Missing 2)

673
00:27:12,869 --> 00:27:14,000
Where is he?

674
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,849
(Did the man of nature find something?)

675
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,349
(It was wild berries!)

676
00:27:28,589 --> 00:27:30,649
(He enjoys the salty-and-sweet combination...)

677
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,690
(with the wild berries and chips!)

678
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:37,230
(The man of nature seeks a higher ground.)

679
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:40,559
(This is it!)

680
00:27:42,029 --> 00:27:45,799
(He takes out the knife that is part of his body now.)

681
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:51,109
(Is he checking the quality of the rock?)

682
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:01,380
(Where he lies his body is a bed for him.)

683
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:06,358
(Deep inside the backyard of the cottage, )

684
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:08,318
(Mr. Kwak becomes one...)

685
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:09,858
(with the forest.)

686
00:28:09,859 --> 00:28:11,489
It's important that I believe in it.

687
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:14,058
It doesn't matter what it is. A true actor...

688
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:16,670
(Practicing his lines for a play)

689
00:28:17,869 --> 00:28:21,639
(Actor Kwak is professional at what he does.)

690
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,970
(Right?)

691
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,680
We'll use the firewood...

692
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,679
again in the evening.

693
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,349
(We'll use the firewood again in the evening.)

694
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,879
(Turning on the guardian mode)

695
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,880
(He splits firewood while the younger brothers have fun.)

696
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,450
(Should I show them what I can do?)

697
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,088
(Slamming)

698
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:45,298
Gosh.

699
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:47,460
(Running hurriedly)

700
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:53,039
(But he gradually gets the hang of it.)

701
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,038
Gosh. I'm so tough.

702
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,169
(Gosh. I'm so tough.)

703
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:59,279
(I need to split more firewood for dinner!)

704
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,579
But if you go that far...

705
00:29:03,349 --> 00:29:06,980
(The problematic man of nature appears.)

706
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,049
- Dong Yeon. Come here. - Yes?

707
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,930
Why are you wearing the vest?

708
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,599
(Laughing uncontrollably)

709
00:29:19,829 --> 00:29:21,430
- Dong Yeon. - I have to set out on a voyage.

710
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:22,970
But...

711
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,739
(He's getting beyond interesting.)

712
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,868
(He doesn't care.)

713
00:29:26,869 --> 00:29:29,140
(I'm going my way.)

714
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,970
What? Are you going to ride the boat?

715
00:29:32,109 --> 00:29:33,240
Why can't I pull it?

716
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:38,349
(Oiva did it in one go.)

717
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,720
(Groaning)

718
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,220
(Groaning)

719
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,419
(His friend comes to help...)

720
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,089
(as he keeps making an old man's groaning sound.)

721
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:48,559
(Groaning)

722
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:51,089
Give it a little push.

723
00:29:51,259 --> 00:29:52,329
- Do you want a push? - Yes.

724
00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:55,769
(Spreading his legs wide open)

725
00:29:55,829 --> 00:29:57,068
(Goodness)

726
00:29:57,069 --> 00:29:58,539
Be careful. Hey.

727
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:00,139
(Be careful with your crotch.)

728
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,868
- Be careful. Hey. - Be careful, Eun Woo.

729
00:30:01,869 --> 00:30:03,209
(A painstakingly beautiful friendship)

730
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:05,140
- Eun Woo. - Hey.

731
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,609
(The man of nature leaves on a voyage alone again.)

732
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,019
Dong Yeon, how far are you going to go?

733
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,279
Don't go too far.

734
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:18,489
(In the midst of the chaos, )

735
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:20,319
(Je Hoon, the guardian, piles up the firewood.)

736
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:24,329
(The scenery of the rented cottage in the no-signal zone)

737
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:27,329
(The oldest brother is proud after piling up the firewood for dinner.)

738
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:35,069
(The second oldest brother sings while playing his favorite tape.)

739
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:41,880
(The youngest takes a nap while dipping his feet in the lake.)

740
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:58,859
(The man of nature goes on a picnic on a small boat.)

741
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:11,740
(The city boys are getting quite used to the life of Lapland.)

742
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:20,779
(Enjoying the relaxing time they earned from adapting to nature)

743
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,990
(He's lying down for the 2nd time today.)

744
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:32,529
(He found a broom mic.)

745
00:31:36,029 --> 00:31:39,339
(The sound of his singing wakes the man of nature up.)

746
00:31:40,569 --> 00:31:42,868
(With 1 hand in his pocket and 1 hand around the broom, )

747
00:31:42,869 --> 00:31:45,339
(he sings while looking at the lake.)

748
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,710
(Like a flame)

749
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:51,279
(He casually joins for a duet.)

750
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:55,019
(The song picks up momentum as Dong Brother joins him.)

751
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:57,890
(A fierce serenade by the two men)

752
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:00,660
(He has never seen anything like it before.)

753
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,358
(A master singer...)

754
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:08,230
(and a handsome fool next to him)

755
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:14,269
(The harmony at its peak)

756
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,940
(Screaming)

757
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:19,439
(Still feeling it)

758
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,680
For goodness sake.

759
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,048
I can sing better here.

760
00:32:23,049 --> 00:32:24,549
Is it because the air is clear?

761
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,679
- Did you have fun? - Yes.

762
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,690
(After a fierce duet, the man of nature comes back to the dock.)

763
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:34,059
(Soldierly)

764
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:37,990
(Will he be able to park the boat inside the narrow space?)

765
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,058
He looks serious.

766
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:41,599
It seems it's not going as he planned.

767
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,670
(How do I put this in there?)

768
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:46,068
I'll turn it and...

769
00:32:46,069 --> 00:32:47,368
(As they see Planner Kwak on a weak mode, )

770
00:32:47,369 --> 00:32:50,209
Dong Hwi, should I make him never be able to park?

771
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,210
(he wants to tease him.)

772
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,979
(Go back.)

773
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:57,179
(Enduring)

774
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,849
- Good. - I'm fine yet.

775
00:32:58,980 --> 00:32:59,980
Dong Yeon.

776
00:32:59,981 --> 00:33:01,849
(You're not fine.)

777
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,848
It's hilarious, but...

778
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:06,160
Gosh. He's even strong.

779
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:09,660
(Mischievous Eun Woo is even strong.)

780
00:33:09,789 --> 00:33:12,730
(I'll get going.)

781
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:14,930
- Bye, Dong Yeon. - This is funny.

782
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:17,528
- I'm going in. - Okay.

783
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:18,940
- Yes. - Come back

784
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,439
(A confrontation)

785
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,380
(Pleading for clemency)

786
00:33:25,809 --> 00:33:26,939
- Dong Yeon. - Yes.

787
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,140
Cook us a delicious dinner.

788
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,079
I said I'd make an incredible kimchi stew.

789
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:33,818
- Thank you. - It's hard to park the boat alone.

790
00:33:33,819 --> 00:33:35,150
It won't be easy.

791
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:37,250
Oiva is truly amazing.

792
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,558
Watch your feet.

793
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,690
(Struggling)

794
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,499
That's it.

795
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,900
(They join forces to barely pull it up.)

796
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,969
Gosh. I need to wash my feet again.

797
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,829
(They look peaceful in a flash.)

798
00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:55,639
(But...)

799
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,440
(Sighing)

800
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:02,210
(There's an elephant in the room.)

801
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,579
(Cutting quietly)

802
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:10,989
(2 of them have to sleep here.)

803
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:12,389
Dong Hwi.

804
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:16,059
(The ones who slept hanging on the trees last night...)

805
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:19,629
(In the icy-cold weather, )

806
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:22,900
(they had an icy-cold battle.)

807
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:27,940
(A dizzying night on the tree tents)

808
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:29,138
Are you alive?

809
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:32,710
(It's a pain they never want to experience again.)

810
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:36,279
(No matter what, we will sleep inside tonight.)

811
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,480
A game...

812
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,819
(Dong Brothers are clenching their teeth.)

813
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,820
What can we play?

814
00:34:40,849 --> 00:34:43,650
(They are more serious than ever to choose a game.)

815
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,489
In fact, with the photos, I wanted to guess who they were.

816
00:34:45,789 --> 00:34:48,320
But we can't download the photos without the internet.

817
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:51,959
(In order to play the game of Guess Who, )

818
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,860
(they have to travel 2 hours back and forth.)

819
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,158
What can we do?

820
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,268
(The witnesses are careful about it too.)

821
00:34:57,269 --> 00:34:58,400
Okay. Then...

822
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:01,699
(A silent tension fills up the front yard.)

823
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:03,739
Hey. How about Word Chain?

824
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:04,869
Okay.

825
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:05,879
Should we play Word Chain?

826
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,809
Yes. Word Chain is nice and classic.

827
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,308
- Let's try it. - Let's do it.

828
00:35:09,309 --> 00:35:10,479
- Are we trying it? - Yes.

829
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,320
(A classic game, World Chain, that suits the classic place.)

830
00:35:13,019 --> 00:35:16,289
(The last match with the night in the air at stake)

831
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:20,820
(Will they struggle in discomfort?)

832
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:25,929
(Or will they greet a cozy morning?)

833
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:28,968
Let's try it first. For now...

834
00:35:28,969 --> 00:35:30,099
Okay. For now...

835
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:31,868
(The 4th lumbar vertebra remembers...)

836
00:35:31,869 --> 00:35:34,139
(the night in the private room.)

837
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:36,169
(He has been prepared sharply...)

838
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:38,269
(for this match!)

839
00:35:38,409 --> 00:35:39,539
Are we doing it for real?

840
00:35:41,809 --> 00:35:44,409
(A kind brother in town)

841
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:47,750
Should we change to find who endures a bug the longest?

842
00:35:48,889 --> 00:35:50,389
(An eccentric brother who is addicted to jokes)

843
00:35:50,989 --> 00:35:52,619
(Fierce)

844
00:35:54,389 --> 00:35:56,559
(An unpredictable, freestyle brother)

845
00:35:58,429 --> 00:36:00,599
(Everyone's type)

846
00:36:00,699 --> 00:36:03,129
The bottom one, the first to get eliminated,

847
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:05,229
will lay in the first coffin.

848
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:07,269
- Okay. - No. It's not a coffin.

849
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:09,569
- The last one will have Tent One? - Yes.

850
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:12,139
(Tent One is...)

851
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,109
(Last night)

852
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,308
(Tent 1, Tent 2)

853
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:19,519
(Of the two tents, )

854
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:21,550
(Surprised)

855
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:26,619
(it's even hard to go up into the Tent 1.)

856
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:30,089
(On top of that, )

857
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:33,360
(the wind blows straight to it.)

858
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,099
(Dizzy)

859
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:40,139
(I'll run away if I get picked again)

860
00:36:40,269 --> 00:36:42,439
We'll go in this order, starting from Dong Yeon.

861
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,369
- Okay. - Dong Yeon, Je Hoon, me, and you.

862
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,138
It has to be three syllables.

863
00:36:46,139 --> 00:36:47,379
(Three syllable rule)

864
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,739
- Let's go. - Let's go.

865
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:50,109
A three-syllable word.

866
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:53,718
- Kungkung-dda. - Kungkung-dda.

867
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:57,448
Husky. Kungkung-dda.

868
00:36:57,449 --> 00:37:00,288
(Ki...)

869
00:37:00,289 --> 00:37:02,659
- What? - This is...

870
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,328
(Is he stuck on his first try?)

871
00:37:06,329 --> 00:37:07,659
You can't do that.

872
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:09,670
But this is so...

873
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:12,169
- Just say it. - It's okay.

874
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:14,900
(What is the word that he's reluctant to say it?)

875
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,109
(Hesitant)

876
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:17,210
Is it okay to say it?

877
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:18,368
Will you do it again?

878
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:20,109
- Husky. Kungkung-dda. - Kungkung-dda.

879
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:22,210
(He begins to speak with determination.)

880
00:37:22,349 --> 00:37:24,079
Kiss me. Kungkung-dda.

881
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,079
(The tension strips off from the beginning.)

882
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:30,320
(Unpleasant)

883
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:32,760
(Serious)

884
00:37:34,059 --> 00:37:35,360
It does work, though.

885
00:37:35,989 --> 00:37:37,259
Okay. Let's do it again.

886
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,960
- Je Hoon, we'll let that pass. - Okay.

887
00:37:39,429 --> 00:37:40,698
You know how to do it now, right, Je Hoon?

888
00:37:40,699 --> 00:37:42,059
Okay. Let's go.

889
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:45,170
(Now, if one gets it wrong, he'll get eliminated!)

890
00:37:45,739 --> 00:37:47,238
Bl-berry.

891
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:48,739
(Bl-berry?)

892
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,709
(He shortens blueberries...)

893
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:52,879
(to bl-berry to play the game.)

894
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,380
(Confident)

895
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:56,908
Hurry up. Kungkung-dda.

896
00:37:56,909 --> 00:37:58,550
- Rivera, kungkung-dda. - Kungkung-dda.

897
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:00,149
Lilac, kungkung-dda.

898
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,880
Rock star, kungkung-dda.

899
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,519
- Oh-strich, kungkung-dda. - Kungkung-dda.

900
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:05,518
(This time, he extended the word "ostrich.")

901
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:07,219
Oh-strich? Okay. Kungkung-dda.

902
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,820
Kungkung-dda.

903
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,859
- Continue. - Continue.

904
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,229
Kungkung-dda.

905
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:13,860
Joe Black, kungkung-dda.

906
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:16,199
Tow-truck service, kungkung-dda.

907
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,769
- Kungkung-dda. - Hold on.

908
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:21,739
(Making silent syllables urgently?)

909
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:23,238
- Hold on. - Let it pass.

910
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:25,139
(Laughing silently)

911
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:26,709
(Laughing)

912
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,610
- Tow-truck service, kungkung-dda. - It's crazy.

913
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:30,650
Tow-truck service, kungkung-dda.

914
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:31,980
Service is one syllable.

915
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,480
Gosh. This is...

916
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:36,618
We'll let it pass if one persuades us with his charm.

917
00:38:36,619 --> 00:38:38,288
- Since it's an individual match. - Yes.

918
00:38:38,289 --> 00:38:40,219
(Suddenly, he tries to bring out their charms.)

919
00:38:40,789 --> 00:38:43,289
I was going to let everything pass and keep playing.

920
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,988
I've never felt...

921
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,629
this energetic ever since I came here.

922
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,699
I'm so excited.

923
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,629
All right. Let's focus now.

924
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,630
- Okay. - Okay.

925
00:38:51,631 --> 00:38:53,570
From Dong Yeon, let's do it for real now.

926
00:38:54,539 --> 00:38:55,839
- Again. - Again.

927
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,868
- For real. - Right.

928
00:38:56,869 --> 00:38:57,969
(They begin the game again.)

929
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,678
- Kungkung-dda. - Kungkung-dda.

930
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:01,279
- Kettle, kungkung-dda. - Kungkung-dda.

931
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,948
- Bicycle, kungkung-dda. - Kungkung-dda.

932
00:39:02,949 --> 00:39:04,309
Well...

933
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:07,379
- Five, four, - Five, four...

934
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,288
- three... - Cobweb, kungkung-dda.

935
00:39:09,289 --> 00:39:11,018
Wife, kungkung-dda.

936
00:39:11,019 --> 00:39:12,019
(His future wife must be so happy.)

937
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,888
- Amsa-dong, kungkung-dda. - Okay, good.

938
00:39:14,889 --> 00:39:16,559
- Club, kungkung-dda. - Kungkung-dda.

939
00:39:16,659 --> 00:39:17,659
(What's next?)

940
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:18,690
Well...

941
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:22,968
- Five, four, three, - Five, four, three,

942
00:39:22,969 --> 00:39:24,328
- two... - two...

943
00:39:24,329 --> 00:39:27,039
Handcart, kungkung-dda.

944
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,039
Cassette, kungkung-dda.

945
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:31,509
Trend, kungkung-dda.

946
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:33,340
Drama, kungkung-dda.

947
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:35,750
Mario, kungkung-dda.

948
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,449
Audio, kungkung-dda.

949
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:40,879
(To avoid sleeping in the air, )

950
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,789
(they compete fiercely.)

951
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,948
NewJeans.

952
00:39:43,949 --> 00:39:45,018
(This messy game continues...)

953
00:39:45,019 --> 00:39:47,260
(for 30 minutes.)

954
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:49,329
(Tired)

955
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,590
(Drained)

956
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:53,899
- Yogurt, kungkung-dda. - Good.

957
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,058
- That again? - Yes.

958
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,499
(It came out quite often.)

959
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,099
Let's end it this time.

960
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:00,500
(Well, then...)

961
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:02,539
Twist, kungkung-dda.

962
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,939
(It's a four-syllable word, but they let this much slide now.)

963
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,279
He's good.

964
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,139
- It's that again? - Yes.

965
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:09,579
Je Hoon.

966
00:40:10,579 --> 00:40:12,449
(His roommate from yesterday is up to help him.)

967
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:13,719
(Twerking)

968
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:16,320
Oh, I get it.

969
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:22,319
(A sexy hint...)

970
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,089
(gets him to twist his body.)

971
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,800
- Come on. - Are you that shocked?

972
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:29,328
- How mean. - Are you that shocked?

973
00:40:29,329 --> 00:40:30,669
- Hey. - Je Hoon, this.

974
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:31,768
Can this be aired?

975
00:40:31,769 --> 00:40:33,738
- Of course, it's just dancing. - It's just a dance move.

976
00:40:33,739 --> 00:40:35,368
- Okay. - Kungkung-dda.

977
00:40:35,369 --> 00:40:37,909
(They pull themselves together and resume the game.)

978
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:39,010
T...

979
00:40:39,011 --> 00:40:41,409
(He just can't say the word out loud.)

980
00:40:41,809 --> 00:40:44,049
(He's too innocent and shy.)

981
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:45,409
- You've got to do the dance too. - Do it.

982
00:40:45,449 --> 00:40:46,780
- Do it as you say the word. - Right.

983
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:48,650
What? No.

984
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,289
Then, are you okay with losing?

985
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:52,959
No, I can do it.

986
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,389
You can do it, but you won't?

987
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:56,029
- Well... - I can easily do it.

988
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,558
- I can keep doing it. - Me too.

989
00:40:57,559 --> 00:40:58,630
I can do it if I have to.

990
00:40:59,659 --> 00:41:01,599
(He's torn...)

991
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:04,529
(between mid-air sleeping in the cold...)

992
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:06,269
(and losing his dignity.)

993
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,670
(Take this.)

994
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:10,170
Twerking.

995
00:41:10,909 --> 00:41:12,309
(Becoming serious)

996
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,909
(Screaming)

997
00:41:14,179 --> 00:41:15,179
(To avoid sleeping in the mid-air tent, )

998
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,949
(he takes every resort.)

999
00:41:17,409 --> 00:41:18,549
(It's shocking...)

1000
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:20,750
(even for the one who caused this.)

1001
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:23,750
Goodness, I watched "Architecture 101."

1002
00:41:24,219 --> 00:41:26,019
(The memories have been restructured.)

1003
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:28,759
(His face blushes more than a monkey's buttocks.)

1004
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,788
Let's not do this.

1005
00:41:29,789 --> 00:41:31,629
Gosh, this is too...

1006
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:33,960
(His agency's actor is feeling so embarrassed.)

1007
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:35,399
Let's do it for real.

1008
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,570
Let's do what's needed for real now.

1009
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:39,069
We've played this game for more than an hour.

1010
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,399
Right,

1011
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,670
so let's flick a bottle cap...

1012
00:41:42,969 --> 00:41:45,409
to have it reach as close to the finishing line as possible.

1013
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:47,138
- But if it falls, you're out. - Okay.

1014
00:41:47,139 --> 00:41:48,479
That person will sleep in the tent.

1015
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,979
- Okay. - Let's do it without practice.

1016
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,550
- Of course. - Okay.

1017
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,919
- But... - Even if something unlucky happens,

1018
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,078
- let's just go on. - Okay.

1019
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:56,549
No playing easy.

1020
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:57,618
No exceptions.

1021
00:41:57,619 --> 00:41:58,820
- Right away. - Right away.

1022
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:00,360
- I'll go. - Let's go.

1023
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:03,360
(Twerking Je Hoon is up first.)

1024
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:06,460
(Carefully getting ready)

1025
00:42:06,829 --> 00:42:10,630
(He can't afford to lose after all that twerking.)

1026
00:42:10,769 --> 00:42:12,129
(He's all spiteful and focused.)

1027
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:13,538
- Let's go. - I'll go.

1028
00:42:13,539 --> 00:42:14,839
A little more.

1029
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,110
Flick it sideways.

1030
00:42:16,139 --> 00:42:17,638
Hey, stop giving me instructions.

1031
00:42:17,639 --> 00:42:18,739
(Playing innocent)

1032
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,879
There's an obstacle on the way.

1033
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,879
(The patronizer backs down, )

1034
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,808
(and the prankster comes.)

1035
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:26,919
Gosh.

1036
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,118
(The youngest members attack together.)

1037
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:30,289
This is...

1038
00:42:30,619 --> 00:42:32,049
- like war. - I'll go.

1039
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,519
A little to the right.

1040
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,919
There...

1041
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,189
(Flicking through the disturbance)

1042
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:37,288
There...

1043
00:42:37,289 --> 00:42:38,559
(Super focused)

1044
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,428
- Well done. - Not bad.

1045
00:42:41,429 --> 00:42:42,630
Gosh, it's too short.

1046
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:45,669
If it falls, does it count?

1047
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:46,769
- Yes. - I see.

1048
00:42:47,369 --> 00:42:48,769
If it falls, you'll enter...

1049
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:50,409
the tent right away.

1050
00:42:50,769 --> 00:42:53,239
(There will be no second chance.)

1051
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,038
(Next up is Dong Yeon.)

1052
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:56,110
- Dong Yeon. - There's a fruit fly here.

1053
00:42:56,309 --> 00:42:58,309
(Shaking a bug swatter)

1054
00:42:58,579 --> 00:42:59,650
Dong Yeon.

1055
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:01,719
There are too many winged insects.

1056
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,189
(Yesterday's loser...)

1057
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:06,118
(wouldn't be disturbed.)

1058
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:07,420
That's not it.

1059
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:09,019
Come on.

1060
00:43:09,389 --> 00:43:10,429
Dong Yeon.

1061
00:43:10,659 --> 00:43:12,230
It's not that finger.

1062
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:13,698
(Fierce)

1063
00:43:13,699 --> 00:43:14,759
Gosh, the fruit fly.

1064
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,928
No, Dong Yeon.

1065
00:43:15,929 --> 00:43:17,070
(He must really hate to sleep outdoors.)

1066
00:43:17,429 --> 00:43:18,629
Take it easy.

1067
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:19,638
(He flicks...)

1068
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,170
(with an incredible sense of focus.)

1069
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:22,238
Take it easy.

1070
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:24,840
(Surprised)

1071
00:43:24,909 --> 00:43:26,408
(Je Hoon)

1072
00:43:26,409 --> 00:43:28,738
(Dong Yeon wouldn't take it easy.)

1073
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:30,249
- He's good. - Nice.

1074
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:32,009
(He's not the bottom-place player of this round.)

1075
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:33,178
This is...

1076
00:43:33,179 --> 00:43:35,119
(He just has to win one more time.)

1077
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:36,888
(Meanwhile...)

1078
00:43:36,889 --> 00:43:38,049
I want to play safely.

1079
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:39,319
Oh, you'll go that way?

1080
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,888
(Je Hoon, Dong Yeon)

1081
00:43:40,889 --> 00:43:41,919
(Maybe he feels burdened.)

1082
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,329
(He chooses to take a safe way.)

1083
00:43:44,429 --> 00:43:47,059
It's quite bumpy there.

1084
00:43:47,829 --> 00:43:49,968
(Compared to the right side, )

1085
00:43:49,969 --> 00:43:53,070
(it's bumpy on the left side.)

1086
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:54,839
- Player Eun Woo... - I'm ready.

1087
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,899
- is off to make an attempt. - It's going to fall.

1088
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,609
- Three, two, one. - He's quite strained.

1089
00:43:57,610 --> 00:43:58,709
Bungee!

1090
00:43:58,710 --> 00:43:59,710
He's too strained.

1091
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:00,710
(Flicking)

1092
00:44:02,409 --> 00:44:03,979
- It fell. - Oh, dear.

1093
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,010
Game over.

1094
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:06,649
Oh, dear.

1095
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:07,650
(The twerker is all excited.)

1096
00:44:07,651 --> 00:44:09,518
That's an unexpected variable.

1097
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:10,650
Eun Woo will sleep in the tent.

1098
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:12,149
Gosh, I didn't...

1099
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,689
see it coming at all.

1100
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:16,058
It's really not easy to make it roll like that.

1101
00:44:16,059 --> 00:44:17,488
How did he get it up?

1102
00:44:17,489 --> 00:44:18,658
- Eun Woo. - Oh, gosh.

1103
00:44:18,659 --> 00:44:19,699
(Eun Woo managed to do something that tricky.)

1104
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:22,329
(Welcome. Isn't it your first time sleeping in the mid-air tent?)

1105
00:44:22,429 --> 00:44:23,729
Still, you should try it.

1106
00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:25,069
- Okay. - Come on.

1107
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:26,570
- Give it a try. - Okay, I will.

1108
00:44:27,269 --> 00:44:29,070
It should at least go farther than this.

1109
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:30,738
- I... - Not this area.

1110
00:44:30,739 --> 00:44:32,880
(If it doesn't pass the base line, they will go again.)

1111
00:44:33,409 --> 00:44:34,480
I...

1112
00:44:34,579 --> 00:44:36,408
You know me so well.

1113
00:44:36,409 --> 00:44:38,779
You really... I mean...

1114
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:39,819
- You know, 1cm is not allowed. - Right.

1115
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:41,979
- Right, it must at least pass here. - Right.

1116
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,749
- Make a line. - Or you'll be out.

1117
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:44,788
Right.

1118
00:44:44,789 --> 00:44:45,819
I can do this much.

1119
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:47,690
(Meanwhile, he's overly relaxed.)

1120
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,328
Let's make it fun.

1121
00:44:50,329 --> 00:44:51,359
- What's fun? - Dong Hwi.

1122
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,459
It's not fun for me.

1123
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:54,230
- There has to be a twist. - A twist?

1124
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:57,729
- There has to be a twist. - A twist?

1125
00:44:57,730 --> 00:44:58,799
(You want a twist?)

1126
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,499
(I don't.)

1127
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:01,569
It's Eun Woo.

1128
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:02,570
(Eun Woo was a promising candidate.)

1129
00:45:02,571 --> 00:45:04,339
(And now, he's confirmed to sleep in the tree tent.)

1130
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:05,409
Gosh.

1131
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:07,678
(Laughing out loud)

1132
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:09,610
(How sweet.)

1133
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:11,549
Let's do it for the last time.

1134
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:13,780
No, we've got to eat now.

1135
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:16,018
But we need one more person to sleep outdoors anyway.

1136
00:45:16,019 --> 00:45:18,789
We can decide by firewood-laying.

1137
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,018
Fine.

1138
00:45:21,019 --> 00:45:23,129
Eun Woo, search for ways...

1139
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:24,158
to raise your body temperature...

1140
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:25,658
while the three of us do the firewood-laying.

1141
00:45:25,659 --> 00:45:27,399
He's so desperate.

1142
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,500
He uses his handsome looks on us.

1143
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:30,800
Look at the lake at a time like this.

1144
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:32,968
(He understands Dong Yeon.)

1145
00:45:32,969 --> 00:45:35,039
Anyway, it's just the four of us.

1146
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,468
Not a dozen people.

1147
00:45:37,469 --> 00:45:38,469
- It's just us four. - Right.

1148
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:39,579
Dong Yeon.

1149
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:42,110
(Swinging)

1150
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:44,379
All right. Whatever.

1151
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:45,448
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1152
00:45:45,449 --> 00:45:46,780
- To where the firewood is. - Let's go and see.

1153
00:45:47,349 --> 00:45:49,178
See what? There's no way for you, Eun Woo.

1154
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:51,149
(There's no need to see because...)

1155
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:52,719
- Come on. - Let's go.

1156
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:54,889
(Stunned)

1157
00:45:55,389 --> 00:45:58,260
(Dong Yeon is out.)

1158
00:45:58,489 --> 00:45:59,959
(Dong Yeon is confirmed to sleep in the tree tent again.)

1159
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:02,329
Good game.

1160
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:05,129
So my friend is my sleeping mate.

1161
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:06,139
(He's given up.)

1162
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:08,800
Goodness. Have a good night.

1163
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:13,480
(He's devastated just like this fallen firewood tower.)

1164
00:46:13,579 --> 00:46:15,079
I've already done it once. I can do it again.

1165
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:18,110
(The rest is omitted.)

1166
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:21,380
I'll be going. It feels a little uneasy here.

1167
00:46:21,579 --> 00:46:22,888
Gosh, Dong Hwi.

1168
00:46:22,889 --> 00:46:23,920
(The games are over with the youngest as losers.)

1169
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,629
(Sleeping is one thing.)

1170
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:32,459
- You'll steam rice? Okay. - Yes.

1171
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:33,460
(Let's get the food ready first.)

1172
00:46:33,461 --> 00:46:34,698
(Going to their positions)

1173
00:46:34,699 --> 00:46:35,760
Meat.

1174
00:46:36,829 --> 00:46:38,868
Should I cut and grill the meat?

1175
00:46:38,869 --> 00:46:39,999
Can you grill it well?

1176
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,639
Yes, I'm good at it.

1177
00:46:42,539 --> 00:46:45,408
(Stir-fried shredded potatoes, stir-fried spicy pork)

1178
00:46:45,409 --> 00:46:46,939
(He learned how to cook in Lapland.)

1179
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:49,039
(Chef Cha Eun Woo for Korean barbecue)

1180
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:53,750
(Rye sujebi, cabbage doenjang soup)

1181
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,448
(He's like a food bending machine.)

1182
00:46:55,449 --> 00:46:57,889
(Chef Kwak Dong Yeon for kimchi stew and pot steamed rice)

1183
00:46:59,789 --> 00:47:02,018
I'll grill the meat...

1184
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:03,058
when you start making kimchi stew.

1185
00:47:03,059 --> 00:47:05,129
- Okay. - That will do, right?

1186
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:06,729
(But the problem is...)

1187
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:07,760
We'll steam rice.

1188
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,670
- The problem is... - Yes?

1189
00:47:09,969 --> 00:47:12,799
That we have to grill the meat here.

1190
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,368
(How are they supposed to grill meat at this fireplace?)

1191
00:47:14,369 --> 00:47:17,570
(There's nowhere to place a grill.)

1192
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,939
(They've waited so long...)

1193
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:23,250
(for kimchi barbecue.)

1194
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:26,979
(Korean barbecue...)

1195
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:29,449
(in the countryside of Finland)

1196
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:34,590
(Was it too much to ask for?)

1197
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:40,999
(They dreamed of Korean soul food in the dense forest.)

1198
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,630
(How will their fate turn out to be?)

1199
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:47,538
We have to grill the meat here.

1200
00:47:47,539 --> 00:47:48,968
I have an idea.

1201
00:47:48,969 --> 00:47:49,969
What is it?

1202
00:47:50,269 --> 00:47:53,079
I'm going to stack up some bricks.

1203
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:56,138
(He'll try to remodel their outdoor kitchen.)

1204
00:47:56,139 --> 00:47:57,610
- You'll place a grill there? - Yes.

1205
00:47:58,449 --> 00:48:00,879
- Like this? - I think it's better.

1206
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,848
- I'll move these away then. - Yes, those two stones.

1207
00:48:02,849 --> 00:48:04,018
(Will they pull off remodeling the fireplace?)

1208
00:48:04,019 --> 00:48:05,488
To the side.

1209
00:48:05,489 --> 00:48:08,289
(Securing enough space to put up a brazier)

1210
00:48:11,059 --> 00:48:12,328
- Thanks. - No problem.

1211
00:48:12,329 --> 00:48:14,159
(Moving bricks)

1212
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:18,069
(Stacking them up one after another)

1213
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:19,639
- The rest... Okay. - All the rest on that side.

1214
00:48:23,369 --> 00:48:25,368
(The city boys couldn't even light a fire, )

1215
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:27,409
(but now, they're trying to remodel the fireplace.)

1216
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:32,149
(Checking level)

1217
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:33,678
- Kind of. - Kind of.

1218
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:35,380
(It's a little higher on this side.)

1219
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:37,849
I can just lower this part.

1220
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:41,320
(He tends to handle everything with power.)

1221
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,488
Je Hoon, this is a nice way to work out.

1222
00:48:44,489 --> 00:48:45,630
(It's a nice way to work out.)

1223
00:48:46,599 --> 00:48:50,429
(Suddenly doing push-ups in the middle of remodeling)

1224
00:48:52,099 --> 00:48:54,468
(Joining in)

1225
00:48:54,469 --> 00:48:56,069
- Don't lower that side. - Not here?

1226
00:48:56,070 --> 00:48:57,239
It has to be higher there.

1227
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:01,980
(While they're adjusting the level with power, )

1228
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:04,379
(the firewood servant, Dong Hwi, gets into his position.)

1229
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:06,519
(The work is divided naturally.)

1230
00:49:06,579 --> 00:49:10,420
We need more firewood to make the fire stronger.

1231
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:14,760
(Inexorable steps)

1232
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:17,158
(Placing it indifferently)

1233
00:49:17,159 --> 00:49:19,530
(His confidence comes...)

1234
00:49:20,929 --> 00:49:24,530
(from the firewood-chopping skills he earned during the first stay.)

1235
00:49:25,469 --> 00:49:27,400
(The firewood servant is back.)

1236
00:49:30,809 --> 00:49:31,940
Gosh.

1237
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:34,709
I've lost my touch after not doing it for a few days.

1238
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:36,139
(He's become rusty.)

1239
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:40,578
(Failing)

1240
00:49:40,579 --> 00:49:43,788
(Flustered)

1241
00:49:43,789 --> 00:49:44,848
(Failing)

1242
00:49:44,849 --> 00:49:45,948
(Failing again)

1243
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:47,190
(And again)

1244
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:52,590
(A single day is enough to make you rusty at chopping firewood.)

1245
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:57,699
(His touch is finally back.)

1246
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:01,069
(Firepower is important for grilling barbecue.)

1247
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:03,409
(He chops firewood nonstop.)

1248
00:50:03,869 --> 00:50:06,940
(He returns with an armful of firewood.)

1249
00:50:07,579 --> 00:50:09,949
What's with this new construction?

1250
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:11,679
What do you say?

1251
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,249
It looks perfect.

1252
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:15,480
- It looks high enough. - You think?

1253
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:17,948
But when should we make a fire?

1254
00:50:17,949 --> 00:50:19,218
Should we do it along with cooking?

1255
00:50:19,219 --> 00:50:20,618
- I'm going to do it now. - I see.

1256
00:50:20,619 --> 00:50:22,360
It's okay to do it in advance.

1257
00:50:22,659 --> 00:50:23,659
Okay.

1258
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:25,730
(It's become a daily routine. They begin making a fire.)

1259
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:29,329
(The eldest member...)

1260
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:32,369
(Scratching)

1261
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,369
(He'd seen it only in movies.)

1262
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:40,578
(But now, he makes kindling on his own.)

1263
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:42,980
(The second-eldest member...)

1264
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,879
How kind of you to help me out.

1265
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:48,980
(He couldn't do anything without Dong Yeon.)

1266
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:52,019
(Right in one go)

1267
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:53,259
(Now, he's good at lighting a fire even without Dong Yeon.)

1268
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:55,559
Put it down there like this.

1269
00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:00,460
(Carefully moving the fire to the fireplace)

1270
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:04,570
It's not catching fire.

1271
00:51:04,829 --> 00:51:06,369
It's spreading now.

1272
00:51:07,070 --> 00:51:08,368
- Let's wait now. - Okay.

1273
00:51:08,369 --> 00:51:09,538
(They manage to light a fire at the new fireplace.)

1274
00:51:09,539 --> 00:51:11,739
- Nice. - All I did was throw one match.

1275
00:51:11,809 --> 00:51:13,939
- Good job. - Good.

1276
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:15,210
(They've leveled up to be country boys.)

1277
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:19,750
(Will they see it through with the kimchi barbecue?)

1278
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:24,250
(And how will Dong Yeon's kimchi stew turn out?)

1279
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:29,559
(Homemaker Kwak begins cooking.)

1280
00:51:31,389 --> 00:51:33,960
(Going outside with the chopping board)

1281
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:39,840
(It's brighter outside due to no electricity.)

1282
00:51:40,769 --> 00:51:45,340
(From one point, he's used to cooking under the bright sun.)

1283
00:51:46,309 --> 00:51:49,579
(Chopping stably even on the handrail)

1284
00:51:50,179 --> 00:51:54,280
(This homemaker in Lapland creates an outdoor kitchen himself.)

1285
00:51:55,349 --> 00:51:58,820
(The sunshine aids him to speed up with preparing ingredients.)

1286
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,459
(Dropping)

1287
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:03,629
No.

1288
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:05,130
(Dashing to save the onion)

1289
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:09,400
(Going straight to the lake)

1290
00:52:10,929 --> 00:52:15,469
(It's become natural for them to wash stuff in the lake.)

1291
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:19,739
(He's back to the kitchen.)

1292
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,449
I feel like my knife skills have improved in days.

1293
00:52:24,909 --> 00:52:26,010
Awesome.

1294
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:29,480
I've gotten better at cutting.

1295
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:33,018
I mean, who would practice cutting in Finland?

1296
00:52:33,019 --> 00:52:34,089
(With faster cutting skills, )

1297
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:36,419
(he's done preparing the cooking ingredients.)

1298
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:38,159
- Should I put... - What?

1299
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,300
Ham or meat in the stew?

1300
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:44,399
- Can't it be both? - Both.

1301
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,969
- I can't do that. - No?

1302
00:52:46,599 --> 00:52:49,138
Then, why don't you put ham in since we'll grill some meat?

1303
00:52:49,139 --> 00:52:50,209
Ham?

1304
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:51,340
(Okay, got it.)

1305
00:52:53,139 --> 00:52:56,380
(He has his own way of cutting ham.)

1306
00:52:57,079 --> 00:53:00,079
(A plastic bag?)

1307
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:04,050
(Putting a chunk of ham into the plastic bag)

1308
00:53:04,519 --> 00:53:07,719
(Rubbing)

1309
00:53:08,119 --> 00:53:12,789
(Crushed ham melts into the broth much faster.)

1310
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:17,269
(Chopping the other chunk into pieces)

1311
00:53:17,969 --> 00:53:21,440
(It's got to have something to chew on.)

1312
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:24,969
(Isn't it such an easy way?)

1313
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:28,440
Can one of you come over to help me?

1314
00:53:28,579 --> 00:53:30,210
- Okay. - Got it.

1315
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:32,578
I need some minced garlic.

1316
00:53:32,579 --> 00:53:33,750
- Sure. - Okay.

1317
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:35,078
- I'll do it. - Garlic?

1318
00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:36,178
- Okay. - I'll do it.

1319
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:38,719
(Dong Hwi volunteers with a sense of confidence.)

1320
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,019
Dong Yeon.

1321
00:53:40,519 --> 00:53:42,018
- You'll do it? - Yes, of course.

1322
00:53:42,019 --> 00:53:43,189
- For real? - Yes.

1323
00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:44,428
(Full of suspicion)

1324
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:45,558
All right, okay.

1325
00:53:45,559 --> 00:53:47,359
(He's like a husband willing to help his unsure wife.)

1326
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:50,329
(Leaving the garlic to him)

1327
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:54,368
(Taking the kimchi they brought from Korea)

1328
00:53:54,369 --> 00:53:56,239
A plate there...

1329
00:53:56,909 --> 00:53:58,670
(His cheeks shake too.)

1330
00:54:00,139 --> 00:54:02,980
(Shaking all in)

1331
00:54:04,510 --> 00:54:06,649
(Shaking the crushed ham...)

1332
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:09,219
(in as well)

1333
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:13,889
(He's got to light a fire now.)

1334
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:16,319
(Striking a light in one go)

1335
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,428
(Lighting the gas stove skillfully)

1336
00:54:18,429 --> 00:54:21,460
(He's used to the manual ignition system now.)

1337
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:26,599
(Stir-fry the kimchi and crushed ham together.)

1338
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:31,939
I hope

1339
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:34,209
(Suddenly singing passionately)

1340
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:37,409
(This is how the housework stress is affecting Dong Yeon.)

1341
00:54:41,349 --> 00:54:44,649
(Sorrowful)

1342
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:47,158
(Venting all his pent-up emotions)

1343
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:52,389
Make sure to be happier than me

1344
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:53,860
(Turning)

1345
00:54:54,159 --> 00:54:57,799
(Returning to the kitchen after relieving all his stress)

1346
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:00,099
(Focusing again)

1347
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:01,869
- Je Hoon. - What?

1348
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,569
- I looked around and found this. - Found what?

1349
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:05,639
(To test the new fireplace)

1350
00:55:05,739 --> 00:55:07,638
- What do you say to fried eggs? - Why not?

1351
00:55:07,639 --> 00:55:09,078
For an appetizer.

1352
00:55:09,079 --> 00:55:10,780
That'd be a nice appetizer.

1353
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:14,079
Why just the two of you?

1354
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:15,420
What?

1355
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:17,118
- Did you hear us? - Yes.

1356
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:18,949
You have such a nice hearing.

1357
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:20,460
I have...

1358
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:22,989
such a sensitive hearing right now.

1359
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:24,689
I can hear even better since I came to Finland.

1360
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:25,730
(His ears have recovered from all that city noises.)

1361
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:31,530
(Making fried eggs for the member with a sharp hearing)

1362
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:33,800
(Sliding)

1363
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:35,868
I messed up.

1364
00:55:35,869 --> 00:55:37,110
- No. - Gosh, my eyes sting.

1365
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,038
It's not flat.

1366
00:55:39,039 --> 00:55:40,209
(The fireplace isn't even.)

1367
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:43,339
It's slanted a little because it's not flat.

1368
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,349
(They notice a problem thanks to making fried eggs.)

1369
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:47,379
The eggs slide because it's slanted.

1370
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:49,519
(Still, the eggs are being cooked nicely.)

1371
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:51,948
(Trying to flip the eggs once)

1372
00:55:51,949 --> 00:55:53,250
(Trying for the second time)

1373
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:55,359
The oil... Oh, no.

1374
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,328
(He messes up.)

1375
00:55:57,329 --> 00:55:59,058
(Still, they're happy.)

1376
00:55:59,059 --> 00:56:00,530
The yolks popped.

1377
00:56:01,099 --> 00:56:03,130
It'll be the same once it goes into our stomachs.

1378
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,400
I'll come back.

1379
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:09,039
- You'll feed them directly? - Yes, this way...

1380
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,909
- Really? It's okay. - Gosh!

1381
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:12,968
(Off to deliver it right away with the frying pan)

1382
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:14,779
It's okay. I'll take care of it.

1383
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:15,808
(He's off to protect the youngest member's mentality.)

1384
00:56:15,809 --> 00:56:17,710
Nothing is a problem. It's all right.

1385
00:56:18,010 --> 00:56:20,320
- Gosh, the eggs didn't break. - They're safe.

1386
00:56:21,079 --> 00:56:22,118
Thanks.

1387
00:56:22,119 --> 00:56:25,320
(If Homemaker Kwak was here, he'd slap him in the back.)

1388
00:56:26,889 --> 00:56:28,289
- Dong Hwi. - What?

1389
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:31,190
(Is he releasing his stress again?)

1390
00:56:31,590 --> 00:56:33,159
It looks really hot.

1391
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,599
Gosh, you're cooling it down for me?

1392
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:37,069
(In this case, he's willing to have it.)

1393
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:38,130
Dong Hwi.

1394
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:39,900
Darn, it's hot.

1395
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,569
Darn it.

1396
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:43,439
(Troubled, Laughing)

1397
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:44,509
(The older one is troubled while the younger one cracks up.)

1398
00:56:44,510 --> 00:56:45,710
- Eun Woo. - Gosh.

1399
00:56:46,510 --> 00:56:47,940
What's the problem with you?

1400
00:56:48,809 --> 00:56:49,809
Okay.

1401
00:56:50,849 --> 00:56:51,980
(Struggling)

1402
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:54,379
(He tries to endure the heat, )

1403
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:55,419
(but he fails.)

1404
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:56,480
It's hot.

1405
00:56:58,619 --> 00:56:59,889
But it's really good.

1406
00:57:00,590 --> 00:57:02,259
It's really good, but it's too hot.

1407
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:03,730
(He burned the roof of his mouth, though.)

1408
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:05,530
- Dong Yeon. - What?

1409
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:08,699
- Dong Yeon. - Yes.

1410
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:10,900
- It's an appetizer. - What is it?

1411
00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:12,198
Fried eggs.

1412
00:57:12,199 --> 00:57:13,999
(He's sweet enough to blow air to it again.)

1413
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,099
It's really good.

1414
00:57:16,269 --> 00:57:18,109
- It's hot. - Okay.

1415
00:57:18,110 --> 00:57:19,169
- Are you okay? - Yes.

1416
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:20,479
(And it's hot again.)

1417
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:21,880
Gosh, my teeth ache.

1418
00:57:22,179 --> 00:57:24,449
What do I do?

1419
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:29,380
(He decides to put it down for a moment.)

1420
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:30,650
Gosh, it's hot.

1421
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:32,118
It's good. That's for sure.

1422
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:33,689
(He stops eating...)

1423
00:57:33,690 --> 00:57:36,829
(and starts ransacking the seasoning storage.)

1424
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:39,658
(After going through it for a while, )

1425
00:57:39,659 --> 00:57:42,699
(he takes out ketchup.)

1426
00:57:43,699 --> 00:57:47,440
(He makes sure to enjoy even a single fried egg thoroughly.)

1427
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:51,170
Painful love

1428
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:52,670
It's hot.

1429
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:57,549
(He throws it in his mouth all at once.)

1430
00:57:57,550 --> 00:58:00,480
(And he goes back to cooking.)

1431
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:05,190
(He's boiling the stir-fried kimchi and ham with water.)

1432
00:58:07,389 --> 00:58:10,058
(The alarm Planner Kwak set earlier goes off.)

1433
00:58:10,059 --> 00:58:12,259
(Dong Yeon takes a look at his collection of seasonings.)

1434
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:14,960
(Without any hesitation, he picks up the anchovy extract.)

1435
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:20,699
(To make something umami, add a spoonful of anchovy extract.)

1436
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:23,968
(Relaxing...)

1437
00:58:23,969 --> 00:58:26,110
(is not an option right now.)

1438
00:58:26,139 --> 00:58:27,638
(The alarms are never-ending.)

1439
00:58:27,639 --> 00:58:29,840
(This is why Homemaker Kwak brought portable chargers.)

1440
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:34,119
(At the alarm, he adds chili powder for spiciness.)

1441
00:58:36,219 --> 00:58:38,019
Chili powder.

1442
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:39,649
(Now he adds chili flakes.)

1443
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:40,859
And then chili flakes.

1444
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:43,730
(He's so meticulous that he's using different types of chili powder.)

1445
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:46,130
I have to let it boil.

1446
00:58:46,131 --> 00:58:47,260
(Bringing his seasonings to Finland was worth it!)

1447
00:58:52,369 --> 00:58:54,138
Did you mince the garlic yet?

1448
00:58:54,139 --> 00:58:55,900
(It's time to put in the garlic.)

1449
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:58,170
Did you mince the garlic yet?

1450
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,539
- What? - You have to hurry.

1451
00:59:01,179 --> 00:59:03,480
All right. I just have to mince these now.

1452
00:59:03,610 --> 00:59:04,979
You didn't do it yet?

1453
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:06,210
- No. - I see.

1454
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:08,578
(Wordlessly nagging)

1455
00:59:08,579 --> 00:59:11,320
(Timing is key.)

1456
00:59:12,989 --> 00:59:15,860
(Dong Hwi is hurrying because of Dong Yeon's silent nagging.)

1457
00:59:17,190 --> 00:59:19,659
I feel like I'm the one being minced.

1458
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,999
(If you don't want to be minced, )

1459
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,369
(mince the garlic...)

1460
00:59:24,869 --> 00:59:28,369
(before Chef Kwak gets angry.)

1461
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:30,609
(He kept...)

1462
00:59:30,610 --> 00:59:32,839
(mincing the garlic nonstop...)

1463
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:34,909
(until he was done!)

1464
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:36,980
(Complete!)

1465
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:41,320
(During that short time, Dong Hwi became exhausted.)

1466
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:45,619
- Dong Yeon. - Yes.

1467
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,119
I minced the garlic.

1468
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:50,590
All right.

1469
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:51,590
(He safely brought Dong Yeon the minced garlic on time.)

1470
00:59:51,591 --> 00:59:53,630
- Thank you. - Sure.

1471
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:56,599
(Thankfully, Dong Yeon is pleased.)

1472
00:59:57,769 --> 01:00:00,969
(He throws in the minced garlic that Dong Hwi put a lot of effort into.)

1473
01:00:03,269 --> 01:00:06,309
(What does the mashed ham kimchi stew taste like?)

1474
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:07,808
(Very pleased)

1475
01:00:07,809 --> 01:00:08,809
Nice.

1476
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:11,249
(The onion he cut earlier...)

1477
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:14,320
(is thrown into the pot as soon as the alarm goes off.)

1478
01:00:16,349 --> 01:00:20,420
(Dong Yeon throws in the rest of the ingredients on time.)

1479
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:24,558
This has that Korean flavor.

1480
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:26,360
(He made a dish full of Korean flavor all the way in Lapland.)

1481
01:00:26,659 --> 01:00:29,828
Ten minutes on high heat, ten minutes on medium heat.

1482
01:00:29,829 --> 01:00:32,599
(Dong Yeon is addicted to being precisely on time until the end.)

1483
01:00:32,769 --> 01:00:33,940
Ten minutes each.

1484
01:00:35,099 --> 01:00:36,698
- There's a griddle. - Gosh, we have a griddle here.

1485
01:00:36,699 --> 01:00:38,170
We can use this.

1486
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:40,269
- Gosh. - The griddle.

1487
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:43,750
- We had this here? - The griddle's here.

1488
01:00:43,949 --> 01:00:45,049
Be careful.

1489
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:46,578
(They found a griddle to use as an alternative to a cauldron lid!)

1490
01:00:46,579 --> 01:00:47,679
What do you think?

1491
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:51,389
(But...)

1492
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:54,320
(it's severely crooked.)

1493
01:00:54,389 --> 01:00:56,058
(Emergency)

1494
01:00:56,059 --> 01:00:57,259
We need to find a way.

1495
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:59,960
(At this rate, they won't be able to grill properly.)

1496
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:03,699
We're going to have to do repairs...

1497
01:01:03,869 --> 01:01:05,800
if we want to grill the meat well.

1498
01:01:05,929 --> 01:01:07,570
- Because of how it's crooked? - Yes.

1499
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:10,809
(Is it that important?)

1500
01:01:11,610 --> 01:01:14,340
(At Eun Woo's words, Je Hoon takes the issue seriously.)

1501
01:01:14,409 --> 01:01:17,309
(What will Eun Woo decide to do?)

1502
01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:21,349
(Put out the fire and do repairs? Or just do repairs as is?)

1503
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:23,078
(The fire pit is in flames.)

1504
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:24,349
What can we do to fix this?

1505
01:01:26,619 --> 01:01:29,259
(With no time to put the fire out, Eun Woo rushes at the fire pit.)

1506
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:30,389
What do you need?

1507
01:01:30,989 --> 01:01:34,760
I was thinking of raising the part below the brick, but it's not easy.

1508
01:01:37,070 --> 01:01:38,428
(He has to protect...)

1509
01:01:38,429 --> 01:01:40,368
(both the fire pit and the fire.)

1510
01:01:40,369 --> 01:01:44,339
(Eun Woo is attempting to prop up the lower side with some wood.)

1511
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:46,769
(Watching attentively)

1512
01:01:46,809 --> 01:01:48,380
If you're going to grab it like that,

1513
01:01:49,139 --> 01:01:50,610
I'll bring you a pair of fireproof gloves.

1514
01:01:51,550 --> 01:01:54,420
(Outdoor kitchen? He's used to it enough!)

1515
01:01:55,050 --> 01:01:57,049
(Doing repairs on the fire pit?)

1516
01:01:57,050 --> 01:01:58,718
(It can't be impossible.)

1517
01:01:58,719 --> 01:02:00,759
Here, put this on your right hand.

1518
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:02,789
(Je Hoon brought fireproof gloves.)

1519
01:02:05,289 --> 01:02:06,360
Gosh.

1520
01:02:08,199 --> 01:02:09,599
(Startled)

1521
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,328
- It's all right. - Gosh.

1522
01:02:11,329 --> 01:02:12,769
(A disaster)

1523
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:15,800
(Dong Hwi is startled too because he has good hearing.)

1524
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,268
(My fire pit fell apart today.)

1525
01:02:18,269 --> 01:02:21,079
(It turned on me in an instant.)

1526
01:02:21,309 --> 01:02:24,679
(Sad)

1527
01:02:24,909 --> 01:02:26,448
It's all right.

1528
01:02:26,449 --> 01:02:28,780
It's all right. First, put the fireproof glove on.

1529
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:31,448
- This is why I wanted to fix it. - I see.

1530
01:02:31,449 --> 01:02:34,189
(He tried to repair the fire pit, but it ended up collapsing.)

1531
01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:35,320
Gosh, Je Hoon.

1532
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:37,729
(Having a barbecue party)

1533
01:02:37,730 --> 01:02:39,530
Having a campfire isn't easy.

1534
01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:41,599
What do you think we can do?

1535
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,170
First, we should remove all these bricks.

1536
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:48,599
Then, we'll stack them up again evenly.

1537
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:51,109
This is why repairs are important.

1538
01:02:51,110 --> 01:02:53,110
We should have done a better job when we first built it.

1539
01:02:54,510 --> 01:02:57,579
Let's put out this fire first...

1540
01:02:58,050 --> 01:02:59,550
and move the bricks over here.

1541
01:03:00,409 --> 01:03:02,448
- All right. - Okay.

1542
01:03:02,449 --> 01:03:03,519
(The eldest takes the lead in the face of a crisis.)

1543
01:03:04,190 --> 01:03:07,559
(Je Hoon is no longer merely naive.)

1544
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:12,659
Gosh, I wanted this to be easy.

1545
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:16,230
(I should do what Je Hoon is doing.)

1546
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:20,230
(He carries sand in both hands after pulling himself together.)

1547
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,038
(Under the eldest's leadership, )

1548
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:26,339
(Eun Woo puts out the fire with the sand.)

1549
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:28,809
(Let's do this again safely.)

1550
01:03:29,139 --> 01:03:30,750
- Dong Hwi. - Yes?

1551
01:03:31,409 --> 01:03:32,879
We're going to rebuild the fire.

1552
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,480
That's all right.

1553
01:03:35,050 --> 01:03:36,348
Things happen.

1554
01:03:36,349 --> 01:03:37,789
(Dong Hwi cheers Eun Woo up.)

1555
01:03:38,889 --> 01:03:40,150
(Pouring sand)

1556
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,518
Do we have to put out the fire completely?

1557
01:03:42,519 --> 01:03:43,889
It's too hot.

1558
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:45,559
All done.

1559
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:47,960
(After a lot of ups and downs, they finished putting out the fire.)

1560
01:03:48,099 --> 01:03:50,500
- We'll need more firewood. - Yes.

1561
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:52,099
Gosh, Dong Hwi.

1562
01:03:52,369 --> 01:03:54,269
That was nice.

1563
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:55,368
I'll go chop some.

1564
01:03:55,369 --> 01:03:56,769
(The two older renters remain calm even during a crisis.)

1565
01:03:57,570 --> 01:04:00,739
(The eldest starts actively rebuilding the fire pit.)

1566
01:04:01,110 --> 01:04:04,050
(Enduring the burning sensation in his eyes, )

1567
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:05,379
All right.

1568
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:08,050
(he finished making the surface of the ground flat.)

1569
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:09,549
That seems nice.

1570
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:11,489
(He stacks up the bricks by himself too.)

1571
01:04:11,949 --> 01:04:14,619
(Eun Woo feels relieved with Je Hoon helping him.)

1572
01:04:15,159 --> 01:04:16,689
It looks flat.

1573
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:18,429
(The brick pillar is more stable than it was earlier.)

1574
01:04:19,889 --> 01:04:23,360
(Please don't collapse this time.)

1575
01:04:23,429 --> 01:04:24,629
It looks flat.

1576
01:04:24,630 --> 01:04:25,868
Can you press down on it?

1577
01:04:25,869 --> 01:04:27,840
(The Renters learned something new again today.)

1578
01:04:27,869 --> 01:04:29,900
(Again)

1579
01:04:31,070 --> 01:04:32,408
- What do you think? - It's nice.

1580
01:04:32,409 --> 01:04:33,739
(We begin)

1581
01:04:34,239 --> 01:04:37,449
(The path to having kimchi barbecue is long and rough.)

1582
01:04:38,579 --> 01:04:40,149
(Meanwhile, it's peaceful in the indoor kitchen...)

1583
01:04:40,150 --> 01:04:43,650
(when Dong Yeon's alarm rings.)

1584
01:04:44,119 --> 01:04:45,749
(As the sound of the alarm fills the small kitchen, )

1585
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:48,320
(the kimchi stew is complete.)

1586
01:04:53,159 --> 01:04:55,059
Gosh, this is insane.

1587
01:04:55,530 --> 01:04:56,899
It's great.

1588
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:59,170
(Homemaker Kwak is on his way.)

1589
01:04:59,369 --> 01:05:00,999
- It's okay. - Is it?

1590
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,969
Well, the left side is slightly lower but...

1591
01:05:05,869 --> 01:05:07,138
- The kimchi stew is complete. - I see.

1592
01:05:07,139 --> 01:05:08,639
I just have to wait for the rice to cook.

1593
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:10,178
- The kimchi stew is complete. - I see.

1594
01:05:10,179 --> 01:05:11,650
I just have to wait for the rice to cook.

1595
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:13,649
- Really? - It's time to grill the meat then.

1596
01:05:13,650 --> 01:05:14,678
(Homemaker Kwak's appearance got all of them rushing.)

1597
01:05:14,679 --> 01:05:15,719
All right.

1598
01:05:15,849 --> 01:05:16,919
Let's hurry.

1599
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:18,519
(Let's hurry.)

1600
01:05:19,019 --> 01:05:20,250
Is it break time?

1601
01:05:20,690 --> 01:05:21,759
- No. - No.

1602
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:23,058
The fire pit was crooked and collapsed.

1603
01:05:23,059 --> 01:05:24,489
- I see. - There's a reason.

1604
01:05:25,230 --> 01:05:26,360
Ten minutes.

1605
01:05:26,489 --> 01:05:27,559
Okay.

1606
01:05:27,730 --> 01:05:28,859
All right, let's do this.

1607
01:05:28,860 --> 01:05:30,928
(Mission: Finish grilling the meat within ten minutes!)

1608
01:05:30,929 --> 01:05:32,030
What do you think?

1609
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:33,869
Let me see.

1610
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:35,598
(Je Hoon seems reliable for the first time.)

1611
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:36,968
- It looks all right. - It's much better.

1612
01:05:36,969 --> 01:05:38,039
- It's flat enough. - Okay.

1613
01:05:38,869 --> 01:05:41,639
All right. Let's start the fire again.

1614
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:43,010
Yes.

1615
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:46,078
(He's making kindling again.)

1616
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:49,050
Dong Hwi, here's the mingling... The kindling.

1617
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:53,690
(They're stuck in an endless cycle of starting a fire.)

1618
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:55,489
It's on fire.

1619
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:57,389
- It's on fire. - Yes, it is.

1620
01:05:57,489 --> 01:05:58,559
Nice.

1621
01:05:59,190 --> 01:06:00,229
Let's go.

1622
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:01,360
(The new fire pit is stable on the ground and burning fast.)

1623
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:02,960
Gosh.

1624
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:06,599
Gosh, the meat is really thin.

1625
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:08,840
It's cooking right away.

1626
01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:13,868
Wait.

1627
01:06:13,869 --> 01:06:16,579
(The meat is sticking to the griddle because they didn't use any oil.)

1628
01:06:16,679 --> 01:06:18,178
Gosh, it's sticking to the griddle.

1629
01:06:18,179 --> 01:06:19,479
- Right. - The grill is...

1630
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:20,848
(After overcoming the fire pit crisis, )

1631
01:06:20,849 --> 01:06:22,218
(the three brothers are now faced with a new difficulty.)

1632
01:06:22,219 --> 01:06:23,820
Have you heard of scrambled meat?

1633
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:26,848
- You're a scrambled-dish expert. - Yes.

1634
01:06:26,849 --> 01:06:28,619
Meat too.

1635
01:06:30,059 --> 01:06:31,389
Should we just add some oil?

1636
01:06:31,590 --> 01:06:32,659
No?

1637
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:34,059
I honestly don't know.

1638
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:36,360
Should we try it?

1639
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:38,629
Let's just add oil on the griddle.

1640
01:06:38,630 --> 01:06:40,840
I think you should use a lot of oil and then coat the griddle.

1641
01:06:41,199 --> 01:06:43,199
Yes, that's right. I think I've seen it somewhere.

1642
01:06:43,940 --> 01:06:44,940
That's enough.

1643
01:06:44,941 --> 01:06:46,109
I'll coat it.

1644
01:06:46,110 --> 01:06:48,408
(The second oldest confidently tries to coat the griddle with oil.)

1645
01:06:48,409 --> 01:06:49,980
- Gosh. - You want me to do it?

1646
01:06:50,139 --> 01:06:51,309
I have a glove on.

1647
01:06:52,150 --> 01:06:54,820
(Trying to remember what he saw at a barbecue restaurant)

1648
01:06:55,449 --> 01:06:56,479
Nice.

1649
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:57,789
(Struggling)

1650
01:06:58,150 --> 01:07:00,989
- You're doing great. - Is that enough? It's hot.

1651
01:07:02,019 --> 01:07:03,190
Gosh.

1652
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:04,859
- Goodness. - Dong Hwi.

1653
01:07:04,860 --> 01:07:06,690
(Their path to Korean barbecue is long and rough.)

1654
01:07:07,699 --> 01:07:08,828
Be careful.

1655
01:07:08,829 --> 01:07:09,899
(Getting used to the fire pit isn't easy at all.)

1656
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:11,570
- You all right? - Yes, I'm all right.

1657
01:07:12,369 --> 01:07:14,999
Dong Yeon really is...

1658
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,538
(Dong Yeon really is feeding the three of us.)

1659
01:07:16,539 --> 01:07:17,539
(Dong Hwi feels ashamed.)

1660
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:18,840
I feel so bad.

1661
01:07:20,239 --> 01:07:23,980
(The white rice is done.)

1662
01:07:26,179 --> 01:07:27,448
How do I keep doing a good job?

1663
01:07:27,449 --> 01:07:29,150
(Dong Yeon succeeded again in cooking rice in a pot.)

1664
01:07:29,449 --> 01:07:32,849
(He's the only one in Lapland who can make rice in a pot.)

1665
01:07:33,889 --> 01:07:36,960
(Mixing the nicely cooked rice)

1666
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:38,429
Gosh.

1667
01:07:39,429 --> 01:07:41,329
I can't make ssamjang.

1668
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:43,399
That's a problem.

1669
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:45,269
(There's no doenjang left to make ssamjang with.)

1670
01:07:46,269 --> 01:07:48,098
Did I not bring the spicy chicken sauce?

1671
01:07:48,099 --> 01:07:49,968
(Barbecue without ssamjang would be devastating.)

1672
01:07:49,969 --> 01:07:54,510
(The once peaceful indoor kitchen is now in crisis.)

1673
01:07:55,809 --> 01:07:57,209
(Empty)

1674
01:07:57,210 --> 01:08:00,179
(What on earth can he use as an alternative to ssamjang?)

1675
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:04,018
(After much thought, )

1676
01:08:04,019 --> 01:08:07,389
(Dong Yeon takes out the seasoned soy sauce, his secret weapon.)

1677
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:11,760
(He's taking on the challenge of creating a new sauce.)

1678
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:15,860
(Tasting)

1679
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:19,569
(He decides to use the seasoned soy sauce.)

1680
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:24,310
(What else?)

1681
01:08:26,970 --> 01:08:30,109
(Dong Yeon adds sugar for sweetness.)

1682
01:08:33,850 --> 01:08:36,579
(He also puts in Dong Hwi's minced garlic.)

1683
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:39,319
(To make it look aesthetically pleasing, )

1684
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:42,689
(Dong Yeon chops some green onion.)

1685
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:46,188
(What will Dong Yeon's special sauce taste like?)

1686
01:08:46,189 --> 01:08:47,829
Can I come outside now?

1687
01:08:48,329 --> 01:08:50,759
(It's been a lot more than ten minutes.)

1688
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:53,368
("Can I come outside now?")

1689
01:08:53,369 --> 01:08:54,538
(Of course...)

1690
01:08:54,539 --> 01:08:57,569
(not.)

1691
01:08:57,609 --> 01:09:00,710
(Dong Yeon is shooting lasers with his eyes.)

1692
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:02,739
Can I bring out the rice and the kimchi stew?

1693
01:09:06,010 --> 01:09:07,079
I guess,

1694
01:09:07,819 --> 01:09:09,420
judging by the speed the meat is cooking at.

1695
01:09:10,750 --> 01:09:12,949
(In a rush)

1696
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:15,789
The meat strips are thin, so let's keep flipping them.

1697
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:18,828
Gosh, the meat is...

1698
01:09:18,829 --> 01:09:19,960
It's going to be good.

1699
01:09:20,359 --> 01:09:21,430
The smell is insane.

1700
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:23,559
(The smell of pork is spreading all over the property.)

1701
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:25,898
Hurry. Tell Dong Yeon to come out.

1702
01:09:25,899 --> 01:09:27,270
Let's just grill everything at once.

1703
01:09:27,869 --> 01:09:30,699
(They have to finish cooking before Dong Yeon gets here.)

1704
01:09:31,069 --> 01:09:33,439
That looks nice. Let's put some salt in now.

1705
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:35,738
(No matter how much of a hurry they're in, they can't forget salt.)

1706
01:09:35,739 --> 01:09:36,880
Nice.

1707
01:09:37,609 --> 01:09:40,209
(The pork is being grilled very quickly.)

1708
01:09:40,210 --> 01:09:41,479
Dong Hwi, nice timing.

1709
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:43,749
Nice.

1710
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:45,549
(Dong Hwi quickly adds black pepper too so he doesn't get in trouble.)

1711
01:09:45,550 --> 01:09:46,719
I'll add the kimchi now.

1712
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:49,260
(He puts the kimchi on the griddle to make it even better.)

1713
01:09:50,390 --> 01:09:52,528
(They don't even miss the barbecue places back in Korea...)

1714
01:09:52,529 --> 01:09:53,658
Nice.

1715
01:09:53,659 --> 01:09:55,059
(because they have Korean barbecue here in Lapland.)

1716
01:09:55,060 --> 01:09:56,100
Nice.

1717
01:09:56,359 --> 01:09:58,129
(It looks and smells perfect.)

1718
01:09:58,130 --> 01:10:00,569
The smell is insane. This is amazing.

1719
01:10:01,970 --> 01:10:03,398
- Okay. - We're done.

1720
01:10:03,399 --> 01:10:04,669
(Current time: 9pm)

1721
01:10:04,670 --> 01:10:07,209
Dong Yeon, we're ready.

1722
01:10:07,210 --> 01:10:08,538
(Thankfully, they finished cooking before Dong Yeon lost his temper.)

1723
01:10:08,539 --> 01:10:09,539
This is great.

1724
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:11,209
Let's eat.

1725
01:10:11,210 --> 01:10:12,679
- Yes. - Let's eat.

1726
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:13,680
(The Renters are now used to eating dinner so late.)

1727
01:10:14,819 --> 01:10:16,879
(Dong Yeon's ham kimchi stew is finally revealed.)

1728
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,089
- This is insane. - This is amazing.

1729
01:10:18,090 --> 01:10:20,689
You even added chopped chili pepper to decorate.

1730
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:23,390
Your cooking skills keep getting better.

1731
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:25,159
Dong Yeon, this is amazing.

1732
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:28,059
(Spicy stew is perfect with white rice.)

1733
01:10:28,060 --> 01:10:29,600
This pot-cooked rice looks great too.

1734
01:10:30,729 --> 01:10:31,828
This is incredible.

1735
01:10:31,829 --> 01:10:34,130
(They also have the Korean barbecue they struggled to complete.)

1736
01:10:34,970 --> 01:10:37,238
- It feels like we're in Korea. - It really does.

1737
01:10:37,239 --> 01:10:38,809
Let's dig in. Thank you for the food.

1738
01:10:38,810 --> 01:10:40,038
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

1739
01:10:40,039 --> 01:10:42,079
(The table full of Korean food feels like home.)

1740
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:44,350
(Dong Hwi tries the kimchi stew.)

1741
01:10:45,979 --> 01:10:47,279
- What do you think? - Gosh. Wait.

1742
01:10:47,550 --> 01:10:49,118
(Do you like it?)

1743
01:10:49,119 --> 01:10:51,689
Gosh, you make me laugh.

1744
01:10:52,119 --> 01:10:53,148
What do you mean?

1745
01:10:53,149 --> 01:10:54,488
This is beyond good.

1746
01:10:54,489 --> 01:10:55,959
(That bite of kimchi stew was so good.)

1747
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:57,390
You really make me laugh.

1748
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,028
I didn't realize food could make me laugh.

1749
01:10:59,029 --> 01:11:00,159
(Dong Yeon has kept Dong Hwi laughing in Lapland.)

1750
01:11:00,289 --> 01:11:01,600
You really made this?

1751
01:11:01,630 --> 01:11:04,099
(Dong Hwi praised Dong Yeon 10 times with that 1 bite.)

1752
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:06,369
This is really...

1753
01:11:07,399 --> 01:11:08,840
This is the real deal.

1754
01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:11,709
(What on earth does it taste like?)

1755
01:11:11,710 --> 01:11:12,770
- This is insane. - Gosh.

1756
01:11:15,239 --> 01:11:17,239
Goodness, the stew...

1757
01:11:18,909 --> 01:11:19,949
The cabbage doenjang soup...

1758
01:11:20,449 --> 01:11:22,579
- we had before. - Yes.

1759
01:11:22,819 --> 01:11:23,879
(Dong Yeon made cabbage doenjang soup for dinner on Day Two.)

1760
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:25,520
This is even better than that.

1761
01:11:25,850 --> 01:11:27,889
- Right, it's so good. - This is really...

1762
01:11:27,890 --> 01:11:29,659
(The kimchi stew looks and tastes even better.)

1763
01:11:29,859 --> 01:11:31,529
(Eun Woo takes a sip of the soup.)

1764
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:35,529
(And then he takes another sip right away.)

1765
01:11:35,729 --> 01:11:36,960
Gosh, this is unbelievable.

1766
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:38,670
Gosh. This is so good, Dong Yeon.

1767
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:42,269
(They keep admiring Dong Yeon's stew each time they have a bite.)

1768
01:11:42,270 --> 01:11:43,800
- This is great. - It's so good.

1769
01:11:45,170 --> 01:11:47,539
(It tastes great.)

1770
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:49,140
This really is incredible.

1771
01:11:49,739 --> 01:11:51,249
(Dong Yeon takes a bite while listening to their praises.)

1772
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:53,050
- It is. Gosh, it's so good. - This really is...

1773
01:11:54,819 --> 01:11:55,819
It's unbelievable.

1774
01:11:56,449 --> 01:11:57,449
It's so good.

1775
01:11:57,450 --> 01:11:58,549
It's my specialty.

1776
01:11:58,550 --> 01:11:59,619
(Dong Yeon is proud that they're enjoying the food.)

1777
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:02,920
(Yum)

1778
01:12:05,029 --> 01:12:06,029
(Gosh)

1779
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:08,228
Gosh, this is insane.

1780
01:12:08,229 --> 01:12:09,559
(Dong Hwi is still admiring the kimchi stew.)

1781
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:10,630
(Yum)

1782
01:12:12,699 --> 01:12:15,739
(Dong Hwi's reaction is worth the effort Dong Yeon put in.)

1783
01:12:15,939 --> 01:12:18,109
If this kimchi stew was a person,

1784
01:12:18,739 --> 01:12:19,840
I would have proposed to it.

1785
01:12:20,439 --> 01:12:21,778
(Dong Hwi's unexpected proposal made Dong Yeon happy.)

1786
01:12:21,779 --> 01:12:22,810
For real.

1787
01:12:23,279 --> 01:12:24,339
I would have brought out a ring.

1788
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,050
- A ring? It's that good? - Yes.

1789
01:12:26,350 --> 01:12:27,679
Gosh, this is...

1790
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:29,250
(Proud)

1791
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:31,420
This kimchi stew really makes me laugh.

1792
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,759
(He's praising Dong Yeon nonstop.)

1793
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:36,420
This combination is extraordinary.

1794
01:12:36,859 --> 01:12:37,929
(The praises are making Dong Yeon happy about feeding the Renters.)

1795
01:12:37,930 --> 01:12:39,130
- The combination? - Yes.

1796
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:41,599
(After finishing up the stew, his attention is on the meat.)

1797
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:44,000
What kind of meat is this?

1798
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:45,469
- Pork shoulder - Pork shoulder.

1799
01:12:45,470 --> 01:12:46,599
(They went through so much...)

1800
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:47,600
Let's try the Finnish pork shoulder.

1801
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:48,600
(to grill the Finnish pork shoulder and kimchi!)

1802
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:53,369
(This is it!)

1803
01:12:53,609 --> 01:12:56,479
(The firewood chopper eats two pieces at once.)

1804
01:12:58,250 --> 01:13:00,680
(I'm going to have two pieces too!)

1805
01:13:02,149 --> 01:13:03,220
This is way too good.

1806
01:13:05,090 --> 01:13:06,189
Seriously.

1807
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:09,659
It's so good.

1808
01:13:09,989 --> 01:13:11,130
Do you like it?

1809
01:13:12,489 --> 01:13:13,529
We did a good job at grilling it.

1810
01:13:14,060 --> 01:13:16,658
I'm not sure who added the salt and pepper,

1811
01:13:16,659 --> 01:13:17,770
but it's seasoned perfectly.

1812
01:13:18,329 --> 01:13:19,430
It was you, Dong Hwi.

1813
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:23,500
- Try it with some kimchi. - Okay.

1814
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:26,210
- Grilled kimchi? - Yes.

1815
01:13:28,210 --> 01:13:31,279
(Dong Hwi wraps the kimchi with a piece of pork.)

1816
01:13:33,479 --> 01:13:34,648
This tastes like stir-fried pork.

1817
01:13:34,649 --> 01:13:35,720
Yes, kind of.

1818
01:13:36,050 --> 01:13:37,579
Stir-fried pork with kimchi.

1819
01:13:38,050 --> 01:13:39,449
This stir-fried pork is great.

1820
01:13:41,489 --> 01:13:43,959
(Eun Woo eats pork, kimchi and rice...)

1821
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:45,089
It's pork wrap.

1822
01:13:45,090 --> 01:13:47,729
(all in one bite.)

1823
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:51,269
(His mouth is full.)

1824
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:53,130
(The sauce Dong Yeon made)

1825
01:13:55,970 --> 01:13:58,340
(The creator is pleased.)

1826
01:13:59,310 --> 01:14:01,738
It tastes amazing with the sauce.

1827
01:14:01,739 --> 01:14:02,810
- The pork shoulder? - Yes.

1828
01:14:05,409 --> 01:14:06,649
Hey, what kind of soy sauce did you use?

1829
01:14:07,250 --> 01:14:08,520
It's so good.

1830
01:14:08,550 --> 01:14:09,579
Gosh.

1831
01:14:09,819 --> 01:14:11,619
The sauce is making me laugh.

1832
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:17,419
How did you make this sauce?

1833
01:14:17,420 --> 01:14:20,289
(Dong Yeon's improvised alternative to ssamjang is also a huge success.)

1834
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:23,129
- This is great with rice. - Totally.

1835
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:24,199
(Its flavor is the perfect blend of savory and sweet.)

1836
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:25,770
Even the rice...

1837
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:28,198
tastes better than last time.

1838
01:14:28,199 --> 01:14:29,269
- Yes. - Right.

1839
01:14:29,270 --> 01:14:30,299
(Dong Yeon's pot-cooked rice keeps improving.)

1840
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:31,439
The rice is amazing.

1841
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:34,979
How did you make rice in a pot?

1842
01:14:36,039 --> 01:14:37,140
Gosh.

1843
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:39,909
I feel like I'm being taken care of by my child on this trip right now.

1844
01:14:41,619 --> 01:14:42,680
Goodness.

1845
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:45,619
Father, do you like the food?

1846
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:48,460
Son.

1847
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:50,220
You should never get married.

1848
01:14:50,890 --> 01:14:52,328
You should stay home and cook for me instead.

1849
01:14:52,329 --> 01:14:53,559
(Don't get married and stay with me forever.)

1850
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:54,630
This is so good.

1851
01:14:58,869 --> 01:15:01,239
I didn't think I would need Korean food,

1852
01:15:01,699 --> 01:15:03,568
- but I did. - Of course.

1853
01:15:03,569 --> 01:15:04,569
Eating Korean food is great.

1854
01:15:04,570 --> 01:15:06,270
It's making me feel...

1855
01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:07,879
- much more emotionally stable. - That's right.

1856
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:09,309
I'm in trouble now.

1857
01:15:09,310 --> 01:15:11,509
I've never craved Korean food while I was...

1858
01:15:11,510 --> 01:15:12,850
- traveling abroad before. - Same.

1859
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:16,549
- But this is going to make me... - You're now going to...

1860
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:18,090
- want only Korean food from now on. - Right.

1861
01:15:18,149 --> 01:15:21,760
(Dong Yeon's cooking even changed Je Hoon's eating habit.)

1862
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:23,459
It feels like I'm at a Korean restaurant near my house.

1863
01:15:23,460 --> 01:15:24,529
It really does.

1864
01:15:24,789 --> 01:15:26,890
A Korean restaurant...

1865
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,029
with this vast lake behind it.

1866
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:33,299
It looks like computer generated imagery.

1867
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:36,539
(They can never get tired of looking at their marvelous front yard.)

1868
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:39,439
This is what happiness feels like.

1869
01:15:43,079 --> 01:15:44,538
Gosh, this is so good.

1870
01:15:44,539 --> 01:15:45,849
(They get to enjoy food that reminds them of home in Lapland!)

1871
01:15:45,850 --> 01:15:47,149
This is insane.

1872
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:51,349
(The Renters are full.)

1873
01:15:51,350 --> 01:15:52,489
The food was so good.

1874
01:15:53,119 --> 01:15:56,060
Dong Yeon, you really are amazing.

1875
01:15:56,590 --> 01:15:58,728
(The second oldest Renter knows how to make someone feel good.)

1876
01:15:58,729 --> 01:15:59,729
Gosh.

1877
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:01,800
I stuffed my face with food.

1878
01:16:01,930 --> 01:16:03,729
- I stuffed my face with food. - Seriously.

1879
01:16:04,670 --> 01:16:06,800
I feel like I can easily stay in Finland for a year.

1880
01:16:07,630 --> 01:16:08,639
(As long as he has the Korean food Dong Yeon made)

1881
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:10,539
I can make it here for a year with this meal.

1882
01:16:10,970 --> 01:16:13,270
Seriously, though. Watching you...

1883
01:16:13,810 --> 01:16:15,908
inspired me to start cooking myself...

1884
01:16:15,909 --> 01:16:18,510
(Will Dong Hwi, who is obsessed with delivery food, cook?)

1885
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:20,579
- just a little. - I see.

1886
01:16:22,949 --> 01:16:24,220
You really moved me.

1887
01:16:25,319 --> 01:16:29,260
Gosh, should we really make them sleep in the tent?

1888
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:34,029
(That's right. The tent at this rented house...)

1889
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:38,729
(is practically wildlife, with the sound of the wind and...)

1890
01:16:39,899 --> 01:16:43,039
(the cold air being the only things they could sense in the dark.)

1891
01:16:44,369 --> 01:16:47,439
(The sleepless tree tent of horror...)

1892
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:51,449
(is where the two chefs will be sleeping tonight.)

1893
01:16:52,810 --> 01:16:54,778
(The two youngest Renters cooked a warm meal for them, )

1894
01:16:54,779 --> 01:16:56,978
(but a cold night in the wild is what awaits them.)

1895
01:16:56,979 --> 01:16:59,549
Gosh, should we really make them sleep in the tent?

1896
01:16:59,550 --> 01:17:01,520
(Is the eldest offering them a hand of mercy?)

1897
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:05,988
(Is he?)

1898
01:17:05,989 --> 01:17:08,560
(Is this a spark of hope?)

1899
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:12,329
(Those two did work really hard.)

1900
01:17:13,130 --> 01:17:15,439
(Should they make them sleep in this tent, or not?)

1901
01:17:16,039 --> 01:17:17,868
(Thinking hard)

1902
01:17:17,869 --> 01:17:19,038
Or there's another way.

1903
01:17:19,039 --> 01:17:20,438
- You know the table there? - Yes.

1904
01:17:20,439 --> 01:17:22,009
We can push it aside...

1905
01:17:22,010 --> 01:17:24,139
and create space between the two beds.

1906
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:25,179
(We'll gladly sleep on the floor.)

1907
01:17:25,180 --> 01:17:26,809
(Good thinking!)

1908
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:27,979
Take out the table for a while.

1909
01:17:28,420 --> 01:17:29,549
Oh, take it out?

1910
01:17:29,550 --> 01:17:30,648
(Being convinced)

1911
01:17:30,649 --> 01:17:33,049
Most of all, in our previous stay,

1912
01:17:33,050 --> 01:17:35,219
I liked it when we all slept and woke up together...

1913
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:36,519
- in the same room. - I know.

1914
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:37,920
(They even bring up their memories from spending the nights together.)

1915
01:17:40,189 --> 01:17:41,459
Okay, got it. Let's do that, then.

1916
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:43,430
- Let's move the table over. - Yes.

1917
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:47,699
And let's all sleep next to each other.

1918
01:17:48,039 --> 01:17:49,869
- Okay. - Nice.

1919
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:51,738
Before we sleep in the same room,

1920
01:17:51,739 --> 01:17:54,669
shall we have some local beer that I bought?

1921
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:55,778
I'd love that.

1922
01:17:55,779 --> 01:17:58,379
- Oh, okay. - That was the best.

1923
01:17:58,380 --> 01:18:00,079
(To celebrate sleeping as a group, they end the day with a local beer.)

1924
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:03,679
Gosh, it's nice and cozy with everyone in here.

1925
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:06,090
- Oh, goodness. - It was perfect.

1926
01:18:07,149 --> 01:18:09,089
Anyway, things are going well.

1927
01:18:09,090 --> 01:18:10,118
Thank you, guys.

1928
01:18:10,119 --> 01:18:12,689
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1929
01:18:12,989 --> 01:18:15,328
(A cool can of beer...)

1930
01:18:15,329 --> 01:18:18,430
(to finish the day)

1931
01:18:19,970 --> 01:18:21,800
(Glancing)

1932
01:18:22,439 --> 01:18:23,569
But...

1933
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:25,238
it's almost 10pm right now.

1934
01:18:25,239 --> 01:18:27,369
- The sun won't set. - It still feels like daytime.

1935
01:18:27,439 --> 01:18:29,140
But even when the sun sets, it's still bright out.

1936
01:18:29,409 --> 01:18:30,679
It's so fascinating.

1937
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:32,250
(Even after some time, they still find the midnight sun fascinating.)

1938
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:35,578
(The sun must not want to go to bed yet either.)

1939
01:18:35,579 --> 01:18:38,949
(It's still holding on tight.)

1940
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:43,590
Honestly, I think today was...

1941
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:45,859
the day I felt most adjusted.

1942
01:18:46,359 --> 01:18:49,028
Since things were a little bit uncomfortable...

1943
01:18:49,029 --> 01:18:50,129
- as we were used to... - Right.

1944
01:18:50,130 --> 01:18:52,099
- Korean culture and lifestyle, - Yes.

1945
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:56,300
But I think I've adjusted to the standards here now.

1946
01:18:56,899 --> 01:18:58,640
- Today was so nice. - Right.

1947
01:18:58,810 --> 01:19:01,038
Not that the other days weren't nice.

1948
01:19:01,039 --> 01:19:02,078
(Even the most steadfast city boy was truly adjusted.)

1949
01:19:02,079 --> 01:19:05,649
Earlier, while we were resting before cooking and eating,

1950
01:19:05,810 --> 01:19:07,979
I was just walking down to see what was there,

1951
01:19:08,119 --> 01:19:09,819
and I felt kind of sleepy.

1952
01:19:10,449 --> 01:19:13,489
I just lied down on a rock there and took a ten-minute nap.

1953
01:19:13,550 --> 01:19:14,788
Oh, really?

1954
01:19:14,789 --> 01:19:16,259
- That's why you weren't around. - Yes.

1955
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:18,159
While the three of us were skipping stones.

1956
01:19:18,930 --> 01:19:21,259
Then, when I saw a boat,

1957
01:19:21,260 --> 01:19:22,929
I wanted to go rowing a bit.

1958
01:19:22,930 --> 01:19:25,199
(If you want to row, you can go on the boat in front of the house.)

1959
01:19:25,270 --> 01:19:28,599
I thought, "Living like this must bring you such joy."

1960
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:29,769
(The way I lived my life wasn't the only correct answer.)

1961
01:19:29,770 --> 01:19:31,609
Dong Yeon, you're a true man of nature.

1962
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:33,108
Dong Yeon really seems to like that kind of stuff.

1963
01:19:33,109 --> 01:19:34,978
And more than anything else...

1964
01:19:34,979 --> 01:19:36,938
- Maybe it's the great air quality, - Yes?

1965
01:19:36,939 --> 01:19:38,109
But I can sing so well.

1966
01:19:38,149 --> 01:19:39,279
"Love of a Thousand Years."

1967
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:42,220
I can't sing the high notes for "Love of a Thousand Years" in Seoul.

1968
01:19:42,449 --> 01:19:45,890
But it was so fascinating that I could reach them so easily here.

1969
01:19:47,090 --> 01:19:50,390
(One person on the river, another person on land)

1970
01:19:51,020 --> 01:19:54,459
(The natural echo makes singing a duet fun.)

1971
01:19:54,460 --> 01:19:56,299
- From land to water... - We sang back and forth.

1972
01:19:56,300 --> 01:19:57,459
- It was good, right? - Yes.

1973
01:19:57,460 --> 01:19:59,329
- It was our own karaoke. - Yes.

1974
01:19:59,699 --> 01:20:01,069
And today,

1975
01:20:01,399 --> 01:20:05,270
things felt really Finnish.

1976
01:20:06,210 --> 01:20:07,238
- Today? - Right.

1977
01:20:07,239 --> 01:20:08,279
- Eun Woo. - Yes?

1978
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:09,539
You didn't sleep in the tent last night.

1979
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:12,448
(The guy with that experience keeps his mouth shut.)

1980
01:20:12,449 --> 01:20:13,449
That's enough.

1981
01:20:13,450 --> 01:20:14,608
Dong Hwi, I'll just...

1982
01:20:14,609 --> 01:20:16,350
- sleep in the tent tonight. - No.

1983
01:20:16,579 --> 01:20:18,149
I can't let you sleep out there.

1984
01:20:18,819 --> 01:20:20,488
Maybe Dong Yeon, but not you.

1985
01:20:20,489 --> 01:20:22,420
Why do you keep doing that to Dong Yeon?

1986
01:20:23,319 --> 01:20:24,559
Stop saying that stuff.

1987
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:25,960
(Seriously, stop saying that to me.)

1988
01:20:26,359 --> 01:20:28,228
- You're scary. - Watch out for your carotid artery.

1989
01:20:28,229 --> 01:20:30,229
(It hasn't even been 10 seconds since they were in sync.)

1990
01:20:30,430 --> 01:20:31,828
You brought a taser gun.

1991
01:20:31,829 --> 01:20:32,969
(The funny Dong Brothers have a unique way of showing love.)

1992
01:20:32,970 --> 01:20:34,100
Seriously...

1993
01:20:34,899 --> 01:20:36,439
But honestly,

1994
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:38,438
seeing a bear is also...

1995
01:20:38,439 --> 01:20:40,439
- We really have to see a bear. - Yes.

1996
01:20:40,869 --> 01:20:42,978
I always think about this kind of stuff.

1997
01:20:42,979 --> 01:20:44,010
First of all,

1998
01:20:44,279 --> 01:20:46,549
- I'd block the window with the bed. - Right.

1999
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:47,609
We just have to block the window.

2000
01:20:47,710 --> 01:20:49,519
And then, the lower cabinets there...

2001
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:50,680
Lift that up.

2002
01:20:51,319 --> 01:20:52,788
(Pretending to fall asleep)

2003
01:20:52,789 --> 01:20:54,148
(Also pretending to sleep)

2004
01:20:54,149 --> 01:20:55,189
Eun Woo, are you sleeping?

2005
01:20:55,420 --> 01:20:56,760
Dong Hwi, are you sleeping?

2006
01:20:57,319 --> 01:20:59,430
(Why, you people...)

2007
01:20:59,859 --> 01:21:01,259
I'm not going to cook anymore.

2008
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:02,398
No.

2009
01:21:02,399 --> 01:21:03,828
- Oh, I... - I won't cook anymore.

2010
01:21:03,829 --> 01:21:05,828
(The news of Chef Kwak's strike strikes down like lightning.)

2011
01:21:05,829 --> 01:21:07,670
I was listening to you so well.

2012
01:21:08,130 --> 01:21:10,000
Yes, I related to what you were saying.

2013
01:21:10,140 --> 01:21:11,499
I'm only going to cook for Je Hoon now.

2014
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:12,568
(From now on, he's Lee Je Hoon's personal chef.)

2015
01:21:12,569 --> 01:21:14,609
- Why did you tell me to do it? - You were copying me.

2016
01:21:15,479 --> 01:21:17,139
I won't give you any food. You should just starve now.

2017
01:21:17,140 --> 01:21:18,279
I'm really sorry.

2018
01:21:18,380 --> 01:21:20,380
(An apology that's faster than the speed of light)

2019
01:21:20,449 --> 01:21:22,919
I have so much respect for people who can cook.

2020
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,988
- I know. - Dong Yeon did a great job.

2021
01:21:24,989 --> 01:21:26,089
I know.

2022
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:27,448
(That's not enough.)

2023
01:21:27,449 --> 01:21:29,960
- Dong Yeon deserves our respect. - Of course.

2024
01:21:30,119 --> 01:21:31,519
Gosh, seriously.

2025
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:32,659
(Smirking)

2026
01:21:32,689 --> 01:21:34,688
You're like our savior.

2027
01:21:34,689 --> 01:21:36,399
(The final bit of praise)

2028
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:39,170
(Savior Kwak's anger melts away after three rounds of praise.)

2029
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:41,099
Should I post an apology on social media too?

2030
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:42,568
(Should I post an apology on social media too?)

2031
01:21:42,569 --> 01:21:44,169
Shall we go to bed now? Shall we get ready for bed?

2032
01:21:44,170 --> 01:21:46,239
(I'll cook for you, so let's stop this and go to bed.)

2033
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:53,479
(It's still bright at 11pm. They wash up early to get ready for bed.)

2034
01:21:54,979 --> 01:21:56,319
Gosh, that's refreshing.

2035
01:21:57,979 --> 01:22:01,590
(They move the table and set up the two sleeping bags.)

2036
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:07,590
(While organizing the bed...)

2037
01:22:07,630 --> 01:22:08,858
I'll just sleep on the floor.

2038
01:22:08,859 --> 01:22:10,800
(I'll just sleep on the floor.)

2039
01:22:11,060 --> 01:22:14,970
(The eldest will sleep on the floor instead of the two youngest guys.)

2040
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:18,809
Je Hoon, will you sleep there?

2041
01:22:18,810 --> 01:22:21,509
Gosh, yesterday, we still...

2042
01:22:21,510 --> 01:22:23,979
Shall we sleep down here, Je Hoon?

2043
01:22:24,979 --> 01:22:27,648
- I wanted to try the sleeping bag. - Oh, really?

2044
01:22:27,649 --> 01:22:29,749
I've never slept in one before.

2045
01:22:29,750 --> 01:22:31,149
(Positive Eun Woo thinks the sleeping bag is actually nice.)

2046
01:22:32,689 --> 01:22:35,288
- Okay. Let's become caterpillars. - All right.

2047
01:22:35,289 --> 01:22:36,358
Orange caterpillars.

2048
01:22:36,359 --> 01:22:39,459
(The two orange caterpillars look rather cute.)

2049
01:22:39,460 --> 01:22:40,959
Goodness.

2050
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:42,560
(Squirming around)

2051
01:22:42,930 --> 01:22:44,559
(Squirming)

2052
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:46,100
Hey, why do you look so cute?

2053
01:22:47,329 --> 01:22:49,170
- Dong Yeon and I... - Yes?

2054
01:22:49,439 --> 01:22:50,800
Sorry, but we simply... What?

2055
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:52,509
(Why are you down there, Je Hoon?)

2056
01:22:52,510 --> 01:22:53,670
But why are you...

2057
01:22:54,369 --> 01:22:56,879
Last night, you guys...

2058
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:59,679
slept in the sleeping bags, so we were very grateful.

2059
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:01,978
You guys should sleep in the beds tonight.

2060
01:23:01,979 --> 01:23:03,618
- Oh, really? - Thank you so much.

2061
01:23:03,619 --> 01:23:04,949
Thank you so much.

2062
01:23:05,050 --> 01:23:06,288
I was expecting it.

2063
01:23:06,289 --> 01:23:07,419
Thank you so much.

2064
01:23:07,420 --> 01:23:09,459
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2065
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:10,520
We won't refuse.

2066
01:23:10,590 --> 01:23:12,189
All right. Good night.

2067
01:23:12,890 --> 01:23:15,199
- Let's go to bed now. - Yes, turn off the lights.

2068
01:23:15,859 --> 01:23:17,529
Dong Hwi, we can't get out.

2069
01:23:17,930 --> 01:23:19,368
- I'll get the lights. - Because of the sleeping bags.

2070
01:23:19,369 --> 01:23:20,669
(In the no-electricity rental room, they turn out...)

2071
01:23:20,670 --> 01:23:22,038
(all of the lanterns and the candles.)

2072
01:23:22,039 --> 01:23:24,500
But we really are tired.

2073
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:26,608
We've had a full day.

2074
01:23:26,609 --> 01:23:27,739
(Current time: 11:30pm)

2075
01:23:27,869 --> 01:23:29,640
- Good night. - Gosh, seriously.

2076
01:23:29,810 --> 01:23:31,039
I'm so tired.

2077
01:23:31,079 --> 01:23:32,179
- Dong Hwi. - Yes?

2078
01:23:32,180 --> 01:23:33,550
Can I go like this in my sleep?

2079
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:34,949
Can I go like this too?

2080
01:23:35,750 --> 01:23:37,720
That looks like it'll be harder for you guys.

2081
01:23:38,489 --> 01:23:40,390
- I'll work out my abs. - Leg raises?

2082
01:23:40,420 --> 01:23:41,889
- Goodness. - Oh, you're right.

2083
01:23:41,890 --> 01:23:43,219
(A sudden show of super strength by the caterpillars)

2084
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:45,028
- These sleeping bags are nice. - They are nice.

2085
01:23:45,029 --> 01:23:46,089
- You guys have so much energy. - Hang on.

2086
01:23:46,090 --> 01:23:48,960
Why are you waking yourselves up when it's time to go to bed?

2087
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:50,858
- Je Hoon. - This is driving me crazy.

2088
01:23:50,859 --> 01:23:53,369
- I'm wide awake now. What do I do? - Yes, I know.

2089
01:23:53,529 --> 01:23:55,839
Please stop talking.

2090
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:56,840
(Stop talking.)

2091
01:23:56,841 --> 01:23:58,868
We can't sleep.

2092
01:23:58,869 --> 01:24:00,909
(We won't be able to sleep tonight.)

2093
01:24:01,340 --> 01:24:02,880
Good night, guys.

2094
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:08,949
(The Renters went to bed before midnight for the first time?)

2095
01:24:08,979 --> 01:24:10,819
Dong Hwi, what do you think happiness is?

2096
01:24:12,489 --> 01:24:15,050
I think he's crazy.

2097
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:16,788
No questions allowed.

2098
01:24:16,789 --> 01:24:18,220
(Please go to sleep.)

2099
01:24:20,890 --> 01:24:25,569
Dong Hwi, how do you grow out your mustache like that?

2100
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:29,398
Not like now... But...

2101
01:24:29,399 --> 01:24:31,238
(Not like now, but when you looked cool.)

2102
01:24:31,239 --> 01:24:32,509
- When... - But...

2103
01:24:32,510 --> 01:24:34,608
can't you ask me this in a private message?

2104
01:24:34,609 --> 01:24:36,510
(Can't we sleep now and talk about this in Korea?)

2105
01:24:36,810 --> 01:24:38,380
Why? I could ask.

2106
01:24:39,449 --> 01:24:41,079
You sure have a lot of questions.

2107
01:24:42,149 --> 01:24:44,448
Dong Hwi, why did you name your company, "Company On?"

2108
01:24:44,449 --> 01:24:47,318
Eun Woo, please stop asking questions!

2109
01:24:47,319 --> 01:24:48,889
(Can't we just go to bed early today?)

2110
01:24:48,890 --> 01:24:50,390
My gosh, seriously.

2111
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:53,130
Dong Yeon must be sleeping. He's so...

2112
01:24:53,359 --> 01:24:55,090
- Dong Yeon, are you sleeping? - He's seriously...

2113
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,728
Why did he come here if he's going to do that?

2114
01:24:57,729 --> 01:24:59,028
He should've just stayed at home alone.

2115
01:24:59,029 --> 01:25:00,299
I have no clue.

2116
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:01,969
(Laughing)

2117
01:25:01,970 --> 01:25:05,269
(Dong Hwi couldn't be woken up alone and decides to wake everyone else.)

2118
01:25:05,270 --> 01:25:06,970
Stop it.

2119
01:25:07,409 --> 01:25:08,609
Oh, that was good.

2120
01:25:09,079 --> 01:25:10,210
All right.

2121
01:25:10,579 --> 01:25:11,779
That was great.

2122
01:25:12,449 --> 01:25:14,279
I feel like we're shooting a sitcom.

2123
01:25:16,649 --> 01:25:17,979
Dong Yeon.

2124
01:25:18,180 --> 01:25:20,550
I put my foot on Eun Woo's leg.

2125
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:24,720
Okay.

2126
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:27,390
(Laughing)

2127
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:33,800
(The fantastic chemistry between the Dong Brothers)

2128
01:25:35,770 --> 01:25:37,398
Gosh, darn it, Dong Yeon.

2129
01:25:37,399 --> 01:25:39,009
(Our dear Dong Yeon)

2130
01:25:39,010 --> 01:25:40,340
Gosh, I ought to kill you.

2131
01:25:40,439 --> 01:25:43,180
(What use is it to go to bed early?)

2132
01:25:43,710 --> 01:25:46,209
That was great timing.

2133
01:25:46,210 --> 01:25:47,979
I love that timing right there.

2134
01:25:49,149 --> 01:25:50,720
Being brave and wise.

2135
01:25:50,819 --> 01:25:52,889
Giving laughs and touching hearts. We did it all.

2136
01:25:52,890 --> 01:25:55,118
(Dong Hwi is proud after waking everyone back up.)

2137
01:25:55,119 --> 01:25:58,060
At what point were we supposed to feel touched?

2138
01:25:58,319 --> 01:25:59,559
- First of all... - Your twerking.

2139
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:02,760
(The most touching moment of today was Je Hoon's twerking.)

2140
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:05,899
Gosh, seriously. That was shocking.

2141
01:26:06,399 --> 01:26:07,728
Caterpillar twerking.

2142
01:26:07,729 --> 01:26:09,739
(Then I'll show it to you again. Caterpillar twerking!)

2143
01:26:10,340 --> 01:26:11,970
Here they go again.

2144
01:26:12,039 --> 01:26:14,409
Why aren't you guys sleeping?

2145
01:26:14,869 --> 01:26:16,539
Encore!

2146
01:26:17,180 --> 01:26:18,979
You guys seem crazy.

2147
01:26:19,109 --> 01:26:20,279
I mean...

2148
01:26:20,949 --> 01:26:22,949
I think it's right to sleep apart.

2149
01:26:23,850 --> 01:26:25,389
We shouldn't sleep together.

2150
01:26:25,390 --> 01:26:29,560
(The rented room was filled with the sound of laughter.)

2151
01:26:31,220 --> 01:26:35,129
(They ended up falling asleep past 2am.)

2152
01:26:35,130 --> 01:26:36,199
You're right.

2153
01:26:36,359 --> 01:26:38,259
(After the darkness passes...)

2154
01:26:38,260 --> 01:26:41,800
(that fell after everyone became quiet, )

2155
01:26:43,369 --> 01:26:44,868
(the bright sunlight of Lapland...)

2156
01:26:44,869 --> 01:26:48,470
(comes up without fail.)

2157
01:26:49,340 --> 01:26:54,710
(They greet their own morning, apart from the world.)

2158
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:58,020
(Current time: 8am)

2159
01:26:59,050 --> 01:27:02,060
(Rustling)

2160
01:27:03,220 --> 01:27:05,390
(Click)

2161
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:13,069
(Waking up and coming outside barefoot)

2162
01:27:13,699 --> 01:27:19,938
(Je Hoon woke up first today as well.)

2163
01:27:19,939 --> 01:27:20,970
Goodness.

2164
01:27:26,449 --> 01:27:30,318
(A quiet privilege...)

2165
01:27:30,319 --> 01:27:35,420
(that only those who wake up early can enjoy)

2166
01:27:36,390 --> 01:27:37,420
My gosh.

2167
01:27:39,029 --> 01:27:42,029
(He can't go without his pajamas today either.)

2168
01:27:42,329 --> 01:27:46,130
(At this rate, Je Hoon's personal color is his sky blue pajamas.)

2169
01:27:46,430 --> 01:27:47,599
This is incredible.

2170
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:49,698
(As long as he has the deck and his pajamas, )

2171
01:27:49,699 --> 01:27:53,270
(this is his runway.)

2172
01:27:53,609 --> 01:27:55,709
(Maintaining his dignity with his pajamas...)

2173
01:27:55,710 --> 01:27:57,779
(as they're the city boy's last bit of pride)

2174
01:27:58,239 --> 01:28:00,108
(He can't give up his pajamas even while washing up with lake water.)

2175
01:28:00,109 --> 01:28:01,909
How can it be so clear?

2176
01:28:06,119 --> 01:28:09,619
(Perfect to the final turn)

2177
01:28:12,260 --> 01:28:15,289
(Meanwhile, the younger guys in the room...)

2178
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:19,630
(The sunlight at 8am, not in the middle of the day)

2179
01:28:19,729 --> 01:28:22,038
(They're used to the midnight sun now.)

2180
01:28:22,039 --> 01:28:24,300
(They sleep well even when it's bright.)

2181
01:28:26,770 --> 01:28:29,380
(Woken up by the sound of the door)

2182
01:28:29,739 --> 01:28:31,408
- Je Hoon. - Are you awake?

2183
01:28:31,409 --> 01:28:32,409
(When did you get up, Je Hoon?)

2184
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:35,949
(The other two are still deep asleep.)

2185
01:28:36,250 --> 01:28:37,479
- Get some more sleep. - Okay.

2186
01:28:38,420 --> 01:28:42,158
(He heads to the kitchen on his tiptoes.)

2187
01:28:42,159 --> 01:28:46,189
(But then...)

2188
01:28:46,789 --> 01:28:48,329
(Ringing)

2189
01:28:48,529 --> 01:28:50,899
(Frozen)

2190
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:52,799
(Eun Woo is startled awake.)

2191
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:55,369
(A sudden game of wits)

2192
01:28:59,310 --> 01:29:02,340
(What is he trying to do that he's making such a ruckus?)

2193
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:07,979
(He takes out a bag of apples?)

2194
01:29:08,149 --> 01:29:09,750
For over 30 years,

2195
01:29:09,979 --> 01:29:11,520
I always have an apple in the morning.

2196
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:13,318
That's my routine.

2197
01:29:13,319 --> 01:29:15,519
(Je Hoon's morning routine for staying young)

2198
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:18,560
(Let's all grow younger together.)

2199
01:29:19,060 --> 01:29:21,759
(He prepares breakfast with the apples and blueberry juice...)

2200
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:24,500
(they bought from the supermarket.)

2201
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:28,840
(What are you doing, Je Hoon?)

2202
01:29:31,340 --> 01:29:32,368
Are you up?

2203
01:29:32,369 --> 01:29:34,309
(Nodding)

2204
01:29:34,310 --> 01:29:36,839
(He nodded, )

2205
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:39,109
(but he's still squirming around.)

2206
01:29:44,779 --> 01:29:47,489
Guys, it's time to get up now.

2207
01:29:48,390 --> 01:29:49,459
Okay, Je Hoon.

2208
01:29:49,460 --> 01:29:50,489
(The youngest members listen to the oldest so well.)

2209
01:29:50,819 --> 01:29:52,760
(Eun Woo gets up right away too.)

2210
01:29:53,630 --> 01:29:55,630
Why was it so cold?

2211
01:29:55,829 --> 01:29:57,500
It kept turning off.

2212
01:29:58,029 --> 01:29:59,270
- Did you sleep in your jacket? - Yes.

2213
01:30:00,729 --> 01:30:02,969
For breakfast, let's have a simple meal...

2214
01:30:02,970 --> 01:30:06,139
with apples and blueberry juice.

2215
01:30:06,140 --> 01:30:08,010
- Sounds good. - And let's clean up...

2216
01:30:08,140 --> 01:30:09,510
and get going.

2217
01:30:10,140 --> 01:30:11,478
Bye!

2218
01:30:11,479 --> 01:30:13,379
(The second oldest can't get up after talking late into the night.)

2219
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:14,449
Later...

2220
01:30:16,149 --> 01:30:21,050
(In their wide open sink, )

2221
01:30:21,590 --> 01:30:24,590
(he washes the apples like he's so used to it.)

2222
01:30:25,060 --> 01:30:26,260
(Squeaky clean)

2223
01:30:28,029 --> 01:30:30,759
(His behind as he washes apples)

2224
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:34,829
(His behind as he stretches)

2225
01:30:35,199 --> 01:30:39,568
(Outside, the guys with handsome behinds have a busy morning.)

2226
01:30:39,569 --> 01:30:43,879
(Inside, Dong Min and Dong Hwi are still rolling around in bed.)

2227
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:45,710
I miss my mom.

2228
01:30:46,649 --> 01:30:48,550
I miss Dongdong.

2229
01:30:48,979 --> 01:30:51,319
I miss my cats too.

2230
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:53,350
I miss Dong Hwi too.

2231
01:30:55,989 --> 01:30:57,359
Dong Hwi is right here.

2232
01:30:58,560 --> 01:30:59,760
The real Dong Hwi.

2233
01:31:00,359 --> 01:31:01,729
Then am I a fake Dong Hwi?

2234
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:04,060
Not the fake Dong Hwi, but the real Dong Hwi.

2235
01:31:05,430 --> 01:31:08,970
(It sure is fun to tease Dong Hwi the moment they wake up.)

2236
01:31:09,199 --> 01:31:11,239
Still, it's our last day.

2237
01:31:11,539 --> 01:31:14,639
Let's sit over there and eat comfortably by the river.

2238
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:16,038
- Sounds good. - Looking out at the river?

2239
01:31:16,039 --> 01:31:18,079
- Yes, let's relax. - Okay.

2240
01:31:19,409 --> 01:31:21,608
Do you want a red or yellow one?

2241
01:31:21,609 --> 01:31:23,550
- I want a red one. - Here.

2242
01:31:23,649 --> 01:31:24,649
Thank you.

2243
01:31:24,650 --> 01:31:25,749
(Dong Hwi takes a red apple as he only eats familiar foods.)

2244
01:31:25,750 --> 01:31:27,719
(Positive Eun Woo obviously takes the unfamiliar yellow apple.)

2245
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:29,060
Dong Hwi, try the yellow one too.

2246
01:31:30,159 --> 01:31:31,819
No.

2247
01:31:32,390 --> 01:31:35,329
Because the yellow one was a little more expensive.

2248
01:31:35,699 --> 01:31:36,858
Oh, really?

2249
01:31:36,859 --> 01:31:38,728
Then I should have a taste.

2250
01:31:38,729 --> 01:31:40,029
(Then let me see that.)

2251
01:31:40,670 --> 01:31:41,670
How is it?

2252
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:44,039
Isn't it tasty?

2253
01:31:45,270 --> 01:31:47,139
- It's tasty. - Isn't it?

2254
01:31:47,140 --> 01:31:48,408
(Thanks to the rental brothers, )

2255
01:31:48,409 --> 01:31:49,710
(he's trying lots of unfamiliar things too.)

2256
01:31:50,210 --> 01:31:55,979
(They're enjoying Je Hoon's morning routine for staying young.)

2257
01:31:57,380 --> 01:31:58,380
This is nice.

2258
01:31:58,479 --> 01:31:59,549
Apples are the best in the morning.

2259
01:31:59,550 --> 01:32:01,318
(A hot spot for good apples and good views)

2260
01:32:01,319 --> 01:32:03,560
(This is the last day they'll get to see this view.)

2261
01:32:04,220 --> 01:32:08,060
Usually, when I go abroad, I look up gyms and stuff.

2262
01:32:08,260 --> 01:32:09,560
Gyms?

2263
01:32:09,930 --> 01:32:12,270
But here, all I care about is...

2264
01:32:13,170 --> 01:32:15,470
the bathroom and whether there's a sink in the kitchen.

2265
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:17,770
You don't need a gym. You can just chop firewood.

2266
01:32:18,199 --> 01:32:19,969
- And row the boat. - Yes, row the boat.

2267
01:32:19,970 --> 01:32:22,140
- You're right. - That's the rowing machine here.

2268
01:32:22,479 --> 01:32:23,680
We do have a rowing machine.

2269
01:32:24,279 --> 01:32:25,909
It's actual rowing.

2270
01:32:27,409 --> 01:32:29,079
- The time... - Yes?

2271
01:32:29,250 --> 01:32:30,379
Just flies by.

2272
01:32:30,380 --> 01:32:31,880
(It's already time to go to their third rental room.)

2273
01:32:32,289 --> 01:32:35,488
Right, and I am looking forward to the vibe of the third house.

2274
01:32:35,489 --> 01:32:36,560
I know.

2275
01:32:37,189 --> 01:32:40,630
(The third rental room they'll get to meet today...)

2276
01:32:40,989 --> 01:32:43,760
(What kind of place will it be?)

2277
01:32:44,329 --> 01:32:45,460
Oh, here it is.

2278
01:32:45,930 --> 01:32:46,970
It's here.

2279
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,670
(Ta-da!)

2280
01:32:50,699 --> 01:32:52,100
- The next house? - The next house?

2281
01:32:52,470 --> 01:32:53,810
What's this? Where is it?

2282
01:32:54,340 --> 01:32:55,640
I'll read it out for you.

2283
01:32:56,539 --> 01:32:59,179
I'm so curious about what the landlord looks like.

2284
01:32:59,180 --> 01:33:00,310
Their faces...

2285
01:33:01,149 --> 01:33:03,180
- Oh, they're a couple. - Yes, they're a couple.

2286
01:33:03,550 --> 01:33:05,149
- Yuri and Anne. - Yuri and Anne.

2287
01:33:05,220 --> 01:33:07,948
"Hello, we're a newlywed couple in our first year of marriage."

2288
01:33:07,949 --> 01:33:10,219
- My goodness. - "We fell in love with..."

2289
01:33:10,220 --> 01:33:12,629
"the friendly and peaceful vibe of Kemijarvi village."

2290
01:33:12,630 --> 01:33:14,789
"That was why we built our own home here."

2291
01:33:14,890 --> 01:33:17,600
"We're living with our animal family now."

2292
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:19,369
Please.

2293
01:33:19,670 --> 01:33:21,430
- Let there be a cat... - A bear.

2294
01:33:21,829 --> 01:33:23,939
I miss cats so much.

2295
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:28,770
"PS, the villagers are all waiting for you guys to visit."

2296
01:33:30,409 --> 01:33:32,849
(The villagers?)

2297
01:33:32,850 --> 01:33:34,549
It's Yuri and Anne's home.

2298
01:33:34,550 --> 01:33:35,948
Hey, then...

2299
01:33:35,949 --> 01:33:37,148
(Does this mean...)

2300
01:33:37,149 --> 01:33:40,649
(we will finally have neighbors too?)

2301
01:33:41,720 --> 01:33:44,089
But since they said the villagers were waiting for us,

2302
01:33:44,090 --> 01:33:46,659
it must be a village where people live close by.

2303
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:49,029
- I see. - Billie Jean

2304
01:33:49,399 --> 01:33:51,399
Is not my lover

2305
01:33:52,529 --> 01:33:53,600
Eun Woo.

2306
01:33:53,899 --> 01:33:55,869
- Yes, that's it. - Nice.

2307
01:33:56,039 --> 01:33:57,198
I'm sorry,

2308
01:33:57,199 --> 01:33:58,769
- but that's enough pelvic movement. - Hey, so...

2309
01:33:58,770 --> 01:34:00,409
after the twerking...

2310
01:34:01,140 --> 01:34:02,880
(So hot)

2311
01:34:02,909 --> 01:34:04,538
He sure is different.

2312
01:34:04,539 --> 01:34:06,010
I have to hold onto something, though.

2313
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:08,779
I can't do it.

2314
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:10,519
- Darn it. - So early in the morning...

2315
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:11,679
(Since they danced from the early morning...)

2316
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:12,989
It never ends.

2317
01:34:13,989 --> 01:34:15,619
- Shall we get ready now? - Shall we get ready?

2318
01:34:15,989 --> 01:34:17,059
- Let's go. - Okay.

2319
01:34:17,060 --> 01:34:18,989
We need to get moving soon to...

2320
01:34:19,390 --> 01:34:20,829
It feels sad to leave.

2321
01:34:24,359 --> 01:34:27,329
Shall I organize my stuff?

2322
01:34:27,970 --> 01:34:29,239
Oh, dear.

2323
01:34:30,670 --> 01:34:35,109
(The fly swatter goes back into Je Hoon's bag.)

2324
01:34:35,779 --> 01:34:37,310
But now that we're about to leave,

2325
01:34:38,079 --> 01:34:39,180
it feels sad.

2326
01:34:39,579 --> 01:34:43,220
I think I've become attached to this place.

2327
01:34:44,319 --> 01:34:45,890
Is it because it's cozy here?

2328
01:34:47,020 --> 01:34:49,358
I'm sure the third house will have its own charms, right?

2329
01:34:49,359 --> 01:34:50,590
Of course. I'm sure it will.

2330
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:52,118
We have to leave.

2331
01:34:52,119 --> 01:34:53,489
(They're sadly preparing to move houses.)

2332
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:55,090
(Knocking)

2333
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:59,630
(Knocking? An unfamiliar sound they've never heard here before)

2334
01:35:00,369 --> 01:35:02,099
(We're the only people around...)

2335
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:04,000
(in this dense forest.)

2336
01:35:04,439 --> 01:35:06,239
(And someone has paid them a visit?)

2337
01:35:06,439 --> 01:35:09,909
(What is the final incident at the second rental room...)

2338
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:15,250
(that fell upon the Renters?)

2339
01:35:15,380 --> 01:35:17,319
(Leaving the second rental room, )

2340
01:35:17,680 --> 01:35:20,289
(they arrive at the new rental room!)

2341
01:35:20,619 --> 01:35:23,289
(They come out of the forest and start village life.)

2342
01:35:23,460 --> 01:35:25,559
(For the first time since living in rented rooms, )

2343
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:29,429
(they have neighbors!)

2344
01:35:29,430 --> 01:35:31,028
(And more neighbors)

2345
01:35:31,029 --> 01:35:35,199
(And it's full of other animal neighbors.)

2346
01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:37,068
(Seeing a crowd after a long while)

2347
01:35:37,069 --> 01:35:38,599
(Village life sounds fun.)

2348
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:40,670
(Village life is so busy.)

2349
01:35:40,970 --> 01:35:42,979
(Let's hurry up and get going!)

2350
01:35:43,380 --> 01:35:46,149
(The village life with so much work starts!)

2351
01:35:46,409 --> 01:35:47,680
(Pull!)

2352
01:35:47,979 --> 01:35:50,379
(They pull, )

2353
01:35:50,380 --> 01:35:53,589
(hammer, )

2354
01:35:53,590 --> 01:35:56,189
(and get kicked.)

2355
01:35:56,390 --> 01:35:58,118
(With more neighbors...)

2356
01:35:58,119 --> 01:36:00,159
(comes more tasks to do.)

2357
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:02,858
(And with more eyes on them, )

2358
01:36:02,859 --> 01:36:05,930
(they must dress up.)

2359
01:36:06,399 --> 01:36:09,438
(Let's wash up and get clean to live in the village.)

2360
01:36:09,439 --> 01:36:10,738
Gosh, my sleeves keep falling down.

2361
01:36:10,739 --> 01:36:12,170
Dong Hwi, I'll roll up my sleeves, at least.

2362
01:36:15,510 --> 01:36:16,839
(Chuckling)

2363
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:18,038
(Eun Woo.)

2364
01:36:18,039 --> 01:36:19,310
(Let's give it a rest.)

2365
01:36:19,449 --> 01:36:21,909
(I can't give it a rest during our first village experience!)

2366
01:36:22,550 --> 01:36:24,549
(Using all kinds of tricks and schemes, )

2367
01:36:24,550 --> 01:36:26,789
(they adjust to village life.)

2368
01:36:27,189 --> 01:36:30,020
(This village really suits me.)

2369
01:36:30,659 --> 01:36:33,260
(The rental life begins in a strange rural village.)

2370
01:36:38,630 --> 01:36:40,368
(Lee Je Hoon)

2371
01:36:40,369 --> 01:36:42,028
(Lee Dong Hwi)

2372
01:36:42,029 --> 01:36:43,938
(Kwak Dong Yeon)

2373
01:36:43,939 --> 01:36:45,600
(Cha Eun Woo)

2374
01:36:45,770 --> 01:36:48,539
(Rented In Finland)
