1
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,949
(Lee Je Hoon)

2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:08,608
(Lee Dong Hwi)

3
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:10,518
(Kwak Dong Yeon)

4
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:12,150
(Cha Eun Woo)

5
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:14,919
(Rented In Finland)

6
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:16,049
What's this?

7
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,189
(The secret home...)

8
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,530
(they have to go by boat)

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,698
(They rowed for a while...)

10
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:27,170
(and reached a secluded house.)

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,069
(What's this?)

12
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,739
(Gasping)

13
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,239
(A big yard, )

14
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,740
(where animals and children play freely)

15
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:39,409
(A rented room with a friendly family)

16
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:41,908
(Hi)

17
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:43,350
(Hi)

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,919
(The first expression...)

19
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,219
(couldn't be more peaceful.)

20
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,559
(However...)

21
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,560
(There is something strange about this house.)

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,429
(The whole family is going somewhere.)

23
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,299
(We will survive.)

24
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,810
(They will survive?)

25
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,969
(They follow the family as if they were hypnotized.)

26
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,579
Gosh, unbelievable.

27
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,709
- Gosh. - Gosh.

28
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:17,518
(A novel sight)

29
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:19,780
- This is a first. - Gosh.

30
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:21,420
What's this?

31
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,048
Bravo.

32
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:25,060
(What will happen at this strange rented home?)

33
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,858
Very well. How does it feel?

34
00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:29,559
- It's perfect. - Okay.

35
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,459
(The younger guys are walking the horses.)

36
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:35,429
I think being around nature...

37
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,640
and especially horses is so relaxing.

38
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:40,139
- They do some weird things... - Yes.

39
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,310
Sometimes, so it's a lot of work.

40
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,639
Radda.

41
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,979
(The landlord's family walks the horses daily.)

42
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,049
Nice.

43
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,980
She's such a nice horse.

44
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:52,620
I wish I could just gallop away...

45
00:01:55,219 --> 00:01:56,619
without thinking about the consequences.

46
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,590
(You want to gallop?)

47
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,329
Watch out.

48
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,500
- No, Venla. - Dong Yeon.

49
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,029
(Let's go!)

50
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,400
Stop.

51
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:13,810
Dong Yeon.

52
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:17,209
(His friend continues moving further away.)

53
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,280
Dong Yeon.

54
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,348
Where are you going, Dong Yeon?

55
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:21,948
(How far are you going?)

56
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:22,979
Come back.

57
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:25,879
- I'll be there. - Dong Yeon.

58
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:29,549
(Dong Yeon has gone out of sight.)

59
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,659
You're so nice.

60
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:32,559
Pull the reins.

61
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,728
(A video of Dong Yeon being abducted by a horse)

62
00:02:33,729 --> 00:02:35,789
Pull the reins.

63
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,628
Pull them with all your strength.

64
00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:40,059
(Caught you, horse.)

65
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,400
No, Dong Yeon.

66
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:43,669
Hey.

67
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:46,198
- Eun Woo. - Yes?

68
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,769
Radda is following you.

69
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,909
(Let's go find our friends.)

70
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:52,809
I'm sorry.

71
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:53,810
It's okay.

72
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:57,120
How could you get abducted by a horse?

73
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,649
(The troublemaker horse ends up getting scolded.)

74
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,219
Here. That's so much better.

75
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:05,519
Okay, there you go.

76
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,429
I almost got kidnapped.

77
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,659
Yes, by a horse.

78
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:12,629
- To the forest. - Unknown forest.

79
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,929
There is nothing but a forest for hundreds of kilometers that way.

80
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,770
(Where Dong Yeon was abducted)

81
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,438
(He almost went missing in Lapland.)

82
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:21,810
- You almost got in trouble. - I was so surprised.

83
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:23,979
She tried to gallop.

84
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:25,609
- Really? - Yes.

85
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,879
(You said you wanted to gallop.)

86
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,348
She feels good going home.

87
00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:34,789
(They look relaxed even without the owner's help.)

88
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:39,888
This horse is farting and doing all sorts of things.

89
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:41,460
She even walked backward.

90
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:43,258
We somehow completed the walk.

91
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:45,099
Yes, we did.

92
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,599
Good girl.

93
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:49,699
She keeps farting.

94
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:51,939
Stop.

95
00:03:54,469 --> 00:03:55,638
Okay.

96
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:58,309
(Thanks to Radda, the good girl, )

97
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:03,080
(and Venla, the troublemaker, )

98
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,549
(they had an interesting walk.)

99
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,650
Good job.

100
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:09,050
That went well.

101
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,019
Thank you.

102
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,189
(You did a good job.)

103
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,559
(He heads to the house...)

104
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,788
(and sees Lampi, who is guarding the entrance.)

105
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:17,730
(She stares at Dong Yeon.)

106
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,199
(He gives her a sweet smile.)

107
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,898
(Eun Woo sits next to Lampi.)

108
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:25,939
Hi.

109
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,208
(Showing interest)

110
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:34,279
(Nodding)

111
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:37,550
(These are the berries I picked.)

112
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,289
(Picking berries in the forest...)

113
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:44,759
(is natural to the children.)

114
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:50,628
(They naturally learn the self-sufficient life.)

115
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:53,230
(I'll help you too.)

116
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:56,099
(Household chores are a part of the children's daily lives...)

117
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,839
(and a way for them to learn about nature.)

118
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,339
(Tasting the berries)

119
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:07,350
(Dong Hwi joins them.)

120
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:10,620
(Eun Woo's eyes are focused on Lampi.)

121
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,179
(Giving her another sweet smile)

122
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,219
Smile.

123
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,689
(Giving her another sweet smile)

124
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,290
- What's your name? - Let's go play.

125
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,889
(Leaving abruptly)

126
00:05:20,589 --> 00:05:21,628
(These guys feel hurt.)

127
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:23,290
Which of us made her leave?

128
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,698
- What? - Which of us made her leave?

129
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:25,929
I don't know.

130
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,199
I think it was me.

131
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,600
She's so cute.

132
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,500
She's really cute.

133
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,769
But she's very shy.

134
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:36,870
Yes.

135
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:41,878
(It's time for her favorite part of the day.)

136
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:44,250
(Excited)

137
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:46,519
- What? - Is she riding the horse?

138
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,589
She rides a pony.

139
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,290
She's so cute.

140
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,160
(Struggling)

141
00:05:56,329 --> 00:05:57,329
Come on.

142
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,198
- How adorable. - Yes.

143
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:01,469
(They are smitten with Lampi.)

144
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,600
It's like a movie scene.

145
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,039
Okay.

146
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,068
(The whole family goes somewhere.)

147
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:08,139
Come on.

148
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:10,069
Venla.

149
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:13,810
(Where are they going?)

150
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,378
(Standing up)

151
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:16,909
Let's go watch them.

152
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,850
(Let's follow them.)

153
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:23,050
(They casually follow the family's outing.)

154
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:24,719
Is her name Emma?

155
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,958
- Lampi. - Lampi?

156
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,159
- Yes. - Lampi.

157
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,859
Lampi means "love."

158
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,128
- Lampi means "love?" - Yes.

159
00:06:30,129 --> 00:06:31,230
Hey, Love.

160
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,128
(Dong Hwi is interested in the pony.)

161
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:35,269
Hey, pony.

162
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:36,898
He is Gandalf.

163
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:38,339
- Gandalf? - Yes.

164
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:40,438
From "The Lord of the Rings?"

165
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:41,508
- Yes. - I see.

166
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:42,539
Gandalf.

167
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,879
(This family has a funny way of naming the animals.)

168
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:47,948
The dog, horses, and the kid.

169
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:51,050
(The dog, horses, girl, and Renters all walk together.)

170
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,350
- Hey. - Hey.

171
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,688
Lampi.

172
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:56,648
(The family arrives at the lake, their destination.)

173
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:57,759
Love.

174
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,990
(What is Lampi's favorite part of the day?)

175
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:03,489
(What kind of day...)

176
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:08,569
(does the big family of Lapland have at the vast lake?)

177
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,439
Lampi.

178
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:14,068
(Lampi shows up in a swimsuit.)

179
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:15,240
She's so cute.

180
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:18,979
The kids must be going swimming.

181
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,110
I think so.

182
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,349
(Let me show you my special swimming session.)

183
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,409
She's so cute.

184
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,720
So cute.

185
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:26,050
I wish she were my daughter.

186
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,420
They went in.

187
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:31,119
- Gosh. - They went in.

188
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,290
Even the pony went in.

189
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,088
(Lampi's friend Gandalf follows her into the lake.)

190
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:36,360
Gandalf.

191
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:39,759
Go, Gandalf.

192
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:44,898
(Why is the pony in the water?)

193
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:46,499
(Then...)

194
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,839
(Lampi gets on the pony without a saddle.)

195
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:51,479
- She's going to ride the pony? - She's riding the pony?

196
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,078
(Their jaws drop.)

197
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:54,149
Unbelievable.

198
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:56,680
(Have fun.)

199
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,980
(See you.)

200
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,819
- She's cute. - She's so pretty.

201
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,089
Gosh.

202
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,388
- Seriously? - Gosh.

203
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:08,459
Unbelievable.

204
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,628
- Gosh. - That's amazing.

205
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:13,160
(I'm coming too.)

206
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:16,729
(They are drawn forward...)

207
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:20,500
(at the novel sight.)

208
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,508
(She moves one step at a time into the water...)

209
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:27,850
(while interacting with the pony.)

210
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,410
What's this?

211
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,450
- Gosh. - Gosh.

212
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:37,490
(Lampi's favorite part of the day is when the family goes swimming.)

213
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:42,960
(A special activity of the family that grew up in Lapland's nature)

214
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,268
(The breath of the horses, )

215
00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:50,128
(the current of the lake)

216
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:54,269
(They find peace in nature.)

217
00:08:55,539 --> 00:08:57,879
I've never seen anything like this.

218
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,049
Most people only ride horses on land.

219
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,379
You rarely get a chance to ride them in a lake.

220
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,090
(They are mesmerized at the unusual sight.)

221
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,319
Gosh.

222
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,820
(Thanos follows them.)

223
00:09:13,659 --> 00:09:15,589
- Are you going too? - He's following them.

224
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,628
Family should stick together.

225
00:09:17,629 --> 00:09:23,200
(The whole family enjoys their free time in nature.)

226
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:24,639
This is impressive.

227
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,168
Bravo.

228
00:09:26,169 --> 00:09:28,870
(It's a heart-warming moment.)

229
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:32,309
(Laughing)

230
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,178
This is amazing.

231
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:36,209
(They feel moved by the scene...)

232
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:39,980
(that looks like something from a movie.)

233
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:43,489
She's so cute.

234
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:47,360
(Lampi feels happy enjoying nature with her beloved family and animal.)

235
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:49,090
Unbelievable.

236
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:51,700
(Approaching)

237
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:55,429
(He doesn't fail to be sweet again.)

238
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:56,529
Thank you.

239
00:09:58,669 --> 00:10:00,299
Good job.

240
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:03,070
Unbelievable.

241
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:05,739
(Running past him)

242
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,779
(She's a chic little girl.)

243
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:10,980
Next one.

244
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,120
- Next one? - Next one?

245
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,219
(Does anyone want to try?)

246
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,289
Nobody?

247
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:18,759
(They want to try but are scared.)

248
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,990
- Nobody. - No.

249
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:24,259
(To let the horse and water guide them...)

250
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,399
(in this huge lake...)

251
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:33,539
(without a saddle or reins?)

252
00:10:34,169 --> 00:10:37,070
(They are nervous and scared to try something new.)

253
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:38,609
(Dong Yeon can't even swim, )

254
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:41,480
(and he was abducted by a horse.)

255
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:45,779
(The city boys are scared.)

256
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,350
A four-year-old can do that.

257
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,559
If she can, then you can.

258
00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:53,558
She asked if we won't try something a four-year-old can do.

259
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:55,289
- I know. - Goodness.

260
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:56,758
(The city boys are humiliated as a whole.)

261
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:58,799
- Are you scared? - Come on.

262
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,899
(It feels so good.)

263
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:03,700
She's provoking us.

264
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:05,339
She's calling us chickens.

265
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,639
(Can you really not do it?)

266
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,609
Should I go in?

267
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,139
(Feeling indecisive)

268
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,678
I did it.

269
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:12,909
"I did it."

270
00:11:13,309 --> 00:11:15,309
- You can do it? - You can do it?

271
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,778
(They don't know what to do...)

272
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:21,089
(when the whole family provokes them.)

273
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:24,360
Wait a minute. I'll bring my clothes.

274
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:25,490
Okay.

275
00:11:25,491 --> 00:11:26,820
(Good idea.)

276
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:31,230
(What? Aren't you scared, Dong Yeon?)

277
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:35,069
- Clothes? - One of us is finally doing it.

278
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,730
(Determined)

279
00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:40,500
(Carefully considering it)

280
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:43,169
Should I give it a try?

281
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,039
(Is Carpe Eun Woo going to try too?)

282
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:49,250
(Taking his vest off)

283
00:11:51,049 --> 00:11:54,549
(Keep this on.)

284
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,418
(What's this?)

285
00:11:58,419 --> 00:12:00,589
Aren't you cold? Should I button this up for you?

286
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:03,129
(No.)

287
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:08,600
(The only person that refuses to wear Cha Eun Woo's clothes)

288
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:12,899
(He checks the temperature before going in.)

289
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,808
(He gets mischievous.)

290
00:12:16,809 --> 00:12:18,679
Should I quickly try before Dong Yeon comes?

291
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,008
- Are you going first? - Should I try right away?

292
00:12:21,009 --> 00:12:22,580
- Yes, I'll go first. - Go ahead.

293
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,378
Let's see.

294
00:12:24,379 --> 00:12:25,480
(Unintentionally reproached)

295
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:27,749
I have a swimsuit somewhere.

296
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,990
(He gets ready without knowing Eun Woo is going first.)

297
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:30,990
Okay.

298
00:12:31,789 --> 00:12:32,789
This is great.

299
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:36,690
(He overcame his fear with his mischief.)

300
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,459
Let's go.

301
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,629
(Getting nervous for Eun Woo)

302
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:43,529
- Do I grab here? - Yes.

303
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:46,298
(He mounts the horse without hesitation.)

304
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:47,340
Hold tight.

305
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,409
(Looking forward to it)

306
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:51,638
- Now we go. - Yes, let's go.

307
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:53,980
(He gets nervous when it's time to move.)

308
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,479
Hold the mane tightly.

309
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,179
(They start moving with no saddle and Eun Woo holding onto the mane.)

310
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:02,518
(He goes into the lake despite his fear.)

311
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:03,590
That's impressive.

312
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:07,219
(He takes a step into unfamiliar territory.)

313
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,229
That's impressive.

314
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,830
(One step at a time)

315
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,059
You look good.

316
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,799
(See you.)

317
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:22,069
(He lets the horse guide him.)

318
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,308
(Gasping)

319
00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:25,878
(The cold water...)

320
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:29,710
(slowly wets him.)

321
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:37,049
(He lets the lake and the horse guide him.)

322
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,389
You're a brave guy.

323
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:40,820
You have no fear?

324
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,259
I have fear but...

325
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,259
(Gasping)

326
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,369
(He lets go of his fear...)

327
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:55,210
(and enjoys the freedom of letting the lake and horse guide him.)

328
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,080
Okay.

329
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:02,048
That's impressive.

330
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,779
(The older guys are living vicariously through Eun Woo.)

331
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:09,750
(When he lets go of his fear, )

332
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:18,128
(he feels every small movement...)

333
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:20,729
(of the horse...)

334
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:25,769
(and the water.)

335
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:29,869
(He feels something unfamiliar...)

336
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:33,878
(through this novel experience.)

337
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:35,750
Eun Woo, this is so impressive.

338
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:38,679
(He gives them a prince's bow.)

339
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,190
This is nice.

340
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:43,849
It feels good.

341
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,558
(When he gives it a try, it feels amazing.)

342
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:46,918
(However...)

343
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,259
Did Dong Yeon run away?

344
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:52,759
Should I wear normal clothes on top of my swimsuit?

345
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,429
I think it'll be cold.

346
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,940
Should I wear both of these?

347
00:14:58,299 --> 00:15:00,970
(While he gets ready without realizing what's happening...)

348
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:02,240
Let's go.

349
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,479
The horse is a good swimmer.

350
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,480
(They go in one by one.)

351
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:08,678
(Going in deep)

352
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:09,710
(Gasping)

353
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,719
(They aren't used to the feeling of the horse and water, )

354
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,820
(but it feels good.)

355
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:23,028
(The warmth of the horse helps them relax.)

356
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:24,299
(Letting out a joyful exclamation)

357
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:29,330
(I'm happy if you're happy.)

358
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:35,610
(They naturally interact as they feel the same current.)

359
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,080
This is amazing.

360
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:42,850
(It is? Then I want to try too.)

361
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:48,918
(He is coming, )

362
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:51,320
(taking big steps.)

363
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:55,089
(He has no idea.)

364
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:58,230
(They have no idea either.)

365
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,759
What's this?

366
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:05,940
What is going on?

367
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:08,039
- We all tried it. - Why are you wet?

368
00:16:08,409 --> 00:16:09,470
We all tried it.

369
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,008
(All three of them tried it before Dong Yeon returned.)

370
00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:12,808
- We all got provoked. - My swimming instructor...

371
00:16:12,809 --> 00:16:14,110
- told me... - Isn't this too much?

372
00:16:14,409 --> 00:16:16,148
I thought the water would be cold.

373
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:18,220
(The beginner swimmer is prepared from head to toe.)

374
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:19,919
What's this?

375
00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:21,589
- Don't use these. - Come on.

376
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,148
I don't know how to swim, so I need them.

377
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,690
- Really? - Do these float?

378
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:28,230
(He is definitely a planner.)

379
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:30,859
To the left.

380
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,399
(He is the man of nature that always tries things first.)

381
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:34,529
Okay.

382
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,069
(But he is highly nervous because he can't swim.)

383
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,739
Move a little up.

384
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,169
Yes, and hold on.

385
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:40,969
Look at Dong Yeon.

386
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,610
(He tightly grips the mane, his lifeline.)

387
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:48,149
(He shakes off his fear of water and horses and starts moving.)

388
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,148
(He trusts the horse as they slowly go into the lake.)

389
00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:53,679
- Okay? - Yes, I'm good.

390
00:16:55,049 --> 00:16:56,949
(Grunting)

391
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,419
- It's okay. - Yes.

392
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:00,959
(The unfamiliar sense of freedom...)

393
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:05,029
(after a moment of anxiety)

394
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,160
You're good at horseback riding.

395
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:19,009
(He shakes off his fear and concerns.)

396
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:24,920
(It's a novel experience focusing on the horse, the lake, and himself.)

397
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,390
(He feels something he's never felt before through the new experience.)

398
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,589
- Are you okay? - Yes, I'm good.

399
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,088
Are you glad you did it?

400
00:17:35,089 --> 00:17:36,430
Yes, thank you so much.

401
00:17:36,529 --> 00:17:38,700
Can I stay longer?

402
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,069
Dong Yeon, you look closer to the horse.

403
00:17:43,269 --> 00:17:45,400
- This is fun. - Yes, it is.

404
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:48,838
(Interacting with the horse...)

405
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:52,179
(helps him get over his fear of swimming...)

406
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:56,380
(and the PTSD from the abduction.)

407
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,749
(Cutting through the water with the horse...)

408
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,288
(is thrilling and relaxing.)

409
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:04,319
You're good at this.

410
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,059
Who would've imagined that we'd ride horses...

411
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,359
in the huge lake in Finland?

412
00:18:12,829 --> 00:18:14,130
- This is fun. - Yes, it is.

413
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,429
I've never seen anything like this.

414
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:22,108
(Life in Lapland makes you become a part of nature.)

415
00:18:22,109 --> 00:18:26,640
(They become part of nature through this novel experience.)

416
00:18:27,109 --> 00:18:31,619
(They become part of nature through an unfamiliar sense of freedom.)

417
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,018
(With a strange yet new experience)

418
00:18:37,019 --> 00:18:42,259
(they've taken a step closer to the life in Lapland.)

419
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,298
(The moment when the landlord's mundane days...)

420
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:52,170
(became our special days)

421
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,799
Let's go for a sauna.

422
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,409
After a sauna...

423
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:57,240
- Are you going to swim? - Yes.

424
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,979
(The young brothers go straight to the sauna...)

425
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,210
(after swimming with the horses.)

426
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:04,818
- Should we go for it, Dong Yeon? - Yes.

427
00:19:04,819 --> 00:19:06,318
(Finnish sauna has become part of their life now.)

428
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:07,548
- Are you ready? - Yes.

429
00:19:07,549 --> 00:19:08,789
- Here we go. - Yes.

430
00:19:08,849 --> 00:19:11,160
- They have a small ladle here. - Okay.

431
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:13,490
This much won't be too hot.

432
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,429
Let's get some sweat out.

433
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,029
(He's used to it.)

434
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:22,599
(During their first sauna, )

435
00:19:24,099 --> 00:19:28,910
(they couldn't bear one splash of water.)

436
00:19:29,609 --> 00:19:30,739
Make it hotter.

437
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,608
(Now, they need 1 sauna a day.)

438
00:19:32,609 --> 00:19:34,649
(They are honorary Lapland people.)

439
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:35,880
(Shouting)

440
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:37,480
(Amazed)

441
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:39,719
Gosh. I can feel it.

442
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,249
(Their fatigue disappears.)

443
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,719
(Feeling languid)

444
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,419
Aleksi's sauna was the most premium, indeed.

445
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,318
- Right. That was the best. - Yes.

446
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,359
(After one splash, they think about their first rented house.)

447
00:19:49,329 --> 00:19:52,730
(They add another ladle of water.)

448
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,829
When it gets a little hotter than this, I'll go...

449
00:19:56,269 --> 00:19:58,499
- Are you going to dive in? - But the water of the lake is...

450
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,740
Cold.

451
00:20:00,069 --> 00:20:01,069
The lake by Oiva's place...

452
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,268
- was really clear. - Right.

453
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:04,608
- It was as it was used by one home. - Right.

454
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:05,740
(With the second splash, they think of the second house.)

455
00:20:07,609 --> 00:20:09,108
(Filled with steam)

456
00:20:09,109 --> 00:20:10,650
- It gets blurry right away, right? - Yes.

457
00:20:12,619 --> 00:20:16,950
(Here's a sight for sore eyes.)

458
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,589
(Eye-opening)

459
00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:24,798
(He's sweet even to objects.)

460
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,000
- It's warm. - Gosh.

461
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,430
- I'll add another. - Okay.

462
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:33,339
(They cure their fatigue by pouring water constantly.)

463
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,210
(They groan because they love it.)

464
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:42,049
- I'm going to the lake. - Really?

465
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,479
(And a lake swimming after sauna!)

466
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,349
- Get going. I'll be here. - Okay.

467
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,419
(I am...)

468
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,220
(a Finnish man, Kwak Dong Yeon.)

469
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:55,430
(There's nothing I can't do now.)

470
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:59,059
(Bring it on, Lake.)

471
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,568
(Swimming? I can do that.)

472
00:21:02,569 --> 00:21:03,869
Darn it.

473
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,940
(First, I need to squeeze myself into the life jacket.)

474
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,909
(Actually, it's Lampi's life jacket.)

475
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:12,579
(Tight)

476
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:17,750
(After putting on the life jacket, he puts on the flippers too.)

477
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,949
(Geared-up Dong Yeon goes for lake swimming, )

478
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,419
(which is part of the sauna routine.)

479
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,959
(After swimming with the horses, he has overcome his fear of water.)

480
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,730
(He dives in without hesitation.)

481
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:38,539
(He lets Lampi's life jacket carry him.)

482
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,409
(Do I want to swim now?)

483
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:46,740
(Dong Yeon, who was afraid of water, )

484
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,778
(has overcome his fear...)

485
00:21:50,779 --> 00:21:54,990
(and now enjoys the freedom enfolded in the lake.)

486
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:02,489
(Dong Yeon is here.)

487
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:04,588
(Did I...)

488
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:07,859
(come too far?)

489
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,170
Where is this?

490
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:14,640
(I can go back, then.)

491
00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:17,338
(While living in Lapland, )

492
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:21,410
(surrounded by lakes, )

493
00:22:22,309 --> 00:22:26,849
(water is no longer a subject of fear, but part of daily life.)

494
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:29,149
(Special thanks to...)

495
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:32,289
(Lampi's life jacket)

496
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,588
(He has fully adapted to water.)

497
00:22:34,589 --> 00:22:38,559
(Dong Yeon is a true Lapland boy now.)

498
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,430
(Meanwhile, in the house)

499
00:22:42,829 --> 00:22:44,368
(What is this sound?)

500
00:22:44,369 --> 00:22:47,240
(It's the sound of the shower they missed so much.)

501
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:49,768
I love the water temperature!

502
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:51,209
(Laughing)

503
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,838
I'll be out in one minute.

504
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,440
Take your time.

505
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:58,880
(They love the world with waterworks.)

506
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:04,250
(The younger ones head to the warm jacuzzi after the sauna.)

507
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:08,018
(But...)

508
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:12,729
(it's too hot.)

509
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:13,799
Should I go for it?

510
00:23:16,569 --> 00:23:20,669
(He is in involuntary slow motion because it's hotter than expected.)

511
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,169
(Laughing)

512
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:23,670
(He feels the pain too.)

513
00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:27,640
(He finally goes into the hot bath successfully.)

514
00:23:28,579 --> 00:23:31,819
(It's so hot.)

515
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:37,589
(Eventually, Eun Woo gets out in 5 seconds.)

516
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:40,959
Darn it.

517
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,289
He's hot.

518
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:44,258
With his hair wet and all.

519
00:23:44,259 --> 00:23:45,430
(He's so handsome that one can curse.)

520
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:48,798
(The shots by the cameramen with their personal interest begin.)

521
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,000
Come on.

522
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:53,439
(Buzzing male cameramen)

523
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,599
Shoot now.

524
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,709
(Admiration and cursing continue.)

525
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:56,969
He's hot.

526
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:59,278
(When the shade blocks the view of Eun Woo's face...)

527
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,440
Move the camera.

528
00:24:00,609 --> 00:24:01,879
I'll go around the back.

529
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,910
(What's there to say? Move it already.)

530
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,519
He's looking even better.

531
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,880
- Darn it. - It's cold.

532
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:11,220
(They satisfy their personal interest.)

533
00:24:12,289 --> 00:24:15,789
(He's even enchanting the cameras too.)

534
00:24:21,569 --> 00:24:24,170
(Mischievous Eun Woo is back.)

535
00:24:25,069 --> 00:24:27,599
(Cameraman: Eun Woo, what are you doing?)

536
00:24:28,609 --> 00:24:31,069
(His mischievous mode is on.)

537
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:36,309
(Joining the fun)

538
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:41,349
(Can anyone tell us why he is so serious?)

539
00:24:42,589 --> 00:24:45,058
(Attacking himself)

540
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:46,920
- Do you know how to do it? - No.

541
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:56,470
(The friends of the same age, 27 years old, get along well.)

542
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,739
(Worried)

543
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,239
(I'll splash it.)

544
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,939
(Shaking)

545
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,839
It's shaking its head.

546
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:10,650
(They get along so well when they are having fun.)

547
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:14,518
(After playing for a while...)

548
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:15,588
What are the others doing?

549
00:25:15,589 --> 00:25:17,589
- I think they're taking a shower. - Yes?

550
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:22,430
Gosh. Since I had some fun,

551
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,099
for the boys, I'll... Hold on.

552
00:25:26,329 --> 00:25:27,929
How do I use the induction cooktop?

553
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:29,400
(How do I use the induction cooktop?)

554
00:25:30,069 --> 00:25:31,229
Is this how I do it?

555
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,038
(As he has gotten used to braziers, )

556
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,469
(the former city boy feels unfamiliar with civilization.)

557
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,470
(Surprised)

558
00:25:36,471 --> 00:25:40,179
(Even the mechanic sound feels new after a long time.)

559
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,309
Okay, then...

560
00:25:41,849 --> 00:25:43,108
(He starts making jam.)

561
00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:44,278
Here.

562
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:45,819
(Featuring civilization he faces after a long time)

563
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,819
That's good.

564
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,890
Okay. Here we go.

565
00:25:54,089 --> 00:25:57,528
(Je Hoon, who had no talent in housework, )

566
00:25:57,529 --> 00:26:01,129
This is only enough for one meal.

567
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:02,500
(learns the fun of harvesting and cooking himself.)

568
00:26:02,869 --> 00:26:05,969
(Lingonberries are known for being sour and astringent.)

569
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:10,309
(Combined with sugar, it's perfectly sour and sweet.)

570
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,008
Two to one. Two for the sugar.

571
00:26:14,009 --> 00:26:15,149
(2 parts sugar to 1 part berries)

572
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:17,808
(He learned the recipe already.)

573
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:18,979
Good.

574
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,380
(He controls the amount precisely.)

575
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:24,920
(Let me tell you how I've gotten perfect life skills in Lapland.)

576
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:30,358
(A harmony between sour lingonberries and sweet sugar)

577
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:32,799
(Refreshing and sweet)

578
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:35,200
I have to stir it constantly.

579
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,298
Jam is all about caring.

580
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:40,439
(The fun of harvesting and making)

581
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,609
It's made with lots of care.

582
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:48,039
(The future cooking king is now interested in cooking.)

583
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:51,920
It has become a jam.

584
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:54,579
(But it might not be enough.)

585
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,119
This is it.

586
00:26:56,349 --> 00:26:58,960
(Super proud)

587
00:26:59,819 --> 00:27:01,318
Am I...

588
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:02,729
a patissier type?

589
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:03,930
Goodness.

590
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:08,699
I should aim to be the one specialized in desserts.

591
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,098
(Handmade lingonberry jam is complete.)

592
00:27:11,099 --> 00:27:13,799
(Did he successfully reduce the sourness?)

593
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:18,538
(The landlord, Katja, has come to do the dishes.)

594
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:20,308
(Staring)

595
00:27:20,309 --> 00:27:21,480
- Hey. - Hey.

596
00:27:22,109 --> 00:27:24,309
This is lingonberry jam.

597
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,919
Okay. Did you make it?

598
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,679
- I made it. - By yourself?

599
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,849
- Yes. - Good.

600
00:27:29,349 --> 00:27:31,118
(Interested)

601
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:32,390
What do you think?

602
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:34,719
(Can I try it?)

603
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,088
One second.

604
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:38,358
(He quickly hands her a spoon.)

605
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:39,500
- Here. - Okay.

606
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:42,670
(Following her like a child)

607
00:27:42,769 --> 00:27:44,828
- It looks like a real one. - Yes.

608
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,369
(Super nervous)

609
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,809
Very good.

610
00:27:52,609 --> 00:27:55,210
(Ecstatic)

611
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:58,649
- Maybe... - Yes.

612
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:00,618
(However)

613
00:28:00,619 --> 00:28:02,720
- Little bit of sugar... - Yes.

614
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,318
- Little bit more sugar? - Yes.

615
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:05,589
- Okay. - Yes.

616
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,518
That will work for you.

617
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,430
(There's always more to learn in the field of cooking.)

618
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:11,690
Add a little more sugar.

619
00:28:12,099 --> 00:28:13,699
- Okay. Thank you. - Yes.

620
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,759
(Leaving casually after giving a lesson)

621
00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:16,599
Gosh.

622
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,169
I feel good.

623
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,670
(The advice allows the novice cook to grow.)

624
00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:24,440
Gosh. That was refreshing.

625
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:27,538
(Dong Yeon finishes taking a shower after the sauna.)

626
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,980
Okay. Let's go.

627
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,390
Goodness.

628
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:40,288
Gosh. It's so cozy.

629
00:28:40,289 --> 00:28:41,519
- It's crazy. - Isn't it nice?

630
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:42,959
(Grabbing)

631
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,289
It's crazy.

632
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:46,499
You look like the owner of the house.

633
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,729
Gosh. It's so pretty.

634
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,929
(He captures Je Hoon who is sitting prettily.)

635
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:52,139
- Je Hoon. I need a favor. - Yes.

636
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,740
Just sit comfortably.

637
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,538
(He was sitting comfortably, )

638
00:28:55,539 --> 00:28:58,910
(but the request makes him uncomfortable.)

639
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,078
(Clicking)

640
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:01,179
I just shot...

641
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,309
- a photo of your lifetime. - Okay.

642
00:29:03,849 --> 00:29:04,950
Look.

643
00:29:05,049 --> 00:29:06,150
Goodness.

644
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,318
- It's amazing. - Isn't it amazing?

645
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:10,088
- Let me change the position. - Look.

646
00:29:10,089 --> 00:29:11,150
Gosh.

647
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,259
- Please take me one too. - Okay.

648
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:16,429
- Where are you going to sit? Okay. - Where you were sitting.

649
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:17,829
(They take lots of photos without worrying about the battery.)

650
00:29:18,329 --> 00:29:19,959
(He fixes his pose.)

651
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,160
A house-owner vibe.

652
00:29:22,269 --> 00:29:24,170
(You know what I'm talking about, right?)

653
00:29:24,869 --> 00:29:26,440
(Amazed)

654
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:30,210
(It's missing something.)

655
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,909
(He uses a prop to fill it up.)

656
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:37,809
(His lips don't even touch the rim.)

657
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:42,450
(He is satisfied with the subject's pose.)

658
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:45,689
(The flashlight keeps going off...)

659
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:48,160
(and so does the atmosphere.)

660
00:29:50,259 --> 00:29:51,588
You have the photo of your lifetime.

661
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:52,660
- I'll send it to you. - Okay.

662
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:54,599
- But now, Je Hoon, - Yes.

663
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,700
- we have to cook. - Shall we?

664
00:29:57,829 --> 00:30:00,740
I'll make a rolled omelette.

665
00:30:00,769 --> 00:30:02,268
- Rolled omelette? - Look forward to it.

666
00:30:02,269 --> 00:30:03,709
We don't have butter, right?

667
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:04,809
No, we don't.

668
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,909
(Concerns come first...)

669
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:08,710
(than the pain.)

670
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:10,180
I've searched everything already.

671
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:14,048
(For a novice cook, )

672
00:30:14,049 --> 00:30:16,788
(the kitchen has been cruel.)

673
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:17,819
It's hot.

674
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,318
(And now, they are offered...)

675
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,829
(with the benefits of the civilization.)

676
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:25,629
(No more water fetching.)

677
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:27,799
(We have waterworks now!)

678
00:30:28,299 --> 00:30:29,899
(The suffering and hardship...)

679
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,568
(will be gone now.)

680
00:30:32,569 --> 00:30:34,399
(In the perfect kitchen, )

681
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,240
(will they have their happy ending?)

682
00:30:37,339 --> 00:30:38,439
(But after a moment, )

683
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,508
(Smashing)

684
00:30:39,509 --> 00:30:41,240
- Hey, Je Hoon. - My goodness.

685
00:30:41,509 --> 00:30:44,750
(a misfortune caused by civilization begins.)

686
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,618
What are you making?

687
00:30:46,619 --> 00:30:48,619
I'll make...

688
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,549
the rolled omelette.

689
00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:53,759
- You're going to be an egg master. - Yes.

690
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,059
(Thinking)

691
00:30:58,490 --> 00:30:59,930
Use the butter if you need it.

692
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,729
Okay.

693
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:03,470
(He gives up the butter since everyone is worried.)

694
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:06,339
Then...

695
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:08,669
Are you cooking now?

696
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,440
Yes. I can get going.

697
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,980
(He knew nothing except for a weight-losing diet.)

698
00:31:15,349 --> 00:31:19,250
(There's a reason he's obsessed with cooking.)

699
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:21,989
(He just wants to serve...)

700
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:24,690
(a tasty dish to the younger brothers.)

701
00:31:24,819 --> 00:31:27,660
(After going through disdain and oppression, )

702
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:31,529
(he has leveled up!)

703
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:34,359
Yes. We have many knives.

704
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:38,029
(He can't make excuses anymore.)

705
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:41,240
(He won't fail today.)

706
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,268
(First, )

707
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:45,880
(he prepares the onions.)

708
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,079
(So, the onions should be...)

709
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:52,548
- Cut the end. - The end.

710
00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:55,819
(He learned how to prepare onions from Homemaker Kwak.)

711
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:58,318
(He cuts the root off...)

712
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:00,259
(as he learned.)

713
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:03,328
Do I wash this?

714
00:32:03,329 --> 00:32:05,558
(Of course, now, )

715
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:08,329
(he does what's considered a matter of course.)

716
00:32:09,769 --> 00:32:13,569
(He washes the carrots when no one tells him to.)

717
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:18,039
I need to julienne it, so I should cut it the long way.

718
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:20,240
I saw them chopping it fast.

719
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:25,578
Chopping.

720
00:32:25,579 --> 00:32:27,348
(He makes chopping sound with his mouth...)

721
00:32:27,349 --> 00:32:29,119
(as his hands can't do it.)

722
00:32:29,619 --> 00:32:30,690
Okay.

723
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:32,920
Gosh. This is really...

724
00:32:33,789 --> 00:32:36,259
It's not easy to julienne it.

725
00:32:37,029 --> 00:32:38,358
- It's not easy. - Right.

726
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:39,828
You might hurt yourself.

727
00:32:39,829 --> 00:32:42,000
Yes. I'm cutting it thinly while being careful.

728
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:45,269
(Washing his hands in the sink before cooking)

729
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,970
Do I get to wash my hands right away like this?

730
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,568
(He's amazed by the developed civilization.)

731
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:51,869
I don't have to crouch.

732
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:53,879
(He feels him.)

733
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,649
I'm feeling grateful,

734
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:58,720
but I wonder if it's something I should be grateful for.

735
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:03,419
For goodness sake. For the past week,

736
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,319
we drew water and used it.

737
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,460
(They tried to save a drop of water back then.)

738
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:13,829
I'm cooking with the sink where the water...

739
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:17,028
comes out from the faucet, and I can't believe it.

740
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:18,170
Right.

741
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,970
(And there's another surprise.)

742
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,670
It has sprouted.

743
00:33:25,509 --> 00:33:28,240
(The garlic they bought a few days ago)

744
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,779
Isn't it bad to use garlic that has sprouted?

745
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:33,118
(Searching Homemaker Kwak's encyclopedia)

746
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:35,618
Isn't that the case for garlic?

747
00:33:35,619 --> 00:33:37,150
Why am I wondering about it?

748
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,390
- You can look it up. - I can look it up.

749
00:33:40,089 --> 00:33:42,558
(They still have the habits from having no Wi-Fi.)

750
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,929
- Sprouted garlic. - Okay.

751
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:46,758
(Can you eat sprouted garlic?)

752
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:48,230
Can we eat it?

753
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:50,069
It won't be a problem.

754
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,469
(They're slowly getting used to the developed environment.)

755
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:52,599
It's simple.

756
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:56,069
What should I do first? Hold on.

757
00:33:56,109 --> 00:33:57,939
(Chef Kwak is preparing a secret menu, a special pasta.)

758
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,440
Should I mince the garlic first?

759
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:01,308
Do you want me to put it in the fridge?

760
00:34:01,309 --> 00:34:02,409
(One guy overhears about the garlic mincing.)

761
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:04,078
- Do I have to mince garlic again? - Yes.

762
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:06,880
Does he have to mince garlic again?

763
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,250
- Is there a lot of garlic? - Garlic mincing never ends.

764
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:10,819
I'll mince it.

765
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,159
- Are you going to do it? - Yes.

766
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:14,519
It won't take long, so I'll do it.

767
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:17,529
(Someone is quiet, which is unnerving.)

768
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:19,400
Eun Woo, what are you making?

769
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,098
The napa cabbage steamed with wine.

770
00:34:21,099 --> 00:34:22,300
I see.

771
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,729
I can make it in 15 minutes.

772
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,039
- Really? - Yes.

773
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:29,269
(Eun Woo's super simple napa cabbage steamed with wine)

774
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:31,268
(With white wine, )

775
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:33,178
(napa cabbage, )

776
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:36,909
(and beef, it's all set.)

777
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:39,948
(Eun Woo's super simple napa cabbage steamed with wine)

778
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:42,079
(1. Put a layer of cleaned napa cabbage in a pot.)

779
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:47,859
(Suddenly, )

780
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:50,530
(Mischievous Eun Woo stops.)

781
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:52,960
(The size of the napa cabbage should be...)

782
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:55,629
(As the kitchen has gotten better, )

783
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:58,029
(his desire and worries for a better quality increases.)

784
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,869
Is this too big for a bite?

785
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,738
- Well. - If you can chop it once...

786
00:35:02,739 --> 00:35:04,340
- Maybe cut it in half? - Yes.

787
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,340
Lengthwise.

788
00:35:06,809 --> 00:35:08,010
Okay.

789
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:13,119
- Lengthwise? Like this? - Yes.

790
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:15,920
(A new, differentiated opinion)

791
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:17,150
Yes.

792
00:35:17,489 --> 00:35:18,788
(Laughing)

793
00:35:18,789 --> 00:35:20,518
- Really? - That's unconventional.

794
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:22,590
Aren't we going to eat it as a wrap?

795
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:25,130
(Thinking)

796
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:27,429
I'll cut it widthwise, not lengthwise.

797
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:28,760
Okay.

798
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,669
(Eun Woo's super simple napa cabbage steamed with wine)

799
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:38,038
(1. Put a layer of cleaned napa cabbage in a pot.)

800
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:43,609
(2. Add a layer of beef on top of it.)

801
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:50,388
(3. Season beef with salt and pepper.)

802
00:35:50,389 --> 00:35:56,659
(4. Pile the cabbage and beef layer by layer.)

803
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:02,099
(Drizzle white wine to finish.)

804
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:05,699
(All he needs to do is to boil it.)

805
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,940
(He wants one last ingredient.)

806
00:36:10,269 --> 00:36:12,939
(That is...)

807
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,809
(garlic.)

808
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,308
(In the civilized kitchen, )

809
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:20,519
(one man still works with his hands.)

810
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:24,590
(The garlic skin has piled up like a mountain.)

811
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:28,219
(Blurred vision)

812
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,690
(Looking around)

813
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:34,300
Okay. I'll be done quickly because there aren't many.

814
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:36,800
Wouldn't they have...

815
00:36:37,099 --> 00:36:38,400
a garlic chopper here?

816
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:40,968
(That's true. They have everything.)

817
00:36:40,969 --> 00:36:42,969
That's true. I'll look for it.

818
00:36:45,139 --> 00:36:46,979
(But even when they check...)

819
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,809
(here and there...)

820
00:36:48,949 --> 00:36:50,179
I don't see it.

821
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,779
(Only one man misses the benefit of the civilization.)

822
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,980
My goodness.

823
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,319
(He decides to put in the garlic later.)

824
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,518
It starts to boil.

825
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:01,190
It's 9:10pm right now.

826
00:37:01,789 --> 00:37:03,828
It'll check on it at 9:20pm.

827
00:37:03,829 --> 00:37:05,289
(Current time 9:10pm He will be done in ten minutes.)

828
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:08,559
(But...)

829
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:10,268
Cutting this up...

830
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:11,269
(But there's a problem here.)

831
00:37:11,269 --> 00:37:12,269
is exhausting.

832
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:15,468
(Progress on the rolled omelette is 30 percent.)

833
00:37:15,469 --> 00:37:20,280
(Progress on the garlic is 50 percent.)

834
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,409
How long will the pasta take, Dong Yeon?

835
00:37:22,849 --> 00:37:24,909
I can make it quickly as soon as I have the garlic.

836
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,119
What time do we have to finish by?

837
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,888
Is there a time limit?

838
00:37:31,889 --> 00:37:32,960
(They can't seem to keep up with the improved environment.)

839
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:34,920
There is a time limit.

840
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,960
(So Eun Woo is taking action.)

841
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,859
If you don't finish up in ten minutes,

842
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:43,369
you have to go into the water.

843
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,630
- Seriously? - Yes.

844
00:37:45,369 --> 00:37:46,839
(The starving younger brother is taking scary measures.)

845
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,570
Ten minutes is too short.

846
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:51,069
(Eun Woo is letting them know...)

847
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,979
I have to peel all these in ten minutes?

848
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:53,980
(that he's hungry in a frightening way.)

849
00:37:54,309 --> 00:37:55,480
I'll try cutting these all at once.

850
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:59,250
(The kind older brothers speed up just in case they have to dive in.)

851
00:38:00,179 --> 00:38:01,819
(At Mischievous Eun Woo's words, )

852
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:04,550
(they're working much faster.)

853
00:38:05,989 --> 00:38:07,989
I finished cutting up the onion. No, not onion.

854
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:09,729
(Side effect: He's overwhelmed.)

855
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:10,760
I finished cutting up the carrot.

856
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:14,730
(Now, it's actually time for him to cut up the onion.)

857
00:38:18,699 --> 00:38:22,039
(He's in a hurry but he's still calmly using the knife.)

858
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:25,010
(Je Hoon has improved quite a lot, though.)

859
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:27,780
(Focused)

860
00:38:28,309 --> 00:38:29,650
(Gosh)

861
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:33,049
When an onion's making my eyes water,

862
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:35,419
did you say I should close one eye? My left one?

863
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,249
Cut it while holding water in your mouth.

864
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:38,250
Water.

865
00:38:39,219 --> 00:38:42,730
(Having a sink inside the kitchen means he can take action quickly.)

866
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:48,199
(With his cheeks full, Je Hoon gets back to cutting the onion.)

867
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:50,500
(Grunting)

868
00:38:52,769 --> 00:38:54,339
I think it's kind of working.

869
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,839
- It really works. - Yes.

870
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,969
(It works well, right?)

871
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:00,209
I'm done peeling the garlic.

872
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:02,710
(It's now time to mince the garlic.)

873
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:06,780
(Dong Hwi brings out a ziplock bag as usual.)

874
00:39:07,449 --> 00:39:09,149
(How can I do this quickly?)

875
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,150
I have to hurry.

876
00:39:10,989 --> 00:39:12,788
(The master of garlic...)

877
00:39:12,789 --> 00:39:15,320
(is suddenly cleaning up.)

878
00:39:16,059 --> 00:39:19,199
(Why is he rolling up his sleeves?)

879
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,630
(The master of garlic is getting into an extraordinary position.)

880
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,400
I'm going to start hand-chopping.

881
00:39:25,699 --> 00:39:27,400
(Hand-chopping?)

882
00:39:27,969 --> 00:39:29,268
(Chop)

883
00:39:29,269 --> 00:39:31,440
(Chop)

884
00:39:32,539 --> 00:39:36,010
(The modern kitchen is filled with a primeval sound.)

885
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:37,650
I have to hurry.

886
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:39,320
(Chop)

887
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,250
(Flying over the couch)

888
00:39:42,889 --> 00:39:46,289
(They've had to acquire many skills to adapt to the hard country life.)

889
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,460
(The master of garlic doesn't even feel pain anymore.)

890
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:56,429
(That must be painful.)

891
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,170
Chopsticks. There they are.

892
00:39:58,429 --> 00:39:59,440
There are lots of them.

893
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:00,639
Dong Hwi.

894
00:40:01,769 --> 00:40:04,609
(Dong Yeon freaks out after seeing something.)

895
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,209
Dong...

896
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:07,980
(A grinding bowl?)

897
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:11,510
(Dong Hwi...)

898
00:40:12,409 --> 00:40:14,820
(The name he wants to call out to, but can't)

899
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:17,589
(It's...)

900
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:19,158
(you, )

901
00:40:19,159 --> 00:40:21,289
(who are chopping with your hand.)

902
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:24,658
(Dong Yeon can't...)

903
00:40:24,659 --> 00:40:28,530
(bring himself to tell Dong Hwi the truth.)

904
00:40:28,929 --> 00:40:31,928
("Maybe I could see you.")

905
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:34,769
(This man was looking forward to it.)

906
00:40:34,869 --> 00:40:36,440
- What is it? - Wait.

907
00:40:36,969 --> 00:40:38,239
Wait.

908
00:40:39,579 --> 00:40:42,010
Is it too late to give this to him?

909
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:43,550
Right now?

910
00:40:43,551 --> 00:40:45,750
Will it make things worse?

911
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,379
It could. He's almost...

912
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,449
He's almost done, right?

913
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:51,319
He's already minced a third of it.

914
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,518
Then we'll pretend we didn't see it.

915
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:54,090
Let's stay quiet about it for now.

916
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:57,960
(They decide to stay quiet for him.)

917
00:40:58,659 --> 00:41:01,860
(The two are worried about hurting his feelings.)

918
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,139
(Chop)

919
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:09,439
(Seeing the garlic escape...)

920
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,808
(is making him upset.)

921
00:41:10,809 --> 00:41:12,409
The garlic keeps sliding out.

922
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:16,649
(Dong Hwi couldn't help but express how he feels.)

923
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:19,149
He's having trouble right now.

924
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,150
Should we just give it to him?

925
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:24,820
I think he's about to give up.

926
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:27,460
You should bring it to him.

927
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:29,190
All right.

928
00:41:29,191 --> 00:41:30,689
(They're going to tell him the truth.)

929
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:32,030
Start by saying "What?"

930
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,829
What? What's this?

931
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:35,659
Hey.

932
00:41:36,329 --> 00:41:38,499
This was in a corner all along.

933
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,800
(He puts on a performance for one person.)

934
00:41:40,739 --> 00:41:42,500
I found this in a corner.

935
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:45,439
- I found this in a corner. - What?

936
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,440
(Gosh)

937
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,408
- Je Hoon. - Yes?

938
00:41:48,409 --> 00:41:51,980
(Dong Hwi is finally given something he's been longing for.)

939
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:55,449
(He's so shocked that he stopped what he was doing.)

940
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:58,789
(Je Hoon stays in character.)

941
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,260
Use this.

942
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:02,488
- This was in the house. - Goodness.

943
00:42:02,489 --> 00:42:03,760
(It's a little too late, but nice to see you, grinding bowl.)

944
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:06,730
I got this.

945
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,399
You good?

946
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,599
(Don't touch my grinding bowl.)

947
00:42:10,869 --> 00:42:12,369
I can't believe we had this.

948
00:42:12,539 --> 00:42:14,999
I'm so foolish.

949
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,409
(Still, Dong Hwi got his happy ending.)

950
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:20,780
(The house is filled with the sound of Dong Hwi grinding the garlic.)

951
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:22,110
I'm done.

952
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:23,809
I love this house.

953
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,050
Put a little in here, please.

954
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,619
- A little? - Yes.

955
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:28,819
- Thank you. - Here.

956
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:29,948
(He shares the garlic he struggled to mince.)

957
00:42:29,949 --> 00:42:31,090
Dong Yeon.

958
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:33,119
Here you go.

959
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,190
Thank you, Dong Hwi.

960
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:38,259
I'll quickly start boiling water...

961
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,329
to cook the noodles.

962
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:40,630
What are you going to make?

963
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:42,630
- Pasta. - Right.

964
00:42:42,929 --> 00:42:44,800
- Pasta. - You wanted pasta.

965
00:42:45,269 --> 00:42:46,598
(Dong Yeon's pasta!)

966
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:48,199
(I'm so excited.)

967
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,709
(Kwak Dong Yeon's dishes...)

968
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:52,840
(have never failed so far.)

969
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,710
(In any challenging environment, )

970
00:42:57,579 --> 00:43:01,050
(whatever adversity he faced, )

971
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:03,920
(Adversity)

972
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:07,219
(Chef Kwak kept his brothers fed.)

973
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,929
(He's made many different dishes throughout their trip.)

974
00:43:12,699 --> 00:43:14,098
(But Napolitan...)

975
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:16,230
(is Chef Kwak's signature dish!)

976
00:43:16,769 --> 00:43:17,929
(Approaching Dong Yeon)

977
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,940
(Peeking)

978
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:21,839
(With an induction cooktop, )

979
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,269
(Chef Kwak is invincible!)

980
00:43:24,809 --> 00:43:27,510
(He's boiling the noodles and making the sauce at the same time.)

981
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,308
(Dong Yeon has lived alone for 15 years.)

982
00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:34,079
(Napolitan is his specialty!)

983
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,050
(I'll show them!)

984
00:43:36,449 --> 00:43:37,718
(A tip for people who live alone: The Napolitan...)

985
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:41,960
(is perfect for emptying out the fridge.)

986
00:43:42,489 --> 00:43:45,058
(He chopped up the vegetables that were left.)

987
00:43:45,059 --> 00:43:47,230
I'm going to appreciate the food I eat from now on.

988
00:43:50,269 --> 00:43:51,499
We already used it.

989
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,239
(Ham, sausage, or bacon. Use whatever you have.)

990
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,670
(The packaging on the bacon is being stubborn.)

991
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:01,539
(In that case, )

992
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:04,309
(I'll have to use this.)

993
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:06,218
(I choose you!)

994
00:44:06,219 --> 00:44:08,179
(Utility knife!)

995
00:44:09,949 --> 00:44:12,518
(The knife instantly cuts through the wrapping.)

996
00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:13,889
Aleksi's knife works so well.

997
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:16,359
I think you're going to keep using that knife in Korea too.

998
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,429
I think so too.

999
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:20,360
But people will think I'm weird if I carry it with me everywhere.

1000
00:44:22,929 --> 00:44:25,769
(Everything's going well with the pasta.)

1001
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:31,569
(He throws in everything they have, )

1002
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:34,780
(which are bacon and sausage.)

1003
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:38,209
(Dong Yeon makes sure...)

1004
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:41,219
(to wash his hands in between.)

1005
00:44:41,349 --> 00:44:44,249
Chop.

1006
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:45,250
(Je Hoon is still making sounds as he cuts up the vegetables.)

1007
00:44:45,989 --> 00:44:47,459
(Once the ingredients are all prepped, )

1008
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:50,190
(it's time to start cooking!)

1009
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:53,659
(Pour olive oil onto the pan.)

1010
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:56,899
(After checking the heat, )

1011
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:00,940
(throw in the onions and bacon.)

1012
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:05,969
(Then, scoop the minced garlic so nothing is wasted...)

1013
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,179
(and put everything in the pan.)

1014
00:45:09,909 --> 00:45:13,579
(Stir-fry the onion and bacon.)

1015
00:45:16,219 --> 00:45:19,119
(In the meantime, boil the noodles.)

1016
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,788
(In the boiled water flavored with chicken stock, )

1017
00:45:23,789 --> 00:45:26,760
(cook the noodles.)

1018
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:31,369
(Nice!)

1019
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:34,669
(After boiling the noodles for 8 minutes, )

1020
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:37,469
(move them straight to the pan.)

1021
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:40,109
(Next, add in...)

1022
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:41,408
(the sausage, )

1023
00:45:41,409 --> 00:45:42,678
(butter, )

1024
00:45:42,679 --> 00:45:44,449
(and oyster sauce.)

1025
00:45:45,179 --> 00:45:47,448
(Without using any store-bought sauce, )

1026
00:45:47,449 --> 00:45:50,519
(finish up by adding ketchup.)

1027
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:52,888
(The Napolitan...)

1028
00:45:52,889 --> 00:45:56,159
(is finished in no time!)

1029
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:58,689
This is great.

1030
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:01,860
(Chef Kwak's signature dish is ready to be served!)

1031
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:04,698
Let's go.

1032
00:46:04,699 --> 00:46:07,339
(Meanwhile, the eldest brother is seasoning the beaten egg.)

1033
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:09,639
(Cautious)

1034
00:46:10,269 --> 00:46:13,909
(He adds the salt in moderation, unlike the past.)

1035
00:46:14,909 --> 00:46:16,308
Goodness.

1036
00:46:16,309 --> 00:46:18,250
(The creator of salty scrambled eggs has made great progress.)

1037
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:22,420
(Je Hoon is beating the eggs like a master chef.)

1038
00:46:23,849 --> 00:46:26,288
The key ingredient of this rolled omelette...

1039
00:46:26,289 --> 00:46:27,690
is mozzarella cheese.

1040
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:32,559
(The day is going as smooth as the beaten eggs.)

1041
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:35,098
(Having done this many times, )

1042
00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:37,030
(Je Hoon expertly checks on the thickness of the eggs.)

1043
00:46:37,369 --> 00:46:39,670
(Perfect!)

1044
00:46:39,769 --> 00:46:41,839
(The main chef is using the induction cooktop.)

1045
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,610
(Sniffling)

1046
00:46:44,039 --> 00:46:46,639
If only we had one more cooktop.

1047
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:48,710
Use this, Je Hoon.

1048
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,710
Can I? Okay.

1049
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:52,348
Well then.

1050
00:46:52,349 --> 00:46:54,519
(Let's roll the omelette.)

1051
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,889
(Flinch)

1052
00:46:57,250 --> 00:46:58,848
This is too much.

1053
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:01,860
(I'm not going to repeat any past mistake!)

1054
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:04,288
(He uses all his might...)

1055
00:47:04,289 --> 00:47:06,829
(to only pour a moderate amount of cooking oil on the pan.)

1056
00:47:07,059 --> 00:47:08,928
(The induction cooktop has strong firepower!)

1057
00:47:08,929 --> 00:47:10,170
Here I go.

1058
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:12,899
(Je Hoon pours the beaten eggs onto the hot pan.)

1059
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,399
Nice.

1060
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,639
(He now has to roll the eggs while cooking it slowly.)

1061
00:47:17,969 --> 00:47:20,440
(This is what I'm talking about!)

1062
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:21,939
Yes. Nice.

1063
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:24,678
It's going great.

1064
00:47:24,679 --> 00:47:25,880
(He's doing a great job with the rolled omelette.)

1065
00:47:27,449 --> 00:47:29,049
(Or so he thought.)

1066
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:30,888
(Pretty soon, his face fell.)

1067
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:32,888
There are so many...

1068
00:47:32,889 --> 00:47:34,090
vegetable pieces.

1069
00:47:36,059 --> 00:47:37,788
(There are too many...)

1070
00:47:37,789 --> 00:47:40,800
(for him to roll the beaten eggs.)

1071
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:45,070
(He was being greedy since they have an induction cooktop.)

1072
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:46,538
Wait, this is too...

1073
00:47:46,539 --> 00:47:47,699
The fire is too strong.

1074
00:47:49,539 --> 00:47:52,769
(The eldest brother is getting anxious.)

1075
00:47:53,809 --> 00:47:57,349
(Meanwhile, the napa cabbage steamed with wine is almost complete.)

1076
00:47:57,710 --> 00:47:59,719
(Boiling)

1077
00:48:00,949 --> 00:48:04,218
(Feeling anxious, )

1078
00:48:04,219 --> 00:48:07,590
(Je Hoon begins to move the spatula around.)

1079
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:18,299
(Flustered, anxious, nervous)

1080
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:20,239
You want the rolled omelette, right?

1081
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:22,039
I'll make you rolled omelette.

1082
00:48:23,809 --> 00:48:26,238
(Besides having too much vegetable, )

1083
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:29,610
(everything was perfect today.)

1084
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:33,320
(Sad)

1085
00:48:33,849 --> 00:48:35,779
It's all right. The eggs can end up steamed.

1086
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:37,149
Just don't hurt yourself.

1087
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:38,489
(It's all right. The eggs can end up steamed.)

1088
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:40,789
(Steamed eggs?)

1089
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,929
You guys want steamed eggs?

1090
00:48:44,489 --> 00:48:46,359
I quickly changed my dish.

1091
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:49,500
I should make you steamed eggs.

1092
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,070
- Sounds good. - Gosh.

1093
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,038
I'll make it for you.

1094
00:48:54,039 --> 00:48:55,170
(I have no choice but to make steamed eggs then.)

1095
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,309
Does the oven work?

1096
00:48:57,710 --> 00:49:00,179
(He suddenly walks over to the oven.)

1097
00:49:00,809 --> 00:49:02,010
It does.

1098
00:49:02,909 --> 00:49:06,349
(They're using all the modern equipment.)

1099
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:08,749
(He's giving emergency treatment to the broken rolled omelette.)

1100
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:11,920
(He moves the eggs into a glass bowl...)

1101
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:16,119
(and pours mozzarella cheese on top.)

1102
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:20,429
(Lastly, cover it with egg garnish.)

1103
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:21,960
Is the bottom layer...

1104
00:49:22,599 --> 00:49:24,329
eggs, then cheese, then eggs?

1105
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:25,929
Yes.

1106
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:27,570
You'll see later.

1107
00:49:28,539 --> 00:49:31,039
(He carries the bowl of eggs...)

1108
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,079
Is it not done yet?

1109
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,578
(to the oven, hoping to revive them!)

1110
00:49:35,579 --> 00:49:36,780
All right.

1111
00:49:37,449 --> 00:49:39,849
Please. Gosh.

1112
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:42,118
Please turn out good.

1113
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:44,989
(Je Hoon is so desperate.)

1114
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:46,759
Ta-da.

1115
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,159
(The younger brothers begin to set the table.)

1116
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:53,730
I'm feeling anxious.

1117
00:49:57,429 --> 00:49:59,169
(Step 1 of feeling anxious)

1118
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:01,869
(Pretending to be cool)

1119
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:03,669
There's a lot of wind coming out.

1120
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:05,808
(Step 2 of feeling anxious: Being suspicious of the oven)

1121
00:50:05,809 --> 00:50:07,738
Please.

1122
00:50:07,739 --> 00:50:09,979
(Step 3 of feeling anxious: Praying to the oven)

1123
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,479
(Finally, step 4 of feeling anxious)

1124
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:14,150
(Pressing on random buttons)

1125
00:50:15,219 --> 00:50:16,919
Je Hoon, should we start eating?

1126
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:17,920
(In a hurry)

1127
00:50:17,921 --> 00:50:18,988
On my way.

1128
00:50:18,989 --> 00:50:20,519
Je Hoon, should we start eating?

1129
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:22,518
On my way.

1130
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:23,689
I'm done.

1131
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:26,030
(He's forced to open the oven.)

1132
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:28,399
(He can't relax until the end of the dinner.)

1133
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,868
All right.

1134
00:50:29,869 --> 00:50:31,499
Thank you so much.

1135
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:34,199
(We're curious to see the end results for many reasons.)

1136
00:50:34,539 --> 00:50:39,269
(Chef Kwak emptied out their fridge with his specialty, Napolitan.)

1137
00:50:39,909 --> 00:50:45,309
(Eun Woo's napa cabbage steamed with wine took 15 minutes to make.)

1138
00:50:45,449 --> 00:50:49,219
(And the eldest brother made an unidentified dish with eggs.)

1139
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,819
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

1140
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:54,019
(They're having dinner made in their first modern kitchen.)

1141
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:56,630
I love Napolitan. I can't believe I get to eat it here.

1142
00:50:57,530 --> 00:51:02,329
(They all take a bite of the Napolitan first.)

1143
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,739
- It's really good. - You really are a genius.

1144
00:51:14,139 --> 00:51:15,279
I'm not.

1145
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,480
(Dong Yeon is a genius!)

1146
00:51:16,809 --> 00:51:18,409
The Napolitan is really good.

1147
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:22,480
I would have needed sliced garlic if I made aglio e olio.

1148
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:26,320
Dong Yeon, you could definitely open a restaurant.

1149
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:28,260
You're great at making Korean and Western dishes.

1150
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,090
The noodles are perfect.

1151
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:31,929
Amazing.

1152
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:34,559
You said you liked your pasta al dente.

1153
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,929
- So I didn't boil them fully. - I see.

1154
00:51:37,570 --> 00:51:38,730
This is perfect.

1155
00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:42,800
(This is great.)

1156
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,069
It's really good.

1157
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:45,369
It's so good.

1158
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:48,408
(The official mom of the group did a perfect job with today's dish.)

1159
00:51:48,409 --> 00:51:49,578
It's great.

1160
00:51:49,579 --> 00:51:52,179
(The official mom of the group did a perfect job with today's dish.)

1161
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:59,689
(I'm going to make this when we get back to Korea.)

1162
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:00,789
It's so good.

1163
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:02,919
Eun Woo made this, right?

1164
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,289
(Eun Woo made this, right?)

1165
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:07,399
This is called napa cabbage...

1166
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,598
- Napa cabbage steamed with wine. - With wine.

1167
00:52:08,599 --> 00:52:09,760
- Steamed with wine. - Yes.

1168
00:52:09,869 --> 00:52:10,969
- Dong Hwi. - Yes?

1169
00:52:11,969 --> 00:52:13,670
I'm going to be honest, I don't like it.

1170
00:52:14,199 --> 00:52:15,399
It could have been better.

1171
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,809
(It could have been better.)

1172
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:19,980
Why? You didn't season it? Or...

1173
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:21,578
(Is something wrong?)

1174
00:52:21,579 --> 00:52:23,139
It's not like it's unpalatable,

1175
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:25,110
but...

1176
00:52:25,179 --> 00:52:26,849
it's not the kind of beef I cook with in Korea.

1177
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:30,589
In Korea, I use thinly sliced beef brisket.

1178
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:31,988
- I see. - But here,

1179
00:52:31,989 --> 00:52:33,388
I had to strip the beef with my hands.

1180
00:52:33,389 --> 00:52:34,760
(He's disappointed that the beef was thicker than those in Korea.)

1181
00:52:34,889 --> 00:52:37,690
I feel like I couldn't fully get rid of the beef smell.

1182
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:40,098
Pick up a piece of cabbage and beef...

1183
00:52:40,099 --> 00:52:43,098
- and dip them in the sauce. - Cabbage and beef.

1184
00:52:43,099 --> 00:52:44,468
- Is this the sauce? - Yes.

1185
00:52:44,469 --> 00:52:47,098
(Eun Woo was nervous so he improvised on a special sauce.)

1186
00:52:47,099 --> 00:52:51,110
(Earlier, while he was cooking)

1187
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:56,039
(Eun Woo tasted the finished napa cabbage steamed with wine.)

1188
00:52:57,750 --> 00:53:01,480
(Thinking)

1189
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,489
Something's wrong.

1190
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:08,488
The beef smell is still there. I should make a sauce.

1191
00:53:08,489 --> 00:53:09,659
(It needs to be paired with a sauce to hide the beef smell.)

1192
00:53:10,489 --> 00:53:12,360
How should I make the sauce?

1193
00:53:13,829 --> 00:53:16,968
(No need to worry. Just look it up!)

1194
00:53:16,969 --> 00:53:21,669
(Thankfully, he has access to the Internet.)

1195
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:25,869
(He starts making the special sauce.)

1196
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:29,038
(Using ketchup as the base, he adds...)

1197
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:31,609
(sugar...)

1198
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:34,780
(and chili powder.)

1199
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:37,750
(Mixing)

1200
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:42,389
It tastes like sweet chili sauce.

1201
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:47,659
(This is how Eun Woo created his handmade sweet chili sauce!)

1202
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:49,499
I'll try it.

1203
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:53,469
(Will his handmade sauce save the dish?)

1204
00:53:54,969 --> 00:53:59,809
(Dong Yeon dips the beef in the sauce and takes a huge bite.)

1205
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:05,979
(Will it be okay?)

1206
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:07,149
(Je Hoon bravely piles up the cabbage and the beef.)

1207
00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:08,518
I do this and...

1208
00:54:08,519 --> 00:54:09,820
(Je Hoon bravely piles up the cabbage and the beef.)

1209
00:54:12,519 --> 00:54:13,759
Hey.

1210
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,089
- This is so good. - It is?

1211
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:16,659
(Gosh, it's good!)

1212
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:19,428
(Taking another bite)

1213
00:54:19,429 --> 00:54:20,859
(Yum)

1214
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:22,328
(Eun Woo is relieved.)

1215
00:54:22,329 --> 00:54:23,500
It's so good.

1216
00:54:29,469 --> 00:54:31,409
What did you use to make this sauce?

1217
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:34,538
- Ketchup, chili powder, sugar. - Ketchup, chili powder, sugar.

1218
00:54:34,539 --> 00:54:35,578
(Mix ketchup, chili powder, sugar for this simple sweet chili sauce.)

1219
00:54:35,579 --> 00:54:36,848
This combination...

1220
00:54:36,849 --> 00:54:40,578
is sour and spicy.

1221
00:54:40,579 --> 00:54:41,920
- It's nice. - Right.

1222
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:44,189
I thought I'd be able to smell the wine,

1223
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:46,320
- I don't smell it, at all. - Really?

1224
00:54:47,019 --> 00:54:49,959
I didn't know you were this good at cooking.

1225
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,058
(Eun Woo saved his dish by improvising!)

1226
00:54:51,059 --> 00:54:52,158
It's so good.

1227
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:53,630
(Eun Woo saved his dish by improvising!)

1228
00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:57,869
(Chef Kwak and Chef Cha's dishes were perfect as always.)

1229
00:54:59,469 --> 00:55:00,699
Guys.

1230
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:03,340
Right.

1231
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:05,808
I'll try it first, Je Hoon.

1232
00:55:05,809 --> 00:55:07,238
(Chef Lee's unidentified egg dish!)

1233
00:55:07,239 --> 00:55:09,909
Dig into the bowl and take a huge bite.

1234
00:55:11,210 --> 00:55:12,649
It looks like an au gratin dish.

1235
00:55:12,650 --> 00:55:13,919
(The oven made the dish look high quality.)

1236
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,079
How many layers are there?

1237
00:55:17,019 --> 00:55:19,549
This one dish has...

1238
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:22,189
steamed eggs and a fried egg...

1239
00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:25,190
with mozzarella cheese in between.

1240
00:55:25,929 --> 00:55:26,959
(It was supposed to be rolled omelette, )

1241
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,229
(but it ended up being a cheesy au gratin?)

1242
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:29,828
Look at it stretching.

1243
00:55:29,829 --> 00:55:31,130
(Cheese gratin that was supposed to be rolled omelet)

1244
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:34,169
- Dip it in? - Yes, and take a lot.

1245
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:36,369
- Gosh, this is crazy. - What is this?

1246
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:44,449
(Savoring)

1247
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:50,019
What do you think?

1248
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,050
Gosh, this is...

1249
00:55:54,889 --> 00:55:56,058
It's to die for.

1250
00:55:56,059 --> 00:55:57,389
(Surprised)

1251
00:55:57,929 --> 00:55:59,089
(They expected it to be a mess, but it's actually good.)

1252
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:00,230
It's good.

1253
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:01,629
It sure is delicious.

1254
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:02,959
- Is it good? - Yes.

1255
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,098
It's mozzarella.

1256
00:56:04,099 --> 00:56:05,170
(He finally gets credit from the younger members.)

1257
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:06,529
It's good.

1258
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:08,199
(Chef Kwak agrees today.)

1259
00:56:09,369 --> 00:56:12,210
(Taking a big mouthful)

1260
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:13,340
It's so good.

1261
00:56:13,341 --> 00:56:14,840
Je Hoon is a master of egg dishes now.

1262
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:16,750
- Right. - A master of egg dishes.

1263
00:56:17,849 --> 00:56:19,510
(Slurping)

1264
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:24,049
(He's most satisfied of all.)

1265
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:25,519
The first day...

1266
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:32,960
- At first, it was... - Yes.

1267
00:56:33,059 --> 00:56:34,960
- rolled omelet. - Right.

1268
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:36,868
- Then, it was steamed eggs. - Right.

1269
00:56:36,869 --> 00:56:39,030
It ended up being a gratin dish.

1270
00:56:39,070 --> 00:56:40,199
That's right.

1271
00:56:40,739 --> 00:56:41,840
Right.

1272
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:44,539
I'm embarrassed to say this, but...

1273
00:56:44,639 --> 00:56:49,639
(Before their journey, he didn't know how to cook at all.)

1274
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:53,949
(He presented the younger members a nightmare with his first dish.)

1275
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:58,488
(But he referred to the advice he got...)

1276
00:56:58,489 --> 00:57:01,889
(and had the compliments motivate him...)

1277
00:57:03,059 --> 00:57:07,730
(to improve this much.)

1278
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,429
I enjoyed it so much.

1279
00:57:10,429 --> 00:57:12,529
Today, I kind of felt like...

1280
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:13,570
Like what?

1281
00:57:14,039 --> 00:57:17,170
- We were given everything, - Right.

1282
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:19,809
Which left us with nothing to blame.

1283
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:20,980
Oh, right.

1284
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:26,280
(The perfectly equipped kitchen made it solely about skills.)

1285
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:29,218
We had to cook with a wood fire all anxiously because we couldn't...

1286
00:57:29,219 --> 00:57:31,050
- adjust the heat. - Right.

1287
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:34,459
But it sure was thrilling when we completed cooking...

1288
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:36,058
through all that trouble.

1289
00:57:36,059 --> 00:57:37,389
- Right. - Yes.

1290
00:57:37,559 --> 00:57:39,530
It was pretty burdensome to cook...

1291
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:42,598
in this neatly provided environment.

1292
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:43,869
Right.

1293
00:57:43,969 --> 00:57:46,230
It's incredible.

1294
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:48,369
- Seriously... - Gosh.

1295
00:57:48,469 --> 00:57:50,639
I don't know why,

1296
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:53,779
but when I cook at home, I often wash my hands.

1297
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:55,578
- That's my style. - I see.

1298
00:57:55,579 --> 00:57:57,210
So, it was troublesome to cook outdoors.

1299
00:57:57,309 --> 00:57:59,710
But here, there's a sink right nearby.

1300
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,549
I can easily wash my hands.

1301
00:58:01,550 --> 00:58:02,920
Right.

1302
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:05,989
This is worth a Nobel Prize.

1303
00:58:06,989 --> 00:58:08,789
Which category?

1304
00:58:09,489 --> 00:58:11,129
A Nobel Peace Prize.

1305
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:12,229
I hardly lose my temper.

1306
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:13,459
(The Renters present the inventor of faucet a Nobel Peace Prize.)

1307
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:15,929
It feels like we traveled time to 100 years ago.

1308
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:19,300
Staying a few days...

1309
00:58:19,769 --> 00:58:22,299
at the houses of Aleksi, Oiva, and Juri...

1310
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:25,669
was a bit tough for me.

1311
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:26,808
- Me too. - I...

1312
00:58:26,809 --> 00:58:29,179
- It was tough, to be honest. - It was very tough.

1313
00:58:29,309 --> 00:58:31,709
But thanks to that trouble,

1314
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:34,549
we've come to appreciate...

1315
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:35,848
- trivial things. - Right.

1316
00:58:35,849 --> 00:58:37,488
- I agree. - One needs experience to know.

1317
00:58:37,489 --> 00:58:40,050
Right, you're right about it.

1318
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:43,659
But after some time once we return to Korea,

1319
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:46,189
we might miss the former houses more.

1320
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:47,499
(They might miss the houses in the countryside more.)

1321
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:49,329
- Right. - You're right.

1322
00:58:51,929 --> 00:58:56,768
(They already miss the midnight sun.)

1323
00:58:56,769 --> 00:58:58,709
Here comes the beer.

1324
00:58:58,710 --> 00:59:00,169
- Thanks. - Thank you.

1325
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:01,380
(They gather around a bonfire for a beer party.)

1326
00:59:01,610 --> 00:59:03,109
- Why don't we have a toast? - Sure.

1327
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:04,179
- Cheers. - Sounds good.

1328
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:06,250
- Cheers. - Cheers.

1329
00:59:07,679 --> 00:59:09,879
- Cheers. - Cheers.

1330
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,919
(Refreshing night air and a warm bonfire)

1331
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,959
(They romantically end a day with a can of beer.)

1332
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,059
Gosh.

1333
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:16,960
Goodness.

1334
00:59:17,530 --> 00:59:20,428
It'd be perfect if we could see an aurora.

1335
00:59:20,429 --> 00:59:21,629
- I know. - An aurora.

1336
00:59:21,630 --> 00:59:26,099
It can be spotted when it's pitch dark.

1337
00:59:26,269 --> 00:59:28,170
But the daytime is too long.

1338
00:59:28,869 --> 00:59:31,110
- It's a shame. - It's a shame.

1339
00:59:31,239 --> 00:59:32,969
Speaking of which, I...

1340
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:35,579
It's nothing big,

1341
00:59:35,909 --> 00:59:37,609
- but I've prepared something. - What is it?

1342
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:40,719
(His hidden item is aurora fire powder.)

1343
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:42,449
It's aurora fire powder.

1344
00:59:43,519 --> 00:59:45,949
It's popular among those...

1345
00:59:46,219 --> 00:59:47,659
who enjoy camping.

1346
00:59:48,019 --> 00:59:49,618
I've never done this before.

1347
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:50,888
- You haven't? - No.

1348
00:59:50,889 --> 00:59:52,429
It's quite fascinating.

1349
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:55,029
All right, then.

1350
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:57,400
- Let's put it in as we make a wish. - Okay.

1351
01:00:05,110 --> 01:00:08,139
(When do we make a wish?)

1352
01:00:09,739 --> 01:00:11,909
Are you doing it alone?

1353
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:15,979
(It's the younger members' wish to know what his wish is.)

1354
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:18,090
Are you going to reveal it through narration later?

1355
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:21,359
- I'll do it now. - Okay.

1356
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:24,960
(Throwing in the powder with his secretive wish)

1357
01:00:26,059 --> 01:00:27,399
I don't see any difference.

1358
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:28,730
Let's go.

1359
01:00:31,869 --> 01:00:32,900
It's green. Gosh.

1360
01:00:33,429 --> 01:00:34,939
It shows totally different colors.

1361
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:36,070
Gosh.

1362
01:00:36,369 --> 01:00:39,468
- How pretty. - So, this is how it works.

1363
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:41,339
It's so fascinating. I've never thought...

1364
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:44,710
a fire could be this colorful.

1365
01:00:45,909 --> 01:00:48,820
Let's imagine that this fire is...

1366
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:52,219
unfolding in the sky.

1367
01:00:54,519 --> 01:00:57,230
Right. We can look at the fire once and then the sky.

1368
01:00:57,860 --> 01:00:59,429
At the fire and the sky.

1369
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:03,459
(A cost-effective version of aurora)

1370
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:07,500
Let's imagine that this fire is unfolding in the sky.

1371
01:01:07,769 --> 01:01:08,969
I love it.

1372
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:12,269
I'm reminded...

1373
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:16,539
of the sunset we saw at Aleksi's on our first day.

1374
01:01:16,610 --> 01:01:17,678
- Right. - It was beautiful.

1375
01:01:17,679 --> 01:01:19,280
It was legendary.

1376
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:20,449
- Gosh. - Right.

1377
01:01:21,150 --> 01:01:22,650
This is magnificent.

1378
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:25,888
It felt as if we were part of an art piece.

1379
01:01:25,889 --> 01:01:30,019
(On their first day from the city, they entered artwork called nature.)

1380
01:01:31,489 --> 01:01:37,069
(Quiet and peaceful moments)

1381
01:01:37,070 --> 01:01:41,739
(The felt a pleasant sense of difference for the first time.)

1382
01:01:42,369 --> 01:01:47,809
(They kept looking up at the sky.)

1383
01:01:48,610 --> 01:01:54,780
(The city boys naturally soaked into nature.)

1384
01:01:55,079 --> 01:01:57,519
It felt warm,

1385
01:01:57,989 --> 01:02:00,119
and I happened to stare at it.

1386
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:02,389
When I was...

1387
01:02:03,389 --> 01:02:05,928
in Korea, I didn't realize...

1388
01:02:05,929 --> 01:02:08,030
- how precious it was. - Right.

1389
01:02:08,829 --> 01:02:11,369
Romance and sentiments...

1390
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:14,939
are inversely proportional to convenience.

1391
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:16,000
Right.

1392
01:02:18,769 --> 01:02:21,980
We came to Finland to find such sentiments.

1393
01:02:22,579 --> 01:02:24,849
It was so fun.

1394
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:27,949
I'm sorry, but you're not going to the airport in a minute, are you?

1395
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:30,749
We have tomorrow to spend together.

1396
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:31,750
(It suddenly feels like they'll part ways.)

1397
01:02:31,751 --> 01:02:34,619
Staring at the aurora fire,

1398
01:02:34,989 --> 01:02:36,759
I happen to share my true feelings.

1399
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:37,959
You're not going to cry, are you?

1400
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:40,389
- We can continue until you cry, - I see.

1401
01:02:40,730 --> 01:02:42,499
Or could I go in and sleep first?

1402
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:45,199
(Let's go to bed and talk about it tomorrow.)

1403
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:51,610
(A special rented house awaits.)

1404
01:02:52,139 --> 01:02:57,349
(The new landlord is the best happy virus in the world.)

1405
01:02:57,650 --> 01:03:02,380
(Don't cry, and we'll meet tomorrow.)

1406
01:03:03,219 --> 01:03:04,448
Good work today.

1407
01:03:04,449 --> 01:03:05,848
- Good work. - Goodnight.

1408
01:03:05,849 --> 01:03:08,159
- Sweet dreams. - Goodnight.

1409
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:10,888
(Dong Hwi let Je Hoon sleep in the attic...)

1410
01:03:10,889 --> 01:03:12,929
(and chose to sleep in the living room.)

1411
01:03:13,789 --> 01:03:17,969
(Lying down on the soft sofa, )

1412
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:23,239
(he hurries to bed.)

1413
01:03:25,769 --> 01:03:28,578
(Eun Woo in the single room alone...)

1414
01:03:28,579 --> 01:03:31,409
(turns off the lights first.)

1415
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:35,650
(Looking around)

1416
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:41,518
(He can't find the switch that he unplugs the whole thing.)

1417
01:03:41,519 --> 01:03:44,559
(What a night in the unfamiliar civilization.)

1418
01:03:47,059 --> 01:03:51,170
(In the room next to the sauna where the lake sound is near, )

1419
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:56,069
(the sauna lover, Dong Yeon, )

1420
01:03:56,070 --> 01:04:00,440
(turns off the lights and gets ready to sleep.)

1421
01:04:01,809 --> 01:04:04,848
(Struggling with the unfamiliar lamp too)

1422
01:04:04,849 --> 01:04:07,320
(Why wouldn't it turn off?)

1423
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:13,219
(He even takes the light bulb off.)

1424
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:17,429
(Hold on.)

1425
01:04:18,159 --> 01:04:19,328
(It wouldn't go off.)

1426
01:04:19,329 --> 01:04:20,329
What...

1427
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:24,829
(This light bulb is more fascinating than the midnight sun.)

1428
01:04:24,869 --> 01:04:28,900
(What's going on?)

1429
01:04:29,639 --> 01:04:33,980
(It's awfully uncanny.)

1430
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:40,509
(This really is strange.)

1431
01:04:40,510 --> 01:04:45,320
(It's actually rechargeable, so the switch is on the bulb.)

1432
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:51,559
(He's completely forgotten about how the civilization works.)

1433
01:04:52,630 --> 01:04:58,300
(Exiling the strange bulb outside the doors)

1434
01:04:59,530 --> 01:05:02,940
(Just outside the doors isn't enough for him.)

1435
01:05:04,369 --> 01:05:08,138
(He tries to hide it behind the wall.)

1436
01:05:08,139 --> 01:05:12,579
(And he ends up leaving it somewhere in the bushes.)

1437
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:15,448
(Living in nature, he's become oblivious of modern civilization.)

1438
01:05:15,449 --> 01:05:16,820
Gosh.

1439
01:05:19,289 --> 01:05:23,158
(He finally lies down.)

1440
01:05:23,159 --> 01:05:26,489
(It's a mood lamp this time.)

1441
01:05:27,659 --> 01:05:31,000
(This one wouldn't turn off either.)

1442
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:35,368
(The lamps frighten him more than the midnight sun.)

1443
01:05:35,369 --> 01:05:37,940
(It's making him miss the days in the countryside.)

1444
01:05:38,010 --> 01:05:40,980
(At that time in the eldest member's room)

1445
01:05:44,250 --> 01:05:45,250
I know it's cruel,

1446
01:05:46,010 --> 01:05:47,110
but I need to kill you.

1447
01:05:48,019 --> 01:05:52,190
(He's after catching a fly instead of going to bed.)

1448
01:05:52,719 --> 01:05:53,719
Sorry.

1449
01:05:53,849 --> 01:05:54,860
There.

1450
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:57,629
(He's surprised at what he did himself.)

1451
01:05:57,630 --> 01:05:58,630
I'm sorry.

1452
01:05:59,489 --> 01:06:02,558
(The fly isn't dead.)

1453
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:07,440
(It flies away to his back.)

1454
01:06:12,139 --> 01:06:16,239
(The fly wouldn't yield despite the electric attack.)

1455
01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:24,719
(He keeps swinging, but it holds no threat.)

1456
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:26,549
Gosh, this one is fast.

1457
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:27,960
(Scratching)

1458
01:06:29,090 --> 01:06:34,000
(His eyes shake.)

1459
01:06:34,059 --> 01:06:38,130
(Now, he's swinging in the air with his knees down.)

1460
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:42,139
(Surprised)

1461
01:06:42,239 --> 01:06:48,380
(And his war against the fly lasted all night.)

1462
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:49,710
Gosh.

1463
01:06:50,179 --> 01:06:54,519
(The midnight sun goes to sleep.)

1464
01:07:01,219 --> 01:07:02,558
(The sun comes up...)

1465
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:06,590
(to give sunshine.)

1466
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:14,800
(The morning at the rented house is sunnier than ever.)

1467
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:18,069
(The sun is up and high.)

1468
01:07:18,070 --> 01:07:21,609
(Are they still asleep?)

1469
01:07:21,610 --> 01:07:23,639
(The current time is 7:10am.)

1470
01:07:30,179 --> 01:07:33,219
(Everyone's asleep in the quiet morning.)

1471
01:07:34,119 --> 01:07:37,558
(But Je Hoon is already awake, walking around in the kitchen.)

1472
01:07:37,559 --> 01:07:41,559
(He heads to the kitchen whenever he has time.)

1473
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:44,058
Gosh.

1474
01:07:44,059 --> 01:07:45,069
(He wants to make breakfast for the others.)

1475
01:07:45,070 --> 01:07:47,070
It's so tiring to wake up in the morning.

1476
01:07:48,769 --> 01:07:50,339
I need to cook for them.

1477
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:51,869
(He forced himself to wake up despite the fatigue.)

1478
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:55,078
(Fumbling)

1479
01:07:55,079 --> 01:07:56,079
I better have this...

1480
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:58,250
to relieve my fatigue.

1481
01:08:06,389 --> 01:08:08,058
(His eyes open wide.)

1482
01:08:08,059 --> 01:08:09,289
I'm feeling recharged.

1483
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:11,388
That feels good.

1484
01:08:11,389 --> 01:08:15,399
(He quickly gets ready to make breakfast.)

1485
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:17,670
(Plain bread, lingonberry jam from yesterday)

1486
01:08:18,930 --> 01:08:23,199
(He hums at the thought of cooking.)

1487
01:08:24,039 --> 01:08:25,769
Four loaves of bread.

1488
01:08:25,770 --> 01:08:26,809
(Today's breakfast is toast with lingonberry jam.)

1489
01:08:26,810 --> 01:08:27,880
Cranberry.

1490
01:08:29,539 --> 01:08:30,879
And...

1491
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,449
(Something's missing.)

1492
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:34,379
Eggs...

1493
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:36,449
(Shouldn't we have some eggs?)

1494
01:08:36,850 --> 01:08:38,188
I have to take all these out.

1495
01:08:38,189 --> 01:08:39,390
(He's all for eggs again today.)

1496
01:08:40,789 --> 01:08:45,130
(When he cooks, there's always an egg dish.)

1497
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:46,288
(Today's dish is...)

1498
01:08:46,289 --> 01:08:47,329
I will...

1499
01:08:47,659 --> 01:08:49,760
fry them golden brown.

1500
01:08:52,899 --> 01:08:56,800
(The noise wakes Dong Hwi up in the living room.)

1501
01:08:57,539 --> 01:08:58,809
(Is he already making breakfast?)

1502
01:08:58,810 --> 01:08:59,810
Je Hoon.

1503
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:01,609
You woke up?

1504
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:05,210
I tried to keep it quiet.

1505
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:07,648
Sleep some more.

1506
01:09:07,649 --> 01:09:08,680
I will...

1507
01:09:09,779 --> 01:09:10,890
cook some eggs for you.

1508
01:09:12,489 --> 01:09:14,020
Eggs again?

1509
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:16,289
It's fried eggs today.

1510
01:09:17,489 --> 01:09:19,188
I won't do anything more.

1511
01:09:19,189 --> 01:09:20,329
(Don't worry. I won't do anything weird.)

1512
01:09:22,899 --> 01:09:25,869
This makes it a series of 4, not 3.

1513
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:28,368
Thanks.

1514
01:09:28,369 --> 01:09:30,639
Don't mention it. Rest some more.

1515
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:32,939
(How will this series end?)

1516
01:09:33,109 --> 01:09:34,509
(Careful)

1517
01:09:34,510 --> 01:09:35,938
(Only a bit of salt)

1518
01:09:35,939 --> 01:09:37,380
Slightly.

1519
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,850
Look at this...

1520
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:43,250
beautifully sunny-side up.

1521
01:09:43,251 --> 01:09:44,819
(He can easily do this much alone now.)

1522
01:09:47,859 --> 01:09:49,818
(Carefully moving it to a plate)

1523
01:09:49,819 --> 01:09:51,930
So that the yolk won't pop...

1524
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:53,689
There.

1525
01:09:54,430 --> 01:09:55,459
How pretty.

1526
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:58,829
(A perfect sunny-side up is complete.)

1527
01:09:59,630 --> 01:10:00,630
Gosh.

1528
01:10:00,631 --> 01:10:01,640
(Feeling proud)

1529
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:03,398
(Preparing some butter in case they want some)

1530
01:10:03,399 --> 01:10:05,710
Enjoy it to your taste.

1531
01:10:06,369 --> 01:10:08,010
It's perfectly cooked.

1532
01:10:08,939 --> 01:10:11,779
(A generous amount of lingonberry jam)

1533
01:10:12,979 --> 01:10:14,379
This is perfect.

1534
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:15,549
It's incredible.

1535
01:10:15,550 --> 01:10:17,750
(Applying some jam on the freshly toasted bread)

1536
01:10:18,619 --> 01:10:20,618
Some tomatoes too.

1537
01:10:20,619 --> 01:10:23,520
(His breakfast-making skills have improved so much.)

1538
01:10:25,359 --> 01:10:27,389
It's good to have tomatoes in the morning.

1539
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:29,659
(He needs to do this 3 more times.)

1540
01:10:30,630 --> 01:10:31,929
All right.

1541
01:10:31,930 --> 01:10:32,930
(He has no time to rest. He moves on to the next one right away.)

1542
01:10:32,931 --> 01:10:34,738
The yolk shouldn't break.

1543
01:10:34,739 --> 01:10:35,739
(Shaking)

1544
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:37,439
(Going off)

1545
01:10:39,770 --> 01:10:41,680
Gosh, it slightly broke.

1546
01:10:43,210 --> 01:10:44,849
It's not easy.

1547
01:10:44,850 --> 01:10:46,310
(Help me.)

1548
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:50,819
(He doesn't want to serve it this way.)

1549
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:53,789
Should I...

1550
01:10:56,159 --> 01:10:57,630
roll it?

1551
01:10:59,029 --> 01:11:00,228
When you make rolled eggs...

1552
01:11:00,229 --> 01:11:03,429
(Just as Dong Yeon taught him, )

1553
01:11:03,430 --> 01:11:06,600
(he waits for it to be cooked.)

1554
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:08,470
All right.

1555
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:12,538
Let's try to make a mini rolled egg.

1556
01:11:12,539 --> 01:11:13,569
(Roll it when the bottom side is cooked.)

1557
01:11:13,739 --> 01:11:15,078
There it goes.

1558
01:11:15,079 --> 01:11:16,408
(Excited)

1559
01:11:16,409 --> 01:11:19,350
(Rolling)

1560
01:11:20,149 --> 01:11:24,250
(It's actually working.)

1561
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:28,389
It's small but cute.

1562
01:11:28,390 --> 01:11:30,260
(He's excited to use what he's learned.)

1563
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:35,560
(The mini rolled egg is complete.)

1564
01:11:35,829 --> 01:11:37,698
This is for me.

1565
01:11:37,699 --> 01:11:40,369
(He'll serve the pretty ones to the others and have it himself.)

1566
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:47,739
(Dong Yeon wakes up to hear the alarm.)

1567
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:54,920
(His bushy hair today is almost touching the ceiling.)

1568
01:11:56,779 --> 01:12:01,619
(What's the important item Dong Yeon takes with him every morning?)

1569
01:12:02,260 --> 01:12:07,159
(That all-round knife is like his other self.)

1570
01:12:08,899 --> 01:12:12,970
(He's ready to go to work.)

1571
01:12:20,970 --> 01:12:22,479
Good morning.

1572
01:12:22,909 --> 01:12:24,139
Good morning.

1573
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:25,180
(Good morning, Dong Yeon.)

1574
01:12:25,550 --> 01:12:27,010
Is Dong Hwi awake?

1575
01:12:27,649 --> 01:12:29,680
Dong Hwi is awake.

1576
01:12:30,649 --> 01:12:32,249
I think Eun Woo is asleep.

1577
01:12:32,250 --> 01:12:34,050
- Let me go wash my face. - Okay.

1578
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:36,118
I think Eun Woo is asleep.

1579
01:12:36,119 --> 01:12:38,859
(Eun Woo?)

1580
01:12:39,930 --> 01:12:43,600
(Rubbing)

1581
01:12:47,170 --> 01:12:49,969
(He wakes up to hear them...)

1582
01:12:49,970 --> 01:12:52,739
(say his name right in front of the door.)

1583
01:12:53,170 --> 01:12:55,639
Hi. Good morning.

1584
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:56,710
(Setting the breakfast in the terrace)

1585
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:58,679
Good morning.

1586
01:12:58,680 --> 01:12:59,949
(Is that for us?)

1587
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:01,420
It's not for you.

1588
01:13:02,220 --> 01:13:03,220
I'm sorry.

1589
01:13:03,850 --> 01:13:04,850
It's for the others.

1590
01:13:04,850 --> 01:13:05,850
(They've surrounded him so gently.)

1591
01:13:05,851 --> 01:13:06,989
I'll feed you later.

1592
01:13:09,659 --> 01:13:14,960
(Following)

1593
01:13:24,539 --> 01:13:25,640
Good morning again.

1594
01:13:28,739 --> 01:13:29,979
All right.

1595
01:13:30,210 --> 01:13:32,648
(Moving busily, )

1596
01:13:32,649 --> 01:13:34,049
(he's done preparing the breakfast.)

1597
01:13:34,050 --> 01:13:35,250
Okay.

1598
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:37,420
I just need them to come now.

1599
01:13:40,350 --> 01:13:41,590
This one is really pretty.

1600
01:13:41,659 --> 01:13:42,920
- Mine too. - Right?

1601
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:44,959
It's pretty and well-done, right?

1602
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:46,029
Yes, thank you.

1603
01:13:46,460 --> 01:13:49,528
I made it nicely with much care.

1604
01:13:49,529 --> 01:13:50,629
- Milk. - Thanks.

1605
01:13:50,630 --> 01:13:51,929
(It must've been hard to do this alone.)

1606
01:13:51,930 --> 01:13:54,839
Je Hoon, thank you for making breakfast for us.

1607
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:55,970
- Right. - My pleasure.

1608
01:13:57,739 --> 01:14:00,439
- Thank you for the food. - Enjoy.

1609
01:14:00,739 --> 01:14:02,478
(The fried egg looks beautifully cooked.)

1610
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:07,109
(Taking a big bite)

1611
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:11,589
You've really become the egg master.

1612
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:14,119
Yes, you've done everything you can with eggs.

1613
01:14:14,489 --> 01:14:16,359
- Your career has changed. - Seriously.

1614
01:14:17,390 --> 01:14:19,488
Gosh, the bread is golden brown and nicely toasted.

1615
01:14:19,489 --> 01:14:21,029
I tried really hard.

1616
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:22,959
I toasted them several times.

1617
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:23,960
(I put a lot of care into toasting them several times.)

1618
01:14:27,869 --> 01:14:30,099
Rather than the egg master, you're the jam master.

1619
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:31,409
Je Hoon, the jam is really...

1620
01:14:31,539 --> 01:14:33,068
You might go to Korea and start selling this.

1621
01:14:33,069 --> 01:14:35,938
- Lee Je Hoon Bakery. - I should go into baking.

1622
01:14:35,939 --> 01:14:38,850
I mean, you make it so well. Why would you...

1623
01:14:39,380 --> 01:14:40,750
buy it from the store?

1624
01:14:41,050 --> 01:14:43,049
But we don't have berries back there.

1625
01:14:43,050 --> 01:14:44,819
- Oh, you're right. - That's right.

1626
01:14:45,050 --> 01:14:48,359
In Finland, the fun is in picking the berries from the forest...

1627
01:14:49,060 --> 01:14:51,460
and making it for people.

1628
01:14:52,260 --> 01:14:53,429
That's correct.

1629
01:14:53,430 --> 01:14:55,659
The horses are quietly...

1630
01:14:56,899 --> 01:14:59,699
That brown one. That's the jerk who kidnapped me.

1631
01:15:00,470 --> 01:15:02,169
(Did you call me?)

1632
01:15:02,170 --> 01:15:03,269
It's coming now.

1633
01:15:03,270 --> 01:15:04,500
Ride it later.

1634
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:06,810
Yes, Dong Yeon.

1635
01:15:07,939 --> 01:15:09,340
But here,

1636
01:15:10,210 --> 01:15:13,350
- the animals are all so happy. - Right.

1637
01:15:13,710 --> 01:15:15,579
I think that means that country is happy.

1638
01:15:16,319 --> 01:15:18,319
- Right. - A country where animals are happy.

1639
01:15:19,090 --> 01:15:20,589
Whether they're street cats or whatever.

1640
01:15:20,590 --> 01:15:22,919
(A country where animals are happy too)

1641
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:24,090
How nice.

1642
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:26,189
My gosh.

1643
01:15:27,630 --> 01:15:30,960
(The smell of grass and water)

1644
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:33,130
- The air is so fresh. - Yes.

1645
01:15:33,369 --> 01:15:34,770
The time flew by.

1646
01:15:36,369 --> 01:15:38,339
(The view of the lake that spread out before them for every meal)

1647
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:39,539
Is it good?

1648
01:15:40,069 --> 01:15:43,639
What if there was a Korean house with a large lake in the backyard?

1649
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:45,778
(In no time, they've gotten used to...)

1650
01:15:45,779 --> 01:15:49,920
(eating as they're immersed in nature.)

1651
01:15:51,119 --> 01:15:53,448
(When they go back to the city and sit at the table, )

1652
01:15:53,449 --> 01:15:58,229
(they will miss this moment, right?)

1653
01:15:58,489 --> 01:16:00,559
I'm all packed now. I'm all ready.

1654
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:02,328
- You should get ready. I'll clean. - My gosh.

1655
01:16:02,329 --> 01:16:04,829
- Thank you, Je Hoon. - You can just leave it.

1656
01:16:04,970 --> 01:16:07,970
A little cloud in the sky

1657
01:16:08,670 --> 01:16:12,770
(Hwicasso sketches as he looks at something before they leave.)

1658
01:16:13,210 --> 01:16:16,539
(The landlord and the horses having an energetic morning)

1659
01:16:16,739 --> 01:16:22,419
(What will Dong Hwi's last memory look like as a picture?)

1660
01:16:22,420 --> 01:16:25,988
(I'm curious.)

1661
01:16:25,989 --> 01:16:27,149
Gift.

1662
01:16:28,590 --> 01:16:29,658
You...

1663
01:16:29,659 --> 01:16:31,288
(Hwicasso shyly hands them his gift.)

1664
01:16:31,289 --> 01:16:33,430
- Gosh, thank you. - Gosh, thank you.

1665
01:16:34,289 --> 01:16:35,800
Oh, my.

1666
01:16:36,199 --> 01:16:38,100
Hey, you drew them so well.

1667
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:39,930
Thank you. May I...

1668
01:16:40,670 --> 01:16:41,969
- hug you? - Yes.

1669
01:16:41,970 --> 01:16:43,738
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1670
01:16:43,739 --> 01:16:45,210
You are always welcome.

1671
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:49,139
(A hug as warm as the rented room was)

1672
01:16:49,140 --> 01:16:52,409
- Thank you so much. - Thank you.

1673
01:16:54,279 --> 01:16:56,520
- Thank you. - Thank you. So nice to meet you.

1674
01:16:57,550 --> 01:16:59,989
I will remember forever.

1675
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:03,318
I hope so. And you're always welcome.

1676
01:17:03,319 --> 01:17:05,390
- Thank you very much. - Thank you very much.

1677
01:17:06,130 --> 01:17:10,430
(Leaving their sadness behind, they leave for their final meeting.)

1678
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:12,669
(The greatest celebrity of Lapland!)

1679
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:15,970
(Who is the special landlord?)

1680
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:19,068
All right. Let's go.

1681
01:17:19,069 --> 01:17:21,140
(They head to where the person they must meet is waiting!)

1682
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:25,310
(Turning up the volume)

1683
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:29,619
(The final song choice: "Travel" by BOL4)

1684
01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:32,089
(All right, let's leave today)

1685
01:17:32,090 --> 01:17:33,420
We're leaving today.

1686
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:36,760
(We're really leaving.)

1687
01:17:37,289 --> 01:17:40,729
(They leave behind the daily life they've gotten used to.)

1688
01:17:41,289 --> 01:17:44,970
(As they go through the unpaved road that seems endless, )

1689
01:17:45,470 --> 01:17:47,898
(there's an open, straight road...)

1690
01:17:47,899 --> 01:17:50,899
(that spreads out in between the green forest.)

1691
01:17:53,170 --> 01:17:56,078
(The reindeer that they met on the road...)

1692
01:17:56,079 --> 01:17:59,949
(and the view of the vast lake)

1693
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:06,118
(They save everything from daily life...)

1694
01:18:06,119 --> 01:18:10,189
(that will become memories in their mind's eye.)

1695
01:18:11,590 --> 01:18:13,528
(But...)

1696
01:18:13,529 --> 01:18:17,858
(they've already been on the road for an hour.)

1697
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:20,930
(Where is the house of the most famous celebrity in Lapland?)

1698
01:18:23,939 --> 01:18:27,109
(Impressed)

1699
01:18:27,569 --> 01:18:28,978
Christmas in the summer.

1700
01:18:28,979 --> 01:18:30,709
(Christmas in the summer)

1701
01:18:30,710 --> 01:18:32,478
(Christmas in the summer?)

1702
01:18:32,479 --> 01:18:35,350
(They arrive at the mysterious final house.)

1703
01:18:35,819 --> 01:18:39,449
(Who is the landlord that's waiting for the Renters?)

1704
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:42,420
(Exclaiming)

1705
01:18:43,319 --> 01:18:44,589
This place is huge.

1706
01:18:44,590 --> 01:18:45,890
(The final rented room they will visit is...)

1707
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:47,528
Santa Claus Village.

1708
01:18:47,529 --> 01:18:49,829
(The official residence of Santa in Rovaniemi, Santa's House)

1709
01:18:50,229 --> 01:18:53,430
(Our landlord is...)

1710
01:18:53,970 --> 01:18:55,698
(the person who gets...)

1711
01:18:55,699 --> 01:18:59,170
(the most letters in the world)

1712
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:05,478
(Letters from all over the world)

1713
01:19:05,479 --> 01:19:07,948
(Hello, Santa Claus. I'm Chae Yoon.)

1714
01:19:07,949 --> 01:19:09,379
(I've decided not to receive a present this Christmas.)

1715
01:19:09,380 --> 01:19:10,778
(I think it would be too hard for you and your helpers.)

1716
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:13,519
(So lovely)

1717
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:15,488
(The person who spreads...)

1718
01:19:15,489 --> 01:19:21,259
(the most joy in the world)

1719
01:19:21,260 --> 01:19:23,299
(The man who leaves his house...)

1720
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:27,199
(for 1 day a year to go all over the world)

1721
01:19:27,699 --> 01:19:29,339
(The final rented room where the one and only landlord awaits)

1722
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:30,970
(Santa's House)

1723
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:34,039
(Welcome!)

1724
01:19:34,369 --> 01:19:36,578
Can we really meet Santa if we go inside?

1725
01:19:36,579 --> 01:19:37,840
(Excited to meet Santa at his home in person)

1726
01:19:38,810 --> 01:19:40,409
Santa Claus Village.

1727
01:19:40,779 --> 01:19:42,648
Hey, this must be the border.

1728
01:19:42,649 --> 01:19:43,749
(Santa's house is located in the North Pole border, latitude 66)

1729
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:47,988
I think it's really the North Pole if we go beyond this line.

1730
01:19:47,989 --> 01:19:50,318
But what if we freeze when we go past the line?

1731
01:19:50,319 --> 01:19:52,090
That's bad. Hang on. I'll try crossing over.

1732
01:19:54,630 --> 01:19:55,759
What?

1733
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:57,429
(They're going back to their childish selves...)

1734
01:19:57,430 --> 01:19:59,100
(at the thought of meeting Santa.)

1735
01:19:59,869 --> 01:20:01,839
Guys, this is the North Pole.

1736
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:03,100
(Unfrozen)

1737
01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:05,868
- It is pretty fascinating. - That border is fascinating.

1738
01:20:05,869 --> 01:20:07,969
But I thought the North Pole...

1739
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:09,938
would only be covered in ice.

1740
01:20:09,939 --> 01:20:11,340
But I guess this is the North Pole too.

1741
01:20:12,050 --> 01:20:13,909
It says, "Santa is here."

1742
01:20:14,409 --> 01:20:16,179
- "Santa is here?" - Oh, it does.

1743
01:20:16,180 --> 01:20:17,579
Santa must be in here.

1744
01:20:17,649 --> 01:20:19,419
Let's go and meet Santa.

1745
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:20,649
(They go into Santa's House where Santa lives.)

1746
01:20:21,859 --> 01:20:24,060
Gosh, there are so many presents.

1747
01:20:24,590 --> 01:20:25,829
It feels weird.

1748
01:20:26,489 --> 01:20:28,358
I feel like my heart is going back to my childhood.

1749
01:20:28,359 --> 01:20:29,600
(I feel like my heart is going back to my childhood.)

1750
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:31,528
(They're regaining their lost childhoods.)

1751
01:20:31,529 --> 01:20:32,728
I want a present.

1752
01:20:32,729 --> 01:20:34,029
(They're regaining their lost childhoods.)

1753
01:20:35,369 --> 01:20:37,038
Oh, my goodness.

1754
01:20:37,039 --> 01:20:38,739
(The house is full of presents.)

1755
01:20:39,439 --> 01:20:40,639
(To be loaded into section 15.3 of the sleigh)

1756
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:42,380
All of these presents will be...

1757
01:20:44,439 --> 01:20:45,809
They're so small and cute.

1758
01:20:45,810 --> 01:20:47,209
(You can get a glimpse of the landlord's taste.)

1759
01:20:47,210 --> 01:20:48,948
- So cute. - I know, right?

1760
01:20:48,949 --> 01:20:50,479
(Such cute miniatures)

1761
01:20:51,319 --> 01:20:53,649
There's a second floor. He lives in a multi-story house.

1762
01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:57,519
(The Renters are so innocent and pure.)

1763
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:59,659
(Next to them...)

1764
01:21:00,630 --> 01:21:02,059
No wonder he needs so many reindeer.

1765
01:21:02,060 --> 01:21:03,130
I know.

1766
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:04,799
You couldn't do this with just a couple of reindeer.

1767
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,800
(The homemaker worries about Santa's work conditions.)

1768
01:21:07,369 --> 01:21:08,670
Is anyone home?

1769
01:21:08,770 --> 01:21:09,970
Is he not here?

1770
01:21:10,270 --> 01:21:12,970
Santa. Can we meet him?

1771
01:21:13,439 --> 01:21:15,039
Santa Claus.

1772
01:21:16,539 --> 01:21:17,778
It's an elf.

1773
01:21:17,779 --> 01:21:19,078
Do we have everyone here?

1774
01:21:19,079 --> 01:21:20,148
- Yes. - Yes.

1775
01:21:20,149 --> 01:21:22,279
So, you guys are ready to finally meet Santa?

1776
01:21:24,020 --> 01:21:25,249
(Opening up Santa's living room)

1777
01:21:25,250 --> 01:21:26,250
Please come on in.

1778
01:21:27,289 --> 01:21:30,089
Gosh, I feel like I'm going in to a strange world.

1779
01:21:30,090 --> 01:21:31,289
On foot?

1780
01:21:33,789 --> 01:21:36,228
- Hello. - Hello.

1781
01:21:36,229 --> 01:21:39,199
(Their last landlord, Santa)

1782
01:21:39,329 --> 01:21:41,430
- Hello. - Come here.

1783
01:21:41,470 --> 01:21:43,170
- Hi. - Hi.

1784
01:21:43,770 --> 01:21:46,438
- You know how to speak Finnish. - Yes.

1785
01:21:46,439 --> 01:21:47,608
Please sit down here.

1786
01:21:47,609 --> 01:21:48,810
Oh, my goodness.

1787
01:21:48,979 --> 01:21:50,108
One is supposed to sit here.

1788
01:21:50,109 --> 01:21:51,579
- Big feet. - Yes.

1789
01:21:51,710 --> 01:21:52,850
Small shoes.

1790
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:56,149
(He's humorous.)

1791
01:21:56,220 --> 01:21:57,379
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

1792
01:21:57,380 --> 01:21:58,389
How are you today?

1793
01:21:58,390 --> 01:21:59,719
- Nice to meet you. - Good.

1794
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:01,419
(They say hello one by one.)

1795
01:22:01,420 --> 01:22:02,688
Nice to meet you.

1796
01:22:02,689 --> 01:22:04,188
Do you want to come here? You can sit down.

1797
01:22:04,189 --> 01:22:06,028
Here, and you can come close.

1798
01:22:06,029 --> 01:22:07,260
(I can't believe we're actually meeting Santa!)

1799
01:22:07,859 --> 01:22:10,559
(They feel like they've gone back to their childhood.)

1800
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,269
(Eyes shining)

1801
01:22:12,270 --> 01:22:13,698
You're coming from far away.

1802
01:22:13,699 --> 01:22:14,769
- Yes. - Right.

1803
01:22:14,770 --> 01:22:16,199
- South Korea. - Yes, I know.

1804
01:22:16,239 --> 01:22:18,199
What have you been doing here already?

1805
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:21,509
We enjoyed kind of like...

1806
01:22:21,510 --> 01:22:23,238
- nature. - Oh, okay.

1807
01:22:23,239 --> 01:22:25,509
Yes, we enjoyed that kind of peaceful...

1808
01:22:25,510 --> 01:22:27,049
- That vibe. - That's true.

1809
01:22:27,050 --> 01:22:30,179
Yes, we have some trees and some lakes here. That's true.

1810
01:22:30,180 --> 01:22:32,590
A lot of lakes and a lot of trees.

1811
01:22:33,220 --> 01:22:35,060
We have lots of space for people.

1812
01:22:37,020 --> 01:22:38,118
(Thinking)

1813
01:22:38,119 --> 01:22:40,560
(Dong Yeon seems to have something he wants to say.)

1814
01:22:41,130 --> 01:22:43,229
Actually, I haven't...

1815
01:22:43,859 --> 01:22:46,670
gotten any presents for years.

1816
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:48,698
- Really? - Why didn't you...

1817
01:22:48,699 --> 01:22:49,899
(Looking at him resentfully)

1818
01:22:50,140 --> 01:22:52,209
(Slightly flustered)

1819
01:22:52,210 --> 01:22:53,810
So, did you write me a letter?

1820
01:22:54,609 --> 01:22:55,839
Did you write me a letter?

1821
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:57,509
- No, I didn't. - That's why.

1822
01:22:57,510 --> 01:22:59,249
That might be the reason.

1823
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:02,380
(You didn't get presents because you lost your childhood.)

1824
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:04,519
(Dong Yeon, it was your fault.)

1825
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:06,789
Oh, we had to send him a postcard.

1826
01:23:06,819 --> 01:23:07,988
Let's try this year.

1827
01:23:07,989 --> 01:23:10,060
- It was my fault. Sorry. - Let's try this year.

1828
01:23:10,659 --> 01:23:12,328
(I have a question too.)

1829
01:23:12,329 --> 01:23:15,600
What do you usually eat?

1830
01:23:15,829 --> 01:23:17,599
- Everything. - Everything?

1831
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:20,898
But my favorite is salmon soup.

1832
01:23:20,899 --> 01:23:22,139
- Salmon soup? - Oh, salmon soup.

1833
01:23:22,140 --> 01:23:24,238
- We had that yesterday. - Have you eaten that here?

1834
01:23:24,239 --> 01:23:25,538
- Yes. - Yesterday.

1835
01:23:25,539 --> 01:23:26,840
That's my favorite.

1836
01:23:27,109 --> 01:23:29,380
Definitely, salmon soup is my favorite.

1837
01:23:29,439 --> 01:23:30,779
We have similar tastes.

1838
01:23:31,979 --> 01:23:33,979
When will he shave his beard?

1839
01:23:35,119 --> 01:23:36,180
Why should I?

1840
01:23:37,020 --> 01:23:38,220
He said, "Why should I?"

1841
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:40,318
Because I love this.

1842
01:23:40,319 --> 01:23:41,589
Your signature.

1843
01:23:41,590 --> 01:23:43,858
But, hey, tell me. I have one question for you.

1844
01:23:43,859 --> 01:23:45,129
All of you together.

1845
01:23:45,130 --> 01:23:46,890
- Listen carefully. - Okay.

1846
01:23:47,859 --> 01:23:50,460
(He has a question for us?)

1847
01:23:50,699 --> 01:23:53,569
Have you been very nice and good all the time?

1848
01:23:53,699 --> 01:23:55,939
Almost all the time.

1849
01:23:57,270 --> 01:24:00,569
(Thinking hard)

1850
01:24:00,670 --> 01:24:02,180
Almost, I think.

1851
01:24:02,479 --> 01:24:05,108
- Almost. - Almost, to be honest.

1852
01:24:05,109 --> 01:24:07,209
Nice. That's very good.

1853
01:24:07,210 --> 01:24:10,520
Because I think nobody can do that all the time.

1854
01:24:11,420 --> 01:24:14,948
But if you try your best, that brings me happiness too.

1855
01:24:14,949 --> 01:24:17,259
- Yes. - If you try your best,

1856
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:19,559
then that makes me and other people happy.

1857
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:20,728
Yes, right.

1858
01:24:20,729 --> 01:24:23,560
(Just as you can't always be kind, you can't always be happy either.)

1859
01:24:23,729 --> 01:24:27,898
(But moments of kindness build up and become happiness in daily life.)

1860
01:24:27,899 --> 01:24:31,909
I think it's all about if you're good to each other.

1861
01:24:32,039 --> 01:24:35,108
Because when you're good to each other,

1862
01:24:35,109 --> 01:24:39,310
that makes the other person happy, and it makes you happy.

1863
01:24:39,609 --> 01:24:41,919
So, helping other people,

1864
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:45,920
making everything easy for other people, and they're helping you.

1865
01:24:46,220 --> 01:24:48,989
I think that makes all of us happy.

1866
01:24:49,460 --> 01:24:52,890
And that would be so nice if everybody remembers that.

1867
01:24:53,390 --> 01:24:55,260
Yes, I'll remember that.

1868
01:24:55,399 --> 01:24:59,470
(The happiest country in the world, Finland)

1869
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:02,369
(And here, people showed them happiness.)

1870
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:05,438
To me, happiness is...

1871
01:25:05,439 --> 01:25:09,840
being able to live within...

1872
01:25:09,979 --> 01:25:14,109
quiet and beautiful nature.

1873
01:25:14,609 --> 01:25:16,679
(To Oiva, happiness is...)

1874
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:20,590
(a life within beautiful nature.)

1875
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:27,629
As we live in a small rural village in Lapland,

1876
01:25:27,630 --> 01:25:29,799
we become closer to our neighbors...

1877
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:33,600
and rely on each other a lot.

1878
01:25:33,670 --> 01:25:36,299
(Juri and Anne's happiness is...)

1879
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:42,140
(the bond with people.)

1880
01:25:42,380 --> 01:25:44,909
I would say happiness is security.

1881
01:25:45,180 --> 01:25:49,078
All people and all animals, they need to feel safe.

1882
01:25:49,079 --> 01:25:53,050
And they need to feel connected to each other.

1883
01:25:53,789 --> 01:25:56,358
(Katja's family's happiness is...)

1884
01:25:56,359 --> 01:26:00,260
(security in body and mind.)

1885
01:26:01,729 --> 01:26:03,228
(And last night...)

1886
01:26:03,229 --> 01:26:06,398
Since we got here, when I recall what we talked about...

1887
01:26:06,399 --> 01:26:11,039
with people we met here, even besides the landlords...

1888
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,810
I think it makes me think of how important it is...

1889
01:26:14,039 --> 01:26:16,310
what each person's...

1890
01:26:17,310 --> 01:26:19,709
first and foremost goal is in life.

1891
01:26:19,710 --> 01:26:21,779
First and foremost? What's a first and foremost goal?

1892
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:25,350
For example, some people want to earn lots of money.

1893
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:28,989
Among people with our job, some want to become very famous.

1894
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:32,528
Not just leading your life...

1895
01:26:32,529 --> 01:26:35,659
in terms of your career,

1896
01:26:36,399 --> 01:26:41,699
but living my life in the way I want to...

1897
01:26:41,970 --> 01:26:43,038
seemed very cool.

1898
01:26:43,039 --> 01:26:46,340
Remember the owner of the huskies?

1899
01:26:46,539 --> 01:26:48,270
She used to live in France,

1900
01:26:48,510 --> 01:26:51,038
but she just wanted to come and live in Lapland.

1901
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:52,149
Right.

1902
01:26:52,449 --> 01:26:54,049
Actually, that's a huge challenge.

1903
01:26:54,050 --> 01:26:56,078
- That's right. - But...

1904
01:26:56,079 --> 01:26:58,750
- She left what she was used to. - she made up her mind to come here,

1905
01:26:59,090 --> 01:27:03,959
and she kept building her own life here.

1906
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:06,228
(The courage to leave behind what you're used to...)

1907
01:27:06,229 --> 01:27:07,289
(and find your own way of life)

1908
01:27:10,029 --> 01:27:13,199
I wasn't able to ask for her name, so I'm not sure.

1909
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:14,669
You know the gas station employee?

1910
01:27:14,670 --> 01:27:16,039
- The one who helped us? - Yes.

1911
01:27:16,340 --> 01:27:19,170
I still remember what she told us.

1912
01:27:20,239 --> 01:27:21,269
(3 days ago)

1913
01:27:21,270 --> 01:27:23,510
(The local employee who helped the Renters fill up on gas)

1914
01:27:23,909 --> 01:27:26,278
(She had moved from...)

1915
01:27:26,279 --> 01:27:28,448
(near the big city of Helsinki to Lapland.)

1916
01:27:28,449 --> 01:27:29,779
When did you move here?

1917
01:27:31,050 --> 01:27:32,520
It was 13 years ago.

1918
01:27:33,119 --> 01:27:34,849
Do you feel more happy here?

1919
01:27:34,850 --> 01:27:37,589
Yes, I'm not in such a hurry here.

1920
01:27:37,590 --> 01:27:39,529
- Yes. - And it's safe here.

1921
01:27:39,789 --> 01:27:41,929
- Safe. Yes. - Yes, very safe.

1922
01:27:41,930 --> 01:27:43,460
- Very safe. - Yes, very safe.

1923
01:27:44,829 --> 01:27:47,769
What the gas station employee said, in a way,

1924
01:27:47,770 --> 01:27:49,739
is the most important thing in my life.

1925
01:27:50,699 --> 01:27:54,369
Safety. And not being in a rush.

1926
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:57,380
But being in a country...

1927
01:27:57,479 --> 01:27:59,850
where I'm the closest to that,

1928
01:27:59,979 --> 01:28:03,819
it makes me realize why the people here are truly happy.

1929
01:28:04,050 --> 01:28:06,189
It made me think of that a lot.

1930
01:28:07,220 --> 01:28:10,759
(The time they spent here made them think about...)

1931
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:14,329
(what's really important in their lives.)

1932
01:28:14,489 --> 01:28:17,828
(It could've been possible because they had free time...)

1933
01:28:17,829 --> 01:28:19,930
(in their lives in Lapland.)

1934
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:25,670
I'm sure everyone wants a life...

1935
01:28:26,739 --> 01:28:28,810
where they're not rushed.

1936
01:28:29,739 --> 01:28:33,448
But I don't know. Since I live such a busy life,

1937
01:28:33,449 --> 01:28:37,180
- Right. - I honestly can't really imagine...

1938
01:28:37,319 --> 01:28:38,850
not having to rush.

1939
01:28:39,890 --> 01:28:41,519
When we go back to Korea,

1940
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:43,159
- we'll be in a rush again, right? - We'll be in a rush again.

1941
01:28:46,229 --> 01:28:48,389
(The city boys who were...)

1942
01:28:48,390 --> 01:28:51,960
(busy running through each day)

1943
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:55,229
(They ended up in the deep countryside of Lapland.)

1944
01:28:55,939 --> 01:28:59,840
(No running water)

1945
01:28:59,970 --> 01:29:01,709
(Showering in the lake...)

1946
01:29:01,710 --> 01:29:05,140
(and bringing water in containers was a daily routine here.)

1947
01:29:05,810 --> 01:29:09,050
(They also drank water straight from the tanks.)

1948
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:14,649
(No electricity)

1949
01:29:15,420 --> 01:29:16,519
(In the dark room with no electricity, )

1950
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:18,760
(they always ran into things.)

1951
01:29:19,930 --> 01:29:21,630
Hey, my phone is not working at all.

1952
01:29:22,159 --> 01:29:26,699
(No cell service)

1953
01:29:27,399 --> 01:29:31,039
(Thanks to this, the city boys experienced a self-sufficient life.)

1954
01:29:33,039 --> 01:29:39,710
(When they willingly accepted these discomforts, )

1955
01:29:40,050 --> 01:29:43,049
(new things filled the empty spaces...)

1956
01:29:43,050 --> 01:29:47,789
(left by what they thought were obvious.)

1957
01:29:49,819 --> 01:29:53,529
(Relaxing moments without having to rush)

1958
01:29:53,789 --> 01:29:55,229
Oh, this is so nice.

1959
01:29:55,430 --> 01:29:58,499
(The speed of their daily lives...)

1960
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:03,899
(gradually slowed down according to the time of nature.)

1961
01:30:05,239 --> 01:30:09,439
(The freedom of living to my own rhythm)

1962
01:30:09,779 --> 01:30:12,149
And when I saw a boat,

1963
01:30:12,210 --> 01:30:13,578
I wanted to row it a bit.

1964
01:30:13,579 --> 01:30:16,649
(A life where I can live on my own time)

1965
01:30:16,779 --> 01:30:19,590
Living like this must have its perks.

1966
01:30:19,689 --> 01:30:20,689
Right.

1967
01:30:20,690 --> 01:30:25,629
(They found true freedom only after accepting the discomforts.)

1968
01:30:25,630 --> 01:30:27,359
This is so nice.

1969
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:34,699
(Laughter from being together)

1970
01:30:35,130 --> 01:30:36,398
Oh, no!

1971
01:30:36,399 --> 01:30:37,538
That's the end of the game.

1972
01:30:37,539 --> 01:30:39,469
An unexpected twist happened.

1973
01:30:39,470 --> 01:30:40,710
You're it, Eun Woo.

1974
01:30:41,170 --> 01:30:44,739
(They felt the joy of being together...)

1975
01:30:45,340 --> 01:30:49,250
(as they spent time in the same house.)

1976
01:30:49,979 --> 01:30:51,880
(And...)

1977
01:30:52,079 --> 01:30:54,589
(they met a new side of themselves...)

1978
01:30:54,590 --> 01:30:58,960
(as they left the environment they were used to.)

1979
01:30:59,090 --> 01:31:01,789
I think I should start a weekend garden or something.

1980
01:31:03,399 --> 01:31:04,560
My gosh.

1981
01:31:07,270 --> 01:31:09,769
Still, as we lived in rented rooms...

1982
01:31:09,770 --> 01:31:11,800
for just a short while in Finland,

1983
01:31:12,069 --> 01:31:13,669
we learned how to relax in life,

1984
01:31:13,670 --> 01:31:15,239
and we got to live here.

1985
01:31:16,539 --> 01:31:19,549
It was such a valuable and happy time.

1986
01:31:19,550 --> 01:31:22,619
(Isn't that what happiness is all about?)

1987
01:31:24,420 --> 01:31:28,319
(Soon, you will see a never-before-seen epilogue.)

1988
01:31:31,359 --> 01:31:34,229
(Je Hoon writes a postcard to send to Korea.)

1989
01:31:34,489 --> 01:31:38,560
(To Je Hoon, Are you doing well? No problems, I hope?)

1990
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:41,568
(It would be nice if every moment was full of good things, )

1991
01:31:41,569 --> 01:31:45,270
(but you know that you can't expect how life will go, right?)

1992
01:31:46,310 --> 01:31:49,238
(Still, let's live each day positively and happily. Let's go!)

1993
01:31:49,239 --> 01:31:52,609
(From myself)

1994
01:31:56,449 --> 01:31:58,420
Please deliver it safely.

1995
01:32:18,670 --> 01:32:20,438
(Lee Je Hoon)

1996
01:32:20,439 --> 01:32:22,139
(Lee Dong Hwi)

1997
01:32:22,140 --> 01:32:24,009
(Kwak Dong Yeon)

1998
01:32:24,010 --> 01:32:25,710
(Cha Eun Woo)

1999
01:32:25,810 --> 01:32:28,550
(Rented In Finland)
