1
00:00:05,286 --> 00:00:06,985
(Lee Je Hoon)

2
00:00:06,986 --> 00:00:08,715
(Lee Dong Hwi)

3
00:00:08,716 --> 00:00:10,625
(Kwak Dong Yeon)

4
00:00:10,626 --> 00:00:12,286
(Cha Eun Woo)

5
00:00:12,427 --> 00:00:14,956
(Rented in Finland)

6
00:00:14,997 --> 00:00:19,067
(The city boys move to their second rented room.)

7
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:22,297
(I hope we have electricity and running water.)

8
00:00:23,067 --> 00:00:27,176
(They cautiously hope for running water and electricity.)

9
00:00:27,177 --> 00:00:29,506
(What kind of place is their second rented room?)

10
00:00:30,946 --> 00:00:33,376
(They drive through dense trees...)

11
00:00:33,377 --> 00:00:37,417
(toward the second landlord.)

12
00:00:38,186 --> 00:00:39,186
Hello.

13
00:00:40,216 --> 00:00:42,755
(Oiva, )

14
00:00:42,756 --> 00:00:45,857
(the friendly landlord)

15
00:00:45,887 --> 00:00:49,155
(And his surprisingly big family)

16
00:00:49,156 --> 00:00:51,097
(So cute)

17
00:00:51,167 --> 00:00:53,936
(They think the kids are so cute.)

18
00:00:54,237 --> 00:00:55,896
(Hi.)

19
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:58,167
(High five)

20
00:00:58,336 --> 00:01:01,877
(She shyly greets them.)

21
00:01:02,677 --> 00:01:05,706
(These are my grandchildren.)

22
00:01:06,747 --> 00:01:11,747
(His daughter lives right next door.)

23
00:01:14,387 --> 00:01:18,287
(They are spending time together while the parents work.)

24
00:01:19,626 --> 00:01:23,096
(Welcome to our home.)

25
00:01:23,357 --> 00:01:25,367
(However...)

26
00:01:25,397 --> 00:01:27,065
(Looking around)

27
00:01:27,066 --> 00:01:29,537
(Where are we staying?)

28
00:01:30,736 --> 00:01:32,406
(It's 20km away.)

29
00:01:32,436 --> 00:01:34,507
(It isn't here?)

30
00:01:34,936 --> 00:01:39,176
(What is the rented room in a secluded area 20km like?)

31
00:01:39,406 --> 00:01:40,616
(Let's leave after saying goodbye to Marketa.)

32
00:01:40,617 --> 00:01:42,515
- I'm going with you. - Yes.

33
00:01:42,516 --> 00:01:43,947
- Wait a minute. - Okay.

34
00:01:45,447 --> 00:01:47,286
You can go in from this way too.

35
00:01:47,287 --> 00:01:48,486
Marketa.

36
00:01:50,186 --> 00:01:51,826
Pizza Margherita.

37
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:55,296
He's lost his mind.

38
00:01:55,527 --> 00:01:57,095
It can't happen to you too.

39
00:01:57,096 --> 00:01:58,336
You must hold onto your sanity.

40
00:01:58,766 --> 00:02:01,235
Marketa, we have to go now.

41
00:02:01,236 --> 00:02:02,766
(Marketa brings something out.)

42
00:02:03,037 --> 00:02:04,166
(Gasping)

43
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:05,666
Don't get too excited.

44
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,305
- I have a present for you. - It looks like a pie.

45
00:02:08,306 --> 00:02:10,136
- Gosh. - This pie...

46
00:02:10,137 --> 00:02:12,305
I made it for you.

47
00:02:12,306 --> 00:02:14,377
- Thank you. - You can take this with you.

48
00:02:14,917 --> 00:02:17,416
- Thank you so much. - Thank you. I appreciate it.

49
00:02:17,417 --> 00:02:18,546
(Touched)

50
00:02:18,687 --> 00:02:20,087
- What is it made of? - It's fresh.

51
00:02:20,257 --> 00:02:21,917
- Blackcurrant. - Blackcurrant.

52
00:02:22,317 --> 00:02:23,825
We have our own blackcurrants.

53
00:02:23,826 --> 00:02:25,556
- We have our own blackcurrants. - Gosh.

54
00:02:26,526 --> 00:02:30,526
(Made for the renters with hand-picked berries)

55
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,736
(A popular dessert during the summers in Finland)

56
00:02:34,037 --> 00:02:36,696
- She made us a blackcurrant pie. - Yes.

57
00:02:36,697 --> 00:02:37,966
- Looks so delicious. - It's for you.

58
00:02:37,967 --> 00:02:39,206
- It's beautiful. - Yes.

59
00:02:39,266 --> 00:02:42,377
- It's so beautiful. Thank you. - Thank you so much.

60
00:02:43,206 --> 00:02:45,046
- It looks tasty. - It looks amazing.

61
00:02:45,176 --> 00:02:46,846
On your way to your rented room,

62
00:02:46,847 --> 00:02:49,576
maybe you can visit Miki.

63
00:02:50,116 --> 00:02:51,187
"Miki?"

64
00:02:52,217 --> 00:02:53,347
Who is Miki?

65
00:02:53,687 --> 00:02:55,816
- Here's the same pie. - The same pie.

66
00:02:55,817 --> 00:02:58,386
Can you bring it to Miki?

67
00:02:58,387 --> 00:02:59,686
- Okay. - We can take it.

68
00:02:59,687 --> 00:03:02,256
- Okay. We can take it. - Of course.

69
00:03:02,257 --> 00:03:03,556
We can take it.

70
00:03:04,296 --> 00:03:05,466
- Thank you. See you. - Thank you.

71
00:03:05,467 --> 00:03:06,696
Thank you so much, Marketa.

72
00:03:06,697 --> 00:03:08,967
- Maybe after the weekend. - After the weekend?

73
00:03:09,496 --> 00:03:11,865
- Have a nice day. - He'll be right back today.

74
00:03:11,866 --> 00:03:12,906
(He leaves after throwing a dad joke.)

75
00:03:12,907 --> 00:03:13,936
- See you soon. - Thank you.

76
00:03:13,937 --> 00:03:15,775
- Thank you. Bye. - Thank you.

77
00:03:15,776 --> 00:03:17,823
(They leave for the rented room with the precious pie.)

78
00:03:17,847 --> 00:03:19,106
- Who is Miki? - Oiva.

79
00:03:19,107 --> 00:03:22,046
Actually, we don't know who Miki is.

80
00:03:22,616 --> 00:03:25,716
I have many rental cottages. And Miki...

81
00:03:25,717 --> 00:03:28,757
is sleeping in our rental cottage.

82
00:03:29,086 --> 00:03:32,025
Yes. We spent some time together.

83
00:03:32,026 --> 00:03:35,525
And he is like a member of our family.

84
00:03:35,526 --> 00:03:37,266
- Okay. - I see.

85
00:03:37,526 --> 00:03:38,865
- Look at the kids. - So cute.

86
00:03:38,866 --> 00:03:40,265
It's like a kindergarten here.

87
00:03:40,266 --> 00:03:41,437
They are so cute.

88
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:44,966
I have space for two.

89
00:03:44,967 --> 00:03:46,306
Two people? Okay.

90
00:03:47,107 --> 00:03:50,175
(A 40-year-old classic truck perfect for off-roading in the countryside)

91
00:03:50,176 --> 00:03:52,646
- If you want to sit with me... - Okay.

92
00:03:53,046 --> 00:03:54,476
So I can explain some things.

93
00:03:54,477 --> 00:03:55,615
- Okay. - All right.

94
00:03:55,616 --> 00:03:57,217
Okay, let's go. Hurry up.

95
00:03:57,847 --> 00:03:58,847
Hurry up.

96
00:03:59,847 --> 00:04:01,686
- Hurry up. - His Korean friend...

97
00:04:01,687 --> 00:04:02,687
He learned "hurry up."

98
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,025
(His Korean friend taught him many things.)

99
00:04:04,026 --> 00:04:05,426
- Really? - Let's see.

100
00:04:05,986 --> 00:04:08,197
- Should I drive? - No, I can drive.

101
00:04:08,426 --> 00:04:11,526
You can go with Oiva and talk to him.

102
00:04:11,697 --> 00:04:13,626
It would be better for you to go.

103
00:04:13,627 --> 00:04:15,136
- It'll be better for communication. - That's right.

104
00:04:15,137 --> 00:04:16,137
You have Eun Woo.

105
00:04:16,397 --> 00:04:18,566
- Eun Woo can go. - Do as you wish.

106
00:04:19,037 --> 00:04:21,337
(Hurry up.)

107
00:04:21,537 --> 00:04:23,276
I'll sit next to Oiva.

108
00:04:23,277 --> 00:04:24,375
Okay.

109
00:04:24,376 --> 00:04:25,736
(Eun Woo chooses to go with Oiva.)

110
00:04:28,517 --> 00:04:31,417
- Nice truck. - Yes.

111
00:04:31,686 --> 00:04:32,786
(A 10-minute ride to Miki's first)

112
00:04:32,787 --> 00:04:35,417
- Let's go. - Yes, sir.

113
00:04:36,486 --> 00:04:39,426
I was happy to have Wi-Fi for a minute there.

114
00:04:40,227 --> 00:04:41,256
Here we go again.

115
00:04:43,056 --> 00:04:46,366
(They leave civilization and head back to the wilderness.)

116
00:04:47,066 --> 00:04:49,235
It's nice that we can rent a car and drive around.

117
00:04:49,236 --> 00:04:50,735
(Something catches the eye of the man of nature.)

118
00:04:50,736 --> 00:04:52,305
You know what's interesting?

119
00:04:52,306 --> 00:04:53,306
What?

120
00:04:54,107 --> 00:04:55,577
The trees have changed.

121
00:04:56,506 --> 00:04:57,805
- What trees are these? - They are?

122
00:04:57,806 --> 00:04:58,876
The trees...

123
00:04:59,306 --> 00:05:02,777
near Aleksi's place were birch trees.

124
00:05:02,917 --> 00:05:04,586
But in this area,

125
00:05:04,587 --> 00:05:07,287
there are more of the trees the restaurant we got buds from.

126
00:05:08,287 --> 00:05:10,926
(These trees usually grow in alpine regions.)

127
00:05:11,857 --> 00:05:15,897
(This area is home to spruce trees also known as Christmas trees.)

128
00:05:15,926 --> 00:05:18,467
(Surprising observation)

129
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:21,037
You're like Talmud. Wait, Talmud was an entomologist.

130
00:05:21,967 --> 00:05:23,235
No, he wasn't.

131
00:05:23,236 --> 00:05:24,735
- That was Fabre. - Yes, Fabre.

132
00:05:24,736 --> 00:05:27,065
- Then what is Talmud? - It's a book of ancient teachings.

133
00:05:27,066 --> 00:05:28,383
(Talmud is a book of Jewish ancient teachings.)

134
00:05:28,407 --> 00:05:30,107
(Grunting)

135
00:05:30,506 --> 00:05:32,406
How could I get Talmud confused with Fabre?

136
00:05:32,407 --> 00:05:33,922
(After living in the countryside, he isn't in his right mind.)

137
00:05:33,946 --> 00:05:35,876
- The Talmud has many good sayings. - Right.

138
00:05:37,717 --> 00:05:41,156
I wonder what those two in front of us are talking about.

139
00:05:41,157 --> 00:05:42,157
Me too.

140
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,856
How do you feel here? Is it too silent?

141
00:05:45,857 --> 00:05:48,527
Yes, it's silent and peaceful.

142
00:05:49,357 --> 00:05:50,827
That's true.

143
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:52,996
I've been...

144
00:05:54,296 --> 00:05:56,266
to South Korea three times.

145
00:05:56,267 --> 00:05:57,936
Once I was in Seoul,

146
00:05:58,407 --> 00:06:00,536
then Busan,

147
00:06:00,537 --> 00:06:02,037
and then Jeju Island.

148
00:06:02,176 --> 00:06:03,777
- Really? - Where are you from?

149
00:06:04,006 --> 00:06:05,306
- Seoul. - Seoul.

150
00:06:05,847 --> 00:06:07,876
What did you do in Seoul?

151
00:06:09,116 --> 00:06:11,287
We had a project...

152
00:06:12,386 --> 00:06:15,017
where we had to benchmark a ceramics center.

153
00:06:15,616 --> 00:06:18,357
(Posio, Lapland is a world-renown city for ceramics.)

154
00:06:18,957 --> 00:06:21,425
(The unrefined colors of nature in Posio...)

155
00:06:21,426 --> 00:06:26,196
(inspire artists.)

156
00:06:26,727 --> 00:06:29,235
Many artists from other countries...

157
00:06:29,236 --> 00:06:31,235
stay here for a month.

158
00:06:31,236 --> 00:06:33,767
They experience our nature...

159
00:06:33,837 --> 00:06:36,436
and make something inspired by it.

160
00:06:37,246 --> 00:06:41,777
(The simple and rugged charm that reflects the nature of Posio)

161
00:06:42,517 --> 00:06:45,646
Here in Posio, we have Professor Suku Park.

162
00:06:45,647 --> 00:06:46,647
I see.

163
00:06:46,746 --> 00:06:49,787
He lives here with his family.

164
00:06:50,217 --> 00:06:52,555
- We were in Gimhae. - Gimhae?

165
00:06:52,556 --> 00:06:54,255
They wanted to see Santa.

166
00:06:54,256 --> 00:06:56,356
- Santa Claus? - I was Santa.

167
00:06:56,357 --> 00:06:58,896
And then my wife made cakes.

168
00:06:58,897 --> 00:07:01,596
- Cakes. - And then we were on TV there.

169
00:07:01,597 --> 00:07:03,467
- And then... - Really?

170
00:07:03,837 --> 00:07:04,865
Yes.

171
00:07:04,866 --> 00:07:05,966
(Endless repetition of "and then")

172
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,107
And then...

173
00:07:08,676 --> 00:07:09,836
(Even the polite reaction fairy...)

174
00:07:09,837 --> 00:07:10,907
I see.

175
00:07:12,077 --> 00:07:13,576
Nature,

176
00:07:13,577 --> 00:07:15,476
- parks, - Yes.

177
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:16,746
People...

178
00:07:17,316 --> 00:07:19,245
They want to see our lifestyle.

179
00:07:19,246 --> 00:07:21,456
- Yes. - They can get inspiration.

180
00:07:21,457 --> 00:07:23,485
In Finland,

181
00:07:23,486 --> 00:07:25,625
we have different colors and morals.

182
00:07:25,626 --> 00:07:26,703
(Was 10 minutes always this long?)

183
00:07:26,727 --> 00:07:28,896
We're heading to Miki's house, right?

184
00:07:28,897 --> 00:07:29,957
Yes.

185
00:07:30,827 --> 00:07:32,625
- That must be his house. - It looks nice.

186
00:07:32,626 --> 00:07:33,667
Goodness.

187
00:07:35,767 --> 00:07:37,635
But it's not our place, is it?

188
00:07:37,636 --> 00:07:39,166
- It's not. - No.

189
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,836
- We're here to deliver a pie. - Gosh.

190
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:44,146
Okay, I'll call Miki. Follow me.

191
00:07:44,147 --> 00:07:45,207
Miki.

192
00:07:46,207 --> 00:07:48,045
- This house... - Yes?

193
00:07:48,046 --> 00:07:50,815
Was built by Oiva himself in 1999.

194
00:07:50,816 --> 00:07:52,286
- In 1999? - Yes.

195
00:07:52,287 --> 00:07:53,956
(Mini Lapland Encyclopedia: Building a house...)

196
00:07:53,957 --> 00:07:55,555
(is a traditional custom and a bucket list in Lapland)

197
00:07:55,556 --> 00:07:57,386
To think he built this himself.

198
00:07:58,256 --> 00:08:01,397
(Who is Miki renting this house?)

199
00:08:02,457 --> 00:08:03,656
Hello, Miki.

200
00:08:03,657 --> 00:08:05,366
- Moi. - Hi.

201
00:08:06,126 --> 00:08:07,865
(What? She's Asian.)

202
00:08:07,866 --> 00:08:09,496
- Moi. - Moi.

203
00:08:09,837 --> 00:08:11,806
- Hi. - Hi.

204
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:16,636
(Miki was Korean?)

205
00:08:16,707 --> 00:08:19,445
- She's Korean. - Gosh.

206
00:08:19,446 --> 00:08:21,576
Can we go in? We have a surprise for you.

207
00:08:21,577 --> 00:08:23,076
Please come in.

208
00:08:23,077 --> 00:08:25,216
- Can we go in? - All right.

209
00:08:25,217 --> 00:08:26,945
- Thank you. - But how...

210
00:08:26,946 --> 00:08:29,486
I didn't think we'd meet a Korean here.

211
00:08:29,657 --> 00:08:31,255
Please excuse us.

212
00:08:31,256 --> 00:08:32,327
My gosh.

213
00:08:33,026 --> 00:08:35,097
- Goodness. - Nice.

214
00:08:35,496 --> 00:08:39,097
(Miki is actually renting this house owned by Oiva.)

215
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:46,937
(It's potter Miki's studio as well as living space.)

216
00:08:48,607 --> 00:08:52,376
(She's like a family member, renting the place for years.)

217
00:08:52,746 --> 00:08:54,375
We're just here to make a delivery.

218
00:08:54,376 --> 00:08:55,976
I see. Thank you.

219
00:08:55,977 --> 00:08:57,216
We were asked to give you this pie.

220
00:08:57,217 --> 00:08:59,846
How about some tea?

221
00:08:59,847 --> 00:09:01,586
- We'd love some. - Please.

222
00:09:01,587 --> 00:09:03,755
What brought you to such a faraway place from Korea?

223
00:09:03,756 --> 00:09:05,857
We want to ask you first.

224
00:09:06,386 --> 00:09:08,125
- Thank you. - Thank you.

225
00:09:08,126 --> 00:09:09,895
Miki. I need to take this call outside. Excuse me.

226
00:09:09,896 --> 00:09:11,226
I need to go out.

227
00:09:11,227 --> 00:09:13,067
- Sorry. - Okay. Don't worry.

228
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,466
- See you soon. - See you.

229
00:09:15,467 --> 00:09:17,265
(Oiva leaves for a while.)

230
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:18,966
- Thank you for the tea. - Thank you.

231
00:09:18,967 --> 00:09:20,405
- Thank you. - It's hot.

232
00:09:20,406 --> 00:09:21,976
- Drink it slowly. - I will.

233
00:09:21,977 --> 00:09:23,706
We were genuinely surprised.

234
00:09:23,707 --> 00:09:25,446
- Little did we imagine a Korean... - Right.

235
00:09:25,447 --> 00:09:27,177
- to be here. - Miki...

236
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:30,446
is the pen name I use as an artist here.

237
00:09:30,447 --> 00:09:32,216
- Are you an artist? - Yes.

238
00:09:32,217 --> 00:09:34,356
I work as a potter.

239
00:09:34,357 --> 00:09:37,587
How long have you rented this place?

240
00:09:38,026 --> 00:09:39,525
It's been 12 years.

241
00:09:39,526 --> 00:09:41,655
- In this house? - I started in this house.

242
00:09:41,656 --> 00:09:43,057
My work started here.

243
00:09:43,557 --> 00:09:46,466
- I had a chance to work... - Yes?

244
00:09:46,467 --> 00:09:50,596
As an intern at a pottery company in Posio for one year.

245
00:09:50,597 --> 00:09:52,606
During that one year,

246
00:09:52,607 --> 00:09:54,937
- I got to know Oiva in Posio. - I see.

247
00:09:55,577 --> 00:09:59,706
When I told Oiva I wanted to return to Posio to set up my studio,

248
00:09:59,707 --> 00:10:01,846
he helped me with the documents.

249
00:10:01,847 --> 00:10:03,976
- Right. - Such as the visa,

250
00:10:03,977 --> 00:10:06,016
- Gosh. - as I'm a foreigner.

251
00:10:06,347 --> 00:10:08,716
Oiva and his family...

252
00:10:08,717 --> 00:10:12,427
are like my family in Posio.

253
00:10:13,156 --> 00:10:16,097
- He's also my mentor. - Goodness.

254
00:10:16,526 --> 00:10:18,665
- I've been wondering. - Yes?

255
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:21,635
Even if you cook Korean food,

256
00:10:21,636 --> 00:10:23,066
there must be a limit.

257
00:10:23,067 --> 00:10:26,005
I've basically given up on making Korean food.

258
00:10:26,006 --> 00:10:27,676
I'm over that phase.

259
00:10:27,677 --> 00:10:31,106
Now, I'm grateful for what I can get here,

260
00:10:31,107 --> 00:10:33,076
like ingredients grown here. In the forest,

261
00:10:33,077 --> 00:10:35,115
there are berries, mushrooms,

262
00:10:35,116 --> 00:10:37,745
- Right. - reindeer meat, elk meat,

263
00:10:37,746 --> 00:10:39,885
and fish from the lake.

264
00:10:39,886 --> 00:10:42,286
- Salmon? - Yes, salmon too.

265
00:10:42,457 --> 00:10:44,856
Do you like gochujang?

266
00:10:44,857 --> 00:10:46,456
- I do. - Would you like some?

267
00:10:46,457 --> 00:10:48,596
- Do you have doenjang? - We do.

268
00:10:48,597 --> 00:10:50,427
- Would you like some? - Yes, please.

269
00:10:50,896 --> 00:10:52,625
I'm out of them.

270
00:10:52,626 --> 00:10:54,865
- I knew it. - Good job for bringing it up.

271
00:10:54,866 --> 00:10:56,196
Nice one.

272
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,566
Earlier, Oiva...

273
00:10:58,567 --> 00:11:00,665
invited us to go to a special cottage.

274
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,976
- Do you know where that place is? - I do.

275
00:11:02,977 --> 00:11:05,146
It's a house...

276
00:11:05,307 --> 00:11:07,846
- Oiva lends out only... - Yes?

277
00:11:07,847 --> 00:11:11,015
- to his closest people. - Oh, gosh.

278
00:11:11,016 --> 00:11:12,245
- Really? - Yes.

279
00:11:12,246 --> 00:11:15,156
And if you get there, you'll see it,

280
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:19,326
but the view of the lake is very beautiful.

281
00:11:19,327 --> 00:11:21,696
It's a joke among us.

282
00:11:21,697 --> 00:11:25,226
We say it's Oiva's private farm...

283
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:28,266
since you can catch many fish there.

284
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,535
If you plan on fishing,

285
00:11:31,536 --> 00:11:33,006
- Miki. - I'm sure...

286
00:11:35,107 --> 00:11:36,636
Hurry up and go.

287
00:11:36,807 --> 00:11:38,375
"Hurry up and go?" Okay.

288
00:11:38,376 --> 00:11:41,677
(This isn't the time to leisurely drink tea.)

289
00:11:44,616 --> 00:11:46,346
- Okay. Let's go. - Hurry.

290
00:11:46,347 --> 00:11:48,655
- Hurry. - Let's go to the special cottage.

291
00:11:48,656 --> 00:11:50,156
(Finally off to the special cottage)

292
00:11:51,087 --> 00:11:52,656
We'll get going.

293
00:11:53,156 --> 00:11:55,057
Bye. Okay.

294
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,025
- Thank you. - Bye.

295
00:12:00,026 --> 00:12:01,496
- Stay healthy. - Bye.

296
00:12:01,996 --> 00:12:04,836
(Meeting a senior renter was pleasant and amazing.)

297
00:12:04,837 --> 00:12:07,735
It's unbelievable how we met a Korean in Finland.

298
00:12:07,736 --> 00:12:08,906
- Gosh. - For real.

299
00:12:09,006 --> 00:12:10,947
She was such a nice person.

300
00:12:11,707 --> 00:12:13,177
Earlier,

301
00:12:14,577 --> 00:12:16,376
when I saw Miki's place,

302
00:12:19,286 --> 00:12:21,717
wanting to live here suddenly...

303
00:12:21,857 --> 00:12:23,687
- I see. - crossed my mind.

304
00:12:26,156 --> 00:12:29,426
- I'm all alone here. - Right.

305
00:12:29,427 --> 00:12:31,097
(I'm all alone here.)

306
00:12:32,567 --> 00:12:34,865
(A quiet place of my own away from the world's noise)

307
00:12:34,866 --> 00:12:38,066
Being able to use my time...

308
00:12:38,067 --> 00:12:41,676
entirely and solely on me is the best.

309
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:45,276
(The time I can focus exclusively on myself)

310
00:12:46,677 --> 00:12:49,515
("The forest is a treasure house...")

311
00:12:49,516 --> 00:12:53,116
("where I can discover amusing things.")

312
00:12:53,246 --> 00:12:54,856
I want to live such a life.

313
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,786
(I want to live such a life.)

314
00:12:58,687 --> 00:13:01,057
- Really? - Yes.

315
00:13:06,197 --> 00:13:07,936
You can't help but think like that...

316
00:13:07,937 --> 00:13:10,936
after meeting an incredible person...

317
00:13:10,937 --> 00:13:13,365
- living out their dream. - I agree.

318
00:13:13,366 --> 00:13:15,337
(Not fancy, but a life focusing on myself)

319
00:13:17,236 --> 00:13:19,746
I want to visit Lapland...

320
00:13:20,307 --> 00:13:21,577
in the winter.

321
00:13:21,776 --> 00:13:23,616
It heard it's beautiful in the winter.

322
00:13:24,146 --> 00:13:27,786
Imagine both sides covered in snow.

323
00:13:28,256 --> 00:13:29,556
That would be insane.

324
00:13:29,557 --> 00:13:31,326
Seriously insane.

325
00:13:31,327 --> 00:13:33,885
(A midsummer night's dream about the winter of Lapland)

326
00:13:33,886 --> 00:13:35,896
This is nice.

327
00:13:39,797 --> 00:13:41,197
They're talking non-stop.

328
00:13:43,597 --> 00:13:45,536
- He is barely facing forward. - Yes.

329
00:13:46,067 --> 00:13:48,635
- I think he's like Park Chan Ho. - Yes, I think so too.

330
00:13:48,636 --> 00:13:50,207
Oiva is like him.

331
00:13:50,776 --> 00:13:52,977
Now we are worried about nature.

332
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,346
We don't have enough of the natural forest left.

333
00:13:56,347 --> 00:13:57,645
(Finnish forest service news)

334
00:13:57,646 --> 00:14:01,186
We usually have 80 to 100cm of snow at the end of March.

335
00:14:01,187 --> 00:14:02,456
(Finnish forest service news)

336
00:14:02,457 --> 00:14:03,686
(Automatic response)

337
00:14:03,687 --> 00:14:07,696
There are around 3,400 accidents involving reindeer in Finland.

338
00:14:07,697 --> 00:14:10,697
(Moving onto Finnish traffic information)

339
00:14:11,496 --> 00:14:14,666
(How much do you know about Finland?)

340
00:14:16,567 --> 00:14:20,135
(Oiva's truck turns onto a forest trail.)

341
00:14:20,136 --> 00:14:22,876
- We must almost be there. - It seems like we're there.

342
00:14:25,047 --> 00:14:26,676
We have to wait.

343
00:14:26,677 --> 00:14:29,016
(They stop in front of a mysterious gate.)

344
00:14:30,317 --> 00:14:32,416
(Whistling)

345
00:14:33,286 --> 00:14:36,187
(As soon as he opens the gate...)

346
00:14:37,156 --> 00:14:38,957
I have absolutely no reception here.

347
00:14:39,486 --> 00:14:40,927
- Really? - Yes.

348
00:14:41,896 --> 00:14:42,896
(They get a bad feeling.)

349
00:14:42,897 --> 00:14:44,056
My gosh.

350
00:14:44,057 --> 00:14:46,165
(They have no reception at their second rented room.)

351
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:47,466
You're right. We have no reception.

352
00:14:47,467 --> 00:14:49,166
I think he will ask us here.

353
00:14:49,337 --> 00:14:51,366
"Would you like to go in? Yes or no?"

354
00:14:52,536 --> 00:14:54,505
Will you continue this challenge?

355
00:14:54,506 --> 00:14:55,736
(Yes)

356
00:14:56,177 --> 00:14:57,207
Let's go.

357
00:15:00,146 --> 00:15:01,316
Forest roads.

358
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:05,015
(A special adventure to a mysterious place)

359
00:15:05,016 --> 00:15:06,686
(He sees a lake outside the window.)

360
00:15:06,687 --> 00:15:09,156
Is this one your lake on the right?

361
00:15:09,756 --> 00:15:12,427
- No, we have 5km to go. - Really?

362
00:15:13,386 --> 00:15:14,457
It's pretty far.

363
00:15:14,626 --> 00:15:18,496
(Gate)

364
00:15:20,567 --> 00:15:24,097
(Their rented room is at the end of the dirt road.)

365
00:15:25,266 --> 00:15:28,937
(A dense forest of trees and swamps)

366
00:15:30,536 --> 00:15:35,547
(A cabin in the midst of Mother Nature)

367
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,885
The route is something totally unexpected.

368
00:15:40,886 --> 00:15:43,385
- Yes. - We're going far in.

369
00:15:43,386 --> 00:15:46,356
It's very far. I think it's been ten minutes.

370
00:15:46,357 --> 00:15:47,486
- Kwak Dong Yeon. - Yes?

371
00:15:47,756 --> 00:15:49,025
You've been abducted.

372
00:15:49,026 --> 00:15:51,526
(We've been abducted.)

373
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:53,265
This is unbelievable.

374
00:15:53,266 --> 00:15:54,296
(Their second rented room is further in the wilderness.)

375
00:15:54,297 --> 00:15:55,937
We're going this far into the wilderness?

376
00:15:57,837 --> 00:15:59,905
I still don't see a house.

377
00:15:59,906 --> 00:16:01,505
- I know. - What is going on?

378
00:16:01,506 --> 00:16:02,636
I don't even see it.

379
00:16:02,876 --> 00:16:04,136
You know what?

380
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:05,977
- The portable charger... - Yes.

381
00:16:06,447 --> 00:16:08,116
I brought from Korea died.

382
00:16:09,016 --> 00:16:10,876
So if I can't charge it,

383
00:16:11,587 --> 00:16:12,646
it's over.

384
00:16:14,717 --> 00:16:16,156
This is like "The Revenant."

385
00:16:16,786 --> 00:16:18,385
(The brake lights turn on and the truck finally slows down.)

386
00:16:18,386 --> 00:16:20,556
The forest is very wide and deep.

387
00:16:20,557 --> 00:16:23,395
(They must finally be there.)

388
00:16:23,396 --> 00:16:25,196
Are we driving further? He made another turn.

389
00:16:29,236 --> 00:16:32,165
(They come to another fork instead of the house.)

390
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:34,677
This is where my forest area starts.

391
00:16:36,006 --> 00:16:37,635
From here is your forest.

392
00:16:37,636 --> 00:16:39,107
Yes, this is mine.

393
00:16:39,547 --> 00:16:40,876
It's my kingdom here.

394
00:16:42,646 --> 00:16:43,817
Your kingdom.

395
00:16:44,616 --> 00:16:47,986
(They drive for a long time to rented room without an address.)

396
00:16:51,057 --> 00:16:52,456
(Oiva's private lake shows up in the distance.)

397
00:16:52,457 --> 00:16:54,727
There is a lake.

398
00:16:55,927 --> 00:16:59,125
I'm very curious about your lake.

399
00:16:59,126 --> 00:17:00,165
(This is Oiva's kingdom.)

400
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,366
- Deeper into the forest. - Yes.

401
00:17:02,766 --> 00:17:03,837
Deeper.

402
00:17:06,636 --> 00:17:09,336
(After 20 minutes on an unpaved road, they don't talk as much.)

403
00:17:09,337 --> 00:17:12,405
(But their concerns grow.)

404
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,475
We're in trouble.

405
00:17:13,476 --> 00:17:15,146
The sunset is in 1.5 hours.

406
00:17:17,047 --> 00:17:18,716
Is this right?

407
00:17:20,317 --> 00:17:21,487
We're here.

408
00:17:21,857 --> 00:17:23,137
- It's over there. - We're here.

409
00:17:25,126 --> 00:17:26,226
We get off here?

410
00:17:27,027 --> 00:17:28,726
- My gosh. - I don't see a house.

411
00:17:30,226 --> 00:17:32,196
We're really in trouble.

412
00:17:34,866 --> 00:17:37,097
I don't see a house.

413
00:17:37,837 --> 00:17:40,166
- Where is the house? - We aren't there yet.

414
00:17:40,636 --> 00:17:42,135
- Okay, let's go. - Let's go.

415
00:17:42,136 --> 00:17:43,237
Let me carry it.

416
00:17:43,676 --> 00:17:44,747
I can manage it.

417
00:17:45,277 --> 00:17:46,445
I hope we have running water.

418
00:17:46,446 --> 00:17:48,516
- I can carry that. - Okay.

419
00:17:48,517 --> 00:17:50,652
(Please let us have either running water or electricity.)

420
00:17:50,676 --> 00:17:52,247
He said there are two single rooms.

421
00:17:52,517 --> 00:17:54,286
- Single rooms. - Then...

422
00:17:54,287 --> 00:17:56,087
I hope there is a sink for cooking.

423
00:17:58,156 --> 00:17:59,263
- I see it. - Isn't that the house?

424
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:01,526
- Is that it? - It's the house.

425
00:18:01,527 --> 00:18:03,257
(They finally see the house.)

426
00:18:03,997 --> 00:18:07,366
(They finally see the house after walking for a while.)

427
00:18:09,436 --> 00:18:11,566
(A red cabin)

428
00:18:11,567 --> 00:18:12,737
Is that your house?

429
00:18:13,406 --> 00:18:15,537
It's nice and cute.

430
00:18:17,537 --> 00:18:18,606
Beautiful.

431
00:18:18,607 --> 00:18:19,975
(Isolated in Mother Nature)

432
00:18:19,976 --> 00:18:21,816
We are going to fish at the cottage.

433
00:18:21,817 --> 00:18:24,615
(A mysterious and rugged hidden paradise)

434
00:18:24,616 --> 00:18:25,787
Gosh.

435
00:18:28,017 --> 00:18:30,317
- This far away. - Wait.

436
00:18:31,116 --> 00:18:32,126
What's this?

437
00:18:32,857 --> 00:18:34,033
This can't be what I think it is.

438
00:18:34,057 --> 00:18:35,196
Is it a tent?

439
00:18:36,626 --> 00:18:40,267
(They get an uneasy feeling.)

440
00:18:40,366 --> 00:18:41,865
Two single rooms.

441
00:18:41,866 --> 00:18:44,426
(The house has two single rooms and a private lake you can use.)

442
00:18:44,466 --> 00:18:45,537
What's this?

443
00:18:46,206 --> 00:18:47,206
This...

444
00:18:47,207 --> 00:18:48,635
(This isn't the single room, is it?)

445
00:18:48,636 --> 00:18:52,077
I want to show you and explain a little bit.

446
00:18:52,176 --> 00:18:53,347
- Yes. - Okay.

447
00:18:53,747 --> 00:18:55,747
As you see, this is the fireplace.

448
00:18:56,946 --> 00:18:58,715
He left us some firewood.

449
00:18:58,716 --> 00:18:59,786
What's this?

450
00:18:59,787 --> 00:19:01,307
(An outdoor kitchen Oiva made himself)

451
00:19:01,757 --> 00:19:05,087
(On the other side of it...)

452
00:19:05,886 --> 00:19:08,026
(is the panorama of a lake that makes their hearts swell.)

453
00:19:08,027 --> 00:19:09,857
- This is amazing. - This is his?

454
00:19:11,196 --> 00:19:13,067
This is his private lake?

455
00:19:15,396 --> 00:19:18,066
This is Wara Lampi.

456
00:19:18,067 --> 00:19:20,165
- Wara Lampi. - Wara Lampi.

457
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,246
(Wara Lampi, the small lake on a hill in the forest)

458
00:19:23,136 --> 00:19:26,145
I heard there were many whitefish in this lake.

459
00:19:26,146 --> 00:19:27,646
- Really? - What is whitefish?

460
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,047
He told me.

461
00:19:30,476 --> 00:19:31,746
You didn't ask him?

462
00:19:31,747 --> 00:19:33,946
No, I didn't ask any questions.

463
00:19:36,557 --> 00:19:37,786
You just have to...

464
00:19:37,787 --> 00:19:38,857
listen to him.

465
00:19:39,057 --> 00:19:42,327
(Eun Woo learned how to handle Oiva.)

466
00:19:42,797 --> 00:19:44,767
The toilet is over there.

467
00:19:44,827 --> 00:19:46,096
- Toilet? - Yes.

468
00:19:46,097 --> 00:19:48,566
You have to use that small, brown-colored place.

469
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:49,872
(A small restroom away from the cabin)

470
00:19:49,896 --> 00:19:50,996
The restroom.

471
00:19:50,997 --> 00:19:52,437
(It looks familiar for some reason.)

472
00:19:52,607 --> 00:19:54,906
- Really? - Yes.

473
00:19:56,136 --> 00:20:01,007
(A squat toilet with sawdust to cover waste)

474
00:20:02,176 --> 00:20:03,317
Why are you afraid?

475
00:20:04,347 --> 00:20:05,347
(I'm used to it now.)

476
00:20:05,348 --> 00:20:07,047
- I know. - Let's go.

477
00:20:08,017 --> 00:20:09,685
His private lake is this big?

478
00:20:09,686 --> 00:20:11,486
(They quickly follow Oiva to the next place.)

479
00:20:12,287 --> 00:20:15,456
He made a wooden bridge here...

480
00:20:15,557 --> 00:20:16,625
so you can walk along it.

481
00:20:16,626 --> 00:20:18,866
(They walk along the wooden deck to the rented room.)

482
00:20:21,396 --> 00:20:23,665
The water is very clean.

483
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:24,766
It's really clean.

484
00:20:24,767 --> 00:20:26,566
You can drink it without any problems.

485
00:20:26,567 --> 00:20:29,127
(Untouched, the clear lake water can be used as drinking water.)

486
00:20:31,607 --> 00:20:33,376
- This is amazing. - It's 9pm.

487
00:20:36,747 --> 00:20:37,747
(The sunset on a beautiful gloomy day)

488
00:20:37,748 --> 00:20:38,886
It really is amazing.

489
00:20:42,156 --> 00:20:44,725
(He uses the last of his battery to take a photo.)

490
00:20:44,726 --> 00:20:45,956
Let's take a look inside.

491
00:20:45,987 --> 00:20:47,185
- Yes. - Okay.

492
00:20:47,186 --> 00:20:48,396
I'm curious to see it.

493
00:20:48,857 --> 00:20:52,666
Do you think there's somebody inside?

494
00:20:53,097 --> 00:20:56,166
(Is someone inside?)

495
00:20:56,267 --> 00:20:57,465
- No. - Maybe not.

496
00:20:57,466 --> 00:21:01,365
Because it's locked. This here means...

497
00:21:01,366 --> 00:21:02,475
there is nobody at home.

498
00:21:02,476 --> 00:21:04,846
- I see. - It also means it's locked.

499
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:05,875
(You just leave shovels or broomsticks on the door to lock up.)

500
00:21:05,876 --> 00:21:07,446
This is the lock?

501
00:21:08,446 --> 00:21:12,047
(It's difficult for robbers to find the place.)

502
00:21:12,247 --> 00:21:14,087
The most important is the sauna.

503
00:21:14,616 --> 00:21:16,256
This is a sauna.

504
00:21:16,257 --> 00:21:19,057
(Being Finnish, he shows them the sauna first.)

505
00:21:20,287 --> 00:21:22,155
Yes, this smell.

506
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:24,056
(There is a sauna even in this secluded place.)

507
00:21:24,057 --> 00:21:25,426
We take showers here.

508
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:29,665
After sauna, go to the lake, come back, have a cup of beer,

509
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:31,906
sauna, lake, back, and have two cups of beer.

510
00:21:34,067 --> 00:21:37,376
After six cups of beer, you are ready to sleep.

511
00:21:38,277 --> 00:21:40,077
Come into the cottage.

512
00:21:40,547 --> 00:21:41,945
- Cottage. - Is this the room?

513
00:21:41,946 --> 00:21:43,175
(Finally going into the most important room)

514
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:44,536
- Do we take our shoes off? - Yes.

515
00:21:46,946 --> 00:21:48,086
(They enter their second rented room.)

516
00:21:48,087 --> 00:21:49,257
It's cozy.

517
00:21:52,287 --> 00:21:59,327
(The small and cozy style of a European countryside cottage)

518
00:22:00,997 --> 00:22:05,406
(Sunlight pours in through the window during the day.)

519
00:22:06,206 --> 00:22:09,176
(Lamps are powered by batteries during the electricity-free night.)

520
00:22:09,976 --> 00:22:14,146
(Candles light up the room.)

521
00:22:15,116 --> 00:22:17,816
(It's as if time stood still...)

522
00:22:17,817 --> 00:22:22,186
(in this room filled with traces of the past.)

523
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:26,987
(Memories of Oiva's friends that visited)

524
00:22:27,357 --> 00:22:30,077
(The Korean friend that taught him how to say "Hurry up" in Korean.)

525
00:22:31,156 --> 00:22:39,007
(It will be filled with memories of the Renters.)

526
00:22:40,267 --> 00:22:41,337
It's very nice.

527
00:22:41,466 --> 00:22:45,375
(The tenants are in love with the cozy space.)

528
00:22:45,376 --> 00:22:46,446
It's cozy.

529
00:22:47,906 --> 00:22:48,916
It's a suite room.

530
00:22:49,247 --> 00:22:50,247
But...

531
00:22:50,547 --> 00:22:52,146
I can't help but count the beds.

532
00:22:52,517 --> 00:22:53,786
(No matter how close he looks...)

533
00:22:53,787 --> 00:22:55,987
(and counts over, )

534
00:22:56,116 --> 00:22:57,385
(there are only two beds.)

535
00:22:57,386 --> 00:22:58,556
Here is...

536
00:22:58,557 --> 00:23:00,086
(Next is the kitchen.)

537
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,527
(Walking in naturally)

538
00:23:02,797 --> 00:23:03,797
They have a stove.

539
00:23:04,357 --> 00:23:07,026
- Yes. - You just open from here.

540
00:23:07,027 --> 00:23:08,066
Okay.

541
00:23:08,067 --> 00:23:11,097
(It's similar to the stove they used at Aleksi's.)

542
00:23:11,936 --> 00:23:13,905
- There are cups here. - Okay.

543
00:23:13,906 --> 00:23:15,753
(The simple kitchenware that reminds them of their grandma)

544
00:23:15,777 --> 00:23:18,446
(It seems to have everything they need.)

545
00:23:20,747 --> 00:23:23,777
(But there is no faucet at the sink.)

546
00:23:25,716 --> 00:23:28,857
(This place has none of it as well.)

547
00:23:29,287 --> 00:23:31,316
I thought we'd have running water from the sink, but I was wrong.

548
00:23:31,317 --> 00:23:32,757
- We don't have running water. - No.

549
00:23:33,456 --> 00:23:34,526
(The only thing left is the single room.)

550
00:23:34,527 --> 00:23:36,125
Isn't it the green tent we saw earlier?

551
00:23:36,126 --> 00:23:39,125
The other room is over there. Outside.

552
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:41,027
Don't say that, please.

553
00:23:41,226 --> 00:23:42,266
Please.

554
00:23:42,267 --> 00:23:43,336
(Sorry.)

555
00:23:43,337 --> 00:23:44,466
Please, no.

556
00:23:44,597 --> 00:23:46,205
(Please tell me it's not true, Oiva.)

557
00:23:46,206 --> 00:23:47,266
Okay, but...

558
00:23:47,267 --> 00:23:49,236
Now, let's go out.

559
00:23:49,237 --> 00:23:50,777
(Hurry and follow me.)

560
00:23:51,777 --> 00:23:54,475
- The inside is really cozy. - It is cozy, indeed.

561
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:55,715
- It's cozy. I like it. - Right.

562
00:23:55,716 --> 00:23:57,176
I can sleep on the floor.

563
00:23:57,946 --> 00:23:59,747
I sleep on the floor back in Korea.

564
00:24:00,787 --> 00:24:02,556
Please don't tell me to sleep outside.

565
00:24:02,557 --> 00:24:04,787
(Please don't kick me out.)

566
00:24:04,956 --> 00:24:06,886
- Okay. Follow me. - Okay.

567
00:24:07,186 --> 00:24:08,356
He wants us to follow him.

568
00:24:08,357 --> 00:24:09,756
(While Oiva can't wait to show them the special room, )

569
00:24:09,757 --> 00:24:10,826
- My goodness. - Gosh.

570
00:24:10,827 --> 00:24:11,827
(the city boys are dragging their feet.)

571
00:24:11,828 --> 00:24:14,966
There's no space for everybody, so...

572
00:24:15,597 --> 00:24:17,895
- here's another room. - Is that a room?

573
00:24:17,896 --> 00:24:19,237
(This is the separate room.)

574
00:24:19,366 --> 00:24:20,435
Is that a room?

575
00:24:20,436 --> 00:24:21,935
(Their suspicion came out to be true.)

576
00:24:21,936 --> 00:24:23,236
No. That's not a room.

577
00:24:23,237 --> 00:24:24,276
(Denying reality)

578
00:24:24,277 --> 00:24:25,376
So...

579
00:24:26,206 --> 00:24:27,645
You must go in.

580
00:24:27,646 --> 00:24:29,416
(By the way, is the entrance on the bottom?)

581
00:24:29,976 --> 00:24:31,115
You sleep in the air.

582
00:24:31,116 --> 00:24:32,716
- You climb up a ladder. - Really?

583
00:24:33,616 --> 00:24:36,787
(It's known as a tree tent.)

584
00:24:38,426 --> 00:24:40,356
(If there are trees, )

585
00:24:40,357 --> 00:24:45,097
(you can have a room in nature wherever you are.)

586
00:24:47,366 --> 00:24:49,336
(It's a suite...)

587
00:24:49,337 --> 00:24:53,067
(where you can enjoy the night sky of Finland closer.)

588
00:24:54,107 --> 00:24:55,537
You sleep in the air.

589
00:24:57,307 --> 00:24:58,777
You sleep in the air.

590
00:24:59,607 --> 00:25:01,547
(Climbing up the ladder)

591
00:25:01,946 --> 00:25:03,016
Okay.

592
00:25:03,017 --> 00:25:04,716
(Entering)

593
00:25:05,686 --> 00:25:07,115
(Struggling)

594
00:25:07,116 --> 00:25:09,317
(Warning: It's hard to climb up.)

595
00:25:10,116 --> 00:25:13,886
(He barely goes up.)

596
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:16,695
- Guys. - Yes.

597
00:25:16,696 --> 00:25:18,126
It's wet up here.

598
00:25:18,666 --> 00:25:19,796
- Is it wet? - It's wet.

599
00:25:19,797 --> 00:25:20,896
It's wet and...

600
00:25:21,666 --> 00:25:23,767
- Let me see. - Is it totally damp?

601
00:25:25,507 --> 00:25:27,536
(But you get the lake view right in front of you.)

602
00:25:27,537 --> 00:25:29,337
- It's slightly wet. - Okay.

603
00:25:29,636 --> 00:25:31,747
And my body... Hold on.

604
00:25:34,347 --> 00:25:35,347
This is...

605
00:25:36,017 --> 00:25:38,716
It feels like I'll get scoliosis.

606
00:25:39,247 --> 00:25:41,987
(Living in this rented house won't be easy either.)

607
00:25:42,116 --> 00:25:44,357
There'll be no mice because you're hanging up here.

608
00:25:45,087 --> 00:25:46,225
Yes.

609
00:25:46,226 --> 00:25:49,156
(There will be no mice, but I might get a cramp.)

610
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:50,326
This is...

611
00:25:50,327 --> 00:25:53,125
I can really sleep on the floor.

612
00:25:53,126 --> 00:25:54,497
- Yes. - Me too. I'll just...

613
00:25:54,797 --> 00:25:57,436
Should we all cuddle to sleep since it's cold?

614
00:25:57,966 --> 00:25:59,006
Exactly.

615
00:25:59,007 --> 00:26:00,466
- Here? - No.

616
00:26:00,507 --> 00:26:01,806
- Dong Yeon. - Yes.

617
00:26:01,807 --> 00:26:03,107
We'll get you your stuff.

618
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,206
Why?

619
00:26:04,307 --> 00:26:06,276
- You look great in there. - You look good.

620
00:26:06,277 --> 00:26:07,675
What do you mean?

621
00:26:07,676 --> 00:26:09,115
- You're looking great. - It looks so pretty.

622
00:26:09,116 --> 00:26:10,776
You hate mosquitoes. It looks like a mosquito net.

623
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:12,317
You're the one who hates mosquitoes.

624
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:13,685
- Gosh. - Why did you go up there, then?

625
00:26:13,686 --> 00:26:15,456
I want to stop climbing up somewhere.

626
00:26:15,557 --> 00:26:17,517
Why did you go in there? You look so good in it.

627
00:26:18,926 --> 00:26:21,027
(Struggling)

628
00:26:21,327 --> 00:26:22,395
Gosh.

629
00:26:22,396 --> 00:26:23,725
(It'd be a big problem if you urgently need...)

630
00:26:23,726 --> 00:26:26,286
(to use the restroom at night because it's not easy to get out.)

631
00:26:26,567 --> 00:26:27,996
(Laughing)

632
00:26:27,997 --> 00:26:29,195
- He's laughing too. - Good.

633
00:26:29,196 --> 00:26:30,965
(He's laughing too.)

634
00:26:30,966 --> 00:26:33,206
Are the two of us sleeping here?

635
00:26:33,807 --> 00:26:35,506
- I know. - Really?

636
00:26:35,507 --> 00:26:36,537
(The endless hardship)

637
00:26:36,676 --> 00:26:38,445
(Tonight)

638
00:26:38,446 --> 00:26:40,347
Gosh. It's so cold.

639
00:26:41,547 --> 00:26:43,517
It feels like it'll collapse.

640
00:26:43,646 --> 00:26:45,916
Just call 911.

641
00:26:46,386 --> 00:26:48,556
- Gosh. - Gosh. It's cold.

642
00:26:48,557 --> 00:26:50,493
(Who will be the lucky ones to get the separate room?)

643
00:26:50,517 --> 00:26:51,756
(I hope you have a lovely night.)

644
00:26:51,757 --> 00:26:52,857
Okay.

645
00:26:53,956 --> 00:26:57,057
The main point is that we need to get fish.

646
00:26:57,297 --> 00:26:59,526
(Am I finally going to catch some fish?)

647
00:26:59,527 --> 00:27:02,766
I already put two lines of net here.

648
00:27:02,767 --> 00:27:05,366
- I see. - I can take those nets.

649
00:27:06,706 --> 00:27:07,965
- Nets? - I see.

650
00:27:07,966 --> 00:27:10,277
- Are we fishing today? - He threw the nets.

651
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:14,577
(Since life in Lapland is about self-sufficiency, )

652
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:18,017
(fishing is a part of Oiva's everyday life too.)

653
00:27:19,616 --> 00:27:22,115
(Aleksi uses a fishing rod...)

654
00:27:22,116 --> 00:27:24,357
(while Oiva uses a fishing net.)

655
00:27:24,857 --> 00:27:27,827
(I'll catch a lot and take them home again today.)

656
00:27:28,226 --> 00:27:30,726
Who wants to go fishing? Put your hands up.

657
00:27:31,327 --> 00:27:32,796
I'll go fishing.

658
00:27:32,797 --> 00:27:34,266
- Come with me. - Let's put an end to this.

659
00:27:34,267 --> 00:27:35,737
- Let's go. - Okay.

660
00:27:35,767 --> 00:27:37,597
We're Team Fishermen.

661
00:27:37,696 --> 00:27:41,705
We'll set up another tent for you two to sleep.

662
00:27:41,706 --> 00:27:43,576
- No. - So, enjoy fishing.

663
00:27:43,577 --> 00:27:45,405
What do you mean us two will sleep out here?

664
00:27:45,406 --> 00:27:46,546
So...

665
00:27:46,547 --> 00:27:48,777
Fishing comes with the tent.

666
00:27:49,277 --> 00:27:51,675
You build a place to live in yourself.

667
00:27:51,676 --> 00:27:54,685
That's the culture of Finland.

668
00:27:54,686 --> 00:27:56,986
- No. - You set it up yourself.

669
00:27:56,987 --> 00:27:58,955
And, you can sleep right in there.

670
00:27:58,956 --> 00:28:00,156
- Yes. - No.

671
00:28:00,726 --> 00:28:01,895
First, go ahead.

672
00:28:01,896 --> 00:28:03,996
Set up the tent comfortably on land.

673
00:28:03,997 --> 00:28:05,465
- Okay. - We'll set it up.

674
00:28:05,466 --> 00:28:06,696
Okay. Go ahead.

675
00:28:07,426 --> 00:28:09,097
The sun will set soon.

676
00:28:09,337 --> 00:28:10,436
Let's hurry.

677
00:28:10,737 --> 00:28:12,537
He wants to hurry because it'll get dark.

678
00:28:14,237 --> 00:28:15,276
Relax.

679
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:16,513
(They hop in the boat hurriedly as the landlord rushes them.)

680
00:28:16,537 --> 00:28:18,476
(Are you all on board?)

681
00:28:18,646 --> 00:28:19,946
Okay.

682
00:28:20,507 --> 00:28:21,607
And then...

683
00:28:22,317 --> 00:28:23,375
See you tomorrow.

684
00:28:23,376 --> 00:28:24,516
(See you tomorrow.)

685
00:28:24,517 --> 00:28:27,385
No.

686
00:28:27,386 --> 00:28:28,817
(No.)

687
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:32,926
(The dad joke never stops.)

688
00:28:33,956 --> 00:28:36,357
(Proud)

689
00:28:37,097 --> 00:28:39,396
- Okay. - I thought he was serious.

690
00:28:39,567 --> 00:28:40,826
Okay. Let's go.

691
00:28:40,827 --> 00:28:42,435
(Let's go to haul in the nets.)

692
00:28:42,436 --> 00:28:43,567
Gosh. Good.

693
00:28:44,636 --> 00:28:45,737
Everyone.

694
00:28:47,436 --> 00:28:48,905
It's 10pm.

695
00:28:48,906 --> 00:28:50,277
(But the time is...)

696
00:28:50,607 --> 00:28:52,047
It's 10pm.

697
00:28:52,547 --> 00:28:54,547
(Losing it)

698
00:28:54,847 --> 00:28:55,875
It's 10pm, but...

699
00:28:55,876 --> 00:28:58,216
(They just can't get used to the white night.)

700
00:28:59,047 --> 00:29:01,185
I feel like I'm dreaming right now.

701
00:29:01,186 --> 00:29:02,386
It doesn't make sense.

702
00:29:02,817 --> 00:29:05,685
It's a double attack of the jet lag and the white night.

703
00:29:05,686 --> 00:29:07,286
(A few days have passed, but the white night isn't easy.)

704
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:10,797
Dong Hwi, don't you feel sad for the actors in Finland?

705
00:29:11,126 --> 00:29:13,366
- Why? - They can do day shots until 10pm.

706
00:29:13,827 --> 00:29:15,066
They can't go home.

707
00:29:15,067 --> 00:29:16,612
(Just thinking about it makes the actor feel terrible.)

708
00:29:16,636 --> 00:29:18,636
The sun has to set for an actor to go home.

709
00:29:18,837 --> 00:29:19,936
I mean...

710
00:29:20,307 --> 00:29:21,606
It's 10pm, but it's still bright.

711
00:29:21,607 --> 00:29:24,007
(While worrying about when Finnish actors would go home...)

712
00:29:24,376 --> 00:29:25,705
Okay. Maybe...

713
00:29:25,706 --> 00:29:27,547
(Glancing)

714
00:29:28,007 --> 00:29:31,615
The net is set from here to the cottage.

715
00:29:31,616 --> 00:29:33,446
But there's only one net here.

716
00:29:35,787 --> 00:29:37,356
(Groaning)

717
00:29:37,357 --> 00:29:39,587
It was tilted quite a bit.

718
00:29:40,027 --> 00:29:41,787
- Okay. I got it. - Okay.

719
00:29:42,956 --> 00:29:46,666
(Oiva hauls in the net.)

720
00:29:46,896 --> 00:29:48,566
I'm the helmsman.

721
00:29:48,567 --> 00:29:50,636
(1-day Assistant 1: I'm the helmsman.)

722
00:29:51,237 --> 00:29:54,037
(1-day Assistant 2, Dong Hwi, holds the net.)

723
00:29:54,636 --> 00:29:57,436
You're right. You're doing a good job.

724
00:29:58,507 --> 00:30:00,276
Let's see.

725
00:30:00,277 --> 00:30:03,577
(How many did he catch?)

726
00:30:10,716 --> 00:30:13,857
(It's a fish!)

727
00:30:16,357 --> 00:30:18,226
It's bigger than what I caught.

728
00:30:20,366 --> 00:30:22,297
(Standing up automatically)

729
00:30:23,466 --> 00:30:24,896
(Actually, there's more than one!)

730
00:30:25,337 --> 00:30:26,607
Is it all right...

731
00:30:26,636 --> 00:30:30,337
Is it possible to scream here? Does it not matter?

732
00:30:30,476 --> 00:30:32,146
No, it doesn't.

733
00:30:32,577 --> 00:30:33,676
There are four.

734
00:30:34,307 --> 00:30:36,076
(Getting ready to scream with his abdomen)

735
00:30:36,077 --> 00:30:37,816
Je Hoon.

736
00:30:37,817 --> 00:30:39,317
(Je Hoon)

737
00:30:39,787 --> 00:30:41,386
Je Hoon.

738
00:30:42,456 --> 00:30:43,685
Did you catch it?

739
00:30:43,686 --> 00:30:45,186
(No way!)

740
00:30:45,686 --> 00:30:47,987
We caught a lot!

741
00:30:48,057 --> 00:30:49,557
He said they caught a lot.

742
00:30:49,656 --> 00:30:52,097
- Good job. - Good job.

743
00:30:52,527 --> 00:30:54,465
The boat is full with the fish.

744
00:30:54,466 --> 00:30:56,037
(We'll eat well here.)

745
00:30:56,436 --> 00:30:58,966
(I'll give some to Marketa.)

746
00:30:59,537 --> 00:31:01,136
There are so many.

747
00:31:02,176 --> 00:31:04,507
Is that a general amount?

748
00:31:04,936 --> 00:31:06,876
- Yes. - Gosh.

749
00:31:07,946 --> 00:31:10,017
- You can turn a little bit. - Yes.

750
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:12,287
- To where? To the right? - To there.

751
00:31:12,646 --> 00:31:14,116
Left.

752
00:31:14,847 --> 00:31:17,857
(The helmsman acknowledges to turn left.)

753
00:31:18,787 --> 00:31:20,885
(It's an amazing load of fish.)

754
00:31:20,886 --> 00:31:22,757
Gosh. It's crazy.

755
00:31:23,726 --> 00:31:25,327
Our stomachs will explode.

756
00:31:26,196 --> 00:31:28,096
He caught a lot, indeed.

757
00:31:28,097 --> 00:31:29,236
It never ends.

758
00:31:29,237 --> 00:31:31,096
(Rookie fisher Dong-Dong Bros have learned to fish with a net.)

759
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:32,206
Thank you.

760
00:31:33,307 --> 00:31:35,705
(Now, he rows it before anyone tells him to.)

761
00:31:35,706 --> 00:31:39,507
He's making sure the net doesn't get tangled up.

762
00:31:40,206 --> 00:31:42,445
Well done. Ten points.

763
00:31:42,446 --> 00:31:43,645
(Well done. 10 points.)

764
00:31:43,646 --> 00:31:44,846
Thank you, Teacher.

765
00:31:44,847 --> 00:31:46,716
(Thank you, Teacher.)

766
00:31:47,547 --> 00:31:49,915
- Have you pitched a tent before? - No.

767
00:31:49,916 --> 00:31:51,685
- I've never done it before. - Never?

768
00:31:51,686 --> 00:31:52,726
Have you?

769
00:31:52,787 --> 00:31:54,557
- I've done it once. - Once?

770
00:31:55,696 --> 00:31:56,796
Okay.

771
00:31:56,797 --> 00:31:58,327
(The 2 have set up a tent 1 time.)

772
00:31:58,696 --> 00:32:00,566
(This time, they have to set up a tent in the air.)

773
00:32:00,567 --> 00:32:01,625
- Je Hoon. - Yes.

774
00:32:01,626 --> 00:32:03,997
- How do I detangle this? - Why?

775
00:32:04,636 --> 00:32:05,806
This...

776
00:32:05,807 --> 00:32:08,436
(Wil they be able to set it up, let alone sleep in it?)

777
00:32:08,607 --> 00:32:10,106
How do I unbuckle it?

778
00:32:10,107 --> 00:32:11,577
(Let me see.)

779
00:32:12,507 --> 00:32:14,875
(Thinking)

780
00:32:14,876 --> 00:32:16,047
You should pull this.

781
00:32:17,047 --> 00:32:18,945
(Push the center...)

782
00:32:18,946 --> 00:32:21,116
(and pull it up.)

783
00:32:24,116 --> 00:32:25,287
I do it like this...

784
00:32:25,456 --> 00:32:26,936
- Yes. That's right. - Nice, Je Hoon.

785
00:32:27,857 --> 00:32:28,956
I do it like this...

786
00:32:29,226 --> 00:32:30,856
(The oldest with the youngest spirit has done it!)

787
00:32:30,857 --> 00:32:31,956
It's pulled.

788
00:32:32,997 --> 00:32:34,896
I think he put it in between there.

789
00:32:35,767 --> 00:32:40,007
(He remembers Oiva's instruction and does it confidently.)

790
00:32:40,666 --> 00:32:42,536
And you have to keep pulling it.

791
00:32:42,537 --> 00:32:43,806
(It's the first time for him to lead a task.)

792
00:32:43,807 --> 00:32:47,247
(After three days of country life, he found his specialty.)

793
00:32:47,777 --> 00:32:49,516
- That's right. - Okay.

794
00:32:49,517 --> 00:32:51,357
(Eun Woo gets a grip on it thanks to Je Hoon.)

795
00:32:51,646 --> 00:32:53,787
(Now, Eun Woo does it without hesitation too!)

796
00:32:54,517 --> 00:32:55,517
Okay.

797
00:32:57,416 --> 00:32:58,757
I'll put it up about here.

798
00:32:59,456 --> 00:33:00,527
Okay.

799
00:33:00,757 --> 00:33:02,797
(Je Hoon ties the loop tightly!)

800
00:33:03,297 --> 00:33:04,327
Okay.

801
00:33:05,027 --> 00:33:07,726
(They are in perfect sync before they know it.)

802
00:33:08,626 --> 00:33:12,097
(He does a great job in everything he does.)

803
00:33:12,936 --> 00:33:14,537
This part is pulled quite a bit.

804
00:33:14,837 --> 00:33:15,837
Yes.

805
00:33:16,807 --> 00:33:18,236
Since they caught lots of fish,

806
00:33:18,237 --> 00:33:20,546
let's set up the tent nicely...

807
00:33:20,547 --> 00:33:21,847
and let them sleep here.

808
00:33:22,646 --> 00:33:23,916
Good idea, Je Hoon.

809
00:33:24,116 --> 00:33:25,146
Gosh.

810
00:33:25,517 --> 00:33:28,146
I'll set up a nice tent so that they can sleep here.

811
00:33:28,287 --> 00:33:29,357
Of course.

812
00:33:31,817 --> 00:33:32,956
It has to go all the way.

813
00:33:33,186 --> 00:33:35,257
(We don't know who will spend the night...)

814
00:33:35,497 --> 00:33:37,027
(in the floating tent.)

815
00:33:38,226 --> 00:33:39,266
Let's go.

816
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:42,126
(But let's levitate it first.)

817
00:33:42,597 --> 00:33:44,195
- Gosh. - One more time.

818
00:33:44,196 --> 00:33:45,566
(Pulling it tightly while wishing it wouldn't be him sleeping here)

819
00:33:45,567 --> 00:33:47,107
- Gosh. - Gosh. It's done.

820
00:33:47,666 --> 00:33:48,737
So...

821
00:33:49,107 --> 00:33:50,806
You go in through here. Right.

822
00:33:50,807 --> 00:33:52,487
(The tree tent is successfully levitated.)

823
00:33:52,876 --> 00:33:55,547
Is it going to be all right? It is, right?

824
00:33:56,976 --> 00:34:00,116
I don't think one can go up there without support.

825
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:01,317
Is that a ladder?

826
00:34:01,616 --> 00:34:02,655
Is that a ladder?

827
00:34:02,656 --> 00:34:04,686
(They didn't hang the ladder.)

828
00:34:05,116 --> 00:34:06,756
Should we just put a big rock...

829
00:34:06,757 --> 00:34:08,386
- or a tree trunk? - Yes.

830
00:34:08,387 --> 00:34:09,455
(We just need to put a thing to step on.)

831
00:34:09,456 --> 00:34:11,426
Over there, there's a tree...

832
00:34:11,427 --> 00:34:13,026
- There's a tree trunk. - It's there.

833
00:34:13,027 --> 00:34:15,395
They can step on it to...

834
00:34:15,396 --> 00:34:17,566
- One, two. Done. - sleep in there.

835
00:34:17,567 --> 00:34:19,137
Dong Hwi. Okay.

836
00:34:21,536 --> 00:34:24,476
(Let's see.)

837
00:34:25,007 --> 00:34:27,047
What? There's a tree trunk.

838
00:34:27,846 --> 00:34:29,776
We can use this. It's perfect.

839
00:34:29,777 --> 00:34:31,352
(He finds a log that was used as a chair.)

840
00:34:31,376 --> 00:34:33,146
I'll borrow this for a while.

841
00:34:33,547 --> 00:34:34,617
Gosh.

842
00:34:36,016 --> 00:34:37,956
(Lifting)

843
00:34:38,157 --> 00:34:40,356
(After a few days in country, )

844
00:34:40,357 --> 00:34:42,527
(they've learned to utilize natural features.)

845
00:34:42,896 --> 00:34:44,125
- Je Hoon. - Yes.

846
00:34:44,126 --> 00:34:45,826
- This will do, right? - Good.

847
00:34:46,496 --> 00:34:50,967
(The loyal servant Cha brings the log.)

848
00:34:52,436 --> 00:34:54,535
Eun Woo, but is it possible to climb up there?

849
00:34:54,536 --> 00:34:56,677
(Spreading)

850
00:34:56,806 --> 00:34:58,806
(Surprised)

851
00:34:59,076 --> 00:35:00,177
Je Hoon, I'll go for it.

852
00:35:02,547 --> 00:35:05,146
- Hey. Gosh. - Je Hoon. It's not bad.

853
00:35:06,286 --> 00:35:08,246
- We did a good job. - Is it all right?

854
00:35:09,456 --> 00:35:11,555
- It's cozy in here. - It's cozy, right?

855
00:35:11,556 --> 00:35:12,686
(It's even cozy.)

856
00:35:15,157 --> 00:35:17,156
(They can make stable eye contact with the sky.)

857
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:19,197
Gosh. It's nice.

858
00:35:20,396 --> 00:35:23,096
- Okay. Good job. - You did a great job.

859
00:35:23,367 --> 00:35:25,096
They will love it.

860
00:35:25,197 --> 00:35:26,766
- We did a good job. - Yes.

861
00:35:26,806 --> 00:35:27,936
Hold on.

862
00:35:29,237 --> 00:35:30,935
- Thank you, Je Hoon. - Okay.

863
00:35:30,936 --> 00:35:32,907
(But it might be hard to get out by oneself.)

864
00:35:34,547 --> 00:35:36,145
- Okay. - Good.

865
00:35:36,146 --> 00:35:39,015
(They got a satisfying result for the experience they had.)

866
00:35:39,016 --> 00:35:40,786
- Good job. - Good. Okay.

867
00:35:41,686 --> 00:35:43,987
We just need to win the game now.

868
00:35:44,056 --> 00:35:45,516
Okay. Je Hoon.

869
00:35:46,126 --> 00:35:47,226
They're here.

870
00:35:47,387 --> 00:35:48,555
They are here.

871
00:35:48,556 --> 00:35:50,633
(Who will get a frosty sleep in this separate room in the air?)

872
00:35:50,657 --> 00:35:51,797
Gosh.

873
00:35:52,967 --> 00:35:54,626
- How could you catch so many? - Gosh.

874
00:35:55,467 --> 00:35:56,496
Goodness.

875
00:35:56,867 --> 00:35:59,205
In just one net,

876
00:35:59,206 --> 00:36:01,036
I think there's about 20 fish.

877
00:36:01,936 --> 00:36:02,975
So...

878
00:36:02,976 --> 00:36:04,906
(Now, it's time to get the fish out of the net.)

879
00:36:04,907 --> 00:36:07,576
First, you have to find its mouth.

880
00:36:08,107 --> 00:36:09,416
- Mouth? - Then...

881
00:36:10,277 --> 00:36:11,877
- That's how you take it out. - I can...

882
00:36:12,817 --> 00:36:14,086
(Staring)

883
00:36:14,087 --> 00:36:15,186
Let me try it.

884
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:17,257
- We should help him. - Yes.

885
00:36:17,786 --> 00:36:19,356
(Let's try it all together.)

886
00:36:19,357 --> 00:36:21,185
- Try it. - Can you touch a fish?

887
00:36:21,186 --> 00:36:22,286
I should.

888
00:36:22,596 --> 00:36:23,757
This is the least I can do.

889
00:36:23,896 --> 00:36:25,357
Like this, and then...

890
00:36:26,197 --> 00:36:27,867
- That's how it's done. - Like this.

891
00:36:27,927 --> 00:36:29,435
(It's interesting.)

892
00:36:29,436 --> 00:36:30,467
Yes.

893
00:36:30,737 --> 00:36:31,995
Push.

894
00:36:31,996 --> 00:36:33,107
Dush?

895
00:36:33,237 --> 00:36:34,237
Just a little bit.

896
00:36:35,306 --> 00:36:37,535
I see. You have to push it.

897
00:36:37,536 --> 00:36:40,507
(They are new to it, but they're learning it by watching.)

898
00:36:40,677 --> 00:36:42,745
Now, it's...

899
00:36:42,746 --> 00:36:45,447
(The man of nature has already mastered it.)

900
00:36:46,087 --> 00:36:47,246
The net...

901
00:36:49,556 --> 00:36:50,915
- We should help him. - Yes.

902
00:36:50,916 --> 00:36:52,456
(But this man is scared of fish.)

903
00:36:52,857 --> 00:36:53,886
(He rolls up his sleeves for now.)

904
00:36:53,887 --> 00:36:55,895
- Can you touch a fish? - I should.

905
00:36:55,896 --> 00:36:58,657
(He listens to the instructions for now.)

906
00:37:00,367 --> 00:37:03,536
(Groping)

907
00:37:06,666 --> 00:37:10,536
(Did he take out his phone?)

908
00:37:11,177 --> 00:37:15,177
(Recording how to prepare the fish so that they can refer to it later)

909
00:37:16,777 --> 00:37:22,087
(Oiva, Lapland's star instructor, gives a lecture.)

910
00:37:22,817 --> 00:37:28,326
(I'll try it tomorrow!)

911
00:37:28,657 --> 00:37:32,026
We have a lot of fish. I'll now collect these fish...

912
00:37:32,027 --> 00:37:33,967
and take them to my home.

913
00:37:34,067 --> 00:37:36,536
Okay. I'll teach you how to clean them.

914
00:37:36,967 --> 00:37:38,535
It's really easy.

915
00:37:38,536 --> 00:37:42,006
(Mr. Oiva prepares the fish to take home.)

916
00:37:42,007 --> 00:37:43,837
(We should watch it carefully too!)

917
00:37:44,007 --> 00:37:45,407
It's a white fish, so...

918
00:37:46,547 --> 00:37:47,906
(How to prepare Lapland's whitefish: 1. Scale it with a utility knife.)

919
00:37:47,907 --> 00:37:50,816
He removes the scales one by one.

920
00:37:50,817 --> 00:37:53,987
You do it like this first, and you open here.

921
00:37:54,786 --> 00:37:55,786
And then...

922
00:37:55,787 --> 00:37:56,986
(2. Cut the fish open.)

923
00:37:56,987 --> 00:37:58,086
He gets the guts...

924
00:37:58,087 --> 00:38:00,156
And I cut it from here.

925
00:38:00,157 --> 00:38:04,197
(3. Chop the head off and remove it with the guts.)

926
00:38:05,226 --> 00:38:06,995
(And then, wash it with clean water.)

927
00:38:06,996 --> 00:38:09,067
- One. - Gosh.

928
00:38:09,967 --> 00:38:12,967
(By the way, after watching for a while...)

929
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:14,967
Gosh. I'm hungry.

930
00:38:16,436 --> 00:38:18,036
Why am I hungry all of a sudden?

931
00:38:18,677 --> 00:38:20,076
It's about time we get hungry.

932
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,777
We can make the fire.

933
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:25,177
We can make the fire here, right?

934
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:29,117
It'll be great if we can get more barks.

935
00:38:29,317 --> 00:38:31,087
- Barks? - Tree barks?

936
00:38:31,456 --> 00:38:33,125
We should have some here.

937
00:38:33,126 --> 00:38:35,006
(Following Je Hoon's lead, they make kindling!)

938
00:38:35,186 --> 00:38:37,726
You can make fire now.

939
00:38:38,157 --> 00:38:41,067
- Okay. - And add more firewood.

940
00:38:44,596 --> 00:38:48,237
(They got better than the first day.)

941
00:38:48,337 --> 00:38:50,606
(Crowded)

942
00:38:50,607 --> 00:38:54,646
(Do they need four people to start a fire?)

943
00:38:55,677 --> 00:38:58,047
- We need more wood, right? - I think it's enough.

944
00:38:58,277 --> 00:38:59,587
I'm hungry.

945
00:39:00,016 --> 00:39:01,116
You're hungry.

946
00:39:01,117 --> 00:39:02,316
(You can eat with us.)

947
00:39:02,317 --> 00:39:04,317
He's been saying that he's hungry for a while now.

948
00:39:04,887 --> 00:39:08,956
(Actually, he started saying it before he checked the net.)

949
00:39:08,987 --> 00:39:10,356
(Current time: 10:30pm)

950
00:39:10,357 --> 00:39:13,666
(I should eat here before leaving.)

951
00:39:14,427 --> 00:39:16,766
- Okay. - Okay, Oiva.

952
00:39:17,036 --> 00:39:19,367
(Yes! We'll have fish for dinner.)

953
00:39:20,036 --> 00:39:21,966
(I'll cook them Finnish fish stew!)

954
00:39:21,967 --> 00:39:24,137
It's a traditional fish dish,

955
00:39:25,036 --> 00:39:27,107
kalapottu.

956
00:39:27,547 --> 00:39:30,646
And then, we add potatoes...

957
00:39:31,177 --> 00:39:32,846
- to make kalapottu. - I see.

958
00:39:33,516 --> 00:39:37,087
(Is it a stew or a grilled dish?)

959
00:39:37,157 --> 00:39:40,886
It's the dinner I want to make.

960
00:39:40,887 --> 00:39:41,956
Okay.

961
00:39:43,096 --> 00:39:44,426
Why do I want to try it?

962
00:39:44,427 --> 00:39:45,657
- Look at this. - Yes.

963
00:39:45,757 --> 00:39:47,326
Now, it's clean.

964
00:39:47,567 --> 00:39:48,996
- Clean. - Clean.

965
00:39:50,297 --> 00:39:52,966
And, I cut it into pieces this big.

966
00:39:52,967 --> 00:39:54,705
- I see. - One, two...

967
00:39:54,706 --> 00:39:55,836
(Cutting the cleaned fish into 3 pieces)

968
00:39:55,837 --> 00:39:56,876
three.

969
00:39:57,237 --> 00:39:58,306
Three pieces.

970
00:39:58,907 --> 00:40:01,546
And then, I put them here.

971
00:40:01,547 --> 00:40:03,387
(He's right next to Oiva before they know it.)

972
00:40:04,846 --> 00:40:05,887
Gosh.

973
00:40:06,146 --> 00:40:07,816
- Can I try it? - Of course.

974
00:40:07,817 --> 00:40:10,417
(Dong Yeon, who has never cooked fish before, is eager to learn!)

975
00:40:10,516 --> 00:40:13,086
(Dong Yeon is amazing.)

976
00:40:13,087 --> 00:40:15,387
- Be careful. It's really sharp. - Be careful.

977
00:40:15,726 --> 00:40:17,125
- Into three parts. - Like this.

978
00:40:17,126 --> 00:40:19,156
Are these okay?

979
00:40:19,157 --> 00:40:20,626
Yes. It's good.

980
00:40:20,797 --> 00:40:21,867
Next...

981
00:40:22,326 --> 00:40:25,766
Okay. They are the potatoes we took.

982
00:40:25,967 --> 00:40:27,035
Thank you.

983
00:40:27,036 --> 00:40:28,943
(The potatoes they took from Oiva's farm this afternoon)

984
00:40:28,967 --> 00:40:31,205
It's a potato party.

985
00:40:31,206 --> 00:40:33,047
Okay. Cut them into the same size.

986
00:40:33,146 --> 00:40:35,776
I cut them for you.

987
00:40:35,777 --> 00:40:36,816
"Same size?"

988
00:40:36,817 --> 00:40:39,176
He's asking us to cut them into the same size, right?

989
00:40:39,177 --> 00:40:41,447
- No. - He already cut them, I think.

990
00:40:41,746 --> 00:40:42,786
What?

991
00:40:43,556 --> 00:40:46,456
(Mr. Impatient doesn't give them a chance to help him.)

992
00:40:48,556 --> 00:40:50,856
(Actually, )

993
00:40:50,857 --> 00:40:54,467
(he's helping them so passionately.)

994
00:40:55,797 --> 00:40:58,896
(Looking around)

995
00:41:00,137 --> 00:41:02,506
Should we help him with it?

996
00:41:02,507 --> 00:41:03,875
(What can we do to help him?)

997
00:41:03,876 --> 00:41:05,176
- Well. - Yes.

998
00:41:05,177 --> 00:41:08,277
Since he's making food for us,

999
00:41:08,777 --> 00:41:11,846
we should also do something for him. What do you think?

1000
00:41:12,146 --> 00:41:13,317
- Sounds good. - Ramyeon.

1001
00:41:13,516 --> 00:41:16,786
(Oiva was very hungry.)

1002
00:41:17,556 --> 00:41:20,226
(What's something we can cook up quickly?)

1003
00:41:20,556 --> 00:41:22,225
- Sounds good. - Ramyeon. Let's make ramyeon.

1004
00:41:22,226 --> 00:41:23,297
- Ramyeon? - Yes.

1005
00:41:24,697 --> 00:41:27,226
Oiva, do you like spicy food?

1006
00:41:27,766 --> 00:41:29,467
I can eat spicy food.

1007
00:41:29,996 --> 00:41:32,196
Gochujang.

1008
00:41:32,197 --> 00:41:33,766
- Gosh, gochujang. - Gosh, gochujang?

1009
00:41:34,306 --> 00:41:35,535
Do you know ramyeon?

1010
00:41:35,536 --> 00:41:36,806
- Do you know ramyeon? - No.

1011
00:41:37,576 --> 00:41:38,607
Do you like noodles?

1012
00:41:39,607 --> 00:41:40,947
- Noodles? - Yes.

1013
00:41:41,607 --> 00:41:43,546
It's not my favorite,

1014
00:41:43,547 --> 00:41:45,117
but I can eat it all.

1015
00:41:47,047 --> 00:41:48,317
Oiva eats everything.

1016
00:41:49,487 --> 00:41:50,916
- You can? - Yes.

1017
00:41:51,157 --> 00:41:54,656
Then if we cook ramyeon, will you try?

1018
00:41:54,657 --> 00:41:56,225
Yes, why not?

1019
00:41:56,226 --> 00:41:57,895
In any case,

1020
00:41:57,896 --> 00:41:59,796
I don't think it's polite for us to sit still.

1021
00:41:59,797 --> 00:42:03,236
We should do something for him.

1022
00:42:03,237 --> 00:42:05,595
- He's putting in so much effort. - Yes.

1023
00:42:05,596 --> 00:42:07,436
But did he say he doesn't really like noodles?

1024
00:42:10,806 --> 00:42:12,676
He said it wasn't his favorite.

1025
00:42:12,677 --> 00:42:15,476
Let's make a tasty ramyeon so it could become his favorite.

1026
00:42:15,907 --> 00:42:18,015
And I want to eat some ramyeon too.

1027
00:42:18,016 --> 00:42:19,515
We'll make ramyeon for all of us.

1028
00:42:19,516 --> 00:42:20,863
(The Dong Brothers go to make ramyeon for Oiva!)

1029
00:42:20,887 --> 00:42:23,887
What we need next is...

1030
00:42:25,157 --> 00:42:27,625
- Have to put a little bit of salt. - Salt.

1031
00:42:27,626 --> 00:42:29,995
This kind of...

1032
00:42:29,996 --> 00:42:31,156
(Use sea salt or bay salt.)

1033
00:42:31,157 --> 00:42:33,166
Not fine salt, but what is it?

1034
00:42:34,626 --> 00:42:35,666
And this much.

1035
00:42:36,467 --> 00:42:37,495
Like this.

1036
00:42:37,496 --> 00:42:38,496
(He doesn't measure the amount!)

1037
00:42:38,497 --> 00:42:40,607
A little bit more. Now it's good.

1038
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:43,406
(Are fish, potatoes, and salt the only ingredients?)

1039
00:42:43,407 --> 00:42:45,276
(The ingredients are simple compared to Korean spicy fish stew.)

1040
00:42:45,277 --> 00:42:46,346
And then...

1041
00:42:49,516 --> 00:42:50,975
- Okay. - Yes.

1042
00:42:50,976 --> 00:42:52,075
(What is the stick for?)

1043
00:42:52,076 --> 00:42:54,447
This kind of wood.

1044
00:42:54,547 --> 00:42:56,186
For what? What do you think?

1045
00:42:57,857 --> 00:42:59,527
He's using a triangular angle...

1046
00:42:59,657 --> 00:43:00,726
- To hang the pot. - Gosh.

1047
00:43:01,786 --> 00:43:05,297
And then we put some firewood.

1048
00:43:05,556 --> 00:43:07,325
He jammed it in the ground.

1049
00:43:07,326 --> 00:43:10,797
(Je Hoon brought a stick to try to help.)

1050
00:43:11,737 --> 00:43:12,765
Yes.

1051
00:43:12,766 --> 00:43:14,435
(Eun Woo...)

1052
00:43:14,436 --> 00:43:16,737
(moved the pot so it doesn't get in the way.)

1053
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:18,206
Like that.

1054
00:43:18,806 --> 00:43:19,806
And then...

1055
00:43:20,107 --> 00:43:22,976
- Put this one here? - You can put it here.

1056
00:43:23,146 --> 00:43:24,176
Okay.

1057
00:43:24,177 --> 00:43:25,915
(Eun Woo is being a good assistant next to Oiva.)

1058
00:43:25,916 --> 00:43:27,185
- Gosh. - Here?

1059
00:43:27,186 --> 00:43:28,217
Yes.

1060
00:43:29,087 --> 00:43:32,717
(He secures the pot by hanging it on the stick.)

1061
00:43:33,587 --> 00:43:34,857
Little more higher?

1062
00:43:35,357 --> 00:43:37,657
Yes, I put the bricks.

1063
00:43:40,297 --> 00:43:41,926
(The height can be adjusted by putting bricks under the stick.)

1064
00:43:41,927 --> 00:43:43,367
The bricks. Gosh.

1065
00:43:45,737 --> 00:43:47,006
Nice.

1066
00:43:47,007 --> 00:43:49,207
(Quick-witted Eun Woo helped Oiva without being asked.)

1067
00:43:50,777 --> 00:43:51,777
This is unnecessary then.

1068
00:43:51,778 --> 00:43:53,818
(He thought it would help, but it was unnecessary.)

1069
00:43:54,107 --> 00:43:56,976
Good. It's boiling just right.

1070
00:43:58,317 --> 00:43:59,317
Okay.

1071
00:43:59,318 --> 00:44:00,446
(What will the fish dish made with only whole foods taste like?)

1072
00:44:00,447 --> 00:44:02,016
- Very good. - I take an onion.

1073
00:44:02,146 --> 00:44:03,156
(But...)

1074
00:44:03,157 --> 00:44:04,657
- And then... - Onion?

1075
00:44:04,757 --> 00:44:05,857
Onion.

1076
00:44:05,987 --> 00:44:07,186
And then...

1077
00:44:08,087 --> 00:44:09,357
I put it here.

1078
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:13,796
(He puts the onion into a different pot?)

1079
00:44:13,797 --> 00:44:16,797
Is he trying to caramelize the onion?

1080
00:44:17,436 --> 00:44:18,495
Caramelizing?

1081
00:44:18,496 --> 00:44:20,136
Like cooking the onion for a long time...

1082
00:44:20,137 --> 00:44:22,206
I think he's trying to make it sweet.

1083
00:44:22,507 --> 00:44:24,576
And then butter.

1084
00:44:26,476 --> 00:44:28,575
(Minced onion and butter?)

1085
00:44:28,576 --> 00:44:29,816
He put two pieces of butter in.

1086
00:44:31,617 --> 00:44:33,317
Is that unsalted butter?

1087
00:44:33,916 --> 00:44:35,785
(The incident is unforgettable.)

1088
00:44:35,786 --> 00:44:38,015
I want to take a little bit of water.

1089
00:44:38,016 --> 00:44:39,016
Water?

1090
00:44:41,487 --> 00:44:42,656
Is it too hot?

1091
00:44:42,657 --> 00:44:45,895
(He's adding fish broth to the onion and butter.)

1092
00:44:45,896 --> 00:44:47,376
He draining some of the boiled broth.

1093
00:44:47,527 --> 00:44:50,396
Now here's the onion and butter...

1094
00:44:51,197 --> 00:44:52,595
and fish broth.

1095
00:44:52,596 --> 00:44:54,142
(They've never seen soup with those ingredients before.)

1096
00:44:54,166 --> 00:44:57,306
It's butter onion soup.

1097
00:44:57,706 --> 00:44:59,876
We're now finally making ramyeon.

1098
00:45:00,507 --> 00:45:01,845
It's time.

1099
00:45:01,846 --> 00:45:03,476
The way I see it,

1100
00:45:03,876 --> 00:45:05,776
I know Oiva said noodles weren't his favorite,

1101
00:45:05,777 --> 00:45:06,785
(The Dong Brothers are on a mission...)

1102
00:45:06,786 --> 00:45:07,915
but he might like ramyeon once he tries it.

1103
00:45:07,916 --> 00:45:09,555
- He might think it's good. - Yes.

1104
00:45:09,556 --> 00:45:10,556
(to make ramyeon Ovia's favorite food.)

1105
00:45:10,557 --> 00:45:13,656
Should we cook 4 packets or 5?

1106
00:45:13,657 --> 00:45:15,225
We have the dish Oiva's making,

1107
00:45:15,226 --> 00:45:16,895
- Then 4? - so 3 or 4? Let's do 4.

1108
00:45:16,896 --> 00:45:17,896
All right. Four.

1109
00:45:17,897 --> 00:45:19,567
Matches.

1110
00:45:19,927 --> 00:45:21,126
The water.

1111
00:45:21,266 --> 00:45:22,625
You're going to add some more, right?

1112
00:45:22,626 --> 00:45:24,466
(They're now used to the gas stoves in Lapland.)

1113
00:45:24,467 --> 00:45:26,337
Good.

1114
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:28,935
Do we have anything that we can add...

1115
00:45:28,936 --> 00:45:30,536
to the ramyeon?

1116
00:45:31,277 --> 00:45:33,547
He doesn't like spicy food, so not really.

1117
00:45:34,507 --> 00:45:37,745
Will adding eggs make it less spicy?

1118
00:45:37,746 --> 00:45:39,415
- In the ramyeon? - Yes, eggs.

1119
00:45:39,416 --> 00:45:41,345
That's a good idea. He gave us some eggs.

1120
00:45:41,346 --> 00:45:43,416
- Right, the ones he gave us. - We'll use them.

1121
00:45:44,087 --> 00:45:47,486
He'll like that we used the eggs from his farm.

1122
00:45:47,487 --> 00:45:49,055
- Yes, we'll use two. - All right.

1123
00:45:49,056 --> 00:45:50,495
(They're doing whatever it takes to make ramyeon Oiva's favorite food.)

1124
00:45:50,496 --> 00:45:51,556
Two eggs.

1125
00:45:52,056 --> 00:45:53,665
- Dong Hwi. I'll start making it. - Yes?

1126
00:45:53,666 --> 00:45:56,297
Okay. Speed is key when cooking ramyeon.

1127
00:45:56,766 --> 00:46:00,305
(Put noodles into the boiling water!)

1128
00:46:00,306 --> 00:46:03,777
(What?)

1129
00:46:04,306 --> 00:46:09,646
(Dong Yeon cooks the noodles fully without the seasoning packet?)

1130
00:46:10,376 --> 00:46:14,786
(Those who like slightly uncooked noodles, get up!)

1131
00:46:16,186 --> 00:46:18,116
(This is Dong Yeon's special recipe.)

1132
00:46:18,117 --> 00:46:21,956
(He adds the seasoning packet once the noodles are fully cooked.)

1133
00:46:22,826 --> 00:46:25,955
All right. We'll just cook this quickly.

1134
00:46:25,956 --> 00:46:27,096
We can eat this first.

1135
00:46:27,126 --> 00:46:29,566
Let's just think of this as a restaurant.

1136
00:46:29,567 --> 00:46:32,165
- Like a course meal. - The ramyeon is the appetizer.

1137
00:46:32,166 --> 00:46:33,236
Before the main dish.

1138
00:46:33,237 --> 00:46:34,765
Do appetizers come after or before the main dish?

1139
00:46:34,766 --> 00:46:36,607
- Before. - Yes, so it's an appetizer.

1140
00:46:38,177 --> 00:46:39,475
Gosh, since I came here,

1141
00:46:39,476 --> 00:46:40,996
I've been getting everything confused.

1142
00:46:45,346 --> 00:46:46,746
- It's perfect. - Gosh.

1143
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:48,322
I can tell from looking at the water.

1144
00:46:48,346 --> 00:46:50,356
Here. Blow before you eat it.

1145
00:46:50,357 --> 00:46:53,786
(What does Dong Yeon's special recipe taste like?)

1146
00:46:54,126 --> 00:46:55,527
Hey, this is perfect.

1147
00:46:55,587 --> 00:46:57,467
If we let this cook more, it will be too salty.

1148
00:46:57,697 --> 00:46:58,756
We have to go now.

1149
00:46:58,757 --> 00:47:00,273
You know I'm good at telling when to stop cooking, right?

1150
00:47:00,297 --> 00:47:01,466
Yes.

1151
00:47:01,467 --> 00:47:03,467
If you add the eggs, it will cook even more.

1152
00:47:03,896 --> 00:47:05,266
You want me to add more water?

1153
00:47:05,797 --> 00:47:07,237
That's a dilemma.

1154
00:47:08,107 --> 00:47:10,506
The eggs will take in the soup.

1155
00:47:10,507 --> 00:47:12,035
(Why is he so serious about adding eggs?)

1156
00:47:12,036 --> 00:47:15,075
- The eggs will coat the soup. - They coat the soup.

1157
00:47:15,076 --> 00:47:17,222
I have some broth over here. You want me to add this back in?

1158
00:47:17,246 --> 00:47:18,446
Yes, that's great.

1159
00:47:18,447 --> 00:47:20,886
- Right? - That broth.

1160
00:47:20,887 --> 00:47:22,446
- I took some out earlier. - Nice.

1161
00:47:22,447 --> 00:47:24,356
- Should I add a spoonful? - Gosh, Dong Yeon.

1162
00:47:24,357 --> 00:47:25,357
Yes, a spoonful,

1163
00:47:25,358 --> 00:47:26,825
because we added two eggs.

1164
00:47:26,826 --> 00:47:28,555
I'm not doing this halfheartedly.

1165
00:47:28,556 --> 00:47:30,926
The eggs will coat the ramyeon.

1166
00:47:30,927 --> 00:47:31,967
- Coat the ramyeon? - Yes.

1167
00:47:33,297 --> 00:47:35,696
- Dong Hwi, let's take this outside. - Okay.

1168
00:47:35,697 --> 00:47:37,035
Should we bring bowls?

1169
00:47:37,036 --> 00:47:38,236
They already took the bowls.

1170
00:47:38,237 --> 00:47:39,296
Okay.

1171
00:47:39,297 --> 00:47:40,366
Let's go.

1172
00:47:40,367 --> 00:47:41,736
(Are they sure the noodles didn't get soggy?)

1173
00:47:41,737 --> 00:47:43,277
Gosh.

1174
00:47:43,507 --> 00:47:44,536
Are we late?

1175
00:47:44,637 --> 00:47:45,935
- No. - No?

1176
00:47:45,936 --> 00:47:46,975
Perfect timing.

1177
00:47:46,976 --> 00:47:49,546
We can eat this as an appetizer anyway.

1178
00:47:49,547 --> 00:47:50,676
The dish is almost done.

1179
00:47:50,677 --> 00:47:52,075
It's nearly done.

1180
00:47:52,076 --> 00:47:53,645
Gosh, our timing was incredible.

1181
00:47:53,646 --> 00:47:55,486
(The non-spicy fish stew is complete as well!)

1182
00:47:56,246 --> 00:47:59,117
- He's covering it. - I think he's trying to flip it.

1183
00:48:00,786 --> 00:48:01,825
Gosh, that pot must be so hot.

1184
00:48:01,826 --> 00:48:02,826
(The recipe and the performance are all simple but cool.)

1185
00:48:02,826 --> 00:48:03,826
Now we're ready.

1186
00:48:06,226 --> 00:48:07,226
Excellent.

1187
00:48:07,266 --> 00:48:08,527
Now it's ready.

1188
00:48:08,766 --> 00:48:10,236
Let's eat. The ramyeon could get soggy.

1189
00:48:10,237 --> 00:48:11,673
(This stew was made only with natural ingredients.)

1190
00:48:11,697 --> 00:48:12,765
Your dinner.

1191
00:48:12,766 --> 00:48:13,836
(Kalapottu, a traditional fish dish of Lapland)

1192
00:48:13,837 --> 00:48:14,867
Thank you so much.

1193
00:48:14,907 --> 00:48:16,137
Thank you for the meal.

1194
00:48:16,266 --> 00:48:17,606
Thank you.

1195
00:48:17,607 --> 00:48:20,606
This is ours. Korean noodles.

1196
00:48:20,607 --> 00:48:22,406
Thank you.

1197
00:48:22,407 --> 00:48:24,245
(Kalapottu made with whole foods, ramyeon full of MSG)

1198
00:48:24,246 --> 00:48:25,346
Korean noodles.

1199
00:48:26,516 --> 00:48:28,916
Do you want to have a competition to see which one's better?

1200
00:48:29,346 --> 00:48:30,387
You'll win.

1201
00:48:31,357 --> 00:48:32,357
We'll have to see.

1202
00:48:32,358 --> 00:48:34,186
You'll win for sure.

1203
00:48:34,387 --> 00:48:36,396
It's because the noodles are soggy.

1204
00:48:38,927 --> 00:48:40,026
No, it's not.

1205
00:48:40,027 --> 00:48:41,027
(No, it's not!)

1206
00:48:41,028 --> 00:48:43,567
I'll teach you how to eat this.

1207
00:48:43,896 --> 00:48:45,737
- Here. - Butter from here.

1208
00:48:48,407 --> 00:48:52,176
He put the butter and onion over...

1209
00:48:52,177 --> 00:48:54,346
over the fish and potatoes.

1210
00:48:54,376 --> 00:48:55,546
I see. Okay.

1211
00:48:55,547 --> 00:48:57,177
And put this.

1212
00:48:57,476 --> 00:48:58,547
Yes, like that.

1213
00:48:59,617 --> 00:49:00,746
Nice.

1214
00:49:00,916 --> 00:49:04,556
This is a Finnish traditional dish called kalapottu.

1215
00:49:04,916 --> 00:49:07,285
- Kalapottu. - Fish and potatoes.

1216
00:49:07,286 --> 00:49:08,555
- Kalapottu. - Kalapottu.

1217
00:49:08,556 --> 00:49:10,357
- Finland traditional local food. - Yes.

1218
00:49:10,527 --> 00:49:14,726
We can call this siikapottu, because we used common whitefish.

1219
00:49:15,626 --> 00:49:16,936
Thank you for the food.

1220
00:49:18,536 --> 00:49:19,637
It's good.

1221
00:49:25,536 --> 00:49:28,076
(He's expressing how good it tastes.)

1222
00:49:30,677 --> 00:49:32,076
The fish is so soft.

1223
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:33,497
- Yes, it's good. - It's amazing.

1224
00:49:33,587 --> 00:49:36,956
This is a simple dish of fish and potatoes,

1225
00:49:37,286 --> 00:49:39,556
but the creamy sauce...

1226
00:49:39,757 --> 00:49:43,156
made with butter and onion poured on top of it...

1227
00:49:43,157 --> 00:49:45,427
makes the flavor amazing.

1228
00:49:46,496 --> 00:49:47,656
And the important thing is...

1229
00:49:47,726 --> 00:49:48,967
that he used unsalted butter.

1230
00:49:49,297 --> 00:49:51,617
(And the important thing is that he used unsalted butter!)

1231
00:49:51,837 --> 00:49:53,435
The flavor is very clean...

1232
00:49:53,436 --> 00:49:55,266
and it feels nutritious.

1233
00:49:55,507 --> 00:49:58,035
It has protein, carbs, and fat.

1234
00:49:58,036 --> 00:49:59,805
(Not using any MSG is the charm of Lapland's simple dish.)

1235
00:49:59,806 --> 00:50:00,947
It's tasty.

1236
00:50:01,576 --> 00:50:02,876
It really is.

1237
00:50:03,376 --> 00:50:04,547
It's tasty.

1238
00:50:05,346 --> 00:50:07,547
(Oiva's Korean is good.)

1239
00:50:08,487 --> 00:50:11,686
This is so delicious and perfect.

1240
00:50:11,757 --> 00:50:14,726
Gosh, this is a delicacy.

1241
00:50:16,027 --> 00:50:18,157
- Try the ramyeon. - Yes.

1242
00:50:19,056 --> 00:50:21,266
Because we're in a competition.

1243
00:50:22,027 --> 00:50:23,696
The noodles are a bit soggy now.

1244
00:50:23,697 --> 00:50:24,995
How do we explain that the noodles are soggy in English?

1245
00:50:24,996 --> 00:50:26,966
I'm thinking, is it really hot?

1246
00:50:26,967 --> 00:50:28,137
(Is the ramyeon spicy?)

1247
00:50:28,306 --> 00:50:30,607
It's not that hot.

1248
00:50:31,306 --> 00:50:33,475
But the noodles are too mushy now.

1249
00:50:33,476 --> 00:50:35,122
(Oiva is used to eating whole foods. Will he like the ramyeon?)

1250
00:50:35,146 --> 00:50:37,345
(Picking at the ramyeon)

1251
00:50:37,346 --> 00:50:40,185
(Dong Yeon is nervous.)

1252
00:50:40,186 --> 00:50:42,746
(Will the ramyeon become Oiva's favorite?)

1253
00:50:42,846 --> 00:50:43,856
Gosh, it's hot.

1254
00:50:43,857 --> 00:50:45,555
This egg.

1255
00:50:45,556 --> 00:50:46,726
- Yes, an egg. - Gosh.

1256
00:50:47,487 --> 00:50:49,185
- We used your eggs, Oiva. - This is ours?

1257
00:50:49,186 --> 00:50:51,297
Yes, your eggs.

1258
00:50:52,027 --> 00:50:55,427
(How are the noodles?)

1259
00:50:55,797 --> 00:50:59,967
(What do you think about the flavor of Korean MSG?)

1260
00:51:01,007 --> 00:51:02,706
This soup is good.

1261
00:51:03,036 --> 00:51:04,336
- Good? - Yes.

1262
00:51:04,337 --> 00:51:05,435
Thank you.

1263
00:51:05,436 --> 00:51:06,607
Ten points.

1264
00:51:06,677 --> 00:51:08,007
- Ten points. - Ten points.

1265
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:10,376
(Dong Yeon is relieved.)

1266
00:51:10,547 --> 00:51:14,047
I give this 100 points.

1267
00:51:14,786 --> 00:51:15,915
Thank you.

1268
00:51:15,916 --> 00:51:17,086
(I won.)

1269
00:51:17,087 --> 00:51:19,415
I want to try the ramyeon. Can I have some?

1270
00:51:19,416 --> 00:51:21,185
- Go ahead, Dong Hwi. - Go ahead.

1271
00:51:21,186 --> 00:51:22,886
You and Dong Yeon made it.

1272
00:51:22,887 --> 00:51:25,407
(This is the first time he's having Korean ramyeon in Lapland!)

1273
00:51:26,626 --> 00:51:30,567
(He's smiling at the taste.)

1274
00:51:31,367 --> 00:51:36,907
(He still hasn't been able to let go of the flavor of MSG.)

1275
00:51:42,107 --> 00:51:44,046
(I love whole foods, )

1276
00:51:44,047 --> 00:51:48,087
(but I also love MSG.)

1277
00:51:48,686 --> 00:51:53,217
(The ramyeon is bringing their old city boy tastebuds back to life.)

1278
00:51:53,826 --> 00:51:56,357
What's amazing is that...

1279
00:51:56,826 --> 00:51:59,157
it's 11:23pm right now,

1280
00:51:59,967 --> 00:52:01,126
but it's still...

1281
00:52:01,197 --> 00:52:03,566
What time is it? 11:30pm?

1282
00:52:03,567 --> 00:52:06,435
It's 23 minutes past 11pm,

1283
00:52:06,436 --> 00:52:07,606
(Current time 11:23pm)

1284
00:52:07,607 --> 00:52:09,035
but it's still this bright.

1285
00:52:09,036 --> 00:52:10,736
Right. How is this nighttime?

1286
00:52:10,737 --> 00:52:11,906
(Even when the sun sets, it doesn't get dark in Posio.)

1287
00:52:11,907 --> 00:52:16,206
The movement of the clouds kind of looks like smoke.

1288
00:52:16,346 --> 00:52:17,617
It's incredible, isn't it?

1289
00:52:17,916 --> 00:52:20,886
I think the food tastes much better...

1290
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:22,686
with this nice view.

1291
00:52:26,556 --> 00:52:29,076
Taking a bite after looking at the view makes the food tastier.

1292
00:52:29,556 --> 00:52:30,797
This is unbelievable.

1293
00:52:30,996 --> 00:52:33,297
I'm looking this way,

1294
00:52:33,666 --> 00:52:36,496
but the first thing I see is Dong Hwi's facial hair.

1295
00:52:37,567 --> 00:52:39,596
I guess your facial hair is part of the scenery.

1296
00:52:40,507 --> 00:52:41,665
(Gosh)

1297
00:52:41,666 --> 00:52:42,867
Today, we...

1298
00:52:43,576 --> 00:52:45,216
We're all talking about different things.

1299
00:52:45,806 --> 00:52:47,447
What were you trying to say?

1300
00:52:47,576 --> 00:52:48,607
Today...

1301
00:52:48,646 --> 00:52:49,705
How often...

1302
00:52:49,706 --> 00:52:51,245
(- Today... - How often...)

1303
00:52:51,246 --> 00:52:52,345
How often...

1304
00:52:52,346 --> 00:52:54,286
(Laughing)

1305
00:52:54,817 --> 00:52:56,386
(None of them are listening to each other.)

1306
00:52:56,387 --> 00:52:57,486
Tell me about it.

1307
00:52:57,487 --> 00:52:59,857
(Drinking the soup of the ramyeon)

1308
00:53:02,056 --> 00:53:04,326
(Clean)

1309
00:53:04,496 --> 00:53:05,556
I'm full.

1310
00:53:05,896 --> 00:53:07,125
- Gosh. - He said "I'm full."

1311
00:53:07,126 --> 00:53:08,427
I'm really full.

1312
00:53:08,867 --> 00:53:09,996
He said "I'm full."

1313
00:53:11,837 --> 00:53:15,467
My wife is waiting.

1314
00:53:16,976 --> 00:53:18,006
Right.

1315
00:53:18,007 --> 00:53:20,306
(Why isn't Oiva coming home?)

1316
00:53:20,376 --> 00:53:23,645
But maybe it's good that she's waiting?

1317
00:53:23,646 --> 00:53:24,845
Don't go.

1318
00:53:24,846 --> 00:53:25,926
(Je Hoon is acting cutesy.)

1319
00:53:26,217 --> 00:53:27,387
Stay with me.

1320
00:53:27,416 --> 00:53:29,286
Stay with us.

1321
00:53:29,416 --> 00:53:31,487
His wife must be so worried.

1322
00:53:31,817 --> 00:53:33,757
He's staying later than she expected.

1323
00:53:34,357 --> 00:53:37,495
She could be thinking that he went somewhere else...

1324
00:53:37,496 --> 00:53:38,656
because it's almost midnight.

1325
00:53:38,726 --> 00:53:40,495
- Instead of coming home? - Thank you very much.

1326
00:53:40,496 --> 00:53:43,566
- Gosh. - He's leaving.

1327
00:53:43,567 --> 00:53:44,766
(Oiva does things his way.)

1328
00:53:45,367 --> 00:53:47,406
I think you can survive here.

1329
00:53:47,407 --> 00:53:48,637
I trust you.

1330
00:53:49,436 --> 00:53:51,536
- Yes, sure. - Thank you for today.

1331
00:53:51,777 --> 00:53:53,075
Okay, see you.

1332
00:53:53,076 --> 00:53:54,745
- Thank you, bye. Have a goodnight. - See you. Goodnight.

1333
00:53:54,746 --> 00:53:56,046
- Goodnight. - Goodnight.

1334
00:53:56,047 --> 00:53:57,845
Gosh, I'm so thankful for him.

1335
00:53:57,846 --> 00:53:59,415
- He's so nice. - He stayed here until so late.

1336
00:53:59,416 --> 00:54:01,786
(I hope you make good memories while renting my house.)

1337
00:54:07,087 --> 00:54:09,087
- Goodness. - Goodness.

1338
00:54:09,857 --> 00:54:13,197
Gosh, this is where I'll be sleeping tonight.

1339
00:54:13,257 --> 00:54:14,826
We don't know that yet.

1340
00:54:15,967 --> 00:54:17,066
(They're getting on each other's nerves as soon as they're inside.)

1341
00:54:17,067 --> 00:54:18,936
- We're... - Yes.

1342
00:54:19,797 --> 00:54:21,907
Goodness, my spot is...

1343
00:54:22,067 --> 00:54:23,836
This is my spot.

1344
00:54:23,837 --> 00:54:25,375
Gosh, this is my spot.

1345
00:54:25,376 --> 00:54:27,805
Goodness, it's soft.

1346
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:29,446
I just automatically sat down.

1347
00:54:29,447 --> 00:54:31,446
(There are 4 people, but only 2 beds.)

1348
00:54:31,447 --> 00:54:32,475
We...

1349
00:54:32,476 --> 00:54:35,617
- Let's not battle as individuals. - Okay.

1350
00:54:36,617 --> 00:54:37,986
Let's play in teams of two.

1351
00:54:37,987 --> 00:54:39,785
Two get to sleep here, while the other two have to sleep outside.

1352
00:54:39,786 --> 00:54:40,825
That's right.

1353
00:54:40,826 --> 00:54:44,027
(2 will sleep inside the house, and 2 will sleep in the tent.)

1354
00:54:45,527 --> 00:54:49,266
(The tent where Dong Yeon felt like he could get scoliosis)

1355
00:54:49,697 --> 00:54:53,066
(The midnight sun has come to an end and it's dark outside.)

1356
00:54:53,067 --> 00:54:56,137
(The view isn't a perk anymore.)

1357
00:54:57,277 --> 00:55:01,677
(The spooky sound of the wind triggering fear is all there is.)

1358
00:55:02,346 --> 00:55:06,117
(On top of that, the temperature dropped with the sunset.)

1359
00:55:06,817 --> 00:55:09,185
(In the secluded forest...)

1360
00:55:09,186 --> 00:55:12,487
(is the thrill of sleeping alongside wild animals.)

1361
00:55:13,657 --> 00:55:17,725
(Which two city boys will be experiencing the scary tree tent?)

1362
00:55:17,726 --> 00:55:19,126
We'll battle in teams of two.

1363
00:55:19,896 --> 00:55:21,095
Dong Yeon.

1364
00:55:21,096 --> 00:55:23,567
Do you want to be on my team? You keep lingering near me.

1365
00:55:23,596 --> 00:55:24,636
(Dong Yeon inches closer.)

1366
00:55:24,637 --> 00:55:25,797
The Dong-Dong Bros.

1367
00:55:26,036 --> 00:55:28,366
- I can't help how I feel. - Strangely enough,

1368
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:29,866
we were the fish team.

1369
00:55:29,867 --> 00:55:31,676
You're Team Fishing and we're Team Tent.

1370
00:55:31,677 --> 00:55:33,106
Yes, fish versus tent.

1371
00:55:33,107 --> 00:55:34,345
- Are we in this together? - Okay.

1372
00:55:34,346 --> 00:55:35,976
- Let's go. - Come on.

1373
00:55:36,677 --> 00:55:38,177
I'm just reminding you...

1374
00:55:38,416 --> 00:55:39,546
that in Finnish culture,

1375
00:55:39,547 --> 00:55:42,185
people sleep in the house they built.

1376
00:55:42,186 --> 00:55:45,117
- Let's see. - Remember Oiva and Aleksi?

1377
00:55:45,416 --> 00:55:48,786
- They share what is theirs. - That's right.

1378
00:55:48,857 --> 00:55:50,956
We'll let you stay in our vacation house,

1379
00:55:51,096 --> 00:55:53,356
Dong Yeon and Dong Hwi.

1380
00:55:53,357 --> 00:55:54,797
Stop that.

1381
00:55:55,467 --> 00:55:56,935
Let's decide through a game.

1382
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:58,035
- All right. - Sure.

1383
00:55:58,036 --> 00:55:59,436
What game should we play?

1384
00:55:59,896 --> 00:56:01,107
For example...

1385
00:56:01,536 --> 00:56:02,536
(Eyes fixed)

1386
00:56:02,537 --> 00:56:04,035
That.

1387
00:56:04,036 --> 00:56:06,435
Let's do bottle flipping.

1388
00:56:06,436 --> 00:56:07,546
On the table.

1389
00:56:07,547 --> 00:56:08,705
The bottle has to land upright right here.

1390
00:56:08,706 --> 00:56:10,346
- Okay. - Okay.

1391
00:56:10,476 --> 00:56:12,845
The team who can make the bottle stand upright the most wins.

1392
00:56:12,846 --> 00:56:14,016
- Okay. - Got it.

1393
00:56:14,186 --> 00:56:15,685
- Let's go. - Should I go first, Je Hoon?

1394
00:56:15,686 --> 00:56:17,556
- Yes. - Gosh, this is...

1395
00:56:18,016 --> 00:56:19,415
Gosh.

1396
00:56:19,416 --> 00:56:21,157
(They each get two chances.)

1397
00:56:21,357 --> 00:56:24,226
This isn't easy to do.

1398
00:56:24,326 --> 00:56:25,926
You just have to get the hang of it.

1399
00:56:25,927 --> 00:56:28,467
(He moved to get the hang of it.)

1400
00:56:30,766 --> 00:56:32,637
(Je Hoon is desperate to sleep on a bed.)

1401
00:56:33,637 --> 00:56:34,966
So Eun Woo...

1402
00:56:34,967 --> 00:56:37,007
(Just like this?)

1403
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:39,507
(It was so close.)

1404
00:56:40,277 --> 00:56:42,546
(Dong Hwi and Dong Yeon were startled for a second.)

1405
00:56:42,547 --> 00:56:44,416
- Okay, last chance. - Yes, last chance.

1406
00:56:45,416 --> 00:56:47,217
(Eun Woo was so close.)

1407
00:56:47,617 --> 00:56:48,887
You're almost there.

1408
00:56:49,387 --> 00:56:50,617
You were bragging so much,

1409
00:56:51,286 --> 00:56:52,516
but you didn't make it.

1410
00:56:53,757 --> 00:56:56,055
- You can do this. - At least once.

1411
00:56:56,056 --> 00:56:57,225
At least once?

1412
00:56:57,226 --> 00:56:58,472
(Eun Woo blocks out their voices and prepares to flip the bottle.)

1413
00:56:58,496 --> 00:57:00,126
Did he get the hang of it?

1414
00:57:02,927 --> 00:57:04,236
- Yes. - You did it.

1415
00:57:04,237 --> 00:57:05,557
(The bottle is standing upright!)

1416
00:57:05,896 --> 00:57:07,466
- Yes. - You did it.

1417
00:57:07,467 --> 00:57:08,706
(Pure joy)

1418
00:57:08,936 --> 00:57:10,136
(Dopamine rush)

1419
00:57:10,137 --> 00:57:11,577
- Gosh. - I can't believe he did it.

1420
00:57:12,277 --> 00:57:14,646
- It could come down to one flip. - Okay.

1421
00:57:14,746 --> 00:57:17,052
- It could come down to one flip. - They might not even flip it once.

1422
00:57:17,076 --> 00:57:18,676
- It could come down to one flip. - Come on.

1423
00:57:18,677 --> 00:57:20,415
Dong Hwi, gosh.

1424
00:57:20,416 --> 00:57:21,986
This is all being recorded on camera.

1425
00:57:21,987 --> 00:57:24,415
- Goodness. - Please take this seriously.

1426
00:57:24,416 --> 00:57:25,816
- I'm always serious. - How did I do this?

1427
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:27,556
- Gosh. - Thanks, hand.

1428
00:57:27,786 --> 00:57:29,486
I've never been not serious.

1429
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:30,555
You really have to take this seriously.

1430
00:57:30,556 --> 00:57:31,625
(Dong-Dong Bros are feeling a sense of urgency.)

1431
00:57:31,626 --> 00:57:32,696
Gosh, Dong Hwi.

1432
00:57:32,697 --> 00:57:34,067
- Already? - One second.

1433
00:57:34,567 --> 00:57:35,796
(Rubbing)

1434
00:57:35,797 --> 00:57:37,935
- Just do as you usually do. - Of course.

1435
00:57:37,936 --> 00:57:40,096
(The pressure is getting to him.)

1436
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:42,606
I'll film this in 4K for you.

1437
00:57:42,607 --> 00:57:43,935
(Eun Woo is excited about succeeding that he's wasting his battery.)

1438
00:57:43,936 --> 00:57:45,436
How did Eun Woo do this?

1439
00:57:45,907 --> 00:57:47,946
Just get the hang of it with your first try.

1440
00:57:47,947 --> 00:57:48,975
You can relax.

1441
00:57:48,976 --> 00:57:50,736
This usually comes down to flipping it once.

1442
00:57:51,416 --> 00:57:52,645
I can relax?

1443
00:57:52,646 --> 00:57:54,717
At first. You can relax for the first time.

1444
00:57:54,817 --> 00:57:56,145
One, two, three.

1445
00:57:56,146 --> 00:57:57,156
(Filmed on Eun Woo's phone)

1446
00:57:57,157 --> 00:57:59,156
(He relaxed too much and failed.)

1447
00:57:59,157 --> 00:58:00,157
Okay.

1448
00:58:00,158 --> 00:58:01,756
You got it now, right?

1449
00:58:01,757 --> 00:58:03,256
You see how it didn't flip all the way?

1450
00:58:03,257 --> 00:58:04,455
Your snap didn't last long enough.

1451
00:58:04,456 --> 00:58:05,495
- Do you get what I mean? - Yes, I got it.

1452
00:58:05,496 --> 00:58:07,567
- One failure. - I got it now.

1453
00:58:08,567 --> 00:58:09,766
Don't let this get to you.

1454
00:58:11,436 --> 00:58:12,566
Dong Hwi.

1455
00:58:12,567 --> 00:58:13,866
(Dong Hwi could endure not having curtains.)

1456
00:58:13,867 --> 00:58:15,467
This isn't easy.

1457
00:58:17,536 --> 00:58:18,976
One, two.

1458
00:58:19,376 --> 00:58:20,745
The bottle will flip. Gosh.

1459
00:58:20,746 --> 00:58:21,806
It fell.

1460
00:58:22,246 --> 00:58:23,606
The bottle will flip. Gosh.

1461
00:58:23,607 --> 00:58:25,075
It fell. That's minus one point.

1462
00:58:25,076 --> 00:58:27,185
No. That's not the rules.

1463
00:58:27,186 --> 00:58:29,516
It usually does come down to one flip.

1464
00:58:29,987 --> 00:58:32,055
Dong Hwi, look at Dong Yeon's face.

1465
00:58:32,056 --> 00:58:33,285
(Eun Woo's phone camera)

1466
00:58:33,286 --> 00:58:34,856
(Trying to be patient with clear eyes)

1467
00:58:34,857 --> 00:58:35,956
Failure.

1468
00:58:36,157 --> 00:58:37,197
Okay.

1469
00:58:37,896 --> 00:58:40,096
- Okay. - All right, it's about one.

1470
00:58:40,226 --> 00:58:42,266
Eun Woo is impressive. He...

1471
00:58:42,697 --> 00:58:44,136
All right. Let's go.

1472
00:58:44,137 --> 00:58:46,036
(Smirking out of sorriness)

1473
00:58:46,766 --> 00:58:50,206
(They're getting close to sleeping in the air.)

1474
00:58:51,407 --> 00:58:52,636
All right.

1475
00:58:52,637 --> 00:58:54,237
(Everything is in Dong Yeon's hand now.)

1476
00:58:55,177 --> 00:58:56,246
Let's not be swayed.

1477
00:58:56,447 --> 00:58:58,317
(He's more serious than ever.)

1478
00:58:58,646 --> 00:58:59,677
Not yet.

1479
00:59:00,117 --> 00:59:02,617
If you succeed, we'll win. It's that simple.

1480
00:59:02,717 --> 00:59:04,217
- Right. - Exactly.

1481
00:59:05,056 --> 00:59:06,886
- Or... - How did you do it?

1482
00:59:06,887 --> 00:59:07,887
(He has two chances.)

1483
00:59:07,888 --> 00:59:09,556
A wrist snap is important.

1484
00:59:10,257 --> 00:59:12,396
- All right. Kwak Dong Yeon. - Snapping.

1485
00:59:12,826 --> 00:59:13,967
Player Kwak Dong Yeon.

1486
00:59:14,297 --> 00:59:15,665
(Will he get to secure an indoor bed?)

1487
00:59:15,666 --> 00:59:16,726
Ready.

1488
00:59:19,337 --> 00:59:20,366
A tent!

1489
00:59:20,367 --> 00:59:21,467
(He fails.)

1490
00:59:22,737 --> 00:59:24,107
(Oh, no.)

1491
00:59:24,277 --> 00:59:25,305
No.

1492
00:59:25,306 --> 00:59:27,475
If you fail again this time,

1493
00:59:27,476 --> 00:59:29,176
- you'll sleep in a tent then. - Even if you don't, we'll be tied.

1494
00:59:29,177 --> 00:59:30,546
- Right, we'll be tied. - We'll be tied...

1495
00:59:30,547 --> 00:59:32,145
- only if you succeed. - You can do it.

1496
00:59:32,146 --> 00:59:33,515
I'll go.

1497
00:59:33,516 --> 00:59:35,716
All right, it's the last chance.

1498
00:59:35,717 --> 00:59:36,786
Please.

1499
00:59:38,016 --> 00:59:40,456
(Let's see.)

1500
00:59:40,527 --> 00:59:41,657
Please.

1501
00:59:42,927 --> 00:59:44,157
- A tent! - Yes!

1502
00:59:44,257 --> 00:59:45,626
We...

1503
00:59:46,357 --> 00:59:47,466
(Happy, Distressed)

1504
00:59:47,467 --> 00:59:49,427
Eun Woo, sleep anywhere you want here.

1505
00:59:49,467 --> 00:59:51,896
I'd love that. You can take any bed too.

1506
00:59:51,996 --> 00:59:53,196
(Failure)

1507
00:59:53,197 --> 00:59:54,507
It wouldn't work.

1508
00:59:54,766 --> 00:59:55,837
Hold on.

1509
00:59:56,706 --> 00:59:57,806
(This is enough.)

1510
00:59:58,436 --> 01:00:02,107
(Welcome. Is it your first time sleeping in the air?)

1511
01:00:02,277 --> 01:00:04,176
This is horrible.

1512
01:00:04,177 --> 01:00:06,617
(The city boys to the bone are getting a throbbing headache.)

1513
01:00:06,876 --> 01:00:08,015
At least, fish...

1514
01:00:08,016 --> 01:00:11,586
(He suddenly picks a bag of sweet chips.)

1515
01:00:11,587 --> 01:00:13,416
- Look at him. - Dong Yeon is...

1516
01:00:13,516 --> 01:00:14,826
craving something sweet.

1517
01:00:16,757 --> 01:00:18,026
(Throwing a bunch in his mouth)

1518
01:00:18,027 --> 01:00:19,055
Hey.

1519
01:00:19,056 --> 01:00:20,725
(Going on a binge out of stress)

1520
01:00:20,726 --> 01:00:22,567
Look. This has got to be acceptable.

1521
01:00:23,027 --> 01:00:24,496
Fine, we'll sleep there.

1522
01:00:24,737 --> 01:00:26,613
- We can spend time here. - But we can have fun here.

1523
01:00:26,637 --> 01:00:27,837
- Seriously. - Right.

1524
01:00:27,936 --> 01:00:29,236
We can chit-chat at night.

1525
01:00:29,237 --> 01:00:31,476
You guys can do it in bed.

1526
01:00:32,376 --> 01:00:34,145
I better lie down and get ready to sleep now.

1527
01:00:34,146 --> 01:00:36,706
- Dong Yeon, that's Je Hoon's bed. - It's my bed.

1528
01:00:36,976 --> 01:00:38,016
Goodness.

1529
01:00:38,246 --> 01:00:39,617
You're so mean.

1530
01:00:40,746 --> 01:00:42,817
(This is my bed.)

1531
01:00:43,016 --> 01:00:45,556
Everything is going to be a competition from now on.

1532
01:00:48,226 --> 01:00:52,156
(Eun Woo can't miss the fun of teasing Dong Hwi.)

1533
01:00:52,157 --> 01:00:54,037
Let's stop. It's no good talking with them now.

1534
01:00:54,427 --> 01:00:55,567
Goodnight.

1535
01:00:56,166 --> 01:00:57,846
Be careful not to get your face paralyzed.

1536
01:00:58,467 --> 01:01:01,535
(Unlike how beautiful it was during the daytime, )

1537
01:01:01,536 --> 01:01:05,277
(it's quite creepy at night.)

1538
01:01:06,007 --> 01:01:07,305
(The temperature dropped, )

1539
01:01:07,306 --> 01:01:10,876
(and the winds are getting stronger.)

1540
01:01:11,617 --> 01:01:14,587
(The first night in a tree tent in the worst weather)

1541
01:01:14,846 --> 01:01:17,015
I think we need something.

1542
01:01:17,016 --> 01:01:18,586
Hey, let's use this as a blanket.

1543
01:01:18,587 --> 01:01:19,656
We need this, at least,

1544
01:01:19,657 --> 01:01:21,356
to use it as a sheet or a blanket.

1545
01:01:21,357 --> 01:01:22,357
(They take a few things to prepare for the cold.)

1546
01:01:22,358 --> 01:01:25,197
Dong Hwi, it gets dramatically cold.

1547
01:01:26,126 --> 01:01:27,796
- We really... - Why did we have to lose...

1548
01:01:27,797 --> 01:01:29,197
on a day like today?

1549
01:01:31,337 --> 01:01:33,836
(They bitterly head to their mid-air tents.)

1550
01:01:33,837 --> 01:01:34,867
Well...

1551
01:01:37,306 --> 01:01:38,907
I can't see anything inside.

1552
01:01:41,476 --> 01:01:42,506
What...

1553
01:01:42,507 --> 01:01:44,276
(Pitch darkness)

1554
01:01:44,277 --> 01:01:47,786
(Sticking his stuff into the tent first)

1555
01:01:49,916 --> 01:01:53,987
(Scared of the darkness, the city boy takes the lantern.)

1556
01:01:55,427 --> 01:01:57,697
- Hey, Dong Yeon. - Yes?

1557
01:01:58,257 --> 01:02:00,527
The CEO was delighted to have me sleep here.

1558
01:02:00,697 --> 01:02:02,166
Why... What happened?

1559
01:02:04,567 --> 01:02:05,807
I'll have to think carefully...

1560
01:02:06,737 --> 01:02:08,567
- about the contract term. - You should.

1561
01:02:09,967 --> 01:02:11,636
(Is someone talking about me?)

1562
01:02:11,637 --> 01:02:12,706
What is this?

1563
01:02:12,777 --> 01:02:14,746
What is this? How do I get in here?

1564
01:02:16,246 --> 01:02:18,075
(Sticking his head in first)

1565
01:02:18,076 --> 01:02:19,116
Gosh, this is...

1566
01:02:19,117 --> 01:02:20,146
(There comes his head.)

1567
01:02:21,317 --> 01:02:22,415
Goodness, gracious.

1568
01:02:22,416 --> 01:02:23,696
(His legs are still struggling.)

1569
01:02:24,987 --> 01:02:27,185
- Dong Hwi. - What?

1570
01:02:27,186 --> 01:02:29,757
Can I call you over if I see any insects?

1571
01:02:31,157 --> 01:02:34,297
You may, but I'm not sure if I can go over.

1572
01:02:34,726 --> 01:02:35,766
Okay.

1573
01:02:36,596 --> 01:02:37,765
Is this right?

1574
01:02:37,766 --> 01:02:38,966
(He's still struggling.)

1575
01:02:38,967 --> 01:02:39,967
Hey, is this...

1576
01:02:39,967 --> 01:02:40,967
(Going in)

1577
01:02:41,536 --> 01:02:43,806
(It's not easy just to enter the mid-air tent.)

1578
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:45,676
(At least, he's arrived somehow.)

1579
01:02:45,677 --> 01:02:46,777
This is no joke.

1580
01:02:48,047 --> 01:02:50,276
(Meanwhile, Dong Yeon's tent has no ladder.)

1581
01:02:50,277 --> 01:02:52,576
How am I supposed to go up there?

1582
01:02:53,317 --> 01:02:54,646
You haven't gone up yet?

1583
01:02:56,217 --> 01:02:58,587
(The wooden foothold is too low for him.)

1584
01:02:59,357 --> 01:03:01,256
(He tries to go up first.)

1585
01:03:01,257 --> 01:03:03,087
(Staggering)

1586
01:03:04,456 --> 01:03:07,266
(The foothold is customized for Eun Woo, the tallest member.)

1587
01:03:07,967 --> 01:03:11,036
(And the tent is up high. It's from smoke into smother.)

1588
01:03:13,536 --> 01:03:17,376
(His legs don't know where to go.)

1589
01:03:18,837 --> 01:03:23,047
(He pushed his upper body in to barely go up in the tent.)

1590
01:03:25,047 --> 01:03:28,245
(It's so hard...)

1591
01:03:28,246 --> 01:03:29,316
I'm tired.

1592
01:03:29,317 --> 01:03:33,016
(to go to bed.)

1593
01:03:37,357 --> 01:03:39,456
- Dong Hwi. - What?

1594
01:03:39,757 --> 01:03:40,967
Are you okay?

1595
01:03:43,666 --> 01:03:45,837
You're not okay. I'm not okay either.

1596
01:03:47,666 --> 01:03:48,666
Gosh.

1597
01:03:48,667 --> 01:03:52,607
(It's their very first time sleeping outdoors and in the air.)

1598
01:03:53,677 --> 01:03:54,875
I feel lost.

1599
01:03:54,876 --> 01:03:56,306
(Tossing and turning)

1600
01:03:56,846 --> 01:04:00,547
(He curls up his body and tries to fall asleep.)

1601
01:04:00,846 --> 01:04:04,516
(But it seems impossible.)

1602
01:04:05,686 --> 01:04:08,626
(Rustling)

1603
01:04:08,927 --> 01:04:10,555
(Dong Yeon is having a hard time falling asleep too.)

1604
01:04:10,556 --> 01:04:12,056
(Sighing)

1605
01:04:14,326 --> 01:04:18,866
(The night in the isolated wild)

1606
01:04:18,867 --> 01:04:22,907
(Will they get to spend it safely?)

1607
01:04:23,867 --> 01:04:26,137
Eun Woo, you went through a lot today.

1608
01:04:26,436 --> 01:04:27,677
Goodnight, Je Hoon.

1609
01:04:28,277 --> 01:04:29,646
Good job today.

1610
01:04:29,777 --> 01:04:31,777
- Sweet dreams. - Goodnight.

1611
01:04:31,876 --> 01:04:32,976
Goodnight.

1612
01:04:34,916 --> 01:04:36,286
Gosh, it's comfortable.

1613
01:04:36,746 --> 01:04:39,456
(Chuckling)

1614
01:04:40,387 --> 01:04:45,427
(This night makes them realize how precious it is to have a floor.)

1615
01:04:46,396 --> 01:04:48,466
(The turbulent night goes, )

1616
01:04:48,467 --> 01:04:52,637
(and the new morning dawns.)

1617
01:04:54,067 --> 01:04:59,336
(The sky is clear as if nothing happened.)

1618
01:04:59,337 --> 01:05:03,306
(The ripples shine to meet the warm sunlight.)

1619
01:05:05,117 --> 01:05:09,516
(The small rented house meets the morning in silence.)

1620
01:05:11,087 --> 01:05:15,527
(It's protected by the green wall of trees.)

1621
01:05:17,527 --> 01:05:21,596
(It's a private house full of romance.)

1622
01:05:22,166 --> 01:05:26,197
(The four of them meet the morning in the world of their own.)

1623
01:05:26,797 --> 01:05:29,606
(Je Hoon and Eun Woo are still sound asleep.)

1624
01:05:29,607 --> 01:05:32,637
(Rustling)

1625
01:05:36,706 --> 01:05:39,376
(Has the morning already come?)

1626
01:05:40,317 --> 01:05:43,086
(Half asleep...)

1627
01:05:43,087 --> 01:05:46,217
(and half awake)

1628
01:05:48,587 --> 01:05:51,857
(His face is all swollen.)

1629
01:05:52,697 --> 01:05:57,496
(Waking up)

1630
01:05:59,137 --> 01:06:00,636
(Bright and sunny)

1631
01:06:00,637 --> 01:06:01,737
Gosh.

1632
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:07,237
(The unintentional bright light wakes Eun Woo up out of surprise.)

1633
01:06:07,507 --> 01:06:09,447
- You're awake? - Yes.

1634
01:06:10,646 --> 01:06:12,515
- Gosh. - Did you have a good night?

1635
01:06:12,516 --> 01:06:13,547
Yes.

1636
01:06:13,916 --> 01:06:15,117
The weather is great today.

1637
01:06:16,117 --> 01:06:17,556
The weather is always great here.

1638
01:06:18,556 --> 01:06:21,757
(The sunny weather welcomes the Renters.)

1639
01:06:22,686 --> 01:06:23,786
Hold on.

1640
01:06:24,257 --> 01:06:26,396
I wonder if they've survived.

1641
01:06:29,427 --> 01:06:31,996
I better go and check if they're alive.

1642
01:06:32,166 --> 01:06:33,367
I'll go.

1643
01:06:35,036 --> 01:06:36,706
What if their faces are paralyzed?

1644
01:06:37,777 --> 01:06:38,876
I'm worried.

1645
01:06:39,206 --> 01:06:40,946
(Checking his looks before going out)

1646
01:06:40,947 --> 01:06:43,107
(Oh, right)

1647
01:06:43,476 --> 01:06:46,646
(Following Eun Woo)

1648
01:06:47,076 --> 01:06:51,257
(Also in the second rented house, he's wearing his dignified pajamas.)

1649
01:06:52,157 --> 01:06:55,887
(Making his bed for his dignity's sake)

1650
01:06:58,226 --> 01:07:03,766
(Naturally, he makes Eun Woo's bed as well.)

1651
01:07:04,467 --> 01:07:08,507
(Meanwhile, Eun Woo has come outside.)

1652
01:07:10,766 --> 01:07:14,106
(Enjoying the refreshing morning air, )

1653
01:07:14,107 --> 01:07:18,447
(he stretches himself so satisfyingly.)

1654
01:07:19,447 --> 01:07:25,555
(Taking only a few steps out...)

1655
01:07:25,556 --> 01:07:28,826
(is enough to reach the front yard with the lake that holds the sky.)

1656
01:07:29,027 --> 01:07:30,027
Are they still asleep?

1657
01:07:32,197 --> 01:07:35,395
(Now, he naturally reaches out...)

1658
01:07:35,396 --> 01:07:41,467
(for fresh morning berries.)

1659
01:07:45,306 --> 01:07:48,406
(Gently making eye contact)

1660
01:07:48,407 --> 01:07:51,345
(He's always willing to say hi.)

1661
01:07:51,346 --> 01:07:52,975
(Dong Yeon, Dong Hwi)

1662
01:07:52,976 --> 01:07:56,016
(He heads to his friend first.)

1663
01:07:56,746 --> 01:08:00,955
(Has he managed to get through the cold overnight?)

1664
01:08:00,956 --> 01:08:02,626
(Grinning)

1665
01:08:04,027 --> 01:08:05,027
Dong Yeon.

1666
01:08:05,028 --> 01:08:08,196
(Whispering)

1667
01:08:08,197 --> 01:08:09,197
Dong Yeon.

1668
01:08:13,737 --> 01:08:15,237
- Did you sleep well? - Yes.

1669
01:08:17,067 --> 01:08:18,407
Gosh. Hey, my back feels weird.

1670
01:08:21,247 --> 01:08:22,576
- Are you alive in there? - Yes.

1671
01:08:22,577 --> 01:08:24,475
(He smiles out of relief to know that his friend is safe.)

1672
01:08:24,476 --> 01:08:25,947
- I'll remove the cover. - Okay.

1673
01:08:27,447 --> 01:08:30,446
(He removes the water cape from the tent.)

1674
01:08:30,447 --> 01:08:32,817
(Groaning)

1675
01:08:33,716 --> 01:08:36,327
(Look at his hair.)

1676
01:08:38,396 --> 01:08:42,167
(He wakes up with his hair all messy.)

1677
01:08:44,436 --> 01:08:45,567
That's a cool hairstyle.

1678
01:08:46,796 --> 01:08:48,607
- You must've visited a hair salon. - Yes.

1679
01:08:51,537 --> 01:08:52,577
How do I go down?

1680
01:08:53,006 --> 01:08:55,607
- I'll hold you. - Guys, are you okay?

1681
01:08:56,277 --> 01:08:57,277
(He's too lost to answer.)

1682
01:08:57,277 --> 01:08:58,277
Are you alive?

1683
01:09:02,016 --> 01:09:03,947
They should've just slept inside.

1684
01:09:04,256 --> 01:09:06,886
(It's too late now.)

1685
01:09:08,426 --> 01:09:14,726
(He washes the dishes after throwing a late remark.)

1686
01:09:15,367 --> 01:09:18,436
(Modest)

1687
01:09:19,266 --> 01:09:22,166
(He's used to washing the dishes with lake water now.)

1688
01:09:22,167 --> 01:09:23,927
I'm impressed that you slept in those tents.

1689
01:09:24,936 --> 01:09:26,036
Can you pull it once?

1690
01:09:26,037 --> 01:09:29,976
(Crying)

1691
01:09:30,777 --> 01:09:35,287
(His poor friend can't even come out from the sleeping bag alone.)

1692
01:09:37,117 --> 01:09:40,857
(How did I fall asleep?)

1693
01:09:42,386 --> 01:09:43,386
(Giving him a sudden hug)

1694
01:09:43,387 --> 01:09:47,497
(It must've been tough, my friend.)

1695
01:09:50,567 --> 01:09:52,596
It shook too much.

1696
01:09:53,596 --> 01:09:54,765
That's the fun of it.

1697
01:09:54,766 --> 01:09:56,526
(That's the fun of sleeping in a tree tent.)

1698
01:09:56,636 --> 01:09:59,077
Be careful of the log.

1699
01:09:59,537 --> 01:10:01,276
(Eun Woo is mean, but sweet.)

1700
01:10:01,277 --> 01:10:03,197
- Should I put your shoes here? - No, it's fine.

1701
01:10:05,646 --> 01:10:07,416
(Acting like...)

1702
01:10:07,417 --> 01:10:10,146
(he didn't mean to help)

1703
01:10:10,917 --> 01:10:12,816
Wasn't it nice to sleep with nature?

1704
01:10:12,817 --> 01:10:14,556
It was a little humid.

1705
01:10:14,586 --> 01:10:16,186
I kept hearing mosquitoes.

1706
01:10:16,386 --> 01:10:17,426
You have a good hearing.

1707
01:10:17,556 --> 01:10:18,657
I see you had a good night.

1708
01:10:18,957 --> 01:10:21,366
- It was great. - I bet.

1709
01:10:21,367 --> 01:10:22,426
Win today.

1710
01:10:23,567 --> 01:10:24,635
(Sighing)

1711
01:10:24,636 --> 01:10:27,567
- You're too heartless. - What?

1712
01:10:29,136 --> 01:10:30,576
Wait here. I'll go wake Dong Hwi up.

1713
01:10:33,506 --> 01:10:35,306
(Staggering)

1714
01:10:35,447 --> 01:10:37,976
(It's not easy to live in Lapland.)

1715
01:10:41,346 --> 01:10:42,386
Are you okay?

1716
01:10:42,947 --> 01:10:44,086
You're still alive?

1717
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:45,917
I'm not sure.

1718
01:10:46,487 --> 01:10:47,657
It must've been hard.

1719
01:10:48,487 --> 01:10:49,725
You went through a lot.

1720
01:10:49,726 --> 01:10:50,786
(Tearing up to hear a warm word)

1721
01:10:50,787 --> 01:10:52,556
It was so cold out there.

1722
01:10:55,096 --> 01:10:56,265
Get some rest.

1723
01:10:56,266 --> 01:10:59,037
(He's about to melt his body in the warm rented house.)

1724
01:10:59,237 --> 01:11:01,537
- Dong Yeon, how do I boil water? - Yes?

1725
01:11:01,867 --> 01:11:03,066
(Calling him for help only after 3 seconds)

1726
01:11:03,067 --> 01:11:04,136
How can I start the fire?

1727
01:11:06,777 --> 01:11:08,277
Well...

1728
01:11:08,777 --> 01:11:09,976
Isn't this right?

1729
01:11:10,607 --> 01:11:11,675
Isn't this the right way?

1730
01:11:11,676 --> 01:11:13,675
(He still has a lot to learn.)

1731
01:11:13,676 --> 01:11:14,886
- And... - And...

1732
01:11:15,617 --> 01:11:18,055
Okay. Thank you.

1733
01:11:18,056 --> 01:11:19,956
(At least, he's a good learner.)

1734
01:11:19,957 --> 01:11:20,987
It's cold.

1735
01:11:21,256 --> 01:11:22,357
Get some rest.

1736
01:11:23,556 --> 01:11:26,256
Let's have a simple breakfast...

1737
01:11:26,396 --> 01:11:29,496
- with cereal and stuff. - And the pie from yesterday.

1738
01:11:29,497 --> 01:11:30,527
Right.

1739
01:11:33,266 --> 01:11:34,536
(Je Hoon doesn't give him a break in many ways.)

1740
01:11:34,537 --> 01:11:35,707
Whose backpack is this?

1741
01:11:36,707 --> 01:11:38,136
- Dong Hwi. - I almost tripped.

1742
01:11:39,377 --> 01:11:40,676
That surprised me.

1743
01:11:42,077 --> 01:11:43,707
I wonder if Dong Hwi has survived.

1744
01:11:46,247 --> 01:11:47,276
Is he alive?

1745
01:11:47,277 --> 01:11:49,397
(The younger members are worried about the city boy.)

1746
01:11:50,016 --> 01:11:52,917
(He fell asleep with his shoes on.)

1747
01:11:54,827 --> 01:11:55,857
His feet are here.

1748
01:11:59,426 --> 01:12:02,196
(Meeting his face)

1749
01:12:02,197 --> 01:12:03,266
Dong Hwi.

1750
01:12:06,667 --> 01:12:07,867
Dong Hwi.

1751
01:12:09,567 --> 01:12:11,036
(He grins suspiciously...)

1752
01:12:11,037 --> 01:12:13,136
(and goes under the tent.)

1753
01:12:14,436 --> 01:12:16,707
(Getting his weapon ready)

1754
01:12:17,707 --> 01:12:20,176
(What a playful alarm that's so like him.)

1755
01:12:21,546 --> 01:12:24,986
(Eun Woo's favorite target gets teased as soon as he wakes up.)

1756
01:12:24,987 --> 01:12:26,656
(It turns out that yesterday...)

1757
01:12:26,657 --> 01:12:29,186
It looked perfect to give a wedgie.

1758
01:12:29,957 --> 01:12:31,656
(This is why one should always watch their mouth.)

1759
01:12:31,657 --> 01:12:32,796
Who is it?

1760
01:12:33,426 --> 01:12:34,896
It's me, Je Hoon.

1761
01:12:35,527 --> 01:12:37,266
Knock it off, Eun Woo.

1762
01:12:39,966 --> 01:12:41,336
Gosh, how did I fall asleep?

1763
01:12:41,636 --> 01:12:44,676
Dong Hwi, it may be a little blinding.

1764
01:12:45,676 --> 01:12:48,476
(Look, the sky has become bright.)

1765
01:12:48,877 --> 01:12:50,946
(Thump)

1766
01:12:50,947 --> 01:12:53,317
(He smirks to receive a fussy morning greeting.)

1767
01:12:53,976 --> 01:12:56,185
(The other tent sleeper suddenly shows up at that time.)

1768
01:12:56,186 --> 01:12:57,345
Goodness.

1769
01:12:57,346 --> 01:12:59,357
(Shaking the tent up and down)

1770
01:13:00,617 --> 01:13:04,556
(The younger members sure love him so much.)

1771
01:13:05,226 --> 01:13:08,166
(He finally escapes from the mid-air rented tent.)

1772
01:13:08,167 --> 01:13:10,367
(Cracking up)

1773
01:13:11,596 --> 01:13:13,237
Why would you take off your pants?

1774
01:13:13,836 --> 01:13:15,266
(Embarrassed)

1775
01:13:15,466 --> 01:13:18,305
Hold on. My body wouldn't move.

1776
01:13:18,306 --> 01:13:19,412
(What a heartbreaking morning greeting.)

1777
01:13:19,436 --> 01:13:20,475
Hold me.

1778
01:13:20,476 --> 01:13:24,077
(Let's hurry inside to warm up.)

1779
01:13:25,447 --> 01:13:27,716
Gosh, look who this is.

1780
01:13:27,917 --> 01:13:30,317
Hey, I slept with this on in case I'd be swept away.

1781
01:13:31,016 --> 01:13:32,117
Good job.

1782
01:13:32,357 --> 01:13:33,657
It must've been tough.

1783
01:13:34,256 --> 01:13:35,586
- Boss. - You're impressive.

1784
01:13:35,686 --> 01:13:38,656
Boss, I almost got killed.

1785
01:13:38,657 --> 01:13:40,127
Hurry inside and get some rest.

1786
01:13:41,266 --> 01:13:42,326
Rest.

1787
01:13:42,327 --> 01:13:44,367
(Dashing to the lake)

1788
01:13:44,396 --> 01:13:45,636
How impressive.

1789
01:13:45,966 --> 01:13:50,006
(Washing the dishes with lake water for many times already)

1790
01:13:51,136 --> 01:13:52,276
(The eldest member set the table neatly for breakfast.)

1791
01:13:52,277 --> 01:13:53,277
What is this?

1792
01:13:53,636 --> 01:13:54,806
- Wait. - Je Hoon...

1793
01:13:55,176 --> 01:13:56,277
did this.

1794
01:13:58,877 --> 01:14:02,146
Get some cereal for yourselves.

1795
01:14:03,617 --> 01:14:05,656
(Today's breakfast is the cereal bought at the mart.)

1796
01:14:05,657 --> 01:14:06,917
Isn't this pie wonderful?

1797
01:14:07,957 --> 01:14:11,357
(And the blackcurrant pie given by Marketa)

1798
01:14:12,527 --> 01:14:14,626
She gave us this pie yesterday.

1799
01:14:14,627 --> 01:14:17,067
(The pie was carefully made with berries she picked herself.)

1800
01:14:17,697 --> 01:14:20,435
And she gave us this custard cream...

1801
01:14:20,436 --> 01:14:21,766
along with the pie.

1802
01:14:21,907 --> 01:14:23,907
Apparently, it's a traditional way in Finland...

1803
01:14:24,136 --> 01:14:26,907
- to have a pie with cream on top. - Oh, really?

1804
01:14:27,907 --> 01:14:32,046
(People have pies with various kinds of cream on top in Lapland.)

1805
01:14:33,216 --> 01:14:35,947
(Delicious pies topped with cream?)

1806
01:14:36,646 --> 01:14:39,817
(It's beautifully delicious.)

1807
01:14:40,516 --> 01:14:41,627
Let me help you.

1808
01:14:42,726 --> 01:14:46,356
(The eldest member spreads the cream himself for the others.)

1809
01:14:46,357 --> 01:14:48,066
I'll get you some on the side then.

1810
01:14:48,067 --> 01:14:49,166
I'd love that.

1811
01:14:49,167 --> 01:14:50,866
I just tried smelling it.

1812
01:14:50,867 --> 01:14:52,037
It's like ice cream.

1813
01:14:52,067 --> 01:14:53,266
It smells so good.

1814
01:14:53,367 --> 01:14:54,765
Let me try the pie.

1815
01:14:54,766 --> 01:14:57,906
(A bite of the pie and cream made by the landlady)

1816
01:14:57,907 --> 01:14:59,277
(Fantastic)

1817
01:14:59,306 --> 01:15:00,577
How is it?

1818
01:15:00,707 --> 01:15:01,947
It's good.

1819
01:15:02,247 --> 01:15:03,487
- Is it good? - It's delicious.

1820
01:15:03,607 --> 01:15:04,817
This is real.

1821
01:15:05,976 --> 01:15:07,276
This is a real deal.

1822
01:15:07,277 --> 01:15:09,223
(Berries picked in the front yard are very fresh as always.)

1823
01:15:09,247 --> 01:15:10,947
(Rushing)

1824
01:15:11,287 --> 01:15:12,417
The pie is so good.

1825
01:15:12,787 --> 01:15:13,957
This cream is amazing.

1826
01:15:14,056 --> 01:15:15,126
- Is it? - Yes.

1827
01:15:15,127 --> 01:15:16,286
(The eldest member belatedly takes a mouthful.)

1828
01:15:16,287 --> 01:15:17,357
It's to die for.

1829
01:15:19,296 --> 01:15:21,567
- Oh, my gosh. - It totally suits my palate.

1830
01:15:23,697 --> 01:15:25,636
This custard cream is crazy.

1831
01:15:25,697 --> 01:15:26,796
- It's crazy, right? - Yes.

1832
01:15:27,336 --> 01:15:28,336
This is good.

1833
01:15:29,436 --> 01:15:31,276
Anyway, did you sleep with a life jacket on...

1834
01:15:32,077 --> 01:15:34,306
- in case you'd be swept away? - Yes.

1835
01:15:34,537 --> 01:15:35,646
And it kept me warm.

1836
01:15:36,146 --> 01:15:37,577
(Giggling)

1837
01:15:37,676 --> 01:15:39,645
I'm thinking of wearing it even when I sleep at home.

1838
01:15:39,646 --> 01:15:41,046
- You mean, the life jacket? - Yes.

1839
01:15:41,317 --> 01:15:43,016
I can do anything to make you laugh.

1840
01:15:43,646 --> 01:15:46,286
(All of a sudden, )

1841
01:15:46,287 --> 01:15:48,725
(they sing "All for You" together.)

1842
01:15:48,726 --> 01:15:50,827
Does anyone want a cup of coffee?

1843
01:15:51,357 --> 01:15:52,527
Me.

1844
01:15:53,096 --> 01:15:55,367
- I'd always say yes to your coffee. - Thanks.

1845
01:15:55,527 --> 01:15:56,826
Enjoy.

1846
01:15:56,827 --> 01:15:58,765
- Thank you. - Thanks, Je Hoon.

1847
01:15:58,766 --> 01:15:59,766
(The eldest serves them a full-course breakfast.)

1848
01:15:59,767 --> 01:16:01,607
The Dong-Dong Couple.

1849
01:16:02,107 --> 01:16:03,406
You went through so much...

1850
01:16:03,407 --> 01:16:04,675
- for sleeping in the tent. - Gosh, no.

1851
01:16:04,676 --> 01:16:06,316
Thank you for acknowledging our hardship.

1852
01:16:06,877 --> 01:16:08,306
- You know, - Yes?

1853
01:16:08,707 --> 01:16:10,447
Seeing the same people...

1854
01:16:11,277 --> 01:16:13,747
- every morning... - Yes?

1855
01:16:14,617 --> 01:16:15,747
Makes me feel so flustered.

1856
01:16:16,546 --> 01:16:17,986
Oh, it doesn't feel nice? You feel flustered?

1857
01:16:17,987 --> 01:16:19,786
Well, so far, I feel flustered.

1858
01:16:19,787 --> 01:16:20,816
(Only child Dong Hwi's honest confession)

1859
01:16:20,817 --> 01:16:21,986
I love this, though.

1860
01:16:21,987 --> 01:16:23,556
Waking up without an alarm.

1861
01:16:23,787 --> 01:16:24,795
(Totally agree)

1862
01:16:24,796 --> 01:16:26,456
Do you know the only time...

1863
01:16:26,457 --> 01:16:28,567
- when the alarm goes off here? - When?

1864
01:16:28,827 --> 01:16:30,027
When Dong Yeon cooks.

1865
01:16:31,667 --> 01:16:34,436
(The only time that a phone rings while living in their rented room)

1866
01:16:34,537 --> 01:16:37,536
This is just my personal opinion,

1867
01:16:37,537 --> 01:16:39,636
but I kind of hope...

1868
01:16:39,676 --> 01:16:42,377
- that phones would get downgraded. - Me too.

1869
01:16:42,676 --> 01:16:43,946
That way,

1870
01:16:43,947 --> 01:16:46,746
we would talk more amongst ourselves.

1871
01:16:46,747 --> 01:16:49,086
If we had met on a drama set,

1872
01:16:49,247 --> 01:16:53,986
it would've been hard for us to get this comfortable and close...

1873
01:16:53,987 --> 01:16:55,886
- with each other. - Right.

1874
01:16:58,726 --> 01:17:04,836
(Being together where obvious things no longer existed, )

1875
01:17:06,997 --> 01:17:10,935
(they found joy in unexpected places.)

1876
01:17:10,936 --> 01:17:12,935
Honestly, since it feels like...

1877
01:17:12,936 --> 01:17:15,476
we don't need to use our phones here...

1878
01:17:16,346 --> 01:17:18,816
I mean, there's so much to see here.

1879
01:17:18,817 --> 01:17:20,376
(They were busy seeing a bigger world outside of a small screen.)

1880
01:17:20,377 --> 01:17:24,215
- Moments like this are rare. - Right.

1881
01:17:24,216 --> 01:17:25,956
But should we get ready now?

1882
01:17:25,957 --> 01:17:27,385
If we're to get going...

1883
01:17:27,386 --> 01:17:29,526
- Oh, shall we? - All right.

1884
01:17:29,527 --> 01:17:31,385
- Okay. Let's go. - Thank you for the food.

1885
01:17:31,386 --> 01:17:32,857
Leave it. I'll clean it up.

1886
01:17:33,556 --> 01:17:36,627
Make sure to check if you left anything behind.

1887
01:17:37,567 --> 01:17:39,036
- Let's go. - Yes, sir.

1888
01:17:39,037 --> 01:17:40,395
I'll get going now.

1889
01:17:40,396 --> 01:17:41,536
Yes, sir.

1890
01:17:41,537 --> 01:17:44,335
It suddenly rained a lot yesterday,

1891
01:17:44,336 --> 01:17:46,806
- but the weather is so nice today. - That's good.

1892
01:17:50,046 --> 01:17:52,617
This keeps... What is this?

1893
01:17:52,716 --> 01:17:54,246
How many huskies will there be?

1894
01:17:54,247 --> 01:17:55,817
(How many huskies will there be?)

1895
01:17:55,886 --> 01:17:57,546
Don't huskies also...

1896
01:17:58,016 --> 01:18:00,256
work as sled dogs?

1897
01:18:00,357 --> 01:18:01,827
Sled dogs?

1898
01:18:02,056 --> 01:18:03,725
- Am I wrong? When I was little... - I'm sure they do.

1899
01:18:03,726 --> 01:18:04,857
- Right? - Yes.

1900
01:18:06,197 --> 01:18:08,167
I'm really looking forward to this.

1901
01:18:08,226 --> 01:18:09,326
I'm curious.

1902
01:18:09,327 --> 01:18:10,727
(What will we do with the huskies?)

1903
01:18:11,067 --> 01:18:12,335
(Now that I think about it...)

1904
01:18:12,336 --> 01:18:13,435
I...

1905
01:18:13,436 --> 01:18:15,866
I brought my running clothes for when the weather is nice,

1906
01:18:15,867 --> 01:18:17,906
- but I feel so embarrassed. - Hey.

1907
01:18:17,907 --> 01:18:19,936
- I feel so... Yes? - Dong Yeon.

1908
01:18:20,476 --> 01:18:23,077
- I didn't know it'd be like this. - Yes?

1909
01:18:23,676 --> 01:18:25,046
I brought lots of cool clothes.

1910
01:18:25,146 --> 01:18:26,746
(His running clothes can't compete.)

1911
01:18:26,747 --> 01:18:28,447
My personal...

1912
01:18:28,846 --> 01:18:33,715
You know, my outfits that I think would look good in pictures?

1913
01:18:33,716 --> 01:18:35,103
(He was all ready to show himself off.)

1914
01:18:35,127 --> 01:18:36,787
I haven't worn any of them.

1915
01:18:37,157 --> 01:18:38,997
Doesn't it feel like you wasted money on that?

1916
01:18:39,697 --> 01:18:43,697
(Being fashionable in a rented room in the countryside is extravagant.)

1917
01:18:43,867 --> 01:18:46,066
I used to work out every day...

1918
01:18:46,067 --> 01:18:50,867
for like 2 or 2.5 hours.

1919
01:18:51,136 --> 01:18:53,636
But here, I'm not exercising at all.

1920
01:18:53,777 --> 01:18:55,246
I feel a little guilty,

1921
01:18:55,247 --> 01:18:58,616
but when I lie down with that guilt,

1922
01:18:58,617 --> 01:19:01,377
- I have no energy left. - Right.

1923
01:19:02,447 --> 01:19:03,845
(Life in Lapland is a workout itself.)

1924
01:19:03,846 --> 01:19:05,486
(Fetching water, chopping firewood, )

1925
01:19:05,487 --> 01:19:07,687
(starting a fire, fishing, pitching a tent and more...)

1926
01:19:07,756 --> 01:19:10,185
The road looks so pretty.

1927
01:19:10,186 --> 01:19:11,457
- Isn't it beautiful? - Yes.

1928
01:19:11,796 --> 01:19:14,656
I'm fascinated by the trees in Northern Europe.

1929
01:19:14,657 --> 01:19:16,895
- I'm amazed whenever I see them. - They're so pretty.

1930
01:19:16,896 --> 01:19:19,256
(The city boys still feel a novelty from the grand nature.)

1931
01:19:20,896 --> 01:19:22,536
"Nordic..." Hey, Je Hoon.

1932
01:19:22,537 --> 01:19:24,536
There was a picture of a dog's paw back there.

1933
01:19:24,537 --> 01:19:25,636
- Really? - Yes.

1934
01:19:26,407 --> 01:19:27,676
We're almost there.

1935
01:19:27,737 --> 01:19:29,947
- Are we already there? - Yes, almost.

1936
01:19:32,046 --> 01:19:33,216
Oh, I think...

1937
01:19:34,277 --> 01:19:35,715
- I see dog houses... - Already?

1938
01:19:35,716 --> 01:19:36,885
(Dog houses?)

1939
01:19:36,886 --> 01:19:38,255
(Barking)

1940
01:19:38,256 --> 01:19:39,416
They're barking.

1941
01:19:39,417 --> 01:19:42,827
(The huskies' barks get clearer.)

1942
01:19:44,527 --> 01:19:45,697
I saw one.

1943
01:19:47,926 --> 01:19:49,627
- Let's go inside. - Is it this way?

1944
01:19:50,926 --> 01:19:55,067
(5 seconds until they meet the huskies)

1945
01:19:57,966 --> 01:19:59,606
Is that a husky?

1946
01:19:59,607 --> 01:20:01,053
(We're looking after those huge dogs?)

1947
01:20:01,077 --> 01:20:02,475
There are malamutes too.

1948
01:20:02,476 --> 01:20:04,556
I've never seen anything like them in my whole life.

1949
01:20:05,146 --> 01:20:06,247
Gosh, the dogs...

1950
01:20:06,646 --> 01:20:07,845
(They arrive at the husky house, feeling half excited, half worried.)

1951
01:20:07,846 --> 01:20:10,947
Gosh, is that a husky?

1952
01:20:13,556 --> 01:20:16,086
(With piercing blue eyes...)

1953
01:20:17,556 --> 01:20:18,725
(Charismatic...)

1954
01:20:18,726 --> 01:20:21,197
(huskies)

1955
01:20:22,226 --> 01:20:23,526
Gosh, so pretty.

1956
01:20:23,527 --> 01:20:25,395
- I know, right? - What do I do?

1957
01:20:25,396 --> 01:20:26,796
(They're full of unexpected charm.)

1958
01:20:26,836 --> 01:20:28,706
(They're playful...)

1959
01:20:28,707 --> 01:20:29,906
So cute.

1960
01:20:29,907 --> 01:20:31,236
The dogs seem so happy.

1961
01:20:31,237 --> 01:20:32,707
(And full of energy)

1962
01:20:33,077 --> 01:20:37,146
(About 30 huskies live here.)

1963
01:20:39,146 --> 01:20:42,386
(Husky House)

1964
01:20:43,016 --> 01:20:46,716
(When winter comes to the Husky House, )

1965
01:20:47,086 --> 01:20:51,327
(the huskies run across the snowy fields.)

1966
01:20:51,726 --> 01:20:54,255
(They run up to 200km on the snowy fields, )

1967
01:20:54,256 --> 01:20:56,796
(equivalent to the distance from Seoul to Gangneung.)

1968
01:20:57,226 --> 01:21:00,435
(Lapland life: Huskies transport people and supplies, )

1969
01:21:00,436 --> 01:21:03,407
(offering great help during the winter.)

1970
01:21:03,907 --> 01:21:06,635
(For the people of Lapland, huskies are...)

1971
01:21:06,636 --> 01:21:11,947
(not just animals but life companions.)

1972
01:21:12,676 --> 01:21:15,715
(Just as they receive lots of help from huskies in the winter, )

1973
01:21:15,716 --> 01:21:18,787
(they spend their summers taking care of the huskies.)

1974
01:21:19,657 --> 01:21:22,585
(Lapland life: During the summer, people take the huskies hiking, )

1975
01:21:22,586 --> 01:21:25,626
(swimming, and grooming their fur...)

1976
01:21:25,627 --> 01:21:28,896
(to spend their time together.)

1977
01:21:29,527 --> 01:21:33,966
(Hiking is especially important for Lapland dog owners in the summer...)

1978
01:21:34,396 --> 01:21:39,537
(to let the huskies release their overflowing energy.)

1979
01:21:39,836 --> 01:21:40,876
Come.

1980
01:21:40,877 --> 01:21:42,946
(Today, the Renters will join in on the locals' daily life!)

1981
01:21:42,947 --> 01:21:44,107
Hey!

1982
01:21:44,676 --> 01:21:46,746
(We're here to help out.)

1983
01:21:46,747 --> 01:21:48,246
- Hello. - Hello.

1984
01:21:48,247 --> 01:21:50,417
(Hi, there.)

1985
01:21:50,846 --> 01:21:54,157
(The huskies recognize their playmates.)

1986
01:21:54,357 --> 01:21:56,857
- Hello. - Hello.

1987
01:21:56,957 --> 01:21:58,425
- I'm Mailys. - Mailys?

1988
01:21:58,426 --> 01:22:00,425
- I'm Je Hoon. - How do you say that?

1989
01:22:00,426 --> 01:22:01,866
- Je Hoon. - Je Hoon.

1990
01:22:01,867 --> 01:22:03,395
- Okay. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

1991
01:22:03,396 --> 01:22:05,636
So, I'm from France.

1992
01:22:05,697 --> 01:22:07,295
- Oh, really? - I came... Yes.

1993
01:22:07,296 --> 01:22:08,965
- Bonjour. - Bonjour.

1994
01:22:08,966 --> 01:22:10,406
How are you?

1995
01:22:10,407 --> 01:22:11,505
That's about it.

1996
01:22:11,506 --> 01:22:13,106
(Their conversation ended very quickly.)

1997
01:22:14,306 --> 01:22:18,106
I moved here with my husband...

1998
01:22:18,107 --> 01:22:20,346
about six and a half years ago to Lapland.

1999
01:22:20,646 --> 01:22:23,845
And we have been living here for three years.

2000
01:22:23,846 --> 01:22:25,686
About three years. Yes.

2001
01:22:26,056 --> 01:22:28,686
And we have sled dog farms.

2002
01:22:29,027 --> 01:22:30,226
Baiko.

2003
01:22:31,957 --> 01:22:34,197
(Here comes Baiko.)

2004
01:22:34,657 --> 01:22:38,166
(They're all in awe.)

2005
01:22:38,167 --> 01:22:39,435
His eyes.

2006
01:22:39,436 --> 01:22:41,095
- This is Baiko. - Baiko.

2007
01:22:41,096 --> 01:22:42,906
He's a Yakutian Laika.

2008
01:22:42,907 --> 01:22:45,027
(Baiko: male, Yakutian Laika, a hunting and sled dog)

2009
01:22:45,207 --> 01:22:47,876
Yes, kind of like a little wolf.

2010
01:22:47,877 --> 01:22:49,276
- Yes. - Right.

2011
01:22:49,277 --> 01:22:50,907
(That's unique.)

2012
01:22:51,006 --> 01:22:52,176
- Yes. - You can pet him.

2013
01:22:54,447 --> 01:22:57,416
(Dongdong's owner pets him with ease.)

2014
01:22:57,417 --> 01:22:59,157
So, Baiko is a boy, actually.

2015
01:22:59,386 --> 01:23:00,786
- Baiko. - And she's a girl.

2016
01:23:00,787 --> 01:23:02,425
(The cat owner is a little nervous.)

2017
01:23:02,426 --> 01:23:03,585
Baiko.

2018
01:23:03,586 --> 01:23:06,395
- Baiko. - Oh, you're so cute.

2019
01:23:06,396 --> 01:23:07,457
(Petting him carefully)

2020
01:23:07,756 --> 01:23:08,925
So cute.

2021
01:23:08,926 --> 01:23:11,067
(That feels nice.)

2022
01:23:11,497 --> 01:23:13,197
He's so adorable.

2023
01:23:14,067 --> 01:23:16,607
And Baiko is from Russia.

2024
01:23:17,037 --> 01:23:18,877
She came from Lithuania.

2025
01:23:20,006 --> 01:23:22,005
- And then... - You're from France.

2026
01:23:22,006 --> 01:23:23,406
I am from France.

2027
01:23:23,407 --> 01:23:26,877
And many others are from the Czech Republic...

2028
01:23:27,176 --> 01:23:29,786
This seems to be a multicultural family.

2029
01:23:29,787 --> 01:23:30,816
(Giggling)

2030
01:23:30,817 --> 01:23:32,816
- I think so. - So international.

2031
01:23:32,817 --> 01:23:35,926
So, maybe you can talk in your own language to the dog.

2032
01:23:36,056 --> 01:23:37,957
Maybe they will understand you.

2033
01:23:39,056 --> 01:23:40,656
You can try and call him.

2034
01:23:40,657 --> 01:23:42,225
- Baiko. - Baiko, come here.

2035
01:23:42,226 --> 01:23:43,395
(Baiko, come here.)

2036
01:23:43,396 --> 01:23:44,667
What? No way.

2037
01:23:45,396 --> 01:23:46,997
(Come here?)

2038
01:23:47,096 --> 01:23:48,666
Baiko, come here.

2039
01:23:48,667 --> 01:23:50,135
- Yes, you see? - Come here.

2040
01:23:50,136 --> 01:23:51,537
- He understands? - Yes.

2041
01:23:52,176 --> 01:23:55,806
- So, it's more the tone of voice. - Sit.

2042
01:23:56,447 --> 01:23:57,645
The tone of voice.

2043
01:23:57,646 --> 01:23:59,976
(The cat owner is simply fascinated.)

2044
01:24:00,417 --> 01:24:02,816
Wait. Sit.

2045
01:24:02,817 --> 01:24:04,747
There you go. Good job.

2046
01:24:05,146 --> 01:24:10,527
(He controls the dog with his low voice.)

2047
01:24:11,056 --> 01:24:12,156
Sit.

2048
01:24:12,157 --> 01:24:13,295
(With a sweet voice)

2049
01:24:13,296 --> 01:24:14,426
Sit.

2050
01:24:14,957 --> 01:24:18,667
(He's confused at the sweet command.)

2051
01:24:19,367 --> 01:24:20,497
Sit.

2052
01:24:20,737 --> 01:24:23,136
Paw.

2053
01:24:23,237 --> 01:24:24,607
Good job.

2054
01:24:25,537 --> 01:24:26,537
Nice.

2055
01:24:26,538 --> 01:24:28,037
(The dog parent is proud.)

2056
01:24:28,676 --> 01:24:29,906
(He gets a yummy treat.)

2057
01:24:29,907 --> 01:24:31,646
- Good job. - His eyes.

2058
01:24:32,247 --> 01:24:34,976
- Yes. - Kind of like a little wolf.

2059
01:24:35,077 --> 01:24:38,386
So, we have two here, and here, we have other dogs.

2060
01:24:38,857 --> 01:24:41,255
- So, do you want to say hello? - Yes, could we...

2061
01:24:41,256 --> 01:24:42,555
- Yes, sure. Let's go. - Okay.

2062
01:24:42,556 --> 01:24:44,787
- Let's say hello to some of them. - Yes.

2063
01:24:45,396 --> 01:24:46,457
Baiko.

2064
01:24:47,697 --> 01:24:49,366
Gosh, they look so cool.

2065
01:24:49,367 --> 01:24:51,603
(They get started on taking care of the huskies and helping out.)

2066
01:24:51,627 --> 01:24:54,095
- All of them look so happy. - Yes.

2067
01:24:54,096 --> 01:24:55,416
(Are you coming to play with us?)

2068
01:24:56,237 --> 01:24:59,206
(Welcome!)

2069
01:24:59,207 --> 01:25:00,907
- Let's go inside. - Okay.

2070
01:25:01,577 --> 01:25:02,706
- Are you good? - Yes, good.

2071
01:25:02,707 --> 01:25:04,046
All right. So...

2072
01:25:04,777 --> 01:25:06,016
Do we have to brace ourselves?

2073
01:25:06,716 --> 01:25:08,346
Continue.

2074
01:25:08,747 --> 01:25:10,185
(They carefully step inside.)

2075
01:25:10,186 --> 01:25:11,247
We can go.

2076
01:25:12,256 --> 01:25:13,317
Yes.

2077
01:25:13,917 --> 01:25:14,986
You can be...

2078
01:25:14,987 --> 01:25:16,925
(A rowdy welcome)

2079
01:25:16,926 --> 01:25:17,987
Yes.

2080
01:25:18,027 --> 01:25:21,027
(They bark to welcome you.)

2081
01:25:21,596 --> 01:25:23,766
The dogs seem so happy.

2082
01:25:24,167 --> 01:25:25,567
They look so happy.

2083
01:25:26,396 --> 01:25:27,835
Hello.

2084
01:25:27,836 --> 01:25:29,505
(Both people and animals in Lapland are the happiest in the world.)

2085
01:25:29,506 --> 01:25:31,787
Look how they're poking you with their noses to pet them.

2086
01:25:32,777 --> 01:25:35,675
I think it would be great to go on a walk with them.

2087
01:25:35,676 --> 01:25:38,036
(Precious beings that become shining lights for each other)

2088
01:25:38,617 --> 01:25:40,545
(They're best friends as soon as they meet.)

2089
01:25:40,546 --> 01:25:44,186
(The huskies are full of energy.)

2090
01:25:44,287 --> 01:25:47,856
So, your T-shirt is white. It will become brown at the end.

2091
01:25:47,857 --> 01:25:49,326
Yes, it's already happening.

2092
01:25:49,327 --> 01:25:51,156
I think you might prefer...

2093
01:25:51,157 --> 01:25:52,157
Oh, did you see?

2094
01:25:52,158 --> 01:25:53,958
(His shirt is already covered in paw prints.)

2095
01:25:54,157 --> 01:25:57,367
(He's slightly taken aback by their overflowing energy.)

2096
01:25:57,896 --> 01:25:59,036
(The dogs are so excited.)

2097
01:25:59,037 --> 01:26:00,096
Come here.

2098
01:26:00,567 --> 01:26:02,805
(Welcome, handsome guys.)

2099
01:26:02,806 --> 01:26:04,407
And then... Yelka!

2100
01:26:04,537 --> 01:26:05,576
Yelka?

2101
01:26:05,577 --> 01:26:06,877
(Yelka appears.)

2102
01:26:07,006 --> 01:26:08,907
Big Yelka. This is a girl.

2103
01:26:09,447 --> 01:26:12,646
And as you can see, she loses a lot of fur.

2104
01:26:13,747 --> 01:26:15,515
(Even Dongdong's owner is surprised by the ball of fur.)

2105
01:26:15,516 --> 01:26:17,045
She must shed really easily.

2106
01:26:17,046 --> 01:26:19,685
Is this currently the season...

2107
01:26:19,686 --> 01:26:22,226
- when they change their fur? - Yes.

2108
01:26:22,287 --> 01:26:25,396
So, the season has started for some of them.

2109
01:26:25,556 --> 01:26:27,255
Now, we are going to...

2110
01:26:27,256 --> 01:26:28,526
(Lapland life: Huskies are a breed that sheds a lot.)

2111
01:26:28,527 --> 01:26:30,465
Remove all this fur...

2112
01:26:30,466 --> 01:26:31,643
(You must maintain their fur by brushing them 2 to 3 times a week.)

2113
01:26:31,667 --> 01:26:33,265
- This fur. - Yes.

2114
01:26:33,266 --> 01:26:35,465
So you can bring some with you as souvenirs.

2115
01:26:35,466 --> 01:26:36,666
(There's something we can do!)

2116
01:26:36,737 --> 01:26:39,036
I'm used to it. My cat sheds this much too.

2117
01:26:39,037 --> 01:26:40,037
You can take that.

2118
01:26:40,277 --> 01:26:42,005
Okay.

2119
01:26:42,006 --> 01:26:44,877
(He brushes skillfully.)

2120
01:26:45,877 --> 01:26:49,216
(He's a seasoned veteran.)

2121
01:26:49,546 --> 01:26:50,645
Oh, that feels good.

2122
01:26:50,646 --> 01:26:52,986
(Stable and comfortable)

2123
01:26:52,987 --> 01:26:54,117
That feels good.

2124
01:26:55,756 --> 01:26:56,856
Doesn't that feel good?

2125
01:26:56,857 --> 01:27:00,457
(His many years of experience as a cat owner comes in handy.)

2126
01:27:01,357 --> 01:27:02,366
What is this?

2127
01:27:02,367 --> 01:27:04,027
Whose fur is this?

2128
01:27:04,926 --> 01:27:06,667
(Hush!)

2129
01:27:06,896 --> 01:27:08,806
Whose fur is this? It's Yelka's, right?

2130
01:27:09,207 --> 01:27:10,306
This.

2131
01:27:10,667 --> 01:27:12,236
How can you live if you shed this much?

2132
01:27:12,237 --> 01:27:13,505
(Yelka is confused.)

2133
01:27:13,506 --> 01:27:15,506
If you lose this much fur,

2134
01:27:15,777 --> 01:27:17,337
does it get on people's clothes or not?

2135
01:27:18,207 --> 01:27:19,376
It does.

2136
01:27:19,377 --> 01:27:20,817
So do you need to be brushed or not?

2137
01:27:22,016 --> 01:27:23,646
Of course you do. Right?

2138
01:27:23,987 --> 01:27:25,857
Look at this. Oh, no, you don't.

2139
01:27:26,256 --> 01:27:28,085
Sit down. No.

2140
01:27:28,086 --> 01:27:29,086
(She fails to escape.)

2141
01:27:29,087 --> 01:27:30,725
You're shedding this much. How can you not be brushed?

2142
01:27:30,726 --> 01:27:32,826
Is that a good dog or a bad dog?

2143
01:27:32,827 --> 01:27:33,925
(Someone save me.)

2144
01:27:33,926 --> 01:27:35,406
You have to get brushed first, right?

2145
01:27:36,426 --> 01:27:37,826
No.

2146
01:27:37,827 --> 01:27:39,036
(She attempts to run away again.)

2147
01:27:39,037 --> 01:27:41,067
Yelka!

2148
01:27:42,266 --> 01:27:45,135
Let's take all your fur.

2149
01:27:45,136 --> 01:27:46,452
(Being dragged back for the 2nd time)

2150
01:27:46,476 --> 01:27:48,746
You look so pretty.

2151
01:27:48,747 --> 01:27:49,976
(Just letting it all go)

2152
01:27:50,407 --> 01:27:52,515
You look so pretty, don't you?

2153
01:27:52,516 --> 01:27:54,516
(She's too beautiful for her own good.)

2154
01:27:55,216 --> 01:27:56,845
(Another pretty dog appears.)

2155
01:27:56,846 --> 01:27:57,886
Oh, that feels good.

2156
01:27:58,817 --> 01:27:59,916
That feels so good.

2157
01:27:59,917 --> 01:28:03,756
(A pretty one next to the pretty one)

2158
01:28:06,926 --> 01:28:08,827
Does that feel good? Yes, it does.

2159
01:28:09,567 --> 01:28:11,627
Does that feel good? Yes?

2160
01:28:12,796 --> 01:28:13,936
Je Hoon, look at this.

2161
01:28:14,237 --> 01:28:16,336
Look what happens when I brush here.

2162
01:28:16,407 --> 01:28:18,006
She closes her eyes.

2163
01:28:18,567 --> 01:28:20,136
- Oh, goodness. - Oh, my.

2164
01:28:20,237 --> 01:28:22,576
- Oh, that feels good. - She loves it so much.

2165
01:28:22,577 --> 01:28:23,646
(I feel great.)

2166
01:28:23,676 --> 01:28:27,247
(I'm having even more fun.)

2167
01:28:28,216 --> 01:28:33,317
(The goofy guy's happiness levels are on the rise.)

2168
01:28:34,256 --> 01:28:37,857
(The dog is busy playing with Je Hoon.)

2169
01:28:39,226 --> 01:28:42,266
(He's really connecting with the dogs.)

2170
01:28:42,396 --> 01:28:43,425
Hey.

2171
01:28:43,426 --> 01:28:45,566
(What a talented guy.)

2172
01:28:45,567 --> 01:28:47,636
Oh, my. Does that feel good?

2173
01:28:47,766 --> 01:28:50,966
And we're going for a short hike.

2174
01:28:51,037 --> 01:28:52,636
- Okay? - Oh, yes, sure.

2175
01:28:52,707 --> 01:28:54,005
So, harness.

2176
01:28:54,006 --> 01:28:55,606
(A necessary course to release the dogs' energy, hiking)

2177
01:28:55,607 --> 01:28:56,706
Oh, that's how you put it on.

2178
01:28:56,707 --> 01:29:00,546
They know how to put on the harness, usually, so it's really easy.

2179
01:29:02,186 --> 01:29:04,345
(Staying calm at the thought of going on a walk)

2180
01:29:04,346 --> 01:29:05,417
Okay.

2181
01:29:05,586 --> 01:29:08,457
So, you have Skeef.

2182
01:29:08,556 --> 01:29:09,626
- Skeef. - Skeef.

2183
01:29:09,627 --> 01:29:12,196
- So, you put this through the ring. - Skeef.

2184
01:29:12,197 --> 01:29:13,402
(Hiking mates: Dong Hwi and Skeef)

2185
01:29:13,426 --> 01:29:14,857
Skeef?

2186
01:29:15,497 --> 01:29:17,466
Skeef?

2187
01:29:18,867 --> 01:29:21,796
(They're still getting to know each other.)

2188
01:29:22,067 --> 01:29:23,737
Skeef is just skipping my commands.

2189
01:29:25,266 --> 01:29:26,676
- Skeef is? - Skeef.

2190
01:29:27,176 --> 01:29:28,176
Skeef.

2191
01:29:28,177 --> 01:29:30,806
(Let's skip over this awkward phase.)

2192
01:29:31,247 --> 01:29:33,917
(Exclaiming)

2193
01:29:37,646 --> 01:29:38,715
She's showing her belly.

2194
01:29:38,716 --> 01:29:40,386
(Lying back)

2195
01:29:41,157 --> 01:29:42,157
Miyuki.

2196
01:29:42,158 --> 01:29:45,256
(Exploding with cuteness at Eun Woo's touch)

2197
01:29:45,596 --> 01:29:46,656
You need to stop.

2198
01:29:46,657 --> 01:29:49,067
Otherwise, she will be like this the whole time.

2199
01:29:49,426 --> 01:29:50,965
Actually, you're going to take her.

2200
01:29:50,966 --> 01:29:52,295
- Yes, I'll take her. - Yes.

2201
01:29:52,296 --> 01:29:54,497
Miyuki.

2202
01:29:54,636 --> 01:29:57,067
And of course, you have Yelka.

2203
01:29:57,167 --> 01:29:59,005
Yelka.

2204
01:29:59,006 --> 01:30:01,536
And you're going to have Sakha.

2205
01:30:01,537 --> 01:30:02,546
Sakha.

2206
01:30:03,207 --> 01:30:04,946
- So, are you good? - Yes, good.

2207
01:30:04,947 --> 01:30:06,715
- Are you ready to go? - Yes, good.

2208
01:30:06,716 --> 01:30:08,476
Okay, take your dogs.

2209
01:30:08,646 --> 01:30:10,817
- Hold your dogs. - Skeef.

2210
01:30:11,716 --> 01:30:13,317
- Skeef. - And go.

2211
01:30:13,817 --> 01:30:15,385
- Dong Hwi. - Go.

2212
01:30:15,386 --> 01:30:16,425
(Yelping to go faster)

2213
01:30:16,426 --> 01:30:17,487
Go.

2214
01:30:18,756 --> 01:30:22,426
(They're getting worked up because they want to go faster.)

2215
01:30:22,667 --> 01:30:24,725
Skeef.

2216
01:30:24,726 --> 01:30:25,965
(Making a ruckus)

2217
01:30:25,966 --> 01:30:27,037
Yelka.

2218
01:30:28,367 --> 01:30:30,466
(The cat owner has never heard this sound before.)

2219
01:30:31,306 --> 01:30:32,335
Oh, dear.

2220
01:30:32,336 --> 01:30:33,576
(Being dragged along)

2221
01:30:33,577 --> 01:30:34,706
You want to run.

2222
01:30:34,707 --> 01:30:36,045
What do I do? He's going wherever he wants.

2223
01:30:36,046 --> 01:30:37,046
Why...

2224
01:30:37,077 --> 01:30:38,806
Wait! Wait here!

2225
01:30:38,877 --> 01:30:39,946
Yelka.

2226
01:30:39,947 --> 01:30:41,015
Skeef.

2227
01:30:41,016 --> 01:30:42,645
- Yelka. - Skeef.

2228
01:30:42,646 --> 01:30:43,845
- Skeef! - Miyu.

2229
01:30:43,846 --> 01:30:45,117
Sakha.

2230
01:30:45,386 --> 01:30:48,657
(Totally chaotic)

2231
01:30:49,426 --> 01:30:50,956
(They haven't taken that many steps yet.)

2232
01:30:50,957 --> 01:30:51,987
Sakha!

2233
01:30:53,497 --> 01:30:54,856
Miyu.

2234
01:30:54,857 --> 01:30:56,626
(They already feel drained.)

2235
01:30:56,627 --> 01:30:59,135
Eun Woo's dog was...

2236
01:30:59,136 --> 01:31:01,372
the one that showed her belly and was so gentle with him earlier.

2237
01:31:01,396 --> 01:31:02,707
But all of a sudden...

2238
01:31:03,167 --> 01:31:04,806
Miyu.

2239
01:31:06,537 --> 01:31:09,506
- So much can happen with animals. - Miyu.

2240
01:31:09,846 --> 01:31:10,907
It's okay.

2241
01:31:13,317 --> 01:31:16,345
So, we'll try to walk slowly.

2242
01:31:16,346 --> 01:31:17,417
Slowly.

2243
01:31:17,646 --> 01:31:19,246
Dong Hwi, we need to keep some distance.

2244
01:31:19,716 --> 01:31:21,657
- Which number am I? - You're number three.

2245
01:31:22,926 --> 01:31:25,256
So, they're all barking because...

2246
01:31:25,896 --> 01:31:27,657
- they want to go fast. - Here?

2247
01:31:28,127 --> 01:31:30,426
(Faster!)

2248
01:31:31,027 --> 01:31:33,867
(A surround sound of barking)

2249
01:31:34,136 --> 01:31:35,595
(Feeling dizzy)

2250
01:31:35,596 --> 01:31:36,906
(He's losing his mind.)

2251
01:31:36,907 --> 01:31:38,806
Sorry. Isn't she strong?

2252
01:31:39,037 --> 01:31:40,037
Yes.

2253
01:31:40,537 --> 01:31:43,247
Miyuki, she's...

2254
01:31:44,506 --> 01:31:45,675
(Hurry up, human!)

2255
01:31:45,676 --> 01:31:47,317
She's copying the dog in front of us.

2256
01:31:47,546 --> 01:31:49,045
(Miyuki)

2257
01:31:49,046 --> 01:31:50,116
Miyu.

2258
01:31:50,117 --> 01:31:52,116
(You have gone off course.)

2259
01:31:52,117 --> 01:31:53,916
(Recalculating the route)

2260
01:31:53,917 --> 01:31:55,255
Unbelievable.

2261
01:31:55,256 --> 01:31:57,787
(Even the experienced is in chaos.)

2262
01:31:57,957 --> 01:31:59,456
(Sakha)

2263
01:31:59,457 --> 01:32:01,895
Sakha.

2264
01:32:01,896 --> 01:32:03,296
(Another dog has gone off course.)

2265
01:32:03,396 --> 01:32:05,095
When we arrive...

2266
01:32:05,096 --> 01:32:06,335
- Sakha. - Sakha.

2267
01:32:06,336 --> 01:32:08,696
(Unable to hold a conversation)

2268
01:32:08,697 --> 01:32:10,366
(Sakha)

2269
01:32:10,367 --> 01:32:11,435
No.

2270
01:32:11,436 --> 01:32:13,475
(Sakha is a pro at going off-course.)

2271
01:32:13,476 --> 01:32:16,076
Wait.

2272
01:32:16,077 --> 01:32:17,145
(Getting dragged around)

2273
01:32:17,146 --> 01:32:18,976
Okay. Sakha.

2274
01:32:19,516 --> 01:32:20,616
Aren't you being dragged around?

2275
01:32:20,617 --> 01:32:24,286
(We'll take you on a walk.)

2276
01:32:24,287 --> 01:32:27,755
Good grief. Taking a walk must be tough.

2277
01:32:27,756 --> 01:32:28,756
I know, right?

2278
01:32:28,757 --> 01:32:29,987
(Even walks aren't easy.)

2279
01:32:30,327 --> 01:32:33,925
We will soon arrive at the lake.

2280
01:32:33,926 --> 01:32:35,056
- Yes. - Okay.

2281
01:32:35,396 --> 01:32:41,497
(Where are they going on today's husky hiking?)

2282
01:32:41,867 --> 01:32:43,666
Goodness, just look at the lake.

2283
01:32:43,667 --> 01:32:45,006
The lake is huge.

2284
01:32:45,306 --> 01:32:46,335
Oh, dear.

2285
01:32:46,336 --> 01:32:49,646
(Is the lake the hiking course?)

2286
01:32:49,976 --> 01:32:53,145
They know where we're going. They're so happy.

2287
01:32:53,146 --> 01:32:54,646
Yes, she's so happy.

2288
01:32:55,447 --> 01:32:58,086
(The problem is, the closer they get to the lake...)

2289
01:32:59,417 --> 01:33:00,516
Miyuki.

2290
01:33:01,686 --> 01:33:03,326
Yelka, you need to come back now.

2291
01:33:03,327 --> 01:33:04,787
- Yelka. - Let's go home.

2292
01:33:04,957 --> 01:33:06,657
- All right. Yelka. - Yelka.

2293
01:33:08,157 --> 01:33:09,627
Miyu!

2294
01:33:10,067 --> 01:33:11,526
- Wait! - Miyu!

2295
01:33:11,527 --> 01:33:12,667
Oh, stop.

2296
01:33:13,896 --> 01:33:16,936
(Even the dogs are extraordinary...)

2297
01:33:17,567 --> 01:33:18,835
I suddenly feel tired.

2298
01:33:18,836 --> 01:33:20,036
(In the wilderness of Lapland)

2299
01:33:21,476 --> 01:33:24,577
(The madness continues!)

2300
01:33:25,757 --> 01:33:27,895
(Full of laughter)

2301
01:33:27,896 --> 01:33:31,127
(Their happy life in the countryside)

2302
01:33:31,667 --> 01:33:35,037
(They overcame their past journey as they cheered each other on.)

2303
01:33:35,115 --> 01:33:36,884
(However, )

2304
01:33:36,885 --> 01:33:40,054
(the reason they've lost their smiles...)

2305
01:33:40,154 --> 01:33:45,153
(If you get eliminated, you'll enter the tent coffin?)

2306
01:33:45,154 --> 01:33:46,324
How do we get up there?

2307
01:33:46,325 --> 01:33:50,224
(Someone has to sleep in the single room in mid-air tonight too!)

2308
01:33:50,394 --> 01:33:53,264
(A competition where no one can back off)

2309
01:33:53,865 --> 01:33:58,205
(A desperate battle over who has to sleep in mid-air)

2310
01:33:58,404 --> 01:33:59,974
(Let's go!)

2311
01:34:00,005 --> 01:34:01,035
Twerking!

2312
01:34:01,635 --> 01:34:02,635
Twerking!

2313
01:34:03,545 --> 01:34:05,504
(Exploding with laughter)

2314
01:34:05,505 --> 01:34:07,374
(Exploding with screams)

2315
01:34:07,375 --> 01:34:08,915
