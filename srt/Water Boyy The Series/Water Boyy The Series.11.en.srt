1
00:02:14,419 --> 00:02:16,159
Kiss. Kiss. Kiss.

2
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:17,599
Okay, if you kiss this boy on the mouth,

3
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,359
we'll stop this right away.

4
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,319
From now,

5
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:23,319
Don't ever mention his name.

6
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,060
Do you have feelings for P'Pan?

7
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,900
You've been practicing for so long.

8
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,379
Don't you want to go somewhere?

9
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:30,960
Let's go.

10
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,979
The club's trip

11
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,219
starts now.

12
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,580
Yeah!

13
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,340
What a view!

14
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,319
If there was no drama,

15
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:48,979
I wouldn't have a chance to come to your home.

16
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,860
The view is so great.

17
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,699
You're right.

18
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,099
It's beautiful

19
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:55,800
and chillaxing.

20
00:02:57,699 --> 00:02:59,339
You can choose any spot

21
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:01,340
you'd like to claim.

22
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:04,039
Can I have all?

23
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,500
I call dibs on the bed.

24
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,399
Hey,

25
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,919
Where's your manner?

26
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,439
A bed should go to the owner.

27
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:17,879
That's okay.

28
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,359
I can sleep in the tent.

29
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,360
I want the bed, too.

30
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,740
No, cannot

31
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,259
This is my room.

32
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,280
No boys allowed.

33
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,319
You want to separate by gender now?

34
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:31,340
Just in case nong Namkhaeng shows up.

35
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,560
Then,

36
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,560
If she comes,

37
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:37,219
I dare you to put your foot on my face.

38
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,759
You face already looks like a foot, dude.

39
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,159
Oh yeah, dude.

40
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:44,620
Hey, Kluay

41
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,699
Sit down now.

42
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,419
Why?

43
00:03:46,419 --> 00:03:48,759
I'll put my foot on your face.

44
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:53,659
P'Pan.

45
00:03:53,659 --> 00:03:54,299
Namkhaeng!

46
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,780
I found a patient here.

47
00:03:57,539 --> 00:03:58,539
Fah,

48
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,919
come here.

49
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,020
Well,

50
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:04,000
Min is also coming.

51
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,500
You can come with him.

52
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,199
Nah

53
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:07,500
We just arrived.

54
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:08,799
Come here.

55
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,639
Come and join us.

56
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,939
The view is gorgeous.

57
00:04:15,939 --> 00:04:17,779
Master Apo!

58
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:19,059
P'Dew.

59
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,939
I miss you so much

60
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,100
You're here!

61
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:23,720
Yes,

62
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,079
just arrived with my friends.

63
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,759
Who's this?

64
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,019
Have you eaten?

65
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:28,139
Want some mussels?

66
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,720
I have plenty.

67
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,600
Want some mussels, guys?

68
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,420
I want two.

69
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,360
Three for me.

70
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,740
I want four.

71
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,120
What about you, Apo?

72
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,319
No,

73
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,779
I'm not into mussels.

74
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:42,379
Have you tasted it?

75
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:44,319
They're fresh and sweet.

76
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,279
Try it.

77
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,439
No,

78
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:48,439
the smell is too strong.

79
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:50,240
Smelly mussels.

80
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,860
No, they're not.

81
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,379
Smell it again.

82
00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:54,459
Have you washed them?

83
00:04:54,459 --> 00:04:55,739
Of course.

84
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,740
They're all clean.

85
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:10,899
Yummy ice cream?

86
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:12,339
Can I try again?

87
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,680
Yes, it's good.

88
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,519
Where did you get it?

89
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,519
My ice cream?

90
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,620
Let's go

91
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,280
I can take you there.

92
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:26,519
Come on.

93
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,020
Come.

94
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:34,839
I'll be back.

95
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,660
Here you go.

96
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,560
These are all mine.

97
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,019
What about me?

98
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,740
you can share with me.

99
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,639
Where are you going?

100
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,000
I don't want the mussels anymore.

101
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,199
I'll get ice cream with Waii.

102
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,940
All mine.

103
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,339
This is mine,

104
00:05:58,339 --> 00:05:59,879
that is mine.

105
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,459
Where are you?

106
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,379
Okay, I'll come down.

107
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,259
Where are you going?

108
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:32,639
Downstairs to see the guys.

109
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,939
Are you avoiding me?

110
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:36,860
What am I supposed to do?

111
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,300
I don't want to talk to you.

112
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,500
Are you still mad at me?

113
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:43,399
I'm not mad.

114
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,420
Fah!

115
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,720
Fah!

116
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:50,860
Fah, it's not what you think.

117
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,580
Fah!

118
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,360
Listen to me.

119
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,520
What are you doing?

120
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,220
He's not doing anything.

121
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,860
How can you say that?

122
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,900
I saw it.

123
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,599
Can you leave Fah alone?

124
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,879
Stop ruining his life?

125
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:20,699
Guys,

126
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,199
while we are here,

127
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,399
I'd like you to forget

128
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,079
the fact that our club is about to be dissolved.

129
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,079
Do you understand?

130
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:30,519
Hey, Wait

131
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:32,180
If you hadn't said that,

132
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,620
I would've forgotten all about it.

133
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,319
Yeah, you're the one who reminds us.

134
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:43,339
But if our club is dissolved, what will we do?

135
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,339
He just told us to forget about it.

136
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,460
This is just a scenario.

137
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,319
Let's discuss this

138
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,079
when we're back.

139
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:58,279
Then,

140
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,340
Let's play a game.

141
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,660
Sure,

142
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:05,100
I haven't played an online game for a while.

143
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,720
Not that kind of game.

144
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,520
What then?

145
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,579
We're going to play

146
00:08:10,579 --> 00:08:12,399
It's Truth or Dare.

147
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,339
The number you're trying to reach is not available.

148
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:26,180
The number you're trying to reach is not available.

149
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:32,579
Hey, Fay!

150
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,279
Kan,

151
00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:36,199
I thought you had left.

152
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,740
I had some errand here.

153
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,099
Where are the others?

154
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,019
They've disappeared.

155
00:08:45,019 --> 00:08:46,379
I cannot reach any of them.

156
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:49,240
Maybe they went away to regroup.

157
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:52,779
I would appreciate a little heads-up,

158
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:53,439
not this...

159
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,820
Sorry.

160
00:08:58,519 --> 00:08:59,519
It's fine.

161
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,220
Waii has changed so much.

162
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:07,419
That's true.

163
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:09,674
How good is that?

164
00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:13,139
Good?

165
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:15,679
Yes,

166
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,139
He's calmer

167
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,000
and listens to others more.

168
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,560
When did this happen?

169
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:30,579
I don't know.

170
00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:37,419
I'm taking off.

171
00:09:37,419 --> 00:09:38,299
Got this thing to do.

172
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:39,679
Kan,

173
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:43,320
even if there's no club, find the time to meet up.

174
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,740
Why do think there will be no club?

175
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:48,659
The Rector...

176
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,020
What's up?

177
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,959
Nothing.

178
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,039
Wait for good news on Monday.

179
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,620
See you.

180
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,460
Truth or Dare?

181
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,299
How?

182
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,120
You haven't played it, have you?

183
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,879
The rule is simple.

184
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:13,840
You can ask any question and

185
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,039
the player has two options:

186
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,339
to perform a dare or

187
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,480
to answer the question...

188
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,000
and you must be honest!

189
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:27,939
You guys will suck at this because you are liars.

190
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:29,779
But I'll excel because

191
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:30,899
I always tell the truth.

192
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:31,439
Let's start.

193
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,299
Really?

194
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,039
Come on.

195
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:33,980
Sure,

196
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:35,939
I want to play it, too.

197
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,340
Got a question to ask.

198
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,220
Who wants the first question?

199
00:10:56,539 --> 00:10:57,599
Not me.

200
00:10:59,179 --> 00:10:59,879
Don't look too far.

201
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:00,379
It's you.

202
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:01,600
You're right next to me.

203
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,200
Why did you look around the circle?

204
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,240
Kluay,

205
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:07,939
Truth or Dare?

206
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,360
Truth.

207
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:14,259
No,

208
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,879
change your answer to Dare.

209
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:17,179
It will be fun.

210
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:18,000
If I said dare,

211
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,379
you'd ask me to do some weird shit.

212
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:20,240
I don't want that.

213
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,100
Fine.

214
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,700
Let's hear the question.

215
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,200
Do you like Achi?

216
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:29,619
That made him choke.

217
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,779
Hit the spot.

218
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,660
I like...

219
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,159
him not.

220
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:40,359
I just like to tease him.

221
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,480
There's nothing.

222
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,000
Why did you do that?

223
00:11:45,259 --> 00:11:46,620
You can ask only one question.

224
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,360
Do you want to answer it?

225
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,940
I don't know.

226
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:55,659
Why did you do it, though?

227
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,519
I just wanted to stop those guys.

228
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,519
I thought doing that would put an end to it.

229
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,240
It did.

230
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:03,860
It ended everything.

231
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,220
You're an idiot.

232
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,720
What's that, Tomboy?

233
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,459
I meant

234
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,540
you're an idiot

235
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,460
like me.

236
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:13,919
I understand.

237
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,500
We are

238
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,740
all idiots.

239
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,159
We don't know how to express our feelings.

240
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:26,779
Does it mean that all the times that you bully Fah,

241
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,699
you have good feelings toward him?

242
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,020
Ass,

243
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,660
but it's true.

244
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,099
What?

245
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,960
Fah is my friend, too.

246
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:37,519
Oh,

247
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,159
just friends.

248
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,720
Let's continue with the game.

249
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,799
I'll spin the bottle.

250
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:53,079
Just the right person.

251
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:57,980
Sure,

252
00:12:58,879 --> 00:12:59,879
I'll do it.

253
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:06,759
Fah.

254
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:13,500
Truth or Dare.

255
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:17,039
Waii may want to come home.

256
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,379
You've been in the swimming club for a while.

257
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:21,200
Why have I never seen you in the pool?

258
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:22,539
I'll do it.

259
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,040
P'Tee.

260
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,040
Hey,

261
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,550
how was your shooting today?

262
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,820
It's good.

263
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,510
Where will it be posted?

264
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,350
The shoot is for a fashion website.

265
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,200
I'll send you the link when it's done.

266
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,270
Thus,

267
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,650
You don't have to go away for days anymore, do you?

268
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,650
I'm not sure.

269
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,020
It may good if I'm not here.

270
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:03,110
How can it be?

271
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,620
Waii may want to come home.

272
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,240
I don't think so.

273
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,340
There's no point trying.

274
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,180
But Wai...

275
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,620
I told you...

276
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,270
we will not discuss this anymore.

277
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,440
I'm sorry.

278
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:30,610
Give me a hug.

279
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,720
Fah,

280
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:59,760
Truth or Dare.

281
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:06,730
Truth.

282
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:09,510
A man of truth.

283
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,200
You've been in the swimming club for a while.

284
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,540
Why have I never seen you in the pool?

285
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:18,950
That's true.

286
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,480
I'm changing to Dare.

287
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,330
You didn't even take the time to think.

288
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,210
My story isn't that interesting.

289
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,040
Dare should be more fun.

290
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,510
Fine, whatever you're comfortable with.

291
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,940
I dare you to dip yourself in the pool

292
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,890
for five minutes.

293
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,450
That's easy.

294
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,010
Come with me.

295
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:50,150
We can do it together.

296
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:50,660
Just five minutes in the pool

297
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,070
will be good on this hot day.

298
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,950
Isn't it too easy?

299
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,070
Anyone can do it.

300
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,670
What about five shots of liquor?

301
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,540
It'll be funny.

302
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,330
No,

303
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:05,990
just dipping in the pool for five minutes.

304
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,680
It's easy, isn't it?

305
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,790
Yeah,

306
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,700
I want to see you get wet as well.

307
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,560
Ever since you joined the club,

308
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,380
I've never seen you swim.

309
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:27,290
This is frigging nonsense.

310
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:28,320
Come on,

311
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,130
it's for fun.

312
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:29,660
Fah,

313
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,130
jump in.

314
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,170
It's so hot now.

315
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:34,010
You'll be cool and chill in the pool.

316
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:34,850
Trust me.

317
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,560
Jump!

318
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,090
Sure

319
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,600
Go.

320
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,730
Or do you have any problems?

321
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:45,470
Hey

322
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:48,010
One, two, three.

323
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,570
He's not going.

324
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,300
Let's get him drunk.

325
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,200
Come on.

326
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:52,940
Stop.

327
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,060
That's not the rule.

328
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,750
The rule is you do the dare.

329
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,440
If you don't, you need to answer

330
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,440
why you wouldn't go into the pool.

331
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:08,200
I'll do it.

332
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,180
Fah,

333
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,510
let's just answer it.

334
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:18,570
No.

335
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:23,820
Let's jump in then.

336
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,820
Stop,

337
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:27,330
what the hell are you doing?

338
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:28,070
Hey,

339
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,950
calm down.

340
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,150
It's just a game.

341
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,490
You may be enjoying this,

342
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,180
but Fah isn't.

343
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:36,940
You know that he almost drowned because of you.

344
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,120
What else do you need?

345
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,030
Almost drowned?

346
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,970
What happened?

347
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:46,860
Fah!

348
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:47,700
Fah!

349
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,110
I'll check on him.

350
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,740
Fah!

351
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,590
Fah!

352
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,320
Fah, stop!

353
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,710
Do you think

354
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:07,060
I'm a clown?

355
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,700
What the hell are you talking about?

356
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,480
A clown who's afraid of water,

357
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:16,310
like a dog.

358
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:20,210
No one thinks you are.

359
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,180
At least

360
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,820
I don't.

361
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,450
What happened?

362
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,690
Where did Min come in?

363
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:33,660
Ask him.

364
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,850
He's dying to tell you guys.

365
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,400
I don't just want to know.

366
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:44,070
I want to hear it from you.

367
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,770
I want to know you more.

368
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,660
Why?

369
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,190
Because

370
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,560
You are my good friend.

371
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,330
I..

372
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,880
I want to be a good friend to you.

373
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:14,590
You should tell this kind of stuff to someone.

374
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,260
Sure,

375
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,420
I'll tell you a joke.

376
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,570
Kluay, Fah, and you

377
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:27,650
used to go the same school, right?

378
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:28,590
Yes.

379
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,860
We were friends.

380
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,880
What kind of friends?

381
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,380
Take it easy.

382
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,210
I've taken it easy for years

383
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,010
because Fah asked me to.

384
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,570
But you won't quit.

385
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,560
What do you want?

386
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,510
I want you to know the truth.

387
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,700
I already do.

388
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,800
But I don't.

389
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,090
What happened to you guys?

390
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,000
I'm so confused now.

391
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:52,700
You want everyone to know the truth.

392
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,400
Three years ago.

393
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,090
Min!

394
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:02,680
You're still late even on this important day.

395
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,740
I'm late because

396
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,740
I queued up to buy this for you.

397
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,500
Don't tease him.

398
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,480
He's really miserable as is.

399
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:11,850
In his lifetime,

400
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,040
he never gets to taste shrimps.

401
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:15,270
Kluay!

402
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,940
I've eaten them.

403
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,150
That's how I know I'm allergic.

404
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:18,950
Good,

405
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:21,180
it's nice to know you can't do something.

406
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:24,630
You're beating me in the swim race.

407
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,620
The race for scholarships is coming up.

408
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,780
I need to up my game.

409
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,390
I have this for you.

410
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:31,950
Here.

411
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,060
This is good.

412
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,090
P'Mai gave it to me.

413
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:36,930
Try it.

414
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,640
Who's P'Mai?

415
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,210
A senior who coaches my swimming.

416
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,390
Anyway,

417
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:45,060
try it.

418
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,180
It's awesome.

419
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,130
Thank you.

420
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,900
That's good.

421
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,380
Help!

422
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,500
Fah!

423
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,700
Help!

424
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,850
He got a rash all over.

425
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,250
What's wrong?

426
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,700
What did you give him?

427
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,440
Fah.

428
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:38,800
Leave him alone.

429
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,540
Kluay,

430
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,570
don't.

431
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,700
He planned to sabotage you.

432
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,540
I don't want to have anything to do with this kind of person.

433
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:49,800
It's best we keep to ourselves.

434
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,820
Dude!

435
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,200
Don't be afraid.

436
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,680
I'm here.

437
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:29,250
Where do you sleep?

438
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,310
Next to you.

439
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,830
If your intentions with Waii are good,

440
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,920
don't do this.

441
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,370
Fah has never swum since.

442
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,030
No,

443
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:53,890
he cannot swim since.

444
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:56,410
You earned a scholarship here

445
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,810
and be the president of the running team

446
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:58,900
that everyone likes,

447
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:01,770
even though you stepped on your friend to come on top.

448
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,350
I didn't know.

449
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:05,170
I didn't plan this.

450
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:07,400
You didn't plan to take the scholarship?

451
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,000
That's right.

452
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,260
I didn't take it.

453
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,410
I gave it up.

454
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,370
You gave it up?

455
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:14,720
Yes,

456
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,370
I took an exam to study here.

457
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:19,730
Yeah,

458
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:20,590
Kluay.

459
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:23,570
If he'd gotten the scholarship,

460
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,180
he would have been in our club.

461
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:28,400
He may have asked to switch the club.

462
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:29,850
No, he can't.

463
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,130
They would recall the scholarship.

464
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,220
Since that happened,

465
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,380
I hadn't touched the pool either...

466
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:40,940
until I found out that

467
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:45,040
Fah is in the club.

468
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,600
You got transferred here.

469
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,650
You just talked it up to make yourself look good.

470
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:50,590
I didn't get transferred.

471
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,030
I asked to be transferred.

472
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,580
The running coach

473
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,580
asked me to take a rest,

474
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:57,590
so I asked to be transferred.

475
00:24:58,530 --> 00:24:59,770
Because, right now

476
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,830
I understand Fah now.

477
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:04,630
What it feels like

478
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,940
when you can't do what you love.

479
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,560
I just want to help him.

480
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,700
Who are you?

481
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,060
Who are you to help?

482
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,200
Even the doctor can't help.

483
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:15,650
I think he can.

484
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:18,850
Kluay,

485
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:21,980
if you want Fah to be able to swim again,

486
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,590
let Min work this out.

487
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,010
You said it's a joke,

488
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:34,150
but it's not funny.

489
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:36,550
No?

490
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,860
You almost drowned!

491
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:42,580
Well, who knows..

492
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:46,090
I used to love swimming.

493
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,600
Look at me now.

494
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,320
I'm afraid of it.

495
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:53,950
And,

496
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:57,040
Why did you join the club?

497
00:25:58,210 --> 00:25:59,370
I thought

498
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,360
if I spend some time near it,

499
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,700
I'd get used to it.

500
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,390
Where did that come from?

501
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:13,770
What are you doing?

502
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:15,920
Try it one more time.

503
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,110
Try what?

504
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,830
Come on.

505
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:19,830
No.

506
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,320
Don't be afraid.

507
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,660
I'm here.

508
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:25,310
No, you'll set me up again.

509
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,710
I won't.

510
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,510
I promise.

511
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,670
You are setting me up right now.

512
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,380
No, I'm not.

513
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,270
Hold on.

514
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,140
Hello, Namkhaeng.

515
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,520
Hello

516
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,430
Can you hear me?

517
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,640
Bad connection.

518
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,260
You can go home and call her.

519
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:06,410
Don't try to get yourself out of this.

520
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,360
Someone needs to be in the pool.

521
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,920
And,

522
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,450
Won't your girlfriend be mad

523
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:13,140
if you don't take her call?

524
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,010
You're right.

525
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,160
Hello, Namkhaeng.

526
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:19,330
I can't hear you.

527
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,270
Thanks.

528
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:41,530
For what?

529
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:44,270
For helping me set up the tent.

530
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:46,270
I'm sleeping here,

531
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,640
so I need to set it up.

532
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,230
Why don't sleep in the house?

533
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,250
No,

534
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:55,020
It's already full.

535
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:57,130
Where do you sleep?

536
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,340
Next to you.

537
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:02,870
It's a small tent.

538
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,310
It won't work.

539
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,870
It will if we sleep close to each other.

540
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:13,310
It's not a problem.

541
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,360
I'm just guessing.

542
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,020
I hope it's not right.

543
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:23,370
I don't want to see you do a wrong thing,

544
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,710
especially with Waii.

545
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:28,550
If your intentions with Waii are good,

546
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,800
don't do this.

547
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,270
Stop confusing him.

548
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,930
Did you call Fay and

549
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:41,250
tell her that you're here?

550
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,260
No.

551
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,890
She'd be so worried.

552
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:51,310
She didn't know that

553
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,800
I came here.

554
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,870
Why didn't you tell her?

555
00:28:58,610 --> 00:28:59,610
I forgot.

556
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,260
Call her now.

557
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,110
Hey,

558
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,190
I know

559
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,370
what you're doing.

560
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,050
Let's just say it.

561
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,360
Waii, I...

562
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:22,140
You want me to lose the phone bet, don't you?

563
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,370
Huh?

564
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,880
You can't fool me.

565
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:31,780
Too bad.

566
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,480
Come in.

567
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,250
Come on.

568
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:43,730
I know.

569
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,560
Ready for bed?

570
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:07,710
Hey,

571
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,810
tomorrow,

572
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,420
Your turn to cook in the morning.

573
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,430
What are you going to make?

574
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,100
Hey!

575
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:36,770
What are you doing?

576
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,160
Sleeping.

577
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:42,110
Why do you sleeping so close to me?

578
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,420
I like it here.

579
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,520
What's your problem?

580
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,940
What's yours?

581
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,610
You don't have Coach Mai to obsess with.

582
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,550
So, now you're bothering me.

583
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:00,580
Sung,

584
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,310
this is not about Coach Mai.

585
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:02,930
Yes, it is.

586
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:05,010
When she's not around,

587
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:07,110
you come back to me.

588
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,900
What if you found a new girl?

589
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:12,950
I'd be dumped like a dog.

590
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,930
No!

591
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:16,230
For me,

592
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,610
you've always.

593
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,480
Hey,

594
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,480
Why you guys are going to bed so soon?

595
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:22,990
Fah,

596
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:24,070
how are you feeling?

597
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,760
I'm fine.

598
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,750
Just very tired.

599
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,670
Fah,

600
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:37,990
where are you sleeping?

601
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,280
There's an empty spot next to me.

602
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,190
You can have it if you want.

603
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,460
Fah!

604
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,490
Fah!

605
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:00,610
It's okay.

606
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:01,780
Let me.

607
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,300
Fah,

608
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,400
where are you sleeping?

609
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,500
None of your business.

610
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,260
When are you going to stop running away from Min?

611
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,000
I'm not.

612
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,170
I just don't have anything to say to him.

613
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:41,210
Fah.

614
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:43,930
Stop talking about it.

615
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,480
Aren't you going to go somewhere?

616
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,800
I'm not in a hurry to go anywhere.

617
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,470
I'm here to talk to you

618
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,070
now

619
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:57,780
Don't you want to call Namkhaeng?

620
00:32:58,830 --> 00:32:59,330
Shit,

621
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:00,130
I forgot.

622
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:08,260
You can run from Min

623
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:11,040
but you can't run from me.

624
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,380
Where are you taking me?

625
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,240
Come on.

626
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:15,810
No.

627
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:16,810
Come.

628
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:19,170
Namkhaeng,

629
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,690
have you been afraid of something terribly?

630
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:21,590
Yes,

631
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:22,800
lizards

632
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,420
What do you do to get rid of the fear?

633
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,260
Why do I need to get rid of it?

634
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:28,260
I'm afraid and that's that.

635
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,300
It makes your life difficult.

636
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,620
You have to be cautious all the time.

637
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,070
Wouldn't it be better not to be afraid?

638
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:37,950
No,

639
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:38,900
I accept my fear.

640
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,020
When I see a lizard,

641
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,550
I scream at the top of my lungs.

642
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:45,830
Pan,

643
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,400
who are you talking to?

644
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:58,650
Do you remember that red swimsuit?

645
00:33:58,830 --> 00:33:59,970
Good thing I didn't buy it.

646
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:01,780
I wouldn't be wearing it anyway.

647
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:09,380
Do you think Fah and Min

648
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,580
will work it out?

649
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,800
Are you taking an interest in your friends' drama?

650
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,590
You usually don't.

651
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,140
I just want to know

652
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,140
what Fah would do

653
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:21,130
when he finds out the truth.

654
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:23,070
You mean you want to know

655
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,850
what you have to do.

656
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:26,050
What's this got to do with me?

657
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:29,000
You've found out the truth about Kan and Coach Tee,

658
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,550
and now you want to know

659
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,240
how to forgive them.

660
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:35,190
Are you taking a walk in my mind right now?

661
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,300
I also know

662
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,660
you want to see Coach Tee.

663
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,420
Wrong.

664
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:47,380
Come and talk a walk again.

665
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,690
Have you called Fay?

666
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,360
You mentioned Fay again.

667
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,360
If you miss her,

668
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:00,350
call her.

669
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:02,610
I thought you should.

670
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,400
All my life

671
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:11,850
I've been doing what I should.

672
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,550
Now I want to do what my heart wants.

673
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:19,780
Go for it.

674
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,540
Whatever it is,

675
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,710
I'm sure you will have thought it through

676
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,590
that it won't hurt anyone.

677
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,570
You know first-hand

678
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,960
what it's like

679
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,690
to be hurt.

680
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,380
Get away, I want to sleep.

681
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,120
Don't laugh.

682
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,020
I'm sorry.

683
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:00,930
"I'm sorry."

684
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:02,730
"I didn't mean to."

685
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,460
You said it all.

686
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:05,950
You think of me as your friend?

687
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,800
Waii,

688
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:59,250
no.

689
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,740
Waii.

690
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,190
Where did you go?

691
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,200
I went shopping

692
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,040
for the breakfast.

693
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,110
It's my turn.

694
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:51,790
I should help.

695
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,350
No,

696
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,170
I can do it myself.

697
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,360
Who exactly has changed?

698
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,310
You said that I changed when I met Coach Mai.

699
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,520
Yes!

700
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:08,890
I did

701
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,980
and I know.

702
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,120
I apologized to you.

703
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,070
What about you?

704
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:16,830
When can you be my friend again?

705
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:29,410
Hey,

706
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:33,920
wash the vegetables till they're clean.

707
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:41,670
Sure,

708
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,640
I'll use dish soap.

709
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:45,240
Hell no.

710
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,610
Who uses dish soap to wash vegetables?

711
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:48,680
You can smile now.

712
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:49,980
I know how to smile since birth.

713
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,110
Is he gay?

714
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,240
What a shame!

715
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:26,260
I hate the bastard who hurt my friend.

716
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,100
The bastard is P'Kluay,

717
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:30,110
the worst swimmer in the club.

718
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,140
Pan!

719
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:59,910
The rule is not to use your mobile phone.

720
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:02,740
You're going down!

721
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:03,830
Give it to me.

722
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:05,420
Pan, wait.

723
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,450
Guys!

724
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:08,190
Pan, I beg you.

725
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,170
Guys!

726
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,740
Sung!

727
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,020
Sung!

728
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:17,850
Stop it.

729
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,700
You'll look beautiful.

730
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:22,250
The color is just right.

731
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:23,140
Stay still.

732
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:25,260
Let us put the flower behind your ear.

733
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:26,390
How does he look?

734
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:27,420
All finished.

735
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:31,590
Sun-dried banana.

736
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:34,730
What the hell did you write?

737
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,520
What are you laughing at?

738
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:38,150
Pan has been using her phone.

739
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,650
Why isn't she getting punished?

740
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:41,150
Do you have evidence?

741
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,050
If I get away...

742
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,800
You will soon.

743
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:46,320
See?

744
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:47,300
He's my friend.

745
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,790
In half an hour.

746
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:50,830
30 minutes.

747
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,880
Let me go.

748
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,440
I'm begging you, let me go.

749
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,760
Don't complain, Kluay.

750
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:00,270
You messed up.

751
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,470
I only used the phone for a minute.

752
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:08,890
Why are you checking the phone?

753
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:10,980
It upsets you emotionally,

754
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:13,330
and physically.

755
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:14,380
Fah,

756
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:15,300
I'm your friend.

757
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:16,850
Yes, I am.

758
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:18,240
Help me then.

759
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:19,850
Pan,

760
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:21,680
let's write on Kluay's body.

761
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:40,790
Will this work?

762
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,110
Should we tie Fah to a chair?

763
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,740
He won't run.

764
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:46,500
Trust me

765
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,900
and you'll see.

766
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:53,170
I'm sorry.

767
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:55,830
"I'm sorry."

768
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:57,710
"I didn't mean to."

769
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:00,210
"I had no idea."

770
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,230
You said it all.

771
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:03,410
I remember.

772
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,500
Fah,

773
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,760
I think Min was telling the truth.

774
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,740
What are you saying, Kluay?

775
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:14,790
He didn't set you up.

776
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:17,010
He declined the scholarship.

777
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:18,980
Huh?

778
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:26,570
Your plan is working, Apo.

779
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:28,770
Oh?

780
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,980
You don't have to forgive me.

781
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:42,430
I just want you to know the truth.

782
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:45,160
Fine.

783
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:46,290
Now I know.

784
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:48,180
Fah!

785
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:49,030
Fah!

786
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:50,090
Fah!

787
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:55,730
Why are you smiling?

788
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:58,220
He doesn't seem like he wants to forgive you.

789
00:42:58,620 --> 00:42:59,620
Nothing.

790
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,900
It feels good just to tell the truth.

791
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:05,450
If he stays mad,

792
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:07,260
I'll have to accept.

793
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:12,270
Why do you look so happy?

794
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:15,150
I think you look beautiful.

795
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:17,070
This look suits you.

796
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,240
You've found your way.

797
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:20,610
Congrats.

798
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:21,670
Min, you jerk.

799
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:22,850
I'm going to get you.

800
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:23,940
Stay away from me.

801
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,740
Your nipples are so red.

802
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:27,740
It'd be nice to get some sun.

803
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:29,580
Min, I'm begging you,

804
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:31,240
help me.

805
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:01,170
You really like

806
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,960
your Coach Tee, huh?

807
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:05,310
I told this to you once.

808
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:07,200
I wasn't kidding.

809
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,850
And you wanted to be friends with me

810
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:12,700
because of him.

811
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:14,940
Wait,

812
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:17,290
seriously?

813
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,340
No.

814
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,140
What was I supposed to do?

815
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:25,700
He told me to stay with you.

816
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,550
So, you wouldn't have

817
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:29,590
if he hadn't told you.

818
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,480
Did anyone tell me

819
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,580
to be here?

820
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:41,870
I want to know

821
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,150
why you've done all this.

822
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:49,750
Is it because you think of me as your friend?

823
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:54,460
Yes,

824
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:57,650
all of you are my friends.

825
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:02,910
It's been more than half an hour.

826
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:05,130
I should free Kluay.

827
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,680
Umm..

828
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:24,670
"We will shine brightly when we help others. Do good."
