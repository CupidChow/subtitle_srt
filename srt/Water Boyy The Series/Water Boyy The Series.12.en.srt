1
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,860
All my life I've been doing what I should.

2
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,100
Now I want to do what my heart wants.

3
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:24,019
I just want you to know the truth.

4
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,240
Now I know.

5
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:28,000
You can run from Min

6
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,280
but you

7
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,400
can't run from me.

8
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,200
You think of me as your friend?

9
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:39,840
This one looks like you,

10
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,340
Kluay.

11
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,759
They all look like me.

12
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:43,459
This is a dog food ad.

13
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,580
Are you sure?

14
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,439
Do I look like a dog?

15
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,180
You look like dog food.

16
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:50,339
Hey, Waii.

17
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:51,620
Where's Apo?

18
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,719
Isn't he with you?

19
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:55,340
He said he's going to join you guys.

20
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,960
No, he's not here.

21
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,259
Nevermind.

22
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,400
That's it?

23
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:07,139
Uh-oh.

24
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,659
Shit is going down.

25
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,760
Where are you going?

26
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,680
I asked you

27
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,400
where you're going.

28
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:41,939
I'm just walking around.

29
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,800
After this.

30
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,500
Go back to my room.

31
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:48,459
I mean

32
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,219
where you're going

33
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,640
after today.

34
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:54,900
If the club is gone,

35
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,719
will you still stay with me?

36
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:06,099
I will

37
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,640
for as long as you want me to.

38
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:26,859
What if I want you to stay forever?

39
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,800
I will stay with you forever...

40
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,500
forever.

41
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,920
You said it.

42
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,620
Don't go back on your word.

43
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,560
You, too.

44
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:30,500
I won't.

45
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:40,019
Waii!

46
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:42,399
Answer your phone now.

47
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:45,879
Hello, Fay.

48
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,540
Uh-huh,

49
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:50,719
thanks.

50
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,080
What's up?

51
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,759
Kan...

52
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:03,419
Listen to this.

53
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,380
Hello, Waii.

54
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,480
This is Kan.

55
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,300
First,

56
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,980
I must apologize to you again

57
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,720
for what I've done.

58
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,400
Putting my own happiness

59
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,120
above yours.

60
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:25,680
When I think about it,

61
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:29,139
it brings me no happiness.

62
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,100
I used to think that my happiest moment

63
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,740
is when I feel the love from P'Tee.

64
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,020
But it's not.

65
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:46,000
I just realized this when I saw you all once again.

66
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,519
My true happiness

67
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:50,939
lies within the time I spend with you guys.

68
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:52,480
Swimming with you

69
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,360
and seeing you smile.

70
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,640
I love the swimming club.

71
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,540
What the club needs

72
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:12,399
the most right now

73
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,439
is Coach Tee.

74
00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:17,180
He's the only thing that

75
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,639
can bring back

76
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,939
the club.

77
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,700
I know that he'll

78
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,840
be happy to help you out.

79
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,240
Now that everything

80
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,579
is going back to how it used to be,

81
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:31,379
I think

82
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:33,219
it'd be better to go back

83
00:07:34,339 --> 00:07:36,299
to how things were

84
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,479
before I disrupted your family.

85
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,620
It must be better.

86
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,839
Thanks

87
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:46,079
for your friendship.

88
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,139
I'll never forget all the good moments

89
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,960
that you've given to me.

90
00:07:54,579 --> 00:07:56,519
May your dreams come true.

91
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,540
I love you guys, always.

92
00:08:00,339 --> 00:08:01,119
Kan.

93
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:05,319
What does this mean?

94
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:07,240
It means Kan is gone.

95
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:09,439
To where?

96
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,519
He broke up with Coach.

97
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,100
And he'll never come back.

98
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,379
Net idol Kan

99
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:25,500
moves to Korea to be an artist.

100
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,180
That is our Kan.

101
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:29,959
Look.

102
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,080
You're right.

103
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,620
Let's go back. Now.

104
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:05,799
Fay.

105
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:06,299
Waii.

106
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:08,559
I have to hang up.

107
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,220
What's going on?

108
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,039
What brings you here?

109
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:14,579
Well...

110
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,679
Kan isn't here.

111
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,839
Don't worry.

112
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,360
Are you okay?

113
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:25,379
Shouldn't I be?

114
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:27,399
Didn't you know that

115
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:29,240
he...

116
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,199
Went to the university.

117
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,640
He's not back yet.

118
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,340
Huh?

119
00:09:35,539 --> 00:09:36,679
Where did he go?

120
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,120
To class as usual.

121
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,700
He's not back yet.

122
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:45,600
Is there something you want to talk about?

123
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:48,159
Well,

124
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:52,379
Well...

125
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,240
um...

126
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:56,779
the club is dissolved.

127
00:09:57,299 --> 00:09:58,719
The club is dissolved?

128
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,820
How?

129
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,000
It's nothing.

130
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,620
I'm taking off.

131
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,820
Wait.

132
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:10,779
You're not here just to tell me that.

133
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,120
What else?

134
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,120
Um...

135
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,220
well... the club is due to be dissolved.

136
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,360
Do you have time to listen?

137
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,120
Fah.

138
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,659
Why did you bring me here?

139
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,279
I swam for the first time in this pool.

140
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:52,860
I won a prize

141
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,560
from a race held in this pool.

142
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,820
And?

143
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,019
I want you to feel what I felt.

144
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,820
How?

145
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:05,419
Walk slowly.

146
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,420
Try it.

147
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,159
You can do it.

148
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:31,379
Fah,

149
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,460
swim back.

150
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:37,519
Swim back to me.

151
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,200
You can do it.

152
00:12:42,139 --> 00:12:43,120
You can do it.

153
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:05,459
That's right.

154
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:17,639
Fah,

155
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:18,759
you did it.

156
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,600
Yes,

157
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,940
I did.

158
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,779
Yay!

159
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:28,639
Pan,

160
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:29,840
thank you.

161
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,259
Please allow me to return.

162
00:13:33,259 --> 00:13:34,200
No.

163
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,179
I don't have to run.

164
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,839
I'm not a coward.

165
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,620
What do you want me to talk about?

166
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:41,799
You know it.

167
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,100
You go,

168
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,120
I'm not.

169
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,650
You're the club captain.

170
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,090
If the Rector sees me now,

171
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,210
he...

172
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,720
That's his problem.

173
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,270
We need to go and fix our problem.

174
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,320
Let's go.

175
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,780
Coach Tee.

176
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:21,850
Vice Rector.

177
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,780
The Rector isn't available now,

178
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,130
so he assigned me to this task.

179
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,920
Sawasdee krap.

180
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,240
The club hasn't performed

181
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,390
on behalf of the university

182
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,750
for years.

183
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:39,210
You were also engaged in a physical altercation.

184
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,850
You made a mess of the university's pool.

185
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,420
You ruined the university's reputation.

186
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:47,630
Tell me

187
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,120
what I should do with you.

188
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,650
This time we plan

189
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,890
to gain the university's reputation.

190
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:54,810
The students who made

191
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:57,710
a mess of the university's pool will do that?

192
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,540
I will not apologize on their behalf.

193
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,810
I'm sure

194
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,480
they've given you

195
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:06,820
a sincere apology.

196
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,900
Allow me to apologize again.

197
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,540
I know that

198
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,370
there's nothing I can do to fix what happened.

199
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,100
But if you give me a second chance,

200
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,740
I will make it worthwhile.

201
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:17,950
Waii,

202
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:21,870
how many chances has the university given you?

203
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,310
I have no reason

204
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:26,310
to trust delinquent kids like you.

205
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,950
Do you trust me?

206
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,200
I guarantee with my reputation that

207
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,640
our club will bring fame

208
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:37,130
in the upcoming National Games.

209
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,230
It's not that I don't trust you,

210
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,030
but you don't belong to our university.

211
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,890
Don't forget that.

212
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,170
Please allow me to return.

213
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,170
No.

214
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,290
Why is that?

215
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,170
Everything that happened

216
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,570
has nothing to do with Coach.

217
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:48,670
It does.

218
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:51,470
I cut your budget.

219
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,840
That includes

220
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:54,850
a budget for the club's coach.

221
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:57,850
I will not take salary

222
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,640
to perform my job.

223
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,690
But I need your support

224
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,690
for the team to enter the competition.

225
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,340
Nice "wai".

226
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,170
What did the Vice Rector say?

227
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,100
We...

228
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,720
will participate in the National Games.

229
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,850
Our club stays alive.

230
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:52,970
If...

231
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,200
Ah,

232
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:57,230
what's the catch?

233
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,580
If we win in the Games.

234
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:02,600
That's easy.

235
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,910
It's not that bad.

236
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,440
There are many races.

237
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,530
We will win at least one.

238
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:08,230
We will have to win at least...

239
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,070
five races.

240
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:15,690
Five?

241
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:20,250
One is easy,

242
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,360
but five is tough.

243
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:22,320
How can you say that

244
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,820
when you haven't tried it yet?

245
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,070
But Coach,

246
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,130
we

247
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,950
have only one week left.

248
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,290
One week is plenty.

249
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,760
Coach Tee is back.

250
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:33,700
What do you have to fear?

251
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:41,810
We will start rigorous practice tomorrow.

252
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:43,580
See you at the pool

253
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,500
6 AM sharp.

254
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,260
6 AM, Coach!

255
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,540
Get some rest.

256
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,260
You've just come back from your trip.

257
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,420
Waii,

258
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,100
did you tell Coach?

259
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,010
I didn't.

260
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,070
All of you are tanned.

261
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,420
Nobody needs to tell me that you went on a trip.

262
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,950
Sawasdee krap, Coach.

263
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,340
See you all at 6

264
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,300
PM!

265
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,050
Coach...

266
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,430
Take care of your friends.

267
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,550
Get your gear ready.

268
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,070
Hey,

269
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,820
Coach knows that you want to thank him.

270
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,890
What?

271
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:46,640
Emotional much?

272
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,390
Non-sense.

273
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,140
Let's go.

274
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,430
We want to thank you, Waii,

275
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,960
For what?

276
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,050
For getting Coach back.

277
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:59,450
You're the captain.

278
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,620
He's my dad.

279
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,400
It makes the most sense that it's me.

280
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,890
With Coach Tee,

281
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,050
I'm confident that

282
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,210
we will win.

283
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,960
Achi, let's go another way.

284
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:23,020
Why?

285
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,710
Do you want to talk to him?

286
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,320
I don't have to run.

287
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,910
I'm not a coward.

288
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,580
He's young.

289
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,980
He doesn't understand.

290
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,950
Don't forget to bring your swimsuit?

291
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,280
Why?

292
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:56,840
To practice swimming.

293
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,560
You need to practice hard.

294
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,950
Are you worried about me?

295
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:06,510
Worried my ass.

296
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,840
Ass... dad

297
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,450
I know you don't have to repeat it.

298
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:14,610
No

299
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,110
I forgot

300
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,230
to pick Namkhaeng up from her dad's.

301
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,010
Are you planning to pick me up tomorrow?

302
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,450
Namkhaeng.

303
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,780
That's my cue to leave.

304
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,290
It's not even the time of our appointment.

305
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:40,450
Why are you here already?

306
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,020
I want to see you.

307
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,450
The feeling is not mutual, I guess.

308
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,980
Seriously,

309
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:46,190
did you even miss me?

310
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,690
The club...

311
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,080
This is about us.

312
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:54,220
I was going to explain...

313
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:56,160
You've been gone the whole day.

314
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,320
Not even a sticker on Line.

315
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:00,490
We've been together for a month.

316
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:02,790
No.

317
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,020
Our anniversary is tomorrow.

318
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,080
You remember.

319
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,200
Of course I do.

320
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,570
I'm ticklish.

321
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:25,050
You said you wouldn't run.

322
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,550
I told you to stop.

323
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,750
I didn't do it

324
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:42,010
because I hated you.

325
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:46,230
I just wanted them to get off your back.

326
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:49,950
I know

327
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,160
what I did was stupid.

328
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,930
But if I hadn't,

329
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,960
they wouldn't have stopped bullying you.

330
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,820
I don't to get you in trouble.

331
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:08,050
Let me go.

332
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:11,160
Let go!

333
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:16,330
I told you to let go!

334
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:31,730
Nice talk.

335
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:33,630
You made yourself look good.

336
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,800
Admit it.

337
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,450
You did it

338
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:41,730
because you didn't want to get yourself in trouble.

339
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:43,710
And you wanted to act tough in front of others.

340
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:45,440
Achi.

341
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:47,360
You only think of yourself.

342
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,490
Do you think

343
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,330
you have the right treat me like that?

344
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,490
I have the right, too.

345
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,160
I

346
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,750
have the right to hate you.

347
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,050
I frigging hate you.

348
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,140
Achi.

349
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,490
Achi.

350
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,370
Did Coach put up a schedule?

351
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,320
Or did he just want to meet us?

352
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:40,370
Did he leave any instruction?

353
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:41,900
Coach, Coach, Coach.

354
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,140
Can you stop talking about him for two seconds?

355
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,180
One,

356
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:45,890
two.

357
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:47,730
Did he want us to do anything?

358
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:48,490
You don't quit.

359
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:49,510
What do you want me to talk about?

360
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,000
About us.

361
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,350
Us?

362
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,320
You mean the club?

363
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,420
You know

364
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,780
what I mean.

365
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,100
I do.

366
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,140
So...

367
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:16,750
No,

368
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,470
not right now.

369
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,580
You're playing hard to get.

370
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,030
Don't let me catch you.

371
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,980
I got you.

372
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,870
You're going down tonight.

373
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,520
What?

374
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:35,970
Hi.

375
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:38,470
Can I have a sleepover?

376
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,160
Waii,

377
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,850
let's go to sleep.

378
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:44,610
I feel like sleeping on the floor tonight.

379
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,450
I was just kidding.

380
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,020
Everything is a joke to you.

381
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:06,430
I have to this thing to work on at the faculty.

382
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:07,950
I need to get up early and go home late.

383
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,470
I can't drive like that.

384
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:11,450
Can I crash here for two weeks?

385
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:12,420
Two weeks?

386
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,740
But

387
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,610
they don't allow girls to sleep here.

388
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,740
Like I hadn't slept here before.

389
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,860
You invited me over that time.

390
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:24,190
That time I was alone.

391
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,510
So?

392
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,260
Just because Apo is here,

393
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,790
do things have to change between us?

394
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,290
Fay, you can have the bed.

395
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:37,680
I'll sleep on the couch.

396
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,720
I'll bring you the blanket.

397
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,400
Thanks.

398
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,270
Are you okay?

399
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,760
Why wouldn't I be?

400
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:07,990
Well...

401
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,350
Hey Apo,

402
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,510
ready for bed?

403
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:11,130
Yes,

404
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:12,690
you can leave the lights on.

405
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:13,450
It's fine.

406
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,470
I'm turning in as well.

407
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,570
Waii,

408
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,070
let's go to sleep.

409
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:19,550
Umm.

410
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:32,090
What are you doing?

411
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,660
Going to sleep.

412
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,930
Sleep here on the bed.

413
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:39,070
I feel like sleeping on the floor tonight.

414
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:51,070
Please turn off the lights.

415
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:23,380
Min!

416
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,970
You had to go back alone, didn't you?

417
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:29,440
You said no when I offered to walk you home.

418
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,790
I thought you said you could take care of yourself.

419
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,440
now you know it's dangerous to walk home alone.

420
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,820
I can take care of myself.

421
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:36,270
This is what you call taking care of yourself?

422
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:39,830
Argh!

423
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,660
Brutal.

424
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:46,390
What if

425
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,570
someone wants to take care of you?

426
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,850
Taking care of me?

427
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,010
Stalking me and

428
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,110
scaring me,

429
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,720
this is what you call taking care?

430
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:57,040
I was just kidding.

431
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,470
Everything is a joke to you.

432
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,820
It must be funny, huh?

433
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,620
What are you talking about?

434
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:03,260
I'm all confused.

435
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,620
What's on your mind?

436
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,120
Well...

437
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:20,950
Now you lost.

438
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,340
Let go.

439
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,940
You're spaced out.

440
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:35,890
I engaged you in conversation

441
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,790
and you're gone.

442
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,340
It's dangerous.

443
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,040
Are you having fun playing this game?

444
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,000
If you are,

445
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,730
you can play it alone.

446
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,830
I'm not having fun.

447
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:09,350
Waii!

448
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,220
Apo!

449
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:11,980
Why are you late?

450
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,190
You know how little time we have left to practice.

451
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:16,690
Go faster!

452
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:17,560
Faster!

453
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,800
You're the Captain.

454
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,270
You need to set a good example.

455
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:26,770
One,

456
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:27,880
two,

457
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:28,730
three,

458
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:29,630
four,

459
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:30,680
five,

460
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,600
six,

461
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,450
seven,

462
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,420
eight,

463
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,480
nine...

464
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,690
Three,

465
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,880
four,

466
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:37,440
five...

467
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,260
You're acting like you don't have the energy.

468
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:38,920
97,

469
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,400
98,

470
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,500
99,

471
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,950
100

472
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,860
Hey, you.

473
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,130
Are you mistaken?

474
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:03,880
There's no costume to make anymore.

475
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,230
That's not why I'm here.

476
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:08,150
This is odd.

477
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:09,570
I just don't see you here often.

478
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,210
This is not normal.

479
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,440
Keeping guard

480
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,560
to let them know what belongs to me.

481
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,300
It is crucial

482
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,400
not to let him out of my sight,

483
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,840
especially during this confusing time.

484
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:05,530
Smile.

485
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:06,880
Can I not smile?

486
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,540
Sure.

487
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:08,820
One, two, three.

488
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,330
Excuse me.

489
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:18,170
Why is your hair like this?

490
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,120
Why?

491
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,180
It's all messed up.

492
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:21,320
Wan!

493
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:21,880
Not nice.

494
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:22,920
Wan!

495
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:25,590
I thought

496
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:27,090
you said you didn't want anyone to take care of you.

497
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,770
Was it because you already have one?

498
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:29,450
Min.

499
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:30,210
Or

500
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:31,510
you can't just choose.

501
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:32,870
Do you want to be surrounded by guys

502
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,760
like you always have?

503
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,380
Min!

504
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:34,980
No!

505
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:36,940
You think you're so important.

506
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,300
Don't flatter yourself.

507
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:39,330
Min,

508
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,920
look what I'm doing now.

509
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,900
What are you doing?

510
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:45,920
He is my friend.

511
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,710
I'm modeling for him.

512
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,630
I'm sorry.

513
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,630
Let's take a 15-minute break.

514
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:54,350
I'm sorry.

515
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,150
Get it together, won't you?

516
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,130
Is what you said

517
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:04,620
how you see me all this time?

518
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:05,990
No.

519
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:07,650
No?

520
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,010
I think I get it now...

521
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,420
why you never opened up to me.

522
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:15,570
What?

523
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:17,850
Me not opening up?

524
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:20,710
Yes.

525
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,800
You've never

526
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,730
told me about

527
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:27,190
Coach Mai...

528
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,340
Your ex-girlfriend.

529
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:41,950
Wan!

530
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,660
How did you know about Mai?

531
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,360
You're not the only one who knows about it.

532
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,480
It's just me and...

533
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,480
And who?

534
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:55,770
What did she tell you?

535
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,360
Don't believe all of it.

536
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,210
I believe her more than you.

537
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,630
At least she didn't hide anything from me.

538
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:01,360
Hiding?

539
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:03,330
Me?

540
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,920
I wasn't trying to hide anything from you.

541
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:08,180
I just want to forget the whole thing,

542
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:10,670
like it never happened before.

543
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,840
That's all.

544
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,360
Why?

545
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,130
Because I want to have a fresh start.

546
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,000
A fresh start with you.

547
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,220
But I guess it will never happen.

548
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:30,000
I understand.

549
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:33,860
You probably won't trust me ever again.

550
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:38,910
Prove it.

551
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,740
Prove it to me.

552
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:44,500
If you want me to trust you,

553
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,500
show me

554
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,200
that you have nothing to hide.

555
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:52,630
If you want to start fresh with me,

556
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:55,170
talk to me when

557
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,320
you're sure about me.

558
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:03,880
Wan.

559
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,860
I'm so sorry, Achi,

560
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:19,740
for everything.

561
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:21,550
Isn't that way too easy?

562
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,010
Ever since Apo's in your life,

563
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:25,240
I've become an outsider.

564
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:41,410
Waii

565
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,040
kept calling me to say that

566
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:44,540
he needed to see him.

567
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,540
There must be a surprise.

568
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:49,690
Achi,

569
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:51,540
walk faster for me, please.

570
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,220
Here he is.

571
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:04,170
Where is P'Waii?

572
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:07,710
There.

573
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:10,080
Why, what?

574
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,150
That's Kluay.

575
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:12,580
Now that he's here,

576
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,680
please talk to him.

577
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:33,200
"I'm sorry, Achi"... Kluay.

578
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,330
Perfect.

579
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,680
Good luck.

580
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:50,110
Go for it.

581
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:55,290
I'm so sorry, Achi,

582
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:57,120
for everything.

583
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:59,230
Isn't that way too easy?

584
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:44,290
Swim to me.

585
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,330
No.

586
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:46,950
Swim,

587
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,610
will you or won't you?

588
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:56,790
Pan!

589
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:00,610
Pan!

590
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:01,110
Fah,

591
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,680
help!

592
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,900
Fah!

593
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,450
That's not hard, was it?

594
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:18,140
Hey!

595
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,360
You tricked me again.

596
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:20,370
I didn't trick you.
You tricked me again.

597
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:21,420
I didn't trick you.

598
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,510
I'm not going to help you again.

599
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:23,700
This is my order.

600
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:26,850
You will come to practice with me,

601
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:27,850
understand?

602
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,800
Both of us

603
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,360
will enter the competition.

604
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:36,490
Okay.

605
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:38,920
Was that so hard?

606
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,470
Are you doing it for real?

607
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:52,830
Yes, I am.

608
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:55,910
Fine.

609
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:03,570
You think this is so much of a sacrifice?

610
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:06,690
Compared to someone

611
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:07,950
who got splashed in the face

612
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:09,610
before the whole university.

613
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,720
Everyone looked at me like

614
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:12,810
I was a dumb sissy.

615
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,840
You doing this is worth forgiving?

616
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:30,890
Hello,

617
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:32,020
I'm Kluay

618
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:33,480
from the swimming club.

619
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,420
I want to apologize to you all.

620
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:05,020
This is nothing compared to

621
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:06,070
what I did.

622
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,730
I want to apologize to everyone,

623
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,850
to the fans

624
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,020
who missed out on an amazing play,

625
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:13,450
to the club

626
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:15,760
for messing things up,

627
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:17,290
to Top

628
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:18,550
and Ko.

629
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:20,730
I shouldn't have hit you.

630
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:24,050
I didn't have the right to do that.

631
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:26,730
Lastly,

632
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,490
I'm sorry, Achi,

633
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,160
for everything I put you through.

634
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,080
From now on, you can do what you want to me.

635
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:38,510
I won't fight.

636
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:41,690
Maximize this opportunity.

637
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,190
I give you my permission.

638
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:46,080
That's enough.

639
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:49,070
Do you forgive me?

640
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:53,050
You had me at apologies.

641
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,550
Oh so sweet.

642
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,190
Leave me out of this.

643
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:14,660
Thank you.

644
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:26,590
Aw, pinky promise.

645
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:51,950
Look at the pictures.

646
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:55,310
Good?

647
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,040
Nice shots.

648
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,180
Why are there only my pictures on your camera?

649
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,890
I like you.

650
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:09,140
Tim.

651
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,220
But,

652
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,020
But I know that you and Min...

653
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:15,070
There's nothing going on between Min and I.

654
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:22,700
But

655
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,930
I'm not ready for this with anyone.

656
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:27,020
I don't get it.

657
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:33,660
I'm not ready

658
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:34,980
to be involved with anyone.

659
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:38,690
But Min?

660
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:43,010
It's the same thing, isn't it?

661
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,760
Wouldn't it be better just to make things clear?

662
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:25,050
What are you doing?

663
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,680
Why is Apo's stuff over there?

664
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,480
I'm just organizing things.

665
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:36,450
It'd make things easy in case anyone moves out.

666
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,360
Move out where?

667
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,310
This is Apo's room.

668
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,760
I said, "just in case."

669
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:44,370
Isn't this a little too much?

670
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:45,990
What's your problem?

671
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:47,150
To be honest,

672
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,100
I don't know

673
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:50,940
what you're doing.

674
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,260
Why are you so attached

675
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,390
to me every step of the way?

676
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:55,810
You were never like this.

677
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:59,460
Could it be that you were never annoyed with me?

678
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:03,770
You didn't have Apo before.

679
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,720
This is outrageous.

680
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,880
Let's talk about it some other time.

681
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,170
Do you want to break up today to get it over with?

682
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:16,030
No need to wait to break up later,

683
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:17,870
so you can do whatever you want now,

684
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,330
and don't need to care about me.

685
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:21,900
Wait,

686
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,580
you already don't.

687
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:26,150
Let's

688
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:27,830
just do this for the sake of your peace of mind.

689
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:29,150
Don't  make things up.

690
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:30,850
Tell me I'm wrong.

691
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:32,950
Ever since Apo's in your life,

692
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:34,880
I've become an outsider.

693
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:37,400
An outsider to my own relationship.

694
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,380
Where do I fit in this picture?

695
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,310
I just have

696
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:45,860
a lot of things to figure out.

697
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:47,530
And

698
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:49,270
Apo gets me

699
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:51,410
the most.

700
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:54,490
Do you have feelings for him?

701
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,640
Tell me.

702
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:02,950
Do you?

703
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:05,150
Do you?

704
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:09,570
Do you?

705
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:10,070
Tell me.

706
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:11,550
Do you have feelings for him?

707
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:16,840
I get now

708
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:21,570
how you must have felt when Kan betrayed you.

709
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:26,690
It hurts like this.

710
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,280
Fay!

711
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:29,580
Fay!

712
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:30,930
I am sorry.

713
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:31,770
Let me go!

714
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:34,700
I'll stop.

715
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:40,370
I'll stop whatever this is.

716
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:44,930
I can't let you go.

717
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:47,150
I won't let you down,

718
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:48,230
not anymore.

719
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:16,450
"Maybe the reason we go back to our old path is that we're afraid of better opportunities."
