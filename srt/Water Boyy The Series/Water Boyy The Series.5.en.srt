1
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,680
He's in love, like you are.

2
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,460
You think it's the same thing?

3
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:27,340
If I can help,

4
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,639
will you accept me as a member of the club?

5
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,260
You being all nice to me was quite telling.

6
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,320
You don't have to quit.

7
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:40,139
Coach has already resigned.

8
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,200
A letter from the Student Body.

9
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:53,319
This year our university will host the Inter-university Sports Competition.

10
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:58,199
The Student Body would like to ask a representative from the swimming club

11
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:03,919
to attend a task delegation meeting.

12
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:07,019
Who would want to attend the meeting?

13
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,800
This is ridiculous.

14
00:03:11,979 --> 00:03:15,379
Well, since we are all here, let's do a proper voting.

15
00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:18,039
Who here thinks we shouldn't give a shit about this?

16
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,420
One vote from me.

17
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:24,120
Where is Pan?

18
00:03:24,259 --> 00:03:27,060
She is late again.

19
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,680
It's fine. She's definitely on the same page with us

20
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,960
I'll vote for her.

21
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,879
This is unanimous. Let's move on to the next matter.

22
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,480
We have one person whose hand is not up.

23
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:49,639
I don't agree.

24
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,400
Not agree or you just want to stir some shit up.

25
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,680
P'Pan.

26
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,060
Oh, Namkhaeng.

27
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:24,659
How did you get here?

28
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,240
Who's that girl?

29
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,420
What girl?

30
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,139
The one P'Fah is buying gifts for

31
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,279
Who is she? Where did she come from?

32
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,500
How did they meet?

33
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,720
Is she a slut or what?

34
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,519
Or does she do some dark magic?

35
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:40,639
Is she cute? Compared to me, who is more beautiful?

36
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:42,759
Hold on, Namkhaeng.

37
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:44,459
Will you or will you not tell me?

38
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:48,039
I have something that I need to tend to.

39
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,079
Let's talk about this some other time.

40
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,379
P'Pan.

41
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,220
Honestly, I swear on my honor...

42
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,720
I will just sit here then.

43
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:10,500
What are you doing?

44
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,339
Do you watch too much Chinese period dramas?

45
00:05:12,339 --> 00:05:15,299
I will stay here night and day.

46
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:21,000
Don't do this. It breaks my heart.

47
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,980
Huh?

48
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,100
I mean...

49
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,300
if you want to sit here, sit away.

50
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,240
I'll come back later.

51
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,939
If you're still here, I'll tell you.

52
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,819
Are you serious?

53
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,660
Will you tell me everything when you come back?

54
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,779
Everything?

55
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,239
Yes. What he does, where he goes, with whom...

56
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,460
What he eats, how he walks, how he breathes

57
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,360
You're his close friend. You must know this kind of things

58
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:51,899
Very close.

59
00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:55,920
Are you going to sit here for real?

60
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:57,839
Right here?

61
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:58,819
Yes.

62
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,180
All day?

63
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:01,479
Of course.

64
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,780
Our club is under scrutiny

65
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:11,259
If we skip the meeting,

66
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,340
it will give Wan an excuse to bring us down.

67
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:16,039
And we have to give in to her?

68
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,000
That's weak.

69
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,220
I'm not afraid of her.

70
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,939
But someone should attend a meeting to speak for us,

71
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:23,579
find a good reason to turn her down.

72
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:25,819
It's better than to hide.

73
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:27,099
It's true.

74
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,560
I think what Min said makes sense

75
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:33,159
You go then.

76
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,379
So, you accept me as a club member now

77
00:06:36,379 --> 00:06:39,319
If I don't accept you, will you go away then?

78
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:41,000
Who are you to fire me?

79
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,500
You're so annoying.

80
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:44,139
Kluay!

81
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,479
His name is listed as a member, so he is a member.

82
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:54,359
Your name is listed, but it doesn't mean you're one of us, got it?

83
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,620
How about this?

84
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:06,180
If you want everyone to accept you and your idea, prove it.

85
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:10,420
If you think attending the meeting will help us, go.

86
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,240
We'll see how it plays out.

87
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,779
But if it doesn't work out like you said,

88
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,280
you know what will happen.

89
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,459
Who agrees with Apo?

90
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:36,939
We conclude that Min will be our representative

91
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:38,860
to attend the meeting with the Student Body.

92
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,699
This meeting is dissolved.

93
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:45,199
Dissolving.

94
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,959
Aren't you going to talk about the club issues?

95
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,580
What issues?

96
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,080
Coach is gone.

97
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,580
I can take care of the club.

98
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,859
No need to burden anyone with this

99
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,140
Has Coach been in touch?

100
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,660
Would you stop asking about Coach?

101
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,220
What are you worried about?

102
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,400
You...

103
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:34,299
dealing with what's going on in the club.

104
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,140
Well, speaking of which... here it is.

105
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,360
Make copies for everyone.

106
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,279
This is the new practice schedule.

107
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,340
We can survive without a coach.

108
00:08:57,899 --> 00:08:59,579
Fah, come here.

109
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:02,579
I have a question.

110
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,060
I've been wondering for so long.

111
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,039
What happened between Kluay and Min during high school?

112
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:08,639
Do you know? Tell me.

113
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,320
I don't know.

114
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,980
Come on. Tell me.

115
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,460
Don't pry into other's business.

116
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:18,120
You're calling me nosy?

117
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,559
I have to go. I've got a test.

118
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,639
See you.

119
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,100
You're not going to tell me?

120
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,759
No. I don't know anything.

121
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:06,960
Excuse me, you dropped something.

122
00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:25,279
Thank you.

123
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:30,620
Don't mention it.

124
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,120
Well, do you know where the Rector's office is?

125
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:42,980
The Rector's office is that way.

126
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:49,679
Or is it that way?

127
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,500
I'm sorry. I'm not sure about it.

128
00:10:58,179 --> 00:11:00,679
I have to go and see for myself, just to be sure.

129
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,259
I can accompany you there.

130
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:08,419
I'd rather not bother you.

131
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:11,000
You can have all the time to think it through.

132
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:20,919
Once you know for sure, line me.

133
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,259
No one from the swimming club is here.

134
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:52,320
Put a note in bold that the swimming team is not cooperative

135
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:55,059
Excuse me for being late.

136
00:11:57,879 --> 00:11:58,759
Hi.

137
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:04,679
Since the rep is here, let's start the meeting.

138
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,559
Excuse me.

139
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,000
In case you need a backup.

140
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,340
Thank you.

141
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:21,239
But dealing with Wan is a piece of cake.

142
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,159
First agenda is...

143
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:28,419
Before we start, the swimming team would like to inform you that

144
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,340
we have an important competition coming up.

145
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:35,779
We need to practice very hard...

146
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,819
That's awesome. You are a true sportsman.

147
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,820
With your busy schedule, you still want to help with the uni's work.

148
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,639
It is not true what they say about the swimming team being selfish

149
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,720
Actually no. We...

150
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,399
If you want to help out so bad, now is your chance.

151
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:57,039
The swimming team will do a dance to mark the opening

152
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:58,659
Dance?

153
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,080
Dance.

154
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:01,939
Wait...

155
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:05,620
Why? You don't need to look so happy.

156
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,360
You have been assigned a task.

157
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,840
Don't disappoint the Rector for the second time

158
00:13:13,179 --> 00:13:14,539
I trust you with this

159
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:21,979
Let's move onto the next agenda.

160
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,580
Are you up for it?

161
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:24,919
Yes.

162
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:26,139
Good job

163
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,980
How did you get here?

164
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,720
This is a restricted area.

165
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,679
It's a good size.

166
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:36,259
Don't.

167
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,470
What are you doing?

168
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,160
Looking for a diet plan?

169
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,100
I'm looking for a meal plan for swimmers like you guys.

170
00:13:58,290 --> 00:13:59,990
Wow...

171
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,500
you are not kidding around.

172
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,450
It's no surprise that you're Coach Tee's son.

173
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,520
I'm sorry.

174
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,760
What's wrong?

175
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:15,730
Nothing.

176
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,190
Are you mad?

177
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:22,040
No. I'm puzzled.

178
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,490
If it were someone else, I'd be mad

179
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,630
But it's you.

180
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,880
Guys!

181
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:38,750
I just met this hot girl.

182
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,010
She's the mother of my child for sure.

183
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,670
You always say that.

184
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,200
This must be the 16th girl.

185
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:48,000
But this girl is the real deal, I can assure you

186
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:49,190
Who is she?

187
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,860
I don't know

188
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:55,800
But it's okay. Put has her Line contact

189
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,080
Let me see.

190
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,630
No way.

191
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,700
Guys!

192
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,020
What now?

193
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,430
I met a hot girl.

194
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,550
A hot girl?

195
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,840
Yours can't be as hot as mine.

196
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,770
That I don't know. But mine is swimming over there.

197
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:15,860
Let's check her out.

198
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,490
Where?

199
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,360
Are you sure it's not Pan?

200
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,820
I can tell the difference between a surfboard and a girl

201
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,130
Let's go.

202
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:38,720
Who is this?

203
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,360
I don't know. She's so hot.

204
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,110
Is she hotter than yours?

205
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,750
As hot as mine.

206
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:57,920
Huh?

207
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,580
Same girl.

208
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,110
How did you get here?

209
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:41,790
I walked.

210
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:45,630
This is a restricted area.

211
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,770
Not for a new coach, though

212
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,470
A new coach?

213
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,050
Hello, everyone.

214
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,990
My name is Mai. I'm replacing Coach Tee.

215
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,890
Coach Tee...

216
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,630
Just call me Mai. I'm relaxed and laid-back.

217
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,720
Don't tell me your names now.

218
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,340
We can learn about each other as we go

219
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:14,510
There's plenty of time to get to know each other.

220
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,300
Are we all here?

221
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,490
One is missing.

222
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,780
He's here just in time.

223
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,410
This is our new coach.

224
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,340
Hi, Coach.

225
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,600
Hi, Min.

226
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,750
Go change and start our practice.

227
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,230
Go and change.

228
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:09,050
I'm ticklish.

229
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:14,910
Do you think there's something strange about the new coach?

230
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,590
Strange,

231
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,550
unique and cute.

232
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:28,790
I didn't mean her appearance. I mean she's a little off

233
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:32,210
I don't think so. She seems dedicated.

234
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:38,270
Min, what do you think?

235
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,030
I don't know.

236
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,590
Where are you going?

237
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,820
I'm going to clear things up with Wan about the club.

238
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,990
What's up?

239
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,630
Don't worry. He'll handle it.

240
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,170
Wait!

241
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,080
I'm finished.

242
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,610
Wait for me!

243
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,670
Can I borrow shampoo?

244
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,300
Can I?

245
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,990
I mean the shampoo.

246
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,470
Of course.

247
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,340
It's a good size.

248
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:36,830
I mean the shampoo.

249
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,220
Wait for me.

250
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,150
Keep it. I'm not in a hurry to use.

251
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:51,120
I mean wait for me to finish my shower.

252
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,680
We can grab dinner together.

253
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,170
Okay.

254
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,380
Hey, you.

255
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:16,650
Did you bring it?

256
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,740
What?

257
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,030
The diary.

258
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,940
This is a lot.

259
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:47,470
You told me to write everything about me

260
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:51,020
This is me over 20 years.

261
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:53,050
I can't just write it in two pages.

262
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,050
Your detailed background in brief.

263
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:58,170
What do you want?

264
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:00,830
This is good. Why do you want it in brief?

265
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:07,550
You used to have crooked teeth.

266
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:12,500
Thank you so much, my dear friend.

267
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,730
Don't you feel weird saying this?

268
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:22,470
Actually yes. But for my dear Namkhaeng,

269
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:29,820
I'd let you be my best friend.

270
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,670
Read it to me.

271
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,320
No. I wrote all of this for you.

272
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,020
Do I need to read it to you as well?

273
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:44,150
But it's a lot. I'm too lazy to read it.

274
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:45,710
Read it to me.

275
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,790
Read it yourself.

276
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:51,970
Are you or are you not going to read it?

277
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:59,680
This is the last time that I do things for you.

278
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:01,550
Do you dare to go against me?

279
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,320
Aren't you afraid I'll rat you out?

280
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:11,130
You wouldn't want anyone to find out

281
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,640
what you stole from Coach Tee's folder, would you?

282
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:16,830
Are you or are you not going to read it?

283
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,260
No.

284
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,180
You can tell on me all you want.

285
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:28,140
Coach Tee isn't here.

286
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,270
Oh, sweet freedom.

287
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,240
Wait,

288
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:39,950
aren't you forgetting something?

289
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:40,970
What?

290
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,430
I can overpower you.

291
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:45,730
Come here.

292
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:47,230
No.

293
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:49,280
Are you going to read it on the ground or in the pool?

294
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,160
No

295
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,180
Come here. Go into the pool. Go.

296
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,450
Are you afraid?

297
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:00,590
Go. It's just water. What are you so afraid of?

298
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,430
Go!

299
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,830
No!

300
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,000
Don't!

301
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,940
If you ever do this to me again, I will not be friends with you.

302
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:19,050
Don't come to me about Namkhaeng.

303
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,970
Read the diary yourself, but don't expect me to be your friend.

304
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,380
Fah can swim?

305
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,440
He's a swimmer in the school team.

306
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:39,860
Is this why you tried so hard to involve the swimming club?

307
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,780
Wow! This room?

308
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,720
This room.

309
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:17,520
Seriously, will you dance for the opening ceremony?

310
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,540
It's an order from you, My Lady.

311
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,490
Who can say no to that?

312
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:31,410
Can we use the stereo from this room?

313
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,560
What is your play here?

314
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,430
Why?

315
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:44,200
Us working together means we can spend time together.

316
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,000
I don't believe your team will dance.

317
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:54,380
Or if you prefer, you can ask someone else to do this.

318
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:00,410
Do you think you can get me to let you off?

319
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:02,100
Hear this.

320
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:09,620
I will do whatever it takes to make a fool of all of you.

321
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:13,110
What is wrong with you?

322
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,640
Seriously, what did the swimming team ever do to you?

323
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:21,530
Why are you out to get us?

324
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:26,330
Has your heart been broken by someone in the team?

325
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,210
Is that it?

326
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,750
Maybe.

327
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:40,330
This is the budget for your performance?

328
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,660
Yes.

329
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,530
Can we get it disbursed today?

330
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:45,970
Don't you think this is a little too high?

331
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:46,910
No.

332
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,470
Your 5 minute-performance costs THB 60,000?

333
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:52,750
Min said Wan told us to spare no expense.

334
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,170
Wan said that?

335
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:57,520
I don't believe Wan would give this much money to the swimming club.

336
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,830
This is not going to work. The cost is too high

337
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,590
Let us consult with Wan.

338
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,170
Can you do it now?

339
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,980
I want to start preparing the props and all.

340
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,700
Wan isn't here.

341
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,160
She is with Min in the rehearsal room

342
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,610
Do you want to talk to her now?

343
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:30,770
You will help me now, right?

344
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:33,270
I am helping you.

345
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,990
Who is that girl?

346
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,110
I can't tell you. Fah will be mad at me.

347
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,270
You said you would help.

348
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:45,390
When he was in high school, he never looked at any girl.

349
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:48,050
All he did was studying and swimming.

350
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,680
Wait, swimming?

351
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:56,460
Fah can swim?

352
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,240
Are you guys really best friends?

353
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,240
He's a swimmer in the school team.

354
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,670
Wan is in the rehearsal room?

355
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,580
Yes, with Min.

356
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,360
Jus the two of them?

357
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,170
Yes

358
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:16,250
They always have one-on-one meetings.

359
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,980
Almost there. Do it.

360
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:41,270
What's that?

361
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:42,690
What?

362
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,080
That!

363
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,200
Look over there.

364
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:47,650
This is not funny.

365
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:48,670
This is not a prank.

366
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:50,260
Go see for yourself.

367
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,390
You go.

368
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,800
Have a look.

369
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,460
Yes, I just saw something.

370
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,800
Where?

371
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:23,470
This room.

372
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,150
Hold on, shouldn't we make an appointment with Wan later?

373
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:34,500
If you barge in, she'll think that we don't trust her.

374
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,920
I don't think you want to have problems with her.

375
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,100
True.

376
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,890
What the hell was that?

377
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:04,200
No, I did see something.

378
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,440
I helped you.

379
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,890
There's no need for you to yell at me.

380
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:13,320
You pulled my arm with force. It hurt.

381
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:23,680
Wait, don't you want to see me practice my dance?

382
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,960
Practice on your own.

383
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:46,890
What are you doing here?

384
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,760
We have something to talk to you.

385
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,530
Wan! Wan!

386
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,380
Hi.

387
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,710
Why did you leave suddenly?

388
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:57,880
I didn't even finish....

389
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,060
I didn't know you're so close to the swimming club.

390
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:07,100
Is this why you tried so hard to involve the swimming club?

391
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,030
And give them a lot of money.

392
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:21,970
It's not what you think.

393
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,460
Guys.

394
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,440
Don't.

395
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,350
What are you doing here?

396
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,160
Do you really want to know?

397
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,480
Leave if you want.

398
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,670
Are you sure?

399
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,340
Captain Waii really brings it this time.

400
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:20,100
Sure, I do

401
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,560
Why did you buy butter?

402
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:24,250
For bread spread.

403
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,850
No. Butter has a lot of fat.

404
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,390
When a competition is near,

405
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,160
it's recommended to use honey or jelly instead.

406
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,760
By whom?

407
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,520
The author of the research that I read.

408
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:39,710
You takes this seriously.

409
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,200
What else does it say?

410
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,850
When the race is coming up,

411
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:45,070
swimmers must maintain body fluid at a proper level.

412
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:50,450
Eat just enough to keep the normal blood sugar level.

413
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:54,570
Don't eat too much. It will ruin your performance.

414
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:58,290
What's so funny?

415
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,710
I thought I'm with an encyclopedia.

416
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,510
Lots of knowledge coming from you.

417
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:07,100
Actually, you don't need to go through all this trouble.

418
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,880
We have a new coach.

419
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:13,790
I don't trust her.

420
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,200
I don't know. It's just a feeling

421
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,490
You're right

422
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:20,430
No one is as good as Coach Tee,

423
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,850
except his son

424
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,120
Want some banana?

425
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,990
I don't want to eat your leftover.

426
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,400
Bullshit.

427
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:43,990
Did the research say what kind of fluid swimmers should drink, Dr. Waii?

428
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:46,950
What kind of fluid?

429
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,990
Like fruit juice.

430
00:33:53,430 --> 00:34:00,120
Oh, it's better to eat fruits, 0% fat milk, or mineral drinks.

431
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:01,250
Yes, sir.

432
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,400
Very good.

433
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,540
You don't eat a banana, right?

434
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,980
Have the peel, then.

435
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:11,490
I'm leaving.

436
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,620
You can leave.

437
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,120
Leave where?

438
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,800
Leave the club.

439
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:27,550
Why?

440
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:30,180
You're here because of Coach Tee.

441
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,870
He's not here now.

442
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,810
You don't have to stay.

443
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:37,970
Are you sure?

444
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:41,780
Yes. It's your life. No one can force you to do anything.

445
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:46,610
I'm here, not because anyone forces me.

446
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:50,180
It's true that I'm here because of Coach Tee.

447
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:57,180
But what makes me happy is you,

448
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:04,530
and everyone.

449
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:08,280
Everyone in the team is my friend.

450
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:10,460
I can't leave you all

451
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:13,110
Oh yeah?

452
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:19,060
I'm telling you, you can't get rid of me that easily.

453
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,430
I have a thick skin

454
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:31,830
It's true. You have a thick skin.

455
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,060
Did you just hit me?

456
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,020
Yeah.

457
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:39,350
Yeah.

458
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:45,090
Help, someone stole my bag! Help

459
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:47,530
Stop! Did you steal a bag?

460
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,340
Return it to the owner.

461
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:53,360
If your parents find out, they will be devastated.

462
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:57,460
If there's something valuable in the bag, the owner will be very sad.

463
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,310
What if your bag gets stolen?

464
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,530
What does the owner have to do to get it back?

465
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,290
Return the bag.

466
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:06,870
How can you take the bag from the owner?

467
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,810
You're good at this.

468
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,680
Why?

469
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,020
You yelled at him until he gave up and ran away.

470
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,180
The same goes to you.

471
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,520
What a mouth we have.

472
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:16,010
Enough.

473
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:18,810
Hey, is this your bag?

474
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,320
Why do you never go into the pool?

475
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,150
You are a part of the swimming club.

476
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:26,400
I'm an academic advisor.

477
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,590
So? You can go in.

478
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,030
I don't know how to swim.

479
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,380
You're good.

480
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:35,030
What?

481
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,410
You don't know how to swim but you were a swimmer for your school.

482
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:40,580
Who told you?

483
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,260
It's true, isn't it?

484
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:45,310
Why do you lie to everyone?

485
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,020
Pretend you don't know how to swim.

486
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:50,190
Why did you apply to be in the swimming team?

487
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:54,090
I'm going to do some homework

488
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,020
Stop.

489
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:05,310
I said I didn't lie. What else do you want?

490
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,660
You'll find out.

491
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:17,090
Give it back.

492
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:35,110
Swim. You were a swimmer, weren't you?

493
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:42,250
Fah, this is not funny.

494
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,760
Fah! Fah!

495
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,400
Fah!

496
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:01,620
Wake up! This is not funny.

497
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,790
Fah!

498
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:36,520
You're okay

499
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:49,910
Thank you

500
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:55,250
I'd be in a lot of trouble if it weren't for both of you.

501
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:58,440
I'm sorry that we didn't catch the bad guy.

502
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,840
He ran away.

503
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,780
Just getting my bag back is enough.

504
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:09,650
My stuff in the bag is not expensive.

505
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,030
But they have sentimental value to me

506
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:21,500
Can I buy you dinner to say thank you?

507
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:25,400
That's not necessary.

508
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:34,630
Think of it as keeping me company over dinner.

509
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,780
Don't you have any friends?

510
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:45,670
I'm old and blind. Who would want me as a friend?

511
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:52,780
Not true. I'm sure you have many fun stories to tell.

512
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:56,760
Somebody said that to me once.

513
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:03,790
But that person isn't around to listen to my stories.

514
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,520
Where did they go?

515
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,340
That person died,

516
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:20,080
but never left me.

517
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:24,390
They're always here

518
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:27,290
and in here.

519
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:29,810
In your bag?

520
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:36,170
I used to have a lot of friends.

521
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:41,880
But after an accident that cost me both eyes,

522
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:44,430
I had fewer friends.

523
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:49,280
Only a few were left to stand beside me.

524
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,520
One of them was the person who gave this ring to me

525
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:59,080
I bet she was very beautiful

526
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:05,530
For me, that person was...

527
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,600
the most handsome.

528
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:18,470
When my day was dark and I was abandoned by others

529
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:22,520
only he was there by my side.

530
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:31,000
It made me realize that losing everything is not all bad.

531
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:38,030
At least, I knew who really loved me.

532
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:43,650
I was not possessive of anything in the bag.

533
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,980
I don't care about the money

534
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:49,240
It's the ring

535
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:52,780
that I care about.

536
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:57,850
Thank you for giving it back to me.

537
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:01,700
No problem. Thank you for sharing the story with us.

538
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:05,640
Thank you for not pushing me away.

539
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:13,150
I am old, blind and now this.

540
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:17,670
Trust me, love...

541
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:21,780
knows no bounds.

542
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:29,740
It's about here, not here.

543
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:33,840
Although we try to run away from it,

544
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:39,050
it stays in here forever.

545
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:43,200
I'm glad I met you both.

546
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:48,530
It's time for me to go.

547
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:53,670
One, two, three.

548
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:04,900
I wish long-lasting love for the two of you.

549
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,400
Uncle...

550
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,070
It's not like that.

551
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:11,450
They say a blind man has the sixth sense.

552
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:20,470
I hope you take care of each other for as long as you can

553
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:22,380
I have to go.

554
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:49,710
Here are the documents that you asked for.

555
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:01,260
I have to go to class.

556
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:02,550
Go.

557
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:06,760
I can just sign my name.

558
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,930
Only sign your name and skip class?

559
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:14,020
I'd rather do something else.

560
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:16,840
Do what?

561
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:18,760
Practice swimming

562
00:44:19,330 --> 00:44:20,570
I'm signing off.

563
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:31,910
Go to class already.

564
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:39,690
What are you doing here?

565
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:41,090
I'm here to coach.

566
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,860
Why here?

567
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,120
Do you really want to know?

568
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:56,000
Because you are here

569
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:04,120
Do whatever you want.

570
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,670
Just don't mess things up.

571
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:25,830
"Don't wait for things to happen. Make it happen by yourself."
