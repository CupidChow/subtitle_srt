1
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,580
Our budget has been cut for months.

2
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:18,079
We need to mobilize funds.

3
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,960
Cinderella!

4
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:24,039
Look at her flirting with the prince.

5
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:24,919
What a slut!

6
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,139
Crushing hard.

7
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,860
I'm going to play with this sissy instead.

8
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:34,280
I wouldn't let anyone hurt my boy.

9
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,439
Can't let them hurt my reputation.

10
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,400
In this scene, after the clock strikes midnight,

11
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,819
Cinderella will jump into the pool.

12
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:47,120
Then, Pan...

13
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:50,519
Where is she?

14
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:53,500
Pan!

15
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,680
She must be with Namkhaeng.

16
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,140
Whatever.

17
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,900
Apo, tell Pan that

18
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,939
she will not be swimming normally.

19
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:06,719
She will have to be underwater for a long time.

20
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:07,719
Then...

21
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,919
The Prince will follow her into the pool.

22
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:18,319
They both will emerge together in the middle of the pool.

23
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,200
Pan, then, will dive underwater again to get away from the Prince,

24
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:23,900
leaving the Prince all alone.

25
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,300
To make sure that we all get that,

26
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,419
let's  do a blocking rehearsal.

27
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,500
Stand up.

28
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,840
The palace is so extravagantly huge, my Daughters.

29
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,240
How fabulous!

30
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:55,319
So fabulous, Mother.

31
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,259
Where is Cinderella?

32
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,379
I think she's over there.

33
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:04,840
No, she's not there.

34
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,120
Or maybe she's over here.

35
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,879
There she is.

36
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:13,159
OMG!

37
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,240
She's in her full-on slut mode.

38
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,300
Wench!

39
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,680
Yes, Mother.

40
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,680
Tramp!

41
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:25,339
Hoe!

42
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:27,699
Good one, Mother.

43
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:32,399
The Prince is here.

44
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:37,039
No! I can't take it.

45
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,839
Look at her flirting.

46
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,579
Such a slut!

47
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:46,699
It's midnight.

48
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:47,939
I have to go.

49
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:48,719
Hold on.

50
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,140
I have to go.

51
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:53,059
No, I have to leave. It's midnight.

52
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,220
I'm going to jump.

53
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,680
Where are you going?

54
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,120
No, don't hold me back.

55
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,579
Do you think it's okay to keep running away?

56
00:05:00,579 --> 00:05:01,199
Kan,

57
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,079
what the hell?

58
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:04,459
Do you think I'm enjoying this?

59
00:05:04,459 --> 00:05:05,899
What the hell are you talking about?

60
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,739
Now I'm lost.

61
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:12,240
This must be a reinterpretation of the script.

62
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,120
I don't think so.

63
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,660
No,

64
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,740
he's totally going off script.

65
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,480
And he's not talking to Cinderella,

66
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,160
but that one.

67
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:25,019
Kan,

68
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,100
what the hell are you doing?

69
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,120
Enough!

70
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:38,379
That got your attention, huh?

71
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,720
Don't keep running away.

72
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,980
Enough.

73
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,459
If I don't talk now,

74
00:05:44,774 --> 00:05:45,774
you can't run anymore.

75
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:47,459
Talk about what?

76
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:48,579
You told me that

77
00:05:48,579 --> 00:05:50,519
I can only talk during rehearsal.

78
00:05:51,939 --> 00:05:53,100
If I don't talk now,

79
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,800
when will I get you to listen?

80
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,280
Shut the hell up.

81
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:00,120
You do nothing but running from problems.

82
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,399
Run from Coach.

83
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,620
Run from me.

84
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:04,819
You fixate on the thought that others betray you.

85
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,580
Do you have any idea

86
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,019
how you hurt others?

87
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,639
You hurt your dad.

88
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,300
Has that ever crossed your mind?

89
00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:14,439
It's because of you,

90
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:15,360
asshole.

91
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,439
Calm down.

92
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:20,759
Take it easy.

93
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:25,420
Stop it.

94
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:30,379
You can never be the team captain.

95
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:33,019
You can't even face your own,

96
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:34,879
How can you fix the team's problems

97
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:41,039
Bitch, that hurt.

98
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:02,819
Aren't you going to say something?

99
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,680
Nah,

100
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,860
I'd rather hear you say it.

101
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:12,459
If Dad said something like that,

102
00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:14,459
it'd be good.

103
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:26,079
Have you ever given him a chance to say it?

104
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,980
If you said something now,

105
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,980
it'd be just excuses.

106
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:36,180
They both made a decision

107
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,019
and expected me to just accept it.

108
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:41,240
They treated me like I wasn't his son,

109
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,540
and wasn't his best friend.

110
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,800
If they don't care about you,

111
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,564
why would Coach resign

112
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:51,759
and why would Kan come here to get an earful from you?

113
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,279
They're mental.

114
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,739
Waii.

115
00:07:57,819 --> 00:08:00,620
In your view, Kan never gave you a chance to be involved.

116
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,319
He's trying to fix this now.

117
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,780
It's up to you

118
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,879
to decide whether to give him a chance.

119
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,220
I'm sorry.

120
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,079
What do you expect me to say?

121
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:49,100
"Hey"

122
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:50,665
"I'm sorry"

123
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:53,779
"Let's be friends again."

124
00:08:54,059 --> 00:08:55,119
Is that it?

125
00:08:55,379 --> 00:08:56,899
I know that you wouldn't forgive me.

126
00:08:56,899 --> 00:08:58,439
You seem to know everything.

127
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,460
Yet, you did it anyway.

128
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,559
What's the frigging point?

129
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,920
Do you remember my parents?

130
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,720
I told you that my parents lived in Chiang Mai.

131
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,120
They would come visit me every weekend.

132
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,340
What's your point?

133
00:09:14,539 --> 00:09:15,639
I lied!

134
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:18,139
All of it was a lie.

135
00:09:19,085 --> 00:09:20,225
I don't have parents.

136
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,159
I don't have a house in Chiang Mai.

137
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,139
I don't have a home to go back to.

138
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:26,539
I don't have a family waiting for me to come home.

139
00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:28,279
I don't have anything.

140
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:30,299
But I met your parents.

141
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,879
Those are my aunt and uncle.

142
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:33,399
They're the ones who raised me.

143
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:36,379
They're okay with me calling them mom and dad.

144
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:40,100
They took pity on me – an abandoned child.

145
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:42,399
so that,

146
00:09:42,754 --> 00:09:45,914
There's no need for them to love me like their own.

147
00:09:47,634 --> 00:09:49,194
When I met Coach Tee,

148
00:09:50,195 --> 00:09:51,315
it's the first time

149
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:53,939
I experienced love and warmth.

150
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:56,599
And you had to keep him all to yourself.

151
00:09:56,659 --> 00:09:58,079
That wasn't my intention.

152
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,920
I didn't think you'd want to know.

153
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:03,019
But I will tell now.

154
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,360
I love Coach Tee.

155
00:10:05,784 --> 00:10:07,164
I love you.

156
00:10:10,455 --> 00:10:12,264
You are my first true friend.

157
00:10:14,674 --> 00:10:16,754
How come you never told me about this?

158
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,540
I was afraid that you'd hate me.

159
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,220
Now I am not afraid anymore.

160
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,980
It's understandable for you to hate me.

161
00:10:23,179 --> 00:10:25,079
But don't hate Coach Tee.

162
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,120
He didn't do anything wrong.

163
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,139
He loves you so much.

164
00:10:31,254 --> 00:10:32,644
That is none of your business.

165
00:10:34,419 --> 00:10:36,319
Are you done with your story?

166
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,680
Thank you

167
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,500
for talking to me.

168
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:53,559
I know now that

169
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:56,439
I was wrong.

170
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:05,860
Tomorrow's rehearsal is at 10, right?

171
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,620
Umm.

172
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,840
Are you ready?

173
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:33,860
Hurry up.

174
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,860
Put, Sung, Kluay, come here.

175
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,059
Come on.

176
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:37,979
You've rehearsed this many times.

177
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,120
Are you still shy?

178
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,460
Says someone who isn't wearing this.

179
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:41,899
I've worn it before.

180
00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:43,259
It wasn't that embarrassing.

181
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:46,559
Where is Pan?

182
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,460
P'Pan,

183
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,200
come here.

184
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:54,399
Come on.

185
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,279
You look great.

186
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,360
Yeah, right.

187
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:23,360
I'll help out at the front desk.

188
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:25,039
Knock them dead!

189
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:26,679
You look so pretty in a dress.

190
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,779
Come on, guys.

191
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:32,439
All right.

192
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,539
This is it.

193
00:12:35,965 --> 00:12:38,764
Big thanks to all of you for doing this.

194
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,620
Our club will go on.

195
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,080
Today will be great.

196
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,820
I can feel it.

197
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:50,059
Let's get this over with.

198
00:12:50,059 --> 00:12:51,299
I feel pretty airy down there.

199
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:52,879
I need to put on some pants.

200
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,680
I'm not wearing any pants either.

201
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,654
Come on.

202
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,460
1, 2, 3

203
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,680
Hey!

204
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,240
Here's the program.

205
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,240
Please enjoy the show.

206
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,240
Enjoy the show.

207
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,740
Wan,

208
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:18,100
this is nerve racking.

209
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,879
Such a huge turnout.

210
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:20,799
This is right up your alley.

211
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,279
Lots of girls here.

212
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:27,199
Well,

213
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,100
I am pleased indeed.

214
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,900
But

215
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:36,559
Only one girl gets my attention.

216
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,820
I really don't know who's coming.

217
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:48,340
What about Coach Mai?

218
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,259
Have you checked on her?

219
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Can I leave this with you?

220
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,179
Don't.

221
00:13:56,179 --> 00:13:57,439
Let me do it.

222
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,440
Here's the program.

223
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:00,539
Please enjoy the show.

224
00:14:00,835 --> 00:14:01,835
Thank you.

225
00:14:01,835 --> 00:14:03,835
Have fun.

226
00:14:06,955 --> 00:14:07,955
Wan,

227
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,299
the show is about to start.

228
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,299
I'll pop to the toilet.

229
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,080
Kluay,

230
00:14:25,659 --> 00:14:27,860
if you don't want to see your girlfriend get beat up,

231
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,860
come out now.

232
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:32,359
Have you ever been this close to a girl?

233
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,420
Hello to all of you who's watching my live streaming.

234
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:52,540
This is Kan.

235
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,980
I just want to tell you that

236
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:57,360
the swimming club's play is about to start.

237
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,160
If you have the ticket,

238
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:58,960
get to the venue now.

239
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,460
If you don't,

240
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,600
you can buy it at the front desk.

241
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,970
See you all.

242
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,890
This is our stage.

243
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:06,650
It's not sold out yet.

244
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,570
You can still make it.

245
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:10,250
You can get the ticket here, but hurry.

246
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,290
Quite a few people are already here.

247
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,640
What's up?

248
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:17,370
Look at him.

249
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,480
He's playing with the camera.

250
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,070
He didn't use to be like that.

251
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,120
People change.

252
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,140
You've changed.

253
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:32,470
You're right.

254
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,470
I look more handsome, right?

255
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,190
Were you such a bad joke teller?

256
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,100
No

257
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:44,570
No way.

258
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:46,520
What was that then?

259
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,420
I only tell bad jokes to you.

260
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,240
Let's talk.

261
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,660
Not you.

262
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,190
I meant Apo.

263
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,420
I have to go get ready soon.

264
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,840
Hope to see all of you.

265
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,320
Where's your boyfriend?

266
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:28,990
What boyfriend?

267
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,910
Don't be a jerk.

268
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,150
Son of a bitch!

269
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:31,940
Easy.

270
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,490
The boy is just shy.

271
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,210
It's okay.

272
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,470
I'll call out his name.

273
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,380
Kluay!

274
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,400
Kluay!

275
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:49,150
If you don't want to see your girlfriend get beat up,

276
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,540
come out now.

277
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,230
Come and defend her honor,

278
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,690
like you always do.

279
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,130
So people will know that Kluay from the swimming team

280
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:58,890
is dating a sissy.

281
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,100
What are you doing?

282
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,510
Go making a mess somewhere else.

283
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,490
We are working here.

284
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,690
Let's go, Achi.

285
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,070
Don't stick your frigging nose where it doesn't belong.

286
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:11,950
Hey!

287
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,750
We don't want trouble with you.

288
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,890
We just want Kluay.

289
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,470
People will find out that he is...

290
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,110
What he is is none of your business.

291
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,280
You're sticking your frigging nose where it doesn't belong.

292
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,320
Are you defending him because you're like him?

293
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,220
Hey!

294
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,250
Don't mind them.

295
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,780
Look at what they're doing.

296
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,790
If you start a fight, the show will be canceled.

297
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,320
What's your problem?

298
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,220
Say it.

299
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,850
You're gay.

300
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,440
Look at your dress.

301
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,570
It screams tranny.

302
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:51,010
If you admit it by saying it out loud,

303
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,610
we'll let your girlfriend go.

304
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,600
Is there anything I can do for you?

305
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,620
No need.

306
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:27,580
Let me do it myself.

307
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,140
Have you ever been this close to a girl?

308
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,350
Why?

309
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,040
Any guy would be excited.

310
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:44,890
Not worried like this.

311
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:54,280
What are you saying?

312
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,840
You look like someone who's feeling guilty.

313
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,610
Let's cut to chase.

314
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,160
Easy.

315
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,640
I'm just guessing.

316
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,640
I hope I'm wrong.

317
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,800
I don't want to see you do a wrong thing,

318
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:16,070
especially with Waii.

319
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:28,050
If your intentions with Waii are good,

320
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:30,050
don't do this.

321
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,470
Stop confusing him.

322
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:34,250
Hey, guys.

323
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:36,910
What are you talking about?

324
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:37,990
Is it serious?

325
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,280
Whatever.

326
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,050
Mine is more serious.

327
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,360
We have a problem.

328
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,640
Come on.

329
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,990
This is your girlfriend.

330
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,910
What the hell do you want me to admit to?

331
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,410
We are not dating.

332
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,320
No?

333
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,460
Then you wouldn't care

334
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:00,230
if we have a little fun with him.

335
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:07,710
Stay still.

336
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,780
No.

337
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,370
What are you doing?

338
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:17,230
Motivate your boyfriend to admit it.

339
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:20,990
I saw you the other day working on the backdrop together.

340
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,510
We want to help as well.

341
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,520
How about painting your whole body?

342
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,460
No!

343
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,040
Are you frigging insane?

344
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,460
Where do you get off hurting him?

345
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,290
Now he's trying to rescue him.

346
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,910
What planet are you on?

347
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:34,910
Huh?

348
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,460
Assholes like you have it coming.

349
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,210
Come help him then.

350
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,140
Come on.

351
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,620
If you're not coming...

352
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,500
I'm sorry.

353
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:48,450
Huh?

354
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,470
What?

355
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:53,990
I'm sorry I punched you the other day.

356
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,400
If you seek revenge,

357
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,440
get back at me.

358
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,100
Don't take it out on him.

359
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,170
You misunderstood.

360
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,970
We're not mad.

361
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:05,930
We just want you to admit that you're dating a sissy.

362
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,070
Come on.

363
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,080
This thing is heavy.

364
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,220
Or do you want me to go through with it?

365
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,340
Hey!

366
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:34,190
You guys go inside.

367
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,110
I'll handle this.

368
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:37,950
No,

369
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,340
I don't want to get the team in trouble.

370
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,780
Here comes the knight in shining armor.

371
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,910
This is such a romantic scene.

372
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,530
How about a kiss?

373
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:55,680
Kiss. Kiss. Kiss.

374
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,040
Okay,

375
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,470
if you kiss this boy on the mouth,

376
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,900
we'll stop this right away.

377
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,000
What do you say?

378
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,020
He's nothing to me.

379
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,020
Cut the shit.

380
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:40,820
Come here.

381
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,380
This club is such a hoot.

382
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,490
It's like a gay-in-the-closet movie.

383
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,790
It's so fun to pick on the gays.

384
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,370
Come to think of it,

385
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,600
even the previous coach is gay.

386
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,790
Come on, guys.

387
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,380
Stop.

388
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,220
Hey, stop!

389
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,880
Guys, stop!

390
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,540
Shit, just frigging stop!

391
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,280
The Rector is here.

392
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:03,130
I'm sorry

393
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,290
for being a lousy captain.

394
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,760
Even if you hadn't started it,

395
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,760
we would have done it anyway.

396
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:11,160
Yes,

397
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,190
If we did nothing today,

398
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:15,190
they would keep messing with us.

399
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,100
Don't be harsh on yourself.

400
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:21,790
We don't blame you for this.

401
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:24,470
Wait until you find out what the Rector said.

402
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,880
You might say something totally different.

403
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,170
Hello, Wanicha.

404
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:39,450
About the directive to dissolve the swimming club.

405
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,160
It's not official yet.

406
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:45,570
They still have a chance...

407
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,330
I will inform the board on Monday.

408
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:51,370
The board will have to vote on it, won't they?

409
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,410
I don't see why

410
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:58,190
the club that brings nothing but trouble to the university

411
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:00,090
is still in existence.

412
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:02,540
Just like what you told me the last time.

413
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,330
Back then the club wasn't any good.

414
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,790
But now, I feel that...

415
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:09,470
How about we talk about this later?

416
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,710
We can discuss where

417
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,350
we can reallocate the club's budget.

418
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:23,810
Ahem,

419
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:24,790
Wanicha.

420
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,130
Thanks for trying.

421
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,640
Oh, you're here.

422
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,220
No, I'm at home. Oh wait.

423
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:38,540
Your club is about to go down, and you're still in a mood to kid around.

424
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:41,370
Someone like me cannot help the club.

425
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,210
But

426
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:49,210
I can think of someone who can.

427
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,430
Who?

428
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,690
Do we have?

429
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,220
Yes, we have.

430
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:58,350
Someone who started all this.

431
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,880
I must do something

432
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:06,970
but I don't know what.

433
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,070
Fah, where are you?

434
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,990
At home.

435
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,100
I'm not feeling well.

436
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,310
There.

437
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:32,780
I don't think they will dissolve our club for real.

438
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,190
Do you?

439
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,650
I can help talk to the Rector.

440
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:38,330
That's okay.

441
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,620
You've done so much already.

442
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:44,460
There should be a way to fix this.

443
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:47,000
Let's wait until the Rector calms down.

444
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,520
We still have time.

445
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,420
Until Monday.

446
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,620
Where is Kluay?

447
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,560
I saw Kluay ride off on a bicycle.

448
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,920
I think

449
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,940
he needs time.

450
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,160
That's what you get

451
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,580
when you're forced to be something you're not.

452
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,310
Those guys can't keep their nose out of someone else's business.

453
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:17,030
Waii, are you okay?

454
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,110
Yes.

455
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,570
Good, let's go to...

456
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,670
Apo,

457
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:24,670
let's go home.

458
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,160
Come on.

459
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:45,490
Easy.

460
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,460
That hurts.

461
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,770
Crybaby.

462
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:00,550
I wish Monday never came.

463
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:03,470
This is not the time for wishful thinking.

464
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,480
I know.

465
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:07,150
I must do something

466
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,120
but I don't know what.

467
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,020
I didn't mean that.

468
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,000
I meant

469
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,110
you don't have to do anything,

470
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,490
including thinking.

471
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:22,710
We have 3 days until the club is officially dissolved.

472
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,040
We have free time.

473
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,170
Yeah.

474
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,150
You've been practicing for so long.

475
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,460
Don't you want to go somewhere?

476
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,580
Where to?

477
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:30,990
My home.

478
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,220
We can catch the earliest bus tomorrow.

479
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:38,390
Let's do it.

480
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,320
Cool.

481
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,580
It's a date.

482
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:46,360
That hurts.

483
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,440
Go easy.

484
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,860
You're doing this on purpose.

485
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,660
I think there's a silver lining in all this.

486
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:09,140
Our club hasn't been dissolved yet.

487
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,520
Don't rush it.

488
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,260
Did we forget something?

489
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:19,670
What?

490
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,640
I brought all the stuff you told me to.

491
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,020
Kluay!

492
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,800
Where have you been all night?

493
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,100
I'm sorry.

494
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,030
We're past that.

495
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:39,550
I don't know if you know.

496
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,170
It's me

497
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,380
who caused the club to go down.

498
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:48,630
You?

499
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:50,790
What did you do?

500
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,640
Who gives a shit about who did what?

501
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,760
But, now

502
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:58,590
Let's focus on our trip.

503
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:00,930
A trip?

504
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,610
Go and pack your bag now.

505
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,270
Trip to where?

506
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,800
My home.

507
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,670
I'm not in a mood to go anywhere.

508
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,020
You don't need a mood to take a trip.

509
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,830
Pack your bag.

510
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:16,460
We're waiting for you here.

511
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:17,370
But...

512
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,970
But what?

513
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:22,280
You'd rather stay here and face the same old problems?

514
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,020
Tell me

515
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,020
Do you want to stay or come with us.

516
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:28,740
See you.

517
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,670
We'll be here.

518
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:37,330
You said it'd be just the two of us.

519
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,700
Just one more.

520
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:45,150
Come on.

521
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,500
Only one.

522
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:00,830
Hey!

523
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,640
You said only one more.

524
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,440
Just them.

525
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:14,610
Thank you for inviting us.

526
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:16,610
Ahem.

527
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,560
You two are inseparable now.

528
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,460
Well, when you are...

529
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,140
What?

530
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,360
When you want to spend time with someone...

531
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,760
Ugh!

532
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,080
Where are Min and Fah?

533
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,020
Who gives a shit about Min?

534
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,560
I asked Fah

535
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:37,910
but he's not coming.

536
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,350
He must be studying.

537
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:42,130
Let me handle it.

538
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,080
Jerk,

539
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,180
where are you?

540
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,320
At home.

541
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,560
I'm not feeling well.

542
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,860
You're sick?

543
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:52,390
Okay...

544
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,740
Get well soon.

545
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,320
He's sick.

546
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,000
We should go.

547
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,520
Okay.

548
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:06,160
The club's trip starts now.

549
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,620
Yeah!

550
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,760
Oops.

551
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,960
You dropped something.

552
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:19,940
Come here!

553
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,180
Come here!

554
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,090
So?

555
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,380
I don't see anyone with him.

556
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:44,150
He's alone.

557
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,470
You're thinking too much.

558
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:54,270
Are you trying to catch him in the act?

559
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:56,410
What?

560
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:00,050
Min and I are just friends.

561
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,640
So,

562
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,440
if there's a beautiful girl coming to see him,

563
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,150
you won't be jealous,

564
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:11,850
right?

565
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:13,820
Right.

566
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:18,330
No matter how hot and sexy she is.

567
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,240
Not jealous at all.

568
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:26,910
Even if she is wearing a tank showing ample cleavage,

569
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:28,470
with a tight booty.

570
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,800
What are you talking about?

571
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:35,370
What?

572
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:44,180
Where are you going?

573
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,770
You wanted to know

574
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:49,850
who would help Min with the club.

575
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,060
By the looks of it,

576
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,720
I don't think they're talking about the club.

577
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:58,090
Sorry I'm late.

578
00:33:58,570 --> 00:33:59,650
It's fine.

579
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,310
Thanks for coming.

580
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,530
What's up?

581
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,910
I didn't think you'd want to see me again.

582
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:13,080
I didn't.

583
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,580
Why did you call?

584
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:18,580
The club will be dissolved.

585
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:21,080
That's not surprising.

586
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:22,590
Hey!

587
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,030
What?

588
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,910
You need to take responsibility for what you did.

589
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:29,200
You threw that frigging party and

590
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,530
it ruined the club's reputation.

591
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:33,850
And the club is dissolved because of me?

592
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,330
You were a part of it.

593
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,000
Will you or will you not help us?

594
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:40,650
What can I do?

595
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:44,890
Tell the Rector the truth.

596
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,920
Can you be a good person for once?

597
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,700
Can you take responsibility for your action for once?

598
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,320
I guess I'm a bad person.

599
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:04,550
I can't help.

600
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,640
Sorry.

601
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,750
You said you wanted to make things right.

602
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:10,300
But you do the same thing.

603
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,300
You haven't changed at all.

604
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,830
This is your letter of resignation.

605
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:28,280
That is a copy.

606
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:30,270
I sent the original.

607
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:31,850
Open it.

608
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,830
You told the Rector that you organized that party,

609
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:39,420
and took responsibility by resigning.

610
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,420
But that's not enough.

611
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,230
That's why

612
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,130
the Rector cut your budget.

613
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:49,060
I felt bad that

614
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,200
I caused the club trouble.

615
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,350
But this is all I can do.

616
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:57,160
Now you know that

617
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,490
I can't help your club.

618
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,560
Don't ever mention his name.

619
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:22,370
or do anything that involves him.

620
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:24,060
Do you have feelings for P'Pan?

621
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:27,760
The number you're trying to reach is not available.

622
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,670
I think Namkhaeng is doing number 2.

623
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,170
I think so, too.

624
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:46,810
Jerks,

625
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:49,310
she's calling her mom.

626
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,430
Why can't she call on the bus?

627
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:53,630
Come on.

628
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,630
Can't you just wait for a few minutes?

629
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:57,720
It's been a long time.

630
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:59,550
For someone so small, she really takes her time to poo.

631
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,500
There she is.

632
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,200
I'm not coming.

633
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,890
Why?

634
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,890
I want to see Achi.

635
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,450
Can you get a hold of him?

636
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:12,750
Yes,

637
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,530
I couldn't reach him at first,

638
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:16,750
but his mom just called to say that he's home.

639
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,610
I think I should pay him a visit.

640
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:19,880
Okay.

641
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:23,310
Keep us updated when you see him.

642
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,220
Where is your bag, Achi?

643
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:39,830
Look at the corner of the room.

644
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:42,600
Found it?

645
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:49,520
Take out a pair of black pants from the bag.

646
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,100
Hang it dry.

647
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,020
Are these your pants?

648
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:55,800
They're big.

649
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:57,810
Not mine.

650
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:00,880
Kluay's.

651
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:05,050
Where is a clothes line?

652
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,300
Are you okay?

653
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,880
I'm fine,

654
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,780
but don't ever mention his name.

655
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,610
or do anything that

656
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,610
involves him.

657
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,950
Okay?

658
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,440
P'Fah!

659
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,440
I thought you're sick.

660
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,280
Well,

661
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:42,600
I'm good now,

662
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:45,210
I guess.

663
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,730
I have to go.

664
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,650
Hold on.

665
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,280
Can I talk to you about something?

666
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,310
Let's take a picture.

667
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:10,560
Hey,

668
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,550
take a look.

669
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
well,

670
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,140
I'm sorry.

671
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:29,510
I didn't mean to.

672
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,530
What's up with them?

673
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:42,970
I don't know.

674
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,460
PMS?

675
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,680
Hey,

676
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,510
You looked so happy when we invited you.

677
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,250
Now you look like crap.

678
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:57,000
Okay,

679
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
you're here in my home.

680
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,890
There's one rule you need to follow

681
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:02,510
which is

682
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:06,750
Switch off your mobile

683
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:07,630
and put it away.

684
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,620
No, this rule sucks.

685
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,530
Okay.

686
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:14,180
Good.

687
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,380
Put it here.

688
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:17,250
Are you serious?

689
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,340
Give it to me.

690
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:21,600
Good job.

691
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,100
You're a good person.

692
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,680
You're the last one.

693
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:33,670
Come on.

694
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,900
Give him the phone.

695
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,720
Everybody has.

696
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,160
Where are you going, Pan?

697
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:41,290
Hey, stop

698
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:43,290
Stop!

699
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:51,370
I will not give the phone

700
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:53,030
No!

701
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:24,070
The number you're trying to reach is not available.

702
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,220
The number you're trying to reach is not available.

703
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:42,110
Ever since P'Pan and I got together,

704
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,840
you've been distant.

705
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:47,870
What's going on in your mind?

706
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,880
Nothing.

707
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:56,110
You and P'Pan used to hang out.

708
00:41:56,610 --> 00:42:00,050
Now that things have changed between me and P'Pan,

709
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:02,110
you've been avoiding her.

710
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:06,340
Do you have feelings for P'Pan?

711
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,910
Umm.

712
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:17,050
You're mad because P'Pan took me away from you, right?

713
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,380
Huh?

714
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:22,410
I understand

715
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:26,780
but I don't feel that way about you anymore.

716
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:29,030
What can I do?

717
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:30,790
For that,

718
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,320
I get it.

719
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:36,960
It's too late for you now.

720
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,160
Hang tight

721
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:40,790
and get over me.

722
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,350
Get over?

723
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:43,810
I will.

724
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,820
We can still be friends.

725
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:48,550
Hang in there.

726
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:50,720
Don't get hung up on me.

727
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:56,290
You put me in a difficult position.

728
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,850
I'd had a crush on you for so long.

729
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:49,900
What the hell are you doing?

730
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:52,470
What the hell are you doing?

731
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,500
Sitting all alone heartbroken like you're in a music video.

732
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:56,600
No one loves you?

733
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,060
You're so wrong.

734
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:03,290
Hey,

735
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:04,870
Don't look so gloomy.

736
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:06,430
You're on vacation.

737
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:07,960
If it were you,

738
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,020
would you forgive me?

739
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:14,670
No.

740
00:44:16,330 --> 00:44:17,330
Thank you.

741
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:18,760
Kluay,

742
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:21,670
if you're just sitting here feeling sad,

743
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:24,720
how can Achi forgive you?

744
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:26,700
I don't want to just sit here.

745
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,840
But I don't know

746
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:30,470
how to apologize.

747
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:32,820
Don't think too much.

748
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:37,110
An apology is as good as it is honest.

749
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:39,460
Just show how guilty you feel

750
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:41,160
and say you're sorry.

751
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:50,660
And he will forgive me, right?

752
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:55,470
It's up to how honest you are.

753
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,320
You can do it.

754
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:16,650
"Remove yourself from the problem.

755
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:19,510
Look at the problem as an outsider and you will see the way."
