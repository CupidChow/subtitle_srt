1
00:02:20,259 --> 00:02:21,599
Here you go.

2
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,460
You should look after the kid whom Coach asked you to.

3
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,120
Who took him in should be looking after him.

4
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:29,639
If I finish your homework, you have to stop being mad at me

5
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:30,939
No.

6
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:33,459
Happy Birthday, Aom.

7
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:42,239
Where are you going?

8
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,439
Who is that?

9
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:56,379
What are you doing?

10
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:58,919
None of your business.

11
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,280
Didn't you just want me to follow you here?

12
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:08,419
Don't be shy.

13
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,699
Women these days do this...

14
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:14,840
stepping outside just to make a guy follow you.

15
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:20,500
What kind of man is so full of himself?

16
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,640
What kind of girl spies on a male dorm?

17
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:30,060
None of your business.

18
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:33,199
I'll teach you how to catch a guy.

19
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:35,180
But a woman like you probably knows.

20
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:41,780
Boys aren't comfortable around women who are talented and smart.

21
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:46,079
Join the cute club like Aom.

22
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,180
She always hits the mark.

23
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,520
Assault and battery.

24
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:57,620
I got you this time.

25
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,099
You didn't listen to a word I said, did you?

26
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,159
Yes, I was.

27
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,340
Come to think about it...

28
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:15,700
you're cute, attractive and well-dressed.

29
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,959
Want to go out with me?

30
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,460
Liar!

31
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,740
Don't think that I won't know your trick.

32
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:38,199
I've used this before when I want to shut someone up.

33
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:40,019
Scare them off and they will disappear.

34
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,600
I'm glad we've cleared this up.

35
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,680
Run along now.

36
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,279
Since we're similar people, let's be friends.

37
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:56,180
I'm Min.

38
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,100
Wan. Nice to meet you.

39
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,740
Since we are friends, let's celebrate.

40
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,840
Celebrate what?

41
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,339
Why don't we go to that place behind 7 Eleven?

42
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,679
It opens 24 hours. Have you been?

43
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,180
No.

44
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,439
You've got to try.

45
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:23,180
I'm going to climb down first. See you in front of that shop.

46
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:25,019
Go away.

47
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:28,019
Be careful when you climb down.

48
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:29,879
Don't get yourself killed and become a ghost that haunts the dorm

49
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:32,539
I don't mind haunting the female dorm

50
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:37,120
Just go,

51
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,120
you psycho.

52
00:05:40,579 --> 00:05:41,779
Go!

53
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:14,019
Sorry!

54
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,180
Thank you

55
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,339
Working hard as an academic consultant of the swimming club, huh?

56
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,019
You know me?

57
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:39,240
Yes, I do. More than you think.

58
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,620
Where did you come from?

59
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:44,199
Just finished some homework.

60
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:45,360
Why do you have so much homework?

61
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,360
Let me have a look.

62
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,020
Who are you?

63
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:57,799
You don't have to know who I am. Just remember my face.

64
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:07,120
Now I know how feisty she is.

65
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:11,479
I will excuse myself now.

66
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,560
I didn't see you earlier.

67
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,939
Where did you go?

68
00:07:58,939 --> 00:08:00,519
I was going to have dinner with that dog

69
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,300
The dog didn't show up.

70
00:08:03,579 --> 00:08:07,060
Dinner with a dog?

71
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:39,639
Jib, tell the teacher I'm on my way.

72
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,539
Do you remember that nerd?

73
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:53,539
Are you okay?

74
00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:54,899
Your bag...

75
00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:57,019
Let me help you.

76
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,200
Are you okay?

77
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,980
Are you hurt?

78
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:15,419
Are you hurt?

79
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:18,159
Hello?

80
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,279
I'm fine.

81
00:09:21,379 --> 00:09:23,379
I'd like to say I'm sorry.

82
00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:26,460
But you didn't watch the road.

83
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:28,819
Hello?

84
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,220
You're okay, right?

85
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,320
I'm taking off now.

86
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,860
Hope you're okay. Bye.

87
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,200
Good morning, Rector.

88
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,099
You shouldn't have gone through the trouble of coming here

89
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:05,860
You could've asked me to meet at your office.

90
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,220
Last year, the swimming club didn't join any external races.

91
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:16,360
Yes, but this year we plan to...

92
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,539
Your boys are quite rowdy.

93
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:20,980
How so?

94
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:25,300
I got a report saying there's a competition within the club,

95
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,879
which escalated to a physical attack.

96
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:31,060
I think there is a misunderstanding.

97
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,440
I don't think so.

98
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:37,120
The student body sent me a report with evidence

99
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:50,240
The swimming club may have to be disbanded

100
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,220
Hey.

101
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,820
Yesterday, I said 'nice to meet you'.

102
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,159
But it wasn't nice for you to meet me.

103
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,340
This will not end well.

104
00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:51,659
Had you known Coach before?

105
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,759
Don't let me find out later.

106
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:55,039
What are you doing?

107
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,180
You woke up early.

108
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,800
Hello, dad.

109
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:45,600
I moved all my stuff last night.

110
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:49,410
I share a room with my roommate.

111
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:53,090
I met Coach Tee.

112
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,290
He is even cooler in person than on TV.

113
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,890
And tougher, too

114
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,470
I'll adapt.

115
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,900
I'm going to take a shower now.

116
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,450
Bye.

117
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,980
Had you known Coach before?

118
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,060
Of course.

119
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,410
How?

120
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,350
He...

121
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,210
Move.

122
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,370
He was so famous.

123
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,360
A national athlete with an endorsement deal

124
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:34,370
He was so cool. Totally my idol.

125
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,260
Didn't you know that your dad was a celebrity?

126
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,500
Enough

127
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:38,960
Weren't you born then?

128
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:41,090
So, you hadn't really known Coach

129
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,900
Not in person. He was just famous.

130
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,540
Why did he ask me to look after you?

131
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,220
How would I know?

132
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,260
Don't let me find out later.

133
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,740
What are you doing?

134
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,730
I'm going to take a shower.

135
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,750
But I was going to

136
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,200
I'm sorry about last night.

137
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,750
What was she doing here?

138
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,240
Is she a teacher's daughter?

139
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,450
Who are you talking about?

140
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:42,850
That one.

141
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,860
The one.

142
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:48,300
The one whom you hit while she was riding a bike.

143
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:49,870
Stop fantasizing about her.

144
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:54,040
She is unique. I can feel it.

145
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:57,190
She's the one.

146
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,490
What are you doing here?

147
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,200
What are you doing here?

148
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:05,850
You don't usually practice during lunch.

149
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:06,760
Butt out.

150
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:07,950
Why didn't you wake me up?

151
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:11,600
I did. Loudly. You wouldn't wake up.

152
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,480
Nothing I can do.

153
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,460
That'd better be true

154
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,490
Sure is

155
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,380
Enough, Pan. Don't make a scene.

156
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:21,520
You can sleep anywhere, even a locker room.

157
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,690
Why did you tell him?

158
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,660
Well... I'm going to class now. Bye.

159
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,130
Come here.

160
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,190
What are you doing here?

161
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,380
Just chilling by the pool.

162
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,950
Chill by the pool?

163
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,360
Are you nuts?

164
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,130
If you have nothing to do, go home.

165
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,930
I don't like to sit with a stranger.

166
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,100
If you can sleep in the locker room, I can sit by the pool.

167
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,520
It's my business.

168
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,570
Well, I don't like it.

169
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,450
I'm a senior in the club. You have to obey.

170
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,660
No.

171
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,470
No? Come here.

172
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,380
Want to sit by the pool? You got it.

173
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:02,570
I'll take you to the pool. To the bottom of the pool.

174
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,600
Guys!

175
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:17,110
Have you seen my new hair?

176
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,780
How does it look?

177
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,200
It took me a long time to style it.

178
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:33,580
Guys, I'll style it like this every day.

179
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,140
Do you think it looks good?

180
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:39,470
This will my signature hairdo.

181
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,380
Hey there.

182
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,600
Looking good.

183
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:47,930
Dressed up for a date?

184
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:49,790
Don't touch it.

185
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:54,510
I am curious what the hair will look like in water.

186
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,690
We shall test it then.

187
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,430
Let's do it.

188
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,450
No, don't!

189
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,170
Come on!

190
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,630
Jerks! My hair!

191
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,250
You've been repeating this word all day.

192
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,280
You want to go to the pool, yeah?

193
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:16,910
Go! Jump!

194
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,160
What are you doing?

195
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:27,360
Same stupid prank you're trying to do. Hypocrite!

196
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:28,370
Come here!

197
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:29,950
I'm not going down.

198
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,140
Sit!

199
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,860
This jerk woke up at 7 AM to style his hair.

200
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,960
He turned up the music so loudly.

201
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,950
Don't! Don't!

202
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:13,080
Put went down. Apo went down. Waii went down.

203
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,780
Now it's your turn.

204
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,310
Go!

205
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:24,970
No!

206
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:25,870
Come here!

207
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:27,070
Coach Tee!

208
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:29,230
What coach! I don't believe you.

209
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,490
Coach is here!

210
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,300
What are you doing?

211
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,010
Are all of you here?

212
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,960
Waii, where are you going?

213
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,750
Why? Have your meeting.

214
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:01,700
You must join as well.

215
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:04,150
No. Tell Kluay what I need to do.

216
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,250
No! You must stay.
Stop being such a child.

217
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,450
Our club is about to be disbanded

218
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,780
I'm late today because I went to the Finance Department.

219
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:28,080
I asked them to hold off any payment to the swimming club.

220
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,400
The club will be disbanded in two months,

221
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,180
as discussed previously.

222
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:35,460
There will be a district-level competition coming up soon.

223
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,460
Our swimmers may win a medal.

224
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:40,550
The swimmers have had a lot of opportunities in the past,

225
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,050
but didn't win anything.

226
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,960
The club should have been disbanded a long time ago since ...

227
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,820
since... a while ago.

228
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,720
Why the swimming club?

229
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,880
There are other poor performing clubs.

230
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,760
They have too many privileges.

231
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,880
Our budget is better spent doing something else

232
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,760
The running and football clubs also occupy the field.

233
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,160
The field could be more useful to others than the pool.

234
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:12,490
Wan, it's a good idea to check out the field.

235
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,220
Otherwise, some may say we're only gunning for the swimming

236
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:19,170
I'll check out the running club this evening.

237
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:24,360
This is how you take care of a newbie?

238
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,780
Who shot these? Who?

239
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,300
You were kidding, right?

240
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,850
You said that just to get Waii to stay, right?

241
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,690
Quiet!

242
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,620
Our club is about to be disbanded for real

243
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:09,660
Now can you stop playing and get serious?

244
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,980
Who's this?

245
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,450
Who is this guy?

246
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:31,090
Sawasdee krap. I am Fah.

247
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:35,300
Fah is our academic consultant that I told you via Line yesterday.

248
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:38,550
You replied with a heart sticker.

249
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:41,010
That must have been an accident.

250
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:44,430
What does an academic consultant do anyway?

251
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,060
I do homework.

252
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:58,040
Apo, how's your first day at the dorm?

253
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,050
It was okay.

254
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,150
Are you sure?

255
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,340
Yes, I am.

256
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,340
What happened to your hand?

257
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:08,240
I got burned by boiling water.

258
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,240
It's getting better.

259
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,980
Waii did it, didn't he?

260
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:14,530
It was an accident. Nobody did anything.

261
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,570
Waii told you to say that, didn't he?

262
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:19,150
You got wet today because Waii bullied you, right?

263
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,480
This is outrageous.

264
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,120
You said it like you'd know everything.

265
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,760
I am your father.

266
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,990
I raised you. I know how childish you are.

267
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,500
You oppose to anything that I tell you.

268
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:35,050
No, Coach. It really was an accident.

269
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:37,400
And we were just playing today.

270
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,580
It was fun for me.

271
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,380
Not everybody find it fun.

272
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,760
Take a look.

273
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:57,510
This is how you take care of a newbie?

274
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,900
Who shot these?

275
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,340
That's not the point.

276
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,990
The point is you being such a baby.

277
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,420
Who shot these?

278
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,640
Let me assure you that

279
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,420
Waii didn't bully me yesterday.

280
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,590
It was an accident.

281
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,360
It's true, Coach.

282
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,840
I can attest that Waii didn't bully Apo.

283
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,480
Me too

284
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,420
Me too.

285
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,050
Waii didn't bully me yesterday.

286
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:33,910
Me too.

287
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,870
Okay. Thank you, everyone.

288
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,480
Waii, I'm...

289
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:45,930
As a coach, I'm sorry.

290
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:54,150
Going forward, you have to be careful.

291
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,240
We are being closely monitored by the student body.

292
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,200
All the pranks you do on another must be toned down

293
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,040
Others may think that our club is full of bullies.

294
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:10,740
Fah.

295
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:11,870
Yes, sir.

296
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:14,740
From now on, do not do homework for your friends.

297
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:19,700
Take care of the documents and practice schedule for the members

298
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:22,070
No more pranks or bullying

299
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,120
It's all Sung.

300
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,620
You too.

301
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:31,400
More importantly, our club has not earned

302
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,270
reputation for the university for years.

303
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:37,740
And it's my fault.

304
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:45,940
Luckily, the Rector gave us two months to make a name for ourselves.

305
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,270
In the meantime, our budget has been put on hold.

306
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,790
Put on hold?

307
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,690
Yes.

308
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,150
If we haven't made any mark during these two months

309
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,750
our club will be disbanded.

310
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,910
The rest of us will need to work very hard

311
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,840
It will be easier for Waii to win

312
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,860
No. You guys should compete.

313
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:12,020
I'm not ready.

314
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,380
Not ready or not willing to sacrifice.

315
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,880
I will for the team,

316
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,080
not for the benefits of a certain someone.

317
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,970
You think I'm doing this for myself?

318
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:25,520
Prove it, then.

319
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,930
Just resign,

320
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,460
and I will compete.

321
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,180
What are you doing?

322
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,520
Nothing.

323
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,080
You are the admin of Waii's fan page.

324
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,460
What are you doing here?

325
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,590
Nothing.

326
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,460
Nothing?

327
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,680
Don't even, Tootsie.

328
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,120
F... you

329
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:18,430
You're going to leave this on Waii's bike? It will disappear.

330
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,770
Let me help.

331
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,430
That is for P'Waii.

332
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,260
Don't. I'm your senior.

333
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,680
Consider this a payment for me to shut up

334
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:29,730
about you stealing Waii's bike.

335
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:31,080
I wasn't stealing. I just...

336
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,530
Are you calling me a liar?

337
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:34,670
Guard! Guard!

338
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,000
Guard!

339
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,970
I'll get you back, douchebag!

340
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,740
What did you say?

341
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:53,420
Hey, aren't you going for a swim?

342
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,670
No.

343
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,880
Are you having a period?

344
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,360
Since Coach told us the news,

345
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:09,100
Why? Do I hardly smile?

346
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,800
Since Coach told us the news,

347
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:13,690
you haven't smiled once.

348
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:15,330
Don't you know it?

349
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:21,340
Do you think Put will be able to get Waii to compete?

350
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,480
I don't think so. I'll bet you 300 baht.

351
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,140
I think he can. I'll bet you 500 baht.

352
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,020
Are you bluffing me?

353
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,870
Up your game

354
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,050
Winner buy me lunch, okay?

355
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:36,250
If you're with me, you'll get free lunch for sure.

356
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,480
Oh yeah?

357
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,100
Are you really not going to compete?

358
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,640
In the district competition.

359
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:48,070
I cannot do it.

360
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,840
Are you still hung up on that?

361
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:05,390
It's still not over?

362
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,840
No way.

363
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:14,610
How can he say that I'm not willing to sacrifice while he...

364
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:18,150
Stop it. You shouldn't dwell on this anymore.

365
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,990
I must apologize to you all.

366
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,620
Forget about it. We are the same team.

367
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,370
We are in the same boat.

368
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:43,390
If you're not ready, it's okay.

369
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,040
We will be ready.

370
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,420
Thank you all of you.

371
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,020
Sure.

372
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,490
Shit, what time is it?

373
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,220
It's almost 5! Shit!

374
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:57,480
Runners are not as hot as swimmers.

375
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,820
Do you dare?

376
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:33,170
Let me take a look.

377
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,950
Where did you come from?

378
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,210
This is a good picture.

379
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,920
We didn't have to pose.

380
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,580
You were in a hurry.

381
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:45,620
And it's for this non-sense.

382
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:48,030
I think she is cute.

383
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:53,080
Who are you talking about?

384
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,580
Does your voice have to be that high?

385
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:00,750
Where did she go?

386
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:04,830
You both!

387
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,300
Excuse me.

388
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,110
It's you

389
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,800
I have a question.

390
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:18,110
Where is the library now?

391
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,020
Go straight and turn right.

392
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,060
Thank you.

393
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,000
Wait, my friend has something to say

394
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,500
Well...

395
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:33,810
I like...

396
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,910
the bike that you rode the other day.

397
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,790
The brake seemed good

398
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,880
Okay... Thank you.

399
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:45,810
I'm taking off. Thank you.

400
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,360
You like her bike, huh?

401
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,760
The brake was good?

402
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,740
Isn't it strange, though?

403
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:58,240
What is a high school student doing in the uni campus?

404
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,950
You shouldn't be surprised.

405
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,860
The uni campus is full of hot guys like me

406
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,500
What's wrong?

407
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,910
I may have sprained my ankle.

408
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:32,510
I hope you're not injured now.

409
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,720
The district sports competition is coming up.

410
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,800
I know

411
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:39,790
You should rest. I don't want you to get worse

412
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:43,110
Please tell Coach that I'm going to see the doctor today

413
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:45,120
Sure, I will.

414
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,460
Take care.

415
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:49,690
I'll continue with my run.

416
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:53,220
Okay. Thank you.

417
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:58,030
1 2 3 4. 1 2 3 4.

418
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:04,910
What are you doing?

419
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,280
Are you looking for...

420
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:15,970
Checking out guys?

421
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:22,530
The president of the club himself.

422
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:27,070
You disappeared last night.

423
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:31,080
I'm sorry. I didn't want to bother someone.

424
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:39,190
And I'm sorry that runners are not as hot as swimmers.

425
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,700
You're a runner.

426
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:44,190
No surprise you come and go so quickly.

427
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:46,500
Are you done here? Please leave

428
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:48,270
This is preserved for athletes only.

429
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,790
When did you get here?

430
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,180
Are you from the student body?

431
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,100
Yes.

432
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:56,310
Min, take care of them.

433
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:59,270
Can I take some time to observe the activity?

434
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:05,000
Coach, didn't George tell you that I'm going to see the doctor?

435
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,560
Are you badly hurt?

436
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:11,110
Not that bad. I just want to go for a checkup.

437
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,280
Do it after practice.

438
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,500
Yes.

439
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:19,530
Now that I'm here, I'd like to see the club's performance

440
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:23,080
We have our schedule

441
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,560
We can't just organize a race like that.

442
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:29,280
I didn't mean the whole club. Just you vs me.

443
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:33,220
Wan is a former runner.

444
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:35,810
Do you dare?

445
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,850
Hello, P'Waii's fan page followers.

446
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:44,190
I'm the admin.

447
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,030
Here we are in the locker room.

448
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:49,340
Is P'Waii's locker this one?

449
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,780
No.

450
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,160
I found it!

451
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,660
Kluay!

452
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,080
I'll get back at you.

453
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:12,320
Is yours getting smaller?

454
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,840
It's sleeping.

455
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:15,720
I meant your leg. What were you thinking?

456
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:18,160
Don't even, you small banana.

457
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:22,940
Hardly. I'm a big banana.

458
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,170
Stop it. I don't want to see it.

459
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:32,010
I saw the admin of your fan page.

460
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,290
And?

461
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,410
He wanted to give you some snacks.

462
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,940
To make sure that it's not poisonous, I took a bite.

463
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,400
So, are you alive and well?

464
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,230
Waii!

465
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:46,630
Stop!

466
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:49,840
Tough crowd

467
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:51,890
I'm alive and well.

468
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,960
The snacks are delicious.

469
00:35:57,370 --> 00:36:00,170
Is Apo still practicing? It's been a while

470
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,400
He must have swum out to the Gulf.

471
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,220
You don't have to wait for me.

472
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,720
I have something to do.

473
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,900
You're not coming home together?

474
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,670
No.

475
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,680
See you later.

476
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,820
The snacks that P'Waii like.

477
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,000
You sick banana.

478
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:18,050
I'll be done in 10 minutes.

479
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,660
Working hard?

480
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:21,990
Are you afraid you will not get to compete?

481
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:23,390
I'll be out in 10 minutes.

482
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,080
I'm telling you, stop it.

483
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:27,100
You must obey me as your caption.

484
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,820
Thank you.

485
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,800
You're hot-tempered.

486
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,040
Unlike your dad.

487
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,810
Why should I be like my dad?

488
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,250
What?

489
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,470
Did you see your dad compete in SEA Games?

490
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:04,800
The host fans booed him but he kept his calm.

491
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:09,600
He didn't say anything but win a medal afterwards.

492
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,880
He was so good.

493
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:20,050
Looking at you closely, you look like your dad.

494
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:24,800
You may be a better swimmer than him.

495
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,700
Why don't you compete?

496
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:33,230
If you want to be like him this bad, why don't you compete?

497
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,800
I'm not.

498
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:38,370
wait...let's talk

499
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:40,010
sit down.

500
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:48,030
I don't know what it is between you and your dad.

501
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:52,530
But please reduce your ego and open your heart.

502
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,970
Our club needs you.

503
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:01,970
Our club?

504
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,270
Do you think of yourself as one of us?

505
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,460
Yes.

506
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,780
Coach Tee accepted us. I practiced.

507
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,100
I will compete as a representative from our club.

508
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,540
What have you done?

509
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:19,060
You have no clue, yet are good at articulation

510
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,200
You are not the one without a clue.

511
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,660
Do you know that although people say okay

512
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:30,270
deep down they want you to compete.

513
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,560
No one will like it if the club is disbanded.

514
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:38,120
But you won't do anything outside your comfort zone.

515
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,180
Don't teach me.

516
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:45,810
I will do anything to keep our club going.

517
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,970
How? Tell me.

518
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:49,250
I have plans.

519
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:51,490
Tell me.

520
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,700
You don't have plans.

521
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:59,600
Show the world that you're the son of Coach Tee,

522
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,080
the real Olympics hero.

523
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:02,370
Shut up!

524
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:09,250
Are you okay?

525
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:17,050
I'm okay. It doesn't hurt.

526
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,370
I'll get some medicines.

527
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:28,560
I went to the pool to give the snacks to P'Waii.

528
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,250
The snacks I prepared in the afternoon got stolen by that jerk

529
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:37,970
Not only is he ugly, he is also greedy.

530
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:43,340
Who are you talking about?

531
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,440
Answer me.

532
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,100
Try to escape.

533
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,970
You have it coming

534
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:06,750
How did you get in here?

535
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,850
I got lost.

536
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,160
You, little Tootsie. You're in for a world of hurt

537
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,990
Where did he go?

538
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:17,220
Waii, what's wrong?

539
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,840
What happened?

540
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:21,670
Let go.

541
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,960
He just answered you. His wrist hurts.

542
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:10,930
What are you doing?

543
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:12,460
Help you take this off.

544
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:15,940
Raise your arms. Come on.

545
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:22,350
Slowly.

546
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,060
Easy, right?

547
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:28,440
Thanks.

548
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,580
Huh?

549
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:32,940
Are you deaf?

550
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,370
You should practice saying that word.

551
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:39,390
You'll be saying it a lot.

552
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:42,950
It will take a while to heal.

553
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:48,560
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

554
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:03,350
I'll wash this.

555
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:06,340
It's okay. I'll do it.

556
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:07,470
No, I'll do it.

557
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:08,270
I'll do it.

558
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:09,800
I'll do it.

559
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:11,390
I'll do it.

560
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:39,770
What are you doing?

561
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:52,870

There is no reason why we won't get past it today.
