1
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,719
The library that's just been moved...

2
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,300
where is it now?

3
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,160
What is a high school student doing in the uni campus?

4
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,800
It's okay. I'll do it.

5
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:31,419
No, I'll do it.

6
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,659
I'll do it.

7
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,860
I'll do it.

8
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,100
What are you doing?

9
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:45,919
L... Laundry

10
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:55,159
When did you come back?

11
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:02,780
I miss you so much.

12
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,200
I just came back.

13
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:08,659
You're the first one I came to see.

14
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:09,699
Fay...

15
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,439
You hurt your wrist?

16
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,580
Not too bad. It'll be healed in no time.

17
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,480
Hope it doesn't hurt too much.

18
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,780
Fay...

19
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:27,460
This is Apo.

20
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,460
He just moved in yesterday.

21
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,180
This is my girlfriend, Fay.

22
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,280
How are you?

23
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,000
You've already asked.

24
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,500
I miss you so much.

25
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,979
I haven't seen you for so long.

26
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,019
Have you eaten?

27
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,879
I'm famished.

28
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:57,439
It's just a sprained wrist. Nothing serious.

29
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:01,939
How bad was it?

30
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,180
You asked me?

31
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,100
Yes.

32
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:08,319
He wouldn't answer me honestly.

33
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,219
He must be in pain but wouldn't show it.

34
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:13,639
He tried to look cool even when he fell.

35
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:15,639
What are you talking about?

36
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,980
Your name is Apo?

37
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,379
Quite unusual.

38
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,900
What are you studying?

39
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:29,279
Are you here to see me or him?

40
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:33,399
You said you're fine. It didn't hurt much.

41
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:36,319
I should take this time to talk to my new friend.

42
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:42,180
Are you about to wash Waii's shirt?

43
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:45,540
Give it to me. I'll do it.

44
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,439
Did you hurt your arm as well?

45
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,840
A little bit. I'm fine.

46
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,839
Waii, why didn't you take care of your friend?

47
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,299
Well...

48
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:09,000
Let's go out for dinner.

49
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,939
Let's go. I'm hungry.

50
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,139
Why don't you come with us?

51
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:19,620
Okay.

52
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:22,599
Let's eat shabu.

53
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,420
Sure.

54
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:24,379
Yay.

55
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:39,259
What are you doing lying down here?

56
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,879
Are you okay?

57
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:57,719
Do you want a true story or a lie?

58
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:02,659
A lie.

59
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,740
I'm good. I'm fine.

60
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,780
Everything is okay.

61
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,040
Such a liar.

62
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,420
You asked for it.

63
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:13,679
What did the doctor say?

64
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,360
I need to see him again

65
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,960
Meanwhile, I need to take a rest.

66
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:24,579
What about the district sports competition?

67
00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:29,060
I don't dare to think about it.

68
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,020
Come on, man.

69
00:06:37,579 --> 00:06:38,839
Don't worry.

70
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,100
Follow the doctor's orders and you'll be fine

71
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:52,639
I have something for you to do while you're taking a rest.

72
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,540
Update something.

73
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:15,079
Maybe he's fine.

74
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:20,819
Wan.

75
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,819
Hmm?

76
00:07:22,899 --> 00:07:25,379
The professor revised my work again.

77
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:26,560
I'm so bummed out.

78
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:30,000
It's fine. Mine got revised many times, too.

79
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,459
Don't lie. You're Miss Perfectionist.

80
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:36,419
The professor loves your work.

81
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:41,839
Let's go to the club. Otherwise, the seniors will be on our ass.

82
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:42,840
Go.

83
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,319
Wan...

84
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,319
Wan!

85
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:07,920
Hmm?

86
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:08,879
Let's go.

87
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,080
What are you doing here?

88
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:42,279
Just leave.

89
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:44,799
We're here to help you. Just say thank you.

90
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,759
What a cutie! Young and innocence

91
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:52,960
This is way out of your league,

92
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,600
but right up our alley.

93
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,840
Are you here to help or to score for yourselves?

94
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,820
Go away! Leave!

95
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:06,460
Go for it then.

96
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:07,819
You're blocking me.

97
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,840
P'Fah!

98
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,740
Please have a seat.

99
00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:20,500
I made some cookies for you

100
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,360
Is it good?

101
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:30,899
Yummy.

102
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,800
Fah...

103
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:36,240
Something on your head.

104
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:40,179
Are you okay?

105
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,280
There's a lot.

106
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,440
Hey, cover up, will you?

107
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,759
Is there a computer I can use to print some stuff?

108
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,679
500 baht.

109
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,600
Just kidding. We're friends.

110
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:41,219
Here it is.

111
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:56,179
You've picked a good spot to place your hand on.

112
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:01,879
Want some water?

113
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:03,740
When your friend offers you something, you should accept.

114
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:04,259
Yes.

115
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:21,939
Pan, what's wrong with you today?

116
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,879
Nothing.

117
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:33,939
Eat it.

118
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,179
And stop this craziness.

119
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,240
No!

120
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:49,379
Hello, my dear swimming club members

121
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:53,439
Wrong place, wrong time.

122
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,080
Why is there tension in the air?

123
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:57,019
How are you?

124
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:59,860
Kluay, how is Waii?

125
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:02,100
He sprained his right wrist.

126
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:03,779
Poor guy.

127
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,720
There are so many injuries lately.

128
00:12:08,539 --> 00:12:11,360
Apo just got burned yesterday.

129
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:16,519
I think our club is in for bad luck.

130
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:18,480
A drink will make it go away.

131
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:27,360
I heard your dear friend, Min, is also hurt.

132
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:28,699
What happened?

133
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,620
I don't know. All I know is that he can't run.

134
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:37,259
Our members are a little strange but you'll fit in eventually.

135
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:38,139
Yes.

136
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:42,500
Guys, this is Min.

137
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,960
He will join our club until he is fit enough to run.

138
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,920
Take good care of him, okay?

139
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:03,039
So cute. I would totally want you as my girlfriend.

140
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,659
Don't talk about things you don't know.

141
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:08,259
Then, say it.

142
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:09,200
Waii!

143
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,430
Sit properly.

144
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:33,270
How? Like this?

145
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,300
No! Sit straight.

146
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,870
I'd like to watch...

147
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,450
Watch what?

148
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,180
Here we are.

149
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,620
Can I borrow your bike?

150
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,680
Again? You borrow it every day.

151
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,500
So we can go home together.

152
00:13:56,530 --> 00:14:00,290
It's so hot today I could melt.

153
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:01,610
Fine.

154
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,930
I'll return the bike this evening and you can give me a ride home.

155
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,860
Okay.

156
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:24,070
Strip him.

157
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,290
Sure.

158
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:27,610
Be still. Don't you dare.

159
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:28,810
Take off his pants.

160
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,180
Throw him into the pool.

161
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,330
Go!

162
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,170
Come here.

163
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,180
Pan.

164
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,610
You are flashing us

165
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,280
I'm sorry.

166
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,080
Now tell me who that girl is.

167
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,610
Who are you talking about?

168
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:19,080
What do you want?

169
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,080
That cute girl who rode your bike.

170
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,690
You were spying on me?

171
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,360
Is she your girlfriend?

172
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,980
No.

173
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,450
But you give me a ride every day.

174
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:31,530
If not a girlfriend, then who?

175
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,880
Why do I have to tell you?

176
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:38,530
You want to know why, huh?

177
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,910
You wouldn't want anyone to find out

178
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,140
what you stole from Coach Tee's folder, would you?

179
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,520
What did you steal?

180
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,070
Spill it.

181
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,150
Now will you answer me?

182
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,800
Her name is Namkhaeng.

183
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,020
We live close to each other.

184
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,610
Our schools are close to each other.

185
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,980
That's it. There's nothing to it

186
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,860
You don't like her?

187
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,180
Why do you want to know about her?

188
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:16,950
Put and I are not interested but Pan is.

189
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,390
You must help me.

190
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,170
Tell me what you need.

191
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:25,610
I'm so cold and I want to get out.

192
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,780
Good boy. That's it.

193
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,510
You're free to leave.

194
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,420
I don't know how to swim.

195
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:44,490
We've been walking for so long.

196
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,030
Take a rest. Come here.

197
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,200
Fine.

198
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,540
Don't you think we've visited the running club too often lately?

199
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,450
Or do you come to see...?

200
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,360
See what?

201
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,580
I'm here for work.

202
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:05,080
Last time the guy got hurt.

203
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,760
If he hadn't, we wouldn't have come.

204
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:09,760
You're here to see Min.

205
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,900
I'm here for work.

206
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,170
Sure.

207
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,900
Please sit next to each other.

208
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:34,930
You're here because you miss me?

209
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,530
Yes, I miss you.

210
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:41,030
Wan also misses the club president.

211
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:44,570
You're here to see the club president?

212
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:47,110
Yes. I want to talk about the club.

213
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,660
So, how is he?

214
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,290
He's fine.

215
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:57,250
But the accident that day...

216
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,950
It just so happens that I am the club president.

217
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:04,870
Really? So cool.

218
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:08,750
What about Min?

219
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:11,340
He quit the club to recuperate.

220
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,340
His injury is that bad?

221
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,450
He cannot run for a while

222
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,780
Where are you going?

223
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,740
I'm going to buy more snacks.

224
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,370
You can have this one.

225
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,520
You're not so tough like the other day, Tootsie.

226
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,410
I am not.

227
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,660
I'm sure I see you in drag.

228
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,620
Leave me alone, will you?

229
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,580
How can I?

230
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,330
You did a number on me.

231
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,080
What are you talking about?

232
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:17,080
I saw some snacks on Waii's locker

233
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:19,100
and shampoo spilled in front of mine.

234
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,470
What do you have to say for yourself?

235
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:26,600
I'm sorry.

236
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:28,000
Say it to Waii.

237
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,570
Please don't tell P'Waii, I'm begging you.

238
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,540
I'll do anything.

239
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,260
Anything?

240
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:47,930
Anything that I am capable of.

241
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,570
Don't worry.

242
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,220
You are capable of this one.

243
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,660
The sun is so bright.

244
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,340
My skin will be dark.

245
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,020
But it may not be as dark as someone's heart.

246
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:10,220
She must have eaten mud.

247
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,300
Mud can't even compare.

248
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:17,080
I don't get those who are gunning for others.

249
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,100
If I were one of those, I wouldn't dare show my face anywhere.

250
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,340
I'd be so embarrassed.

251
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,930
You're right.

252
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:36,390
Do I owe you an apology?

253
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,520
I don't think so.

254
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:42,040
People here are out to get me anyway.

255
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,450
Take 'serves you right' instead.

256
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,020
It hurts badly.

257
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,190
It was satisfying, though

258
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,890
Come down.

259
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,220
Hey!

260
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,040
What is your responsibility and have you finished?

261
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,130
Not yet. I'm sorry.

262
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,130
What are you doing?

263
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,870
It's my business anyway.

264
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,960
This is the swimming club.

265
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:33,450
Non-members are not allowed.

266
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:35,020
Haven't you seen the announcement?

267
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,370
Maybe you haven't seen the announcement

268
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:46,700
Going forward, the student body allows other clubs to use the pool.

269
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:50,500
Effective today. Take a look.

270
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:59,810
If you need some time to try to understand it

271
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:02,790
you can keep it. Take as long as you need.

272
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,960
I have many copies. This one is yours.

273
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,010
Get out.

274
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,580
Get the hell out.

275
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,570
I don't need to. I am authorized to be here.

276
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:17,810
I don't care

277
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:20,310
If there's a problem, get the Rector here.

278
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:22,770
You have a problem, not me.

279
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:26,500
President of the swimming club hasn't won any medals for a year.

280
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:30,560
Why do you need the pool then? To practice your pose late at night?

281
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:32,840
Don't talk about things you don't know.

282
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,220
Then, say it.

283
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,300
Waii!

284
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:48,200
You will start using the pool today?

285
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:54,430
Can I ask you to finish within half an hour?

286
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:56,270
We have to practice.

287
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,810
You got it, Coach.

288
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:00,890
But on the event day, we will need to use the pool for a full day.

289
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:01,840
That's too much!

290
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,340
Just a couple of months.

291
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,950
Within the next month, the uni will see the team captain perform.

292
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:13,490
The team captain has a duty to protect the club.

293
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,580
Thank you.

294
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,480
What are you doing?

295
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,810
If you want a photo, just ask. Don't act like a creep.

296
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:57,150
You're done creating a mess?

297
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:04,080
Take it all you want.

298
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,000
Smile.

299
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:11,700
I'm not here because of the head of the swimming team.

300
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,650
Are you here to see me?

301
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:24,570
Do you know that I'm with the swimming team now?

302
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,890
You?

303
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,220
Don't act so innocent.

304
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:34,960
If you don't want to be known as a girl who pesters, stop following me.

305
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,470
Who?

306
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,100
You!

307
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,950
I'm not pestering. I'm working.

308
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:42,270
Pestering someone is not cool.

309
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,640
Can't you hear me? I'm working.

310
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,050
Work?

311
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:54,580
When a girl is not willing to have her photos taken, but you do it anyway,

312
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,830
it's not okay, you know?

313
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:59,770
You totally underestimate my skills.

314
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,480
Look! How's that?

315
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:06,720
This one could make you a net idol.

316
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,780
So cute.

317
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:11,030
I would totally want you as my girlfriend.

318
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,200
This is not funny.

319
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:21,690
I'm leaving

320
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:23,550
Stop coming to the pool.

321
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:25,720
I'm here for work. Haven't you listened?

322
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:52,670
Coach told me to stay at the dorm in case we have early practice.

323
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,640
Fay, why didn't you tell me you'd come?

324
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,840
I'm here to see Apo, not you.

325
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:24,160
You're here early. I don't even have to wait for you.

326
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:26,230
Let's go home.

327
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,890
Wait, come here for a second.

328
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:34,630
Oh, I know her.

329
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:39,840
This is Pan, my friend from the swimming club.

330
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:43,310
This is Namkhaeng, my neighbor.

331
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,120
Hello.

332
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,040
Is this your real voice?

333
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:02,730
Namkhaeng, I'm going to get something over there.

334
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:04,060
Just stay with Pan for a minute.

335
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,090
I'll be back shortly.

336
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,790
Take good care of her.

337
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:17,300
Are you just his friend?

338
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,020
Fah?

339
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:20,980
We are just friends, totally.

340
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:21,790
Are you sure?

341
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:23,030
A million percent.

342
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:25,230
I'm not into guys anyway.

343
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,240
Huh?

344
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,630
I'm not into guys like Fah.

345
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,200
That's great.

346
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:37,760
Why's that?

347
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:42,230
I don't know any of his friends.

348
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,070
I don't have anyone to talk to.

349
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:48,230
Can you ship me and P'Fah?

350
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,240
Can you ship me and P'Fah?

351
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,020
Ship?

352
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:55,400
Yes, ship me and P'Fah like...

353
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,680
this.

354
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:07,260
Can you ask him how he feels about me?

355
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:10,460
I don't know how else to make a move on him

356
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:13,240
Please. Help me please.

357
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:25,060
Please, P'Pan.

358
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:39,640
You said there's nothing going on between you and Namkhaeng.

359
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,970
There's nothing.

360
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,090
Just that she's been making a move on you

361
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:49,650
Where did you get this from?

362
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,580
Her own words.

363
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:54,460
Help!

364
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,090
Calm down.

365
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,370
Come here.

366
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,590
Do you have a death wish?

367
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,580
Good that you're here.

368
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:07,160
Help me remove him from the board.

369
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,710
You were so happy to see Namkhaeng before.

370
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,120
Why are you like this now?

371
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,920
He lied to me about Namkhaeng.

372
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:14,930
I didn't lie.

373
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:18,610
She likes me but I don't like her back.

374
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,210
Fah!

375
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,680
She likes Fah and why are you beating him up?

376
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,530
Right?

377
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,990
Are you really my friend?

378
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,340
Yes, I am.

379
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,680
What Put said is right.

380
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:35,920
Even if you beat him up, it doesn't make her like you.

381
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,150
She may even hate you.

382
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:44,460
I promise I will stop hanging out with her.

383
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,750
I won't see her or talk to her.

384
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,990
So, you don't have to see her either. Okay?

385
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,160
I won't see her either?

386
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,020
Not okay!

387
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:58,430
Seriously? What do you want?

388
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:02,650
But you see her because of Fah.

389
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:09,460
Whatever makes me stay dry, I'm in.

390
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:27,590
Apo!

391
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:28,620
Fay!

392
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,680
Sorry, I thought the room would be empty

393
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:33,620
It's okay. I'm running late.

394
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:38,340
Waii is at the pool.

395
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:39,740
Huh?

396
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:42,010
What about his wrist?

397
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:44,650
Not yet. He's crazy. He finds a way to practice.

398
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,140
You're not going to see Waii?

399
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,490
No,

400
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:56,810
I'm lazy. I'd rather stay here.

401
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,810
How long have you stayed here?

402
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,450
A few days.

403
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,010
Do you like Waii?

404
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,990
I mean do you get along well with him?

405
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:17,250
Oh, it's good. It's going okay.

406
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:19,490
Seriously?

407
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:22,870
Waii is not good at getting along with people.

408
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:27,560
People who can get along with him are very special.

409
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,220
Maybe a little strange.

410
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:39,620
You guys are messy.

411
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,820
He hasn't talked to me much, actually.

412
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:49,800
I don't even know if he is willing to let me stay here.

413
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,930
This is the reason why Waii doesn't have a lot of friends.

414
00:31:54,810 --> 00:32:00,690
He used to be close with someone but then they fought.

415
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:05,810
Waii gets into a lot of fights...

416
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:09,780
with friends, father.

417
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,980
It's actually about the same thing.

418
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:17,060
I'm hungry. What do you have?

419
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:23,130
Let me go have a look in the fridge.

420
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,960
Today sucks.

421
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:44,930
The frigging student body came to pool...

422
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:47,680
Apo, I think this looks very spicy.

423
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:53,180
Thought you guys don't talk much.

424
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,460
Fay, why didn't you tell me you'd come?

425
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,560
I'm here to see Apo, not you

426
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:06,330
Why do you want to see him?

427
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:08,300
I'm not telling you.

428
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:13,300
Have you eaten?

429
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,060
Fay made this.

430
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,830
I made this for you, Apo.

431
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,290
But...

432
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,980
I'm not eating. Go for it. I'm not hungry.

433
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,600
Do you want eggs?

434
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,860
Let's add eggs

435
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,190
I'm going to buy eggs for you.

436
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:28,210
Fay, no

437
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,400
It's fine.

438
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,420
No, I'm not having eggs.

439
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:38,130
I told you Fay is my girlfriend.

440
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:42,130
She came to see you but you're not here.

441
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:44,800
And you two cooked up something to eat.

442
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,370
Well...

443
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:51,420
From now on, I'll keep you in sight at all times.

444
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:54,810
Don't hang out with Fay alone ever again. Got it?

445
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,540
Help me!

446
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,830
Now I'm dead.

447
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,230
You're slow, Put.

448
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,460
What did you blame me for?

449
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:12,690
Min is pretty good.

450
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:14,690
He's good at everything.

451
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,310
Don't say nice things about him.

452
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,710
You know that Kluay kind of hates him

453
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:22,190
Who says?

454
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:26,570
Yeah right? You don't look like you hate him at all.

455
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:32,370
So, what's going on between you, Min and Fah?

456
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,770
It's a long time ago. Nothing important.

457
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:37,710
You never answer the question.

458
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:39,350
Why is it such a secret?

459
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:44,570
For real, I don't think there's anything

460
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:49,140
Guys, Minotaur is here.

461
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,300
I saw it. Get him.

462
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,760
Get him? I've tried and lost ten times.

463
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,380
Don't know what else to do.

464
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,460
He's so good.

465
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:00,060
I'd love to know who he is.

466
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,420
He can join my team then

467
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:11,830
We lost again.

468
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:13,350
For the eleventh time.

469
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:16,690
Want to go for the twelfth round?

470
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,760
I'm not playing anymore. Let's go find something to eat.

471
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,980
I'm hungry.

472
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,400
I need something to recharge myself

473
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,160
You, too?

474
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,070
Yes. Come on.

475
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:25,130
I have to go as well.

476
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,110
Yes.

477
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:42,990
Why aren't you carrying anything?

478
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,380
I can't.

479
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:48,500
But after I'm full, I'd be on a roll.

480
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,900
I'll win every round.

481
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,360
You're talking bullshit.

482
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:53,930
Why did you stop?

483
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:57,900
Min,

484
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:01,570
what are you doing here?

485
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,330
I'm waiting for you guys.

486
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,040
Waiting for us?

487
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,620
That's right.

488
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,060
Why?

489
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,190
Coach told me to stay at the dorm in case we have early practice.

490
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,240
You're staying with us?

491
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,120
Yes.

492
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:25,160
Kluay, where are you going?

493
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:31,090
Don't worry. He's usually like this.

494
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,630
He'll come back.

495
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:36,280
Want to come inside?

496
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:38,450
Let's go. Don't worry.

497
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,060
Come on, dude

498
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,310
Come on, bro.

499
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,660
Welcome.

500
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,710
Put your stuff there.

501
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,230
Thanks for letting me in.

502
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,590
I've been slacking off lately.

503
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:02,130
I don't have muscles anymore.

504
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:14,810
I can't let this go. I want a rematch.

505
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:19,210
But Kluay's gone, and we're missing one member.

506
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:21,010
What should we do?

507
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,020
Ask someone else to join?

508
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,660
Who?

509
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:27,070
Min, do you play games?

510
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,060
Yes. What game?

511
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:33,350
Check it out.

512
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:35,950
Come sit, sir.

513
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:38,680
You don't need to do that

514
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,800
That's a bit much.

515
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,020
I'm glad we have a full team.

516
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,560
This game.

517
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,060
This one?

518
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,430
I play it, too.

519
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:50,850
Awesome

520
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:52,180
Login with Kluay's computer

521
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,000
Are you sure?

522
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,040
Yeah. Go for it.

523
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,660
We need teamwork.

524
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,480
We have a team.

525
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,910
Are you good at this game?

526
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,430
So-so.

527
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:06,560
Yeah? It's okay. I'll teach you.

528
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,060
I'm an expert.

529
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,500
Thank you.

530
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,810
What?

531
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:16,740
Are you sure you've logged in correctly?

532
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,840
Yeah, I'm sure.

533
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,620
This is your handle?

534
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:26,910
Yes, I am Minotaur.

535
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:31,570
Minotaur in the flesh.

536
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,350
Why?

537
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,890
Nothing.

538
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,140
Let's get started.

539
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,090
Yeah?

540
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:40,430
What are you waiting for?

541
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,680
You're going to teach me, right?

542
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:46,850
How about I massage you instead?

543
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,830
Here we go. Let's choose an avatar.

544
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:52,730
Hey, wait.

545
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,240
You don't like them?

546
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,880
No. They like to bully the weaker ones.

547
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,500
What you've done...

548
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:06,100
is it for the greater good or for your personal satisfaction?

549
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:26,480
Just drop me off here.

550
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:29,750
No, let's walk to your place. It's getting late.

551
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:32,890
Not that late. It's okay. I can find my way back.

552
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,630
You have practice tomorrow, right?

553
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,440
Yes.

554
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:40,110
Apo, I'll make you some noodles again next time.

555
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:44,060
Two eggs. You like eggs, don't you?

556
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:48,130
I'm taking off. Bye.

557
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,700
Go home safely.

558
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,600
Call me.

559
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:01,110
Why are you looking at my girlfriend?

560
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:04,790
I'll stop then.

561
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,350
You'd better.

562
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,460
Where are you going?

563
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,880
The dorm is this way

564
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,120
I don't want to go back yet

565
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:18,470
I'm taking a walk.

566
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,960
I see. I'm going back then.

567
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,080
Hey, wait.

568
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:32,330
I told you I need to keep you in sight at all times.

569
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,530
I thought you're taking a walk

570
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,820
Too lazy

571
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:14,800
I'd rather sit still.

572
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:24,550
You want to swim, don't you?

573
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:27,980
How about being honest with yourself?

574
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,520
You act like you hate swimming.

575
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,780
You don't understand.

576
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,220
What?

577
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,880
I don't hate swimming.

578
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,680
I just don't want to enter competitions

579
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,720
You're afraid of losing?

580
00:41:58,890 --> 00:41:59,810
No.

581
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:07,680
Can I have my moment of silence without your annoying questions?

582
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:13,680
Why did you ask me to come with?

583
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,770
Huh?

584
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,050
What?

585
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:43,030
Okay. I'll stop talking.

586
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,330
Are you happy?

587
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:47,480
No.

588
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,550
Now?

589
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:51,050
Now?

590
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,020
No.

591
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,140
Now?

592
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:59,240
You like to swim very much, right?

593
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:03,430
Go swim then.

594
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:05,990
No! Waii! I'm sorry.

595
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,200
Mai.

596
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:38,270
Hello, Mai?

597
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:50,490
You're not eating. Are you full?

598
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,280
Excuse me.

599
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,680
Do you know where the toilets are?

600
00:43:57,870 --> 00:43:58,860
Bell?

601
00:43:58,870 --> 00:43:59,890
Wan?

602
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,540
What are you doing here?

603
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:09,550
I'm waiting for my girlfriend.

604
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,680
She lives around here.

605
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:17,370
When I saw you earlier, I thought you've changed so much.

606
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:20,480
Seeing you now makes me realize you're still the same girl.

607
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,370
Why? How have I changed?

608
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,240
You are much more beautiful.

609
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:28,930
You wore these thick glasses when we're in junior high.

610
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:33,010
You came to school without any makeup on.

611
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:37,750
Well, a person should improve over time.

612
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:40,610
I'm glad to see you cuter and stronger.

613
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,040
It's been a long time.

614
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:49,010
Where are you going?

615
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:50,750
Hi, kitty.

616
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:53,950
Isn't she cute?

617
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:00,870
Hold this for me?

618
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:05,950
I'm tired.

619
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:08,880
Turn around.

620
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:14,470
Why?

621
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:16,490
Turn around.

622
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:18,910
Why?

623
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,750
If not, I'll tell Waii.

624
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:30,250
You're heavy.

625
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:38,130
Keep going.

626
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:40,920
A servant does not talk much.

627
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,380
What are you doing?

628
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:48,100
The swimmers aren't nice.

629
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:50,340
You don't like them?

630
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:54,100
No. They like to bully the weaker ones

631
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:58,340
Why don't you stop them?

632
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:01,360
Why would I do that?

633
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,680
It's better to take pictures as evidence and get them later.

634
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,160
What you've done...

635
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:09,780
is it for the greater good or for your personal satisfaction?

636
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:18,450
Even if I explained to you, you wouldn't understand.

637
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,070
The toilets are over there.

638
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,270
I forgot!

639
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:24,630
I'm going. Bye.

640
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:39,800
Waii, instead of coming here, why don't you call a doctor?

641
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,860
He's my brother. I need to see him.

642
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:43,430
Who is he with?

643
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:46,010
I don't care. Stop asking

644
00:46:53,050 --> 00:47:01,360
Something may seem impossible until you start taking action.
