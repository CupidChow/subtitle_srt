1
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,630
Why do you need the pool then?

2
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,720
To practice your pose late at night?

3
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,360
What you've done...

4
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,580
is it for the greater good or for your personal satisfaction?

5
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,150
This one could make you a net idol.

6
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,630
This is Pan, my friend from the swimming club.

7
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,990
Can you ship me and P'Fah?

8
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,740
Can you ship me and P'Fah?

9
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,410
Waii, instead of coming here, why don't you call a doctor?

10
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,050
He's my brother. I need to see him.

11
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,420
P'Tee,

12
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,990
join me in the shower?

13
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,640
Okay.

14
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,030
Change of plan.

15
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,100
Let's do something else.

16
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:36,490
Waii!

17
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:39,750
Kan!

18
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,420
P'Waii.

19
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,080
Mai.

20
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,400
This painting is over 10 years old.

21
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:16,820
Waii painted it.

22
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,460
The pigments faded.

23
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,110
I wish they were as bright as before.

24
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,260
I'm sorry for the shock earlier.

25
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:39,900
That's fine.

26
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,770
Are you disappointed in me?

27
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:49,410
Well...

28
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,540
no.

29
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:01,110
Mai, you said you had a high fever.

30
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,210
So mischievous.

31
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,940
I was a little sick but I wanted to see you, so I called

32
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,500
I was so worried.

33
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,730
Who gave you the medicine?

34
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,530
P'Kan. He gave me a sponge bath, too.

35
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,940
Does he come here a lot?

36
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,440
Here it comes.

37
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,480
Boiled rice with minced pork, your favorite.

38
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,320
Yay!

39
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,140
And boiled eggs?

40
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:30,140
Six minutes, just the way you like it.

41
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,270
Awesome.

42
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,830
Go home.

43
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,640
I can take care of my brother.

44
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,610
Where do you want him to go?

45
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,970
He lives here with us.

46
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,700
Mai, I have to go.

47
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,880
I'll call you later.

48
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,960
P'Waii!

49
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,310
Waii! Waii!

50
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,520
Let's go.

51
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,660
Now? What about your brother?

52
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,520
Waii, please be here for your brother.

53
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,490
I'll go.

54
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,540
Then go!

55
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,120
And don't ever come back.

56
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,480
Go! Get gone!

57
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,080
You come here in my house, spend time with my brother.

58
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,680
Be with my father.

59
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,400
Just go!

60
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,470
Waii, your brother is sick.

61
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:44,990
Use your brain

62
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,670
What about you?

63
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,670
Did you use your brain when you brought him to our house?

64
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:52,030
Whoever I bring home is my business.

65
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,580
Where does he sleep?

66
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:58,610
Waii.

67
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,610
Do you sleep on the same bed?

68
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,500
Does he sleep where mom used to?

69
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,080
Sawasdee krap, Coach.

70
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,340
One, two, three.

71
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,980
Two beds, three people. Easy, right?

72
00:08:56,530 --> 00:09:00,330
Yep. Thanks so much and apologies for bothering you.

73
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:04,950
It's nothing. But we do expect something in return.

74
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,090
What?

75
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,310
Easy. Just win the next game.

76
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,260
Right up my alley. Bring it.

77
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,880
Before you do that, can you take this douche off my back?

78
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,380
I feel like I'm possessed by a ghost.

79
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,520
I can't do anything with that.

80
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm going to turn on the game.

81
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,400
Is Mai asleep?

82
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,180
Yes. He cried himself to sleep.

83
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:39,370
Do you think this thing between us...

84
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,140
Save this conversation for another day

85
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,760
I can take any more stress at this point.

86
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:45,900
I'm sorry.

87
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:47,520
Kan,

88
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,090
don't think too much into this.

89
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,400
Waii is always like this, you know it.

90
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,410
Don't go anywhere.

91
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,670
But Wai...

92
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,070
He would hate me regardless.

93
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,540
All I ask is that you don't hate me, too.

94
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,910
That will never happen.

95
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,550
I love you

96
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,720
And I will love you forever.

97
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,840
Waii! Wait for me!

98
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,900
Waii.

99
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,950
Mai just called me, so I came here.

100
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,710
Fay, can you let me be alone?

101
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,760
Please go home.

102
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:01,520
Waii!

103
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:03,380
Fay, let me handle this.

104
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,930
Waii!

105
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,600
Don't!

106
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Let go! None of your business.

107
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,640
Get a grip.

108
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,400
What's the point of doing all this?

109
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:50,650
I didn't expect this to make things better.

110
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:53,260
How can my life be better?

111
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,650
Didn't you see how your Coach Tee was?

112
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,530
Others call him 'great'.

113
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,650
But he's actually an old creep.

114
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,050
He's in love, like you are.

115
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,460
You think it's the same thing?

116
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:45,570
Do you still think it's the same?

117
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:11,670
Accept it.

118
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,550
You don't know shit about love.

119
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:23,440
I want to know how guy-on-guy action is better.

120
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:26,610
How is it so good that it replaced my mom?

121
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,680
Satisfied?

122
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:09,670
Did you get your answer?

123
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,520
He's famous?

124
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,760
Yes, but not for swimming.

125
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,120
What girl, P'Fah?

126
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,460
What are they chatting about?

127
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,220
P'Fah!

128
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:16,200
Are you free? Can you help me buy something?

129
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,350
Okay.

130
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:23,990
All done.

131
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,520
Great.

132
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:43,220
Namkhaeng. Namkhaneg.

133
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,030
Why a long face?

134
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,650
Don't you want to go shopping with me?

135
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,980
What's wrong?

136
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,920
I do but...

137
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,980
Here you go.

138
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,220
Thank you.

139
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,120
I thought it'd be just the two of us.

140
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,620
Where's the snack for P'Fah?

141
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,670
P'Fah, you can share with me.

142
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,950
It's okay. I'll get my own.

143
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,720
Enjoy yours.

144
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,620
P'Fah!

145
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,190
P'Pan.

146
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,190
Hmm?

147
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,670
Can you please leave?

148
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:46,120
Tell him you have a stomachache or something

149
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:49,380
But...

150
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,500
You said you're going to help me.

151
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,160
Please help, P'Pan.

152
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,340
Please.

153
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,760
What happened to our pool?

154
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:25,380
Look from here to there, all filled with trash.

155
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:26,470
Shit.

156
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,870
That frigging student body.

157
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,600
They destroyed our pool.

158
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,600
They said they'd clean up afterward.

159
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,430
And did they?

160
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,230
I heard they're going to do something again tomorrow.

161
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,970
This is a pool, not a playground.

162
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,470
What the hell?

163
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,970
Wait, the student body.

164
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,530
Is it Wan?

165
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:50,970
Do you know her?

166
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,930
Yeah, a little.

167
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:00,430
If you know her, can you talk to her?

168
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,550
Tell her to get off our back.

169
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,330
It's frigging annoying.

170
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,120
Why did you ask an outsider for a favor?

171
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,100
A runner won't give a damn about us.

172
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,970
What if I can help?

173
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:22,590
Will you accept me as a member of your club?

174
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:29,940
Show us what you can do and we can talk.

175
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,090
Let us help.

176
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,550
Hey, Fay.

177
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:58,460
Waii is at my place

178
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,380
Oh, does he have clothes?

179
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,750
That's why I'm here.

180
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,470
Is he okay?

181
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,060
When he first found out about this, it was way worse.

182
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,960
You mean Kan?

183
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,210
You met Kan, I see.

184
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,100
Is he Waii's friend that you mentioned?

185
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,320
They were tight in the first year of college.

186
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:49,150
A famous duo of the club.

187
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,580
Now they hate each other more than anything.

188
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,260
Is he a swimmer?

189
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:06,470
He was. That's how he knew Waii's dad.

190
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:11,400
When this happened, he changed to another university.

191
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:14,020
Very famous now.

192
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,320
He's famous?

193
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,340
Yes, but not for swimming.

194
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:24,440
Give me your phone.

195
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:45,440
No more questions, right?

196
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:14,490
Why are you two walking that closely together?

197
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:21,270
P'Fah, you said you're going to take me to the mall to buy a gift.

198
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,580
Oh, a gift.

199
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:28,760
I'm too lazy to go now. Let's do this later.

200
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,520
Oh... whose gift are you buying for?

201
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:42,960
When a guy asks a girl to help him buy a gift, it must be for a girl.

202
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,640
What girl? Who is it?

203
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,480
I have to pee. Take this.

204
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:49,500
I have to pee. I'll be back.

205
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,050
P'Fah!

206
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,880
Who is the gift for?

207
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,880
I have to go, too.

208
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,280
Wait, P'Pan. Why are you in a hurry?

209
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,310
You wanted me to leave, didn't you?

210
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:03,000
Please tell Fah that I have to go to practice.

211
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,900
Also tell him to get anything except a doll because she hates that.

212
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:12,310
P'Pan, who is she?

213
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,110
They asked me to come and left me like this.

214
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:19,050
Who is she?

215
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:27,560
Hey.

216
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,060
Are you sure you want to leave?

217
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,610
You'll leave me alone with Namkhaeng.

218
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:36,290
Fine. Just follow the plan that I told you.

219
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:39,470
She knows that I never buy stuff for girls.

220
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:42,050
Do the things that she doesn't know.

221
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:44,050
So, she'll come to a person who knows like me.

222
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,780
I'm taking off.

223
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:49,290
Wait, what do you want me to buy?

224
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,060
Buy whatever.

225
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,520
You certainly take a long time to pee.

226
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,560
How about you pee standing up with someone watching?

227
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,190
But I'm still pissed at you for last night.

228
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,540
What are you doing?

229
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,810
Min.

230
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,920
By the look of it, you're not here to help.

231
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,100
Are you about to hurt Wan?

232
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:55,550
I just want to get revenge for you, Min.

233
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,680
Why?

234
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:01,870
Because she caused you to get hurt and unable to run.

235
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,630
Aren't you upset?

236
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,870
Of course, I am.

237
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:15,610
But when I realize that someone is upset in my place, it lessens my pain.

238
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:18,230
I don't think you should hurt Wan.

239
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:22,420
The only person who can do something to her is me.

240
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:25,050
Let's go along with this, okay?

241
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,330
Don't hurt her or she may cry.

242
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,500
Who says I'll cry?

243
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:38,490
You and your friends don't have to come to the track anymore.

244
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:39,950
We can chat on IG.

245
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:45,030
Bye.

246
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,840
Thank you for the paint

247
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,460
Why are you here?

248
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,380
To help you

249
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,160
Who asked you?

250
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:10,550
Thank you for taking care of this.

251
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,670
It's okay. No problem.

252
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:18,970
I told you that I wouldn't let anyone hurt you.

253
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,600
Do you have a clue what I'm working on?

254
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:35,580
This must be a cutout for some event.

255
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:39,900
Some event that will be held at the swimming club tomorrow.

256
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,060
So? I'm with the running team.

257
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:46,140
I have nothing to do with the swimming club.

258
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,640
You're playing for two teams now, huh?

259
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,800
To be honest, I didn't come here to help you.

260
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:03,190
I wanted to talk to you.

261
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:09,510
What about?

262
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,660
Were you a runner?

263
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,120
Yes.

264
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,140
Why did you stop?

265
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,840
You're asking too many questions.

266
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,580
You were a runner.

267
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:28,900
I wanted to know if the reason you quit is the same as mine.

268
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,420
I'm sorry.

269
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:44,400
That's fine. Forget about it.

270
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:46,500
It's bound to happen sooner or later.

271
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,340
I caused your injuries

272
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:53,330
Forget about it. This is nothing.

273
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:54,860
I'll be fine soon.

274
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,360
Hey!

275
00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:00,070
Sorry to interrupt.

276
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:02,200
You didn't interrupt anything.

277
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,240
There is an urgent meeting.

278
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,330
Let's go.

279
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:07,800
No. I haven't finished my work here

280
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,960
Let someone else do it then.

281
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,680
There's no one.

282
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:18,050
I need to do it myself.

283
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,500
What are we going to do if this is not done?

284
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:22,230
The event is tomorrow morning.

285
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,330
I'll do it.

286
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,490
Trust me.

287
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,640
This is the only cutout that we have.

288
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:33,670
If you mess it up, there's not a spare one that we can use.

289
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:36,880
Easy peasy. The task is just to paint this, right?

290
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,580
Go to your meeting.

291
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:40,030
I'll handle this.

292
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:56,920
I told you the only person who can do something to her is me.

293
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:14,000
Coach.

294
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,610
Is Waii here?

295
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:19,300
No. I don't know when he will be back.

296
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,380
Okay.

297
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:24,560
Maybe it's better to wait until he calms down.

298
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:27,690
He never will.

299
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:32,250
You've seen how he talks to me.

300
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,140
If you knew that, why would you come here?

301
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:41,530
I'm your father.

302
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:43,410
I have every right to see you.

303
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:45,740
Act like one.

304
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,700
It's my fault

305
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:53,180
that I didn't teach you to respect your father.

306
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:55,530
Have you done anything to deserve it?

307
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:05,530
What do I need to do to be able to talk to you?

308
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,050
End it with him.

309
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:08,650
No.

310
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:12,150
You can't do shit. Why would you even ask?

311
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,800
Calm down.

312
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:17,170
Coach, there's no point to talk to him now.

313
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:20,030
Now or later, it doesn't matter.

314
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,000
I can't even look at you.

315
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,700
Don't yell at me for earlier.

316
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,150
I won't.

317
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:18,230
I think he should give you some time to cool off.

318
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:35,920
But I'm still pissed at you for last night.

319
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,860
Easy.

320
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,320
This is mine and I'm throwing it at you.

321
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:04,290
Stop playing.

322
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:12,440
Look at Pan, sitting here brooding over something,

323
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,840
and not helping us do the work.

324
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:18,950
It's not strange for her to not do the work.

325
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:22,200
The brooding part is...

326
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,320
also normal.

327
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:29,960
It's just the way her face is.

328
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,140
I heard that, you jerk!

329
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:40,110
Are you ready for a battle with me? Fine.

330
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:44,550
I thought you're hungry. Would you like some?

331
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:47,050
No! It's dirty!

332
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:48,860
What are you guys doing?

333
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,790
What do you have there?

334
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:56,280
This is an important document needed for the event tomorrow.

335
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,360
So is the cutout in front.

336
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,990
This means they can't hold the event tomorrow.

337
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:04,230
How did you get these? That's awesome.

338
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:07,660
I'm a member of this club. I have to help.

339
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:16,820
On the other hand, someone is pouting every time he sees Min.

340
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:20,530
He pouts so much that I'm afraid his face will get tired.

341
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,950
Don't you want to do something else?

342
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:28,740
What do you mean?

343
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:30,830
He wants to know.

344
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,710
I'll pull your pants instead.

345
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:55,770
What the hell are you doing?

346
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:57,950
Now I know why your name means banana.

347
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,930
I'm jumping in.

348
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,240
Namkhaeng, don't look. Not a pretty sight.

349
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:25,950
Kluay, get dressed!! Quick!

350
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,730
Don't look.

351
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,280
Okay, you can look now.

352
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:40,690
Are you okay?

353
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:41,570
Are you feeling hot?

354
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:43,000
What were they doing before?

355
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,830
I was shocked.

356
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:46,690
How could you walk in here?

357
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:49,090
It is a restricted zone.

358
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:51,670
I want to see you.

359
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,160
You want to see me?

360
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,490
Why are you smiling?

361
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,730
Oh, am I?

362
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,850
What is it that you want to see me about?

363
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:07,440
I want to seek your advice on P'Fah.

364
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,230
I have practice.

365
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:21,490
Hey, guys, we have practice later, right?

366
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:22,660
Right.

367
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:27,640
I have to practice. You can wait for me outside.

368
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,380
I'll give you a call.

369
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,490
You have my number?

370
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:36,170
Give me your hand.

371
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:42,450
This is my number.

372
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:43,990
Use this to contact me via Line.

373
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,920
Guys, sawasdee ka.

374
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:50,490
Sawasdee krap.

375
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:54,590
What's going on?

376
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,540
If you're done with your trick, please start your practice.

377
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,320
Come here.

378
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,610
All smiley.

379
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:05,740
What? There's nothing going on.

380
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,850
Where is Coach, anyway?

381
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:08,360
I'm surprised he's not here yet.

382
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,970
He's never late.

383
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:12,350
That's true.

384
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,060
Guys,

385
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:16,860
Coach isn't coming today.

386
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,350
Why?

387
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,690
Where is he?

388
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,920
If it's not necessary, no need to say hi.

389
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,520
You dare to show your face here.

390
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,610
You call this 'taken care of'?

391
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,910
Why didn't you go to practice?

392
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:13,040
Leave me alone.

393
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,220
You heard it. I don't want to see him.

394
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:20,000
Are you avoiding Coach?

395
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:24,720
Yes. I will quit the club tomorrow.

396
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:26,550
You don't have to.

397
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,190
This is my business.

398
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:30,580
Coach has already resigned.

399
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:34,140
You don't have to see him anymore. Got it?

400
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,580
You're Waii's friend, right?

401
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,500
Is he here?

402
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,950
He isn't.

403
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:05,410
That's a lie

404
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,160
What do you want from him?

405
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:13,130
I can't just let him be when he cost Coach a career.

406
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,250
Coach resigned of his own accord.

407
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,190
Waii had nothing to do with it.

408
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,700
Coach resigned because of him.

409
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,800
And you.

410
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:23,160
I'm not saying Waii is right.

411
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:25,530
But it may be good to take his perspective.

412
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,160
I think it's best to give each other space for now.

413
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,900
Are you ready to talk?

414
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,440
Do you know...

415
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:07,010
my mom died when Mai was born?

416
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:14,620
Since then, my life had revolved around my dad.

417
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:22,340
So you swam with him.

418
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:30,310
He became a swimming coach because of me.

419
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:37,140
When I was little, he was there for us the whole time.

420
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,620
When he found out that I liked swimming,

421
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,660
he was very supportive.

422
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:53,000
His life revolved around us, too. Me and Mai.

423
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:04,410
You must know that he loves you and your brother very much.

424
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:11,400
Even an outside like me can feel it.

425
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:15,850
Why?

426
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:21,910
Why aren't the three of us enough for him?

427
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:37,130
You have Fay.

428
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:41,160
Coach wants someone who takes care of him, too.

429
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:54,720
Why Kan, then?

430
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:02,540
The reason I don't enter external races is him.

431
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,660
You do it out of spite for Coach?

432
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,820
No.

433
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:13,840
If I attend races, I may see him.

434
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:19,330
My dad will also get to see him.

435
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:25,160
I'm such an idiot for not knowing that they've been living together all along.

436
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,850
Let's play a game.

437
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:33,170
No.

438
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:36,320
Non-sense.

439
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:40,110
I'm going to bed.

440
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,840
Let's play.

441
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,340
Whoever laughs first loses.

442
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:58,060
I will win this game for sure.

443
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,440
I'm not in the mood for laugh.

444
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:14,420
Enough?

445
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:17,370
It's my turn.

446
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:19,050
Go ahead.

447
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:53,110
So who won?

448
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:57,990
It's a tie.

449
00:42:57,990 --> 00:42:59,310
I'm going to bed.

450
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:17,050
Hey, Fah!

451
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:24,250
How are you? You're here early.

452
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:26,640
I haven't seen you in practice, though.

453
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,680
Cut the crap. If it's not necessary, no need to say hi.

454
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,380
So, about that...

455
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:39,090
You dare to show your face here.

456
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:41,670
I already took care of that.

457
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,160
You said you would accept me into the club.

458
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,500
You call this 'taken care of'?

459
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:52,020
Please come inside. This is a charity event.

460
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:55,950
I can guarantee that it will be fun as well as charitable.

461
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,910
Let's go, Fah.

462
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:08,790
I should have known not to trust someone who has betrayed a friend.

463
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:12,230
Please bring your friends.

464
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:13,320
Wan.

465
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:16,380
You said without the cutout you wouldn't have been able to hold the event

466
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,430
Do you know we're living in a digital age?

467
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:26,990
It only took an event created on Facebook to get people to come.

468
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:30,080
Do you really believe that I would leave you alone with such an important thing?

469
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,980
You being all nice to me was quite telling.

470
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,460
You're a good actor.

471
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,970
You are, too

472
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:49,590
Your apology was also fake, wasn't it?

473
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:09,330
"An unwounded person is one without experience."
