1
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,640
What are you doing here?

2
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,580
I'm here to coach

3
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,099
Fah!

4
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,860
Fah!

5
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:28,059
I wish long-lasting love for the two of you

6
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,719
I'm scared!

7
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,560
It's not what you think.

8
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,159
Men.

9
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:58,699
There isn't the only girl in school, you know?

10
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,640
Slut.

11
00:03:32,539 --> 00:03:36,579
Cancel your account

12
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,040
28...

13
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,520
29...

14
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:05,039
30...

15
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:11,119
Next is 5 sets of sit-ups.

16
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,620
You will compete next month.

17
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:15,659
Pair up.

18
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:23,019
Come on.

19
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,320
I'll help you. Come on.

20
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:16,139
Are they doing sit-ups or something else?

21
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:09,120
Fah, do you know where all the member applications are.

22
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:16,060
Oh, they are in the cabinet next to the lockers.

23
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,720
What about the applications of the new members?

24
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,780
I couldn't find them.

25
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:29,939
Min's application, in particular.

26
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:37,959
Min didn't submit an application.

27
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,040
He just transferred from the swimming club.

28
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:51,039
I just want to know why Min is here in the swimming club

29
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,660
He loves to run.

30
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,920
How did you know that Min used to be on the running team.

31
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,120
I was...

32
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,300
I heard from other people.

33
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,160
So, do you know why?

34
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,780
I think he got injured.

35
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,379
He cannot run fast anymore.

36
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:17,779
I think that's why he was transferred.

37
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,840
Okay. Thank you.

38
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:28,079
Fah,

39
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:32,399
I didn't see your application either.

40
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:38,899
Coach Tee must have placed it somewhere else

41
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,620
Oh, Namkhaeng!

42
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,699
Why are you startled every time you see me?

43
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:06,839
I'm not the only one startled to see you here.

44
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,160
Come here.

45
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:21,779
Shit, is she with Pan?

46
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,300
A tomboy wins this round.

47
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,300
This is something.

48
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:28,839
Shit!

49
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:32,980
Who are you calling shit?

50
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:36,759
Not you.

51
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:40,240
Sung, come and see what your friend did.

52
00:08:47,539 --> 00:08:50,860
This is the clip of you and Wan.

53
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,900
Shit, it's been shared over a hundred times.

54
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,060
Who is this?

55
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:06,240
Is she P'Fah's crush?

56
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:09,779
What, the new coach?

57
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:11,460
Don't lie to me.

58
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,399
I've been following him for weeks

59
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,360
I never saw him talk to any girl, but this one

60
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,899
Wait, following him for weeks.

61
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:21,480
Do you even go to school?

62
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,840
Or are you lying to me?

63
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,080
What lie?

64
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,019
Does he even have a crush?

65
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:28,480
If I find out that you lie to me,

66
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,879
I'll stop being friends with you.

67
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,700
I'll hate you so much.

68
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,240
Yep, that's the one

69
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:39,500
Yes!

70
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:41,879
Why are you happy?

71
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:44,679
At least I know what my enemy looks like

72
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:49,379
She's very attractive.

73
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,379
Hot and fierce.

74
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,840
This is exactly his type.

75
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,940
Totally opposite to you.

76
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,360
What are you saying?

77
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,380
It's not too late to get over him.

78
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,140
This is his type, huh?

79
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,240
I'll be one for him

80
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,120
Huh?

81
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,220
Hey!

82
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,679
Where did you come from?

83
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,199
I was under the water for a long time.

84
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,240
You're full of it.

85
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,299
What did you say?

86
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:36,319
Show me.

87
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:37,740
Sure.

88
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:19,360
This pool is exclusive to the members.

89
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:22,019
Your dad isn't here, is he?

90
00:11:23,539 --> 00:11:25,539
Don't say you're practicing.

91
00:11:25,539 --> 00:11:28,319
From what I've seen, it didn't look like practicing at all.

92
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:32,599
That was us taking a rest.

93
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:38,299
Don't you miss me?

94
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,740
Of course.

95
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:42,919
What about you, Apo?

96
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,240
I won't let you out of my sight again.

97
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,720
The last time I left Waii with you and you both disappeared.

98
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,019
Are you cold?

99
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:54,279
Yes. Give me a hug.

100
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:59,699
Play with me. Come on.

101
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,240
Let's go.

102
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:05,120
Go.

103
00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:42,679
Let me go!

104
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:45,659
What have you done?

105
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:51,259
Remember this technique. You won't have to tie your shoes ever again

106
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:28,110
Aom, I was just looking for you.

107
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,970
Why are you here?

108
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:32,650
Have you seen Wan? Where is she?

109
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:37,570
If you're here about the performance budget, sorry.

110
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:42,630
Your club and your girl are out of this project.

111
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,930
Wan, too?

112
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,500
Did you have to fire her?

113
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:51,530
No. She's just been taken off the press conference task

114
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,390
It doesn't mean that she gets fired.

115
00:13:54,700 --> 00:14:00,620
Plus, there's no evidence that she did something wrong.

116
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,960
If she's innocent, why did she run?

117
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,840
She's off the grid.

118
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,630
What am I supposed to think?

119
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,850
She ran?

120
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,680
Why and where did she go?

121
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,840
Enough, Min.

122
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,750
Stop pulling pranks on her.

123
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,090
I'm going back to work.

124
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,980
P'Waii is so cool.

125
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,090
Who? Let me go!

126
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,870
This is not okay. Let me go!

127
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:56,810
Boy, you're sitting here in the dark.

128
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,080
What have you done?

129
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,740
I just finished my tutoring.

130
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,620
Don't hurt me.

131
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,960
What valuables do you have on you?

132
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,020
Give them to me.

133
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,010
Take whatever you want.

134
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,890
Don't dig too deep.

135
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:22,170
You have nothing.

136
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,130
I'll take this then.

137
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:25,860
No!

138
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,230
Who is in the profile picture with you?

139
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:30,230
Your boyfriend?

140
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,980
No, I just admire him.

141
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,390
Smile!

142
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,200
I order you to smile!

143
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,800
If you don't want anything to happen to you,

144
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:54,690
see me at the pool at 10 AM tomorrow.

145
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,620
Don't be late. Got it, tootsie?

146
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,680
Shit, it's frigging P'Kluay.

147
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,660
What did you say?

148
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,700
Nothing.

149
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,460
See your profile picture.

150
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,920
Do you see the man beside you?

151
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:14,670
Quite good looking like me.

152
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,200
Shit, P'Kluay!

153
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,450
Don't delete this picture, understand?

154
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,040
Are you ticklish?

155
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,950
You screamed like a girl when I touched you.

156
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,040
No.

157
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,060
Scared much?

158
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,110
Hey.

159
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,130
What?

160
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:59,930
Why are you taking so long to tie your shoes?

161
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,080
hurry up.

162
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,900
Dude! Don't interrupt me or it will take longer.

163
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:07,900
Let me.

164
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,080
Remember this technique.

165
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:35,090
You won't have to tie your shoes ever again.

166
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,510
Ever again?

167
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,660
Too extreme, don't you think?

168
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,040
Lifetime guarantee.

169
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,100
How can you do that?

170
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,960
Will you run with me for the rest of your life?

171
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,600
Sure, I will.

172
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:02,390
I'm going out for a run before the sun comes out.

173
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,580
Hold on

174
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,120
Hey.

175
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:10,130
Fay will run with us.

176
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,100
I miss this.

177
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,330
We used to run together every morning.

178
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,460
Remember?

179
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,400
That's right.

180
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,520
Look at this.

181
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,190
Waii tied my shoes and the laces stay tied to this day.

182
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:26,110
See? I told you.

183
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:31,340
Even that time when I was chased by a dog.

184
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,010
It was so funny, do you remember?

185
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:34,840
Yes, it was funny.

186
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:37,050
You wanted to climb a tree.

187
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,600
I was scared.

188
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:43,440
But in the end, I got to climb on your back.

189
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,400
Whoa, you're heavy. Have you gained weight?

190
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:48,830
Rude.

191
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,100
Come down, chubby.

192
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,160
Who? Let's run.

193
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:54,810
Challenge accepted.

194
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,110
Are you satisfied?

195
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:24,390
Maybe it's better if you go back to bed.

196
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,080
Put, are you out of your mind?

197
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,450
You asked us to practice early morning.

198
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:40,070
We have practice sessions in the afternoon, per the schedule.

199
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,400
Did you call us to see you warm up?

200
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,350
Oh, I see.

201
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,420
Wow, you're here.

202
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,300
I didn't think you'd come.

203
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:01,690
Mai, you are here. I have to be as fit as you.

204
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,190
Coach Mai - isn't she a little older?

205
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,950
Well, older is hot.

206
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:28,640
Did you call us just to watch you flirt with her?

207
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,170
No, I'm not flirting with her.

208
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,200
He's afraid he's going to look silly.

209
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,660
He wanted us to come so he wouldn't look like he tries too hard.

210
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,900
You really know me.

211
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:48,020
It's true. I don't want to come on too strong.

212
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,960
I can feel that sometimes she's having feelings for me.

213
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,160
But other times, she's not.

214
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:56,170
What do you think?

215
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,580
Hey, listen to me, will you?

216
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:04,090
I find this more interesting.

217
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:11,950
Min's clip?

218
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:15,990
I saw it.

219
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:17,210
Saw what?

220
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,600
Show me.

221
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,500
It's nothing. Just a clip of Min and his girl.

222
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,270
Let's talk for a minute.

223
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,330
There's nothing to talk about.

224
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:51,050
This is not the way you should talk to your coach.

225
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,480
Sorry, Coach.

226
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,160
What is it that you want to talk about?

227
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,040
Have a seat.

228
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,720
What do you want?

229
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,960
Lie down.

230
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,360
Mai.

231
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,760
Coach Mai.

232
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,460
What are you doing?

233
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,690
You look stressed out.

234
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,960
I want to help you to relax a bit.

235
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,550
I don't need

236
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,240
Is there something bothering you?

237
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,500
No.

238
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,560
What about school?

239
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:52,700
Competition?

240
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,530
Health?

241
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,690
Or love?

242
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,140
You don't have to tell me.

243
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:08,860
I already know what's up with you.

244
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,880
Ouch! What are you doing?

245
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:22,550
Are you really keeping me out of your life completely?

246
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,840
You started it.

247
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,400
I came back

248
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,840
Isn't that a little too easy?

249
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:33,810
I'm not a restaurant that you can change when you're bored.

250
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:36,390
You can't just come back when you miss the old taste.

251
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:39,730
Yeah, you found your new restaurant.

252
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:44,930
Did it taste nice when you were busy doing it in the classroom?

253
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,390
I wonder.

254
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:59,830
Have you found her?

255
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,670
Wan.

256
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:10,290
I know you're hiding. Come out

257
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:13,360
Dial it down, will you? I don't want to disturb my neighbors.

258
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,700
Aom, please tell me where she is.

259
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,310
I do want to help her.

260
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,070
You want to help her?

261
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:25,910
Stop trying to find her.

262
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,120
You are not going to tell me, are you?

263
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:37,720
Fine. If you're not, I'll George that you're having a fling with a pre-med

264
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:39,020
Where did you hear that?

265
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:41,890
I just made it up.

266
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,960
You're crazy

267
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:49,840
Yes, I am. George is even crazier

268
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:53,570
He will believe me if I tell him that

269
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,190
George, you fool

270
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,180
Don't tell Wan that I told you.

271
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,570
On my scout honor.

272
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,810
Let's do it in the bathroom.

273
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,860
She wanted a manly man.

274
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:15,760
I'm a frigging tomboy, for Christ's sake.

275
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:17,230
You're a tomboy?

276
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,010
Hello, Aom.

277
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,540
Is it here?

278
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,660
If you lied to me, you and George are done.

279
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:01,340
I got you. Where did you run off to?

280
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:07,700
Don't run away again.

281
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,350
Wan.

282
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,670
Sorry.

283
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,260
You apologized to me?

284
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:39,240
What else do you want to hear?

285
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:41,880
Anything to get you off my back.

286
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,960
Wan, let's talk for a second.

287
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,630
What club are you in?

288
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,920
Your cat is cute.

289
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,460
You don't know what club I'm in?

290
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:23,600
Namkhaeng, this shirt should look cute on you.

291
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:26,130
Pair with these jeans.

292
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:31,250
I bought these for you.

293
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:34,170
You said you'd take me to the mall.

294
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,280
Another lie from you.

295
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:40,990
These are cute, but it's not the style of that woman.

296
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,420
I want that style.

297
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:52,210
Do you really think that Fah will like you when you do that?

298
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:54,490
He doesn't like me when I'm like this.

299
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,520
Screw him.

300
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:01,580
There are others who like you the way you are.

301
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:09,370
P'Pan.

302
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,980
But I want P'Fah.

303
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:17,150
Are you happy, though?

304
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:21,370
How long can you pretend to be someone else?

305
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:23,310
I broke up with my ex over this.

306
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,050
She wanted a manly man.

307
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:27,770
I'm a frigging tomboy, for Christ's sake.

308
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:29,670
Now she's with a man.

309
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:31,730
You're a tomboy?

310
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:36,330
You didn't know?

311
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,610
Of course, I did. I didn't want to stress you out.

312
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:44,210
I'm not stressed out.

313
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,050
I let it go. I forgot about her.

314
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,860
How come you're over her so easily?

315
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,210
I don't know.

316
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,390
Maybe...

317
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,880
I have some help

318
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,360
to get over her.

319
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,490
P'Kluay?

320
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:10,010
What could he do to help me?

321
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,430
Is that P'Kluay?

322
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,390
Shit, Kluay.

323
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:21,760
Tom, what are you doing secretively?

324
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,580
Are you on a date?

325
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,740
What about you? Where are you going?

326
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,480
Going out on a date?

327
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:29,410
Eww... no.

328
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:32,990
I'm taking him to buy something for a project.

329
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,710
Don't say I'm helping you. You forced me to do it for you.

330
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:40,080
I talked you up and made you look good.

331
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,560
I didn't want to help. My hands were tied.

332
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,920
You talk too much, tootsie.

333
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:46,730
Who's a tootsie, you jerk?

334
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,530
Yeah, work him hard.

335
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:52,650
He skips on our group project all the time to watch P'Waii swim.

336
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:54,430
You know him?

337
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,580
We're in the same class.

338
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:58,290
Why didn't you tell me?

339
00:29:58,290 --> 00:29:59,630
Why would I?

340
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,960
Are you messing with me?

341
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,410
Yes, for a while now

342
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:06,140
Go and do your shopping.

343
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:07,990
Go now.

344
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:19,530
Wan,

345
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,290
do you remember me?

346
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,970
It's Pon. We met in study body's camp in high school.

347
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,520
Oh, Pon. It's been a long time.

348
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,710
You still remember me.

349
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,330
You're not easy to forget.

350
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,470
Because I was testy?

351
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:42,770
Because you're cute.

352
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:46,380
I haven't heard this from anyone in a while.

353
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:51,080
Not many people know that you're a kind soul, especially to cats.

354
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,770
You like to eat chocolate during meetings.

355
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:56,170
You avoid eating tomatoes in your dish.

356
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,540
How do you know all this?

357
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,890
I told you I never forget you.

358
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:06,460
Do you want to eat chocolate out of the meetings?

359
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:09,180
Sure, there's one good place nearby.

360
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,080
Let's do it in the bathroom. Come on.

361
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:22,270
Let me go.

362
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:27,460
Who do you think you are, talking to someone like this?

363
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:29,200
Do you want to say it again?

364
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,500
I'm sorry. I thought it's just a fling between you guys.

365
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,060
Didn't think it's serious.

366
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:38,680
No. Don't.

367
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,500
Pon, go. I'm not mad at you for saying that.

368
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:47,890
You're a fool for listening to what others say.

369
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:49,610
It's pathetic.

370
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:58,770
Are you okay?

371
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:00,830
I'm fine.

372
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,100
I'm sorry.

373
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,150
From the heart?

374
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,270
Umm...

375
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:33,770
Smile.

376
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,520
For what?

377
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,520
Smile from the heart.

378
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,180
Come on. Smile.

379
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:44,710
Smile from the heart.

380
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,520
Come on. Smile.

381
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:53,520
I'm sorry and thank you for earlier

382
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:58,940
I'm sorry, too, for the clip.

383
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,960
Keep calm and carry on.

384
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:07,940
I'm here for you.

385
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,360
Thanks.

386
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:21,200
Guys!

387
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,470
Did you finish your shopping?

388
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:26,030
No, but I have something better.

389
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,910
Tada!

390
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,090
You can't sit there

391
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,380
Let me be happy like a normal person.

392
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,170
Normal?

393
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,590
Yeah, with him.

394
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,700
What are you doing?

395
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,370
Taking photos of the cat house

396
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:03,290
as ideas for my cat at home.

397
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,830
I can take the picture for you

398
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:05,730
Okay.

399
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:13,280
Oh so cute. Good boy.

400
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:15,330
Aren't you cute?

401
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:16,590
Don't eat the cat.

402
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:19,800
Didn't you want to take a picture of the house? Here it is.

403
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:22,540
Wan.

404
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:29,560
Don't take my picture.

405
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:39,660
Look, nice pictures.

406
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:47,710
I'm going to buy some water.

407
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,080
Do you want anything?

408
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,090
No.

409
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:50,990
Okay.

410
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:56,830
If you're not doing anything besides taking pictures

411
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:58,490
you don't need to be here.

412
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:00,170
Are you with the cat club?

413
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:03,610
Not the cat club, the volunteering club.

414
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,940
Right now we're doing a project for stray cats.

415
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:06,850
You like cats?

416
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:08,110
I like dogs

417
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,380
Why don't you help dogs?

418
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:13,440
Enough with your stupid questions.

419
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,490
If I don't mess with you, where's the fun?

420
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:19,160
Life doesn't have to be fun all the time.

421
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,420
It doesn't hurt to be serious from time to time

422
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,180
Sure, continue.

423
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,960
Have you seen stray cats on campus?

424
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:25,750
Yes. A lot.

425
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:29,010
Right? That's why we need to help them.

426
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,960
Build a place for them to live properly.

427
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:32,680
Why did you just start?

428
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,800
I've been doing this a long time,

429
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,960
but it never takes

430
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:45,530
Why?

431
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:48,580
Because of your swimming club.

432
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,040
Shit, you startled me.

433
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,830
You thought I was Apo or something?

434
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:03,730
We finally got rid of that Wan girl

435
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:24,200
Is this your ex-girlfriend?

436
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,680
Yes, why?

437
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:28,010
She's not that pretty.

438
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,480
What? Who are you?

439
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,540
I'm Namkhaeng, P'Pan's new girlfriend.

440
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:39,160
Seriously?

441
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,760
Thank you, P'Namwan.

442
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,800
For what?

443
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,680
For leaving P'Pan.

444
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:47,590
Otherwise, I wouldn't be with P'Pan today.

445
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:51,090
You like them young now?

446
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:53,710
Yes, young.

447
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,800
Our names say it all.

448
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,680
Namkhaeng or ice is fresher than sticky Namwan or syrup.

449
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:05,080
Shit, girl fight!

450
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:07,410
You're not that manly either.

451
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,560
And he calls me a tootsie.

452
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:28,200
Shit, you startled me.

453
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,510
Don't say shit.

454
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:31,710
Oh, Fay.

455
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,900
"Oh, Fay"?

456
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,700
You thought I was Apo or something?

457
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,700
You're getting a little bit too chummy with him.

458
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,400
I'm jealous, you know.

459
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:51,760
Jealous? That's nuts.

460
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:54,490
We made a plan to practice together

461
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:57,900
Well, practice then. What are you waiting for?

462
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,600
Let go first so I can practice.

463
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,710
No.

464
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,520
Fay, what are you doing?

465
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:31,530
Don't you like it?

466
00:38:58,860 --> 00:38:59,900
Apo.

467
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,070
Apo.

468
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:02,930
Apo.

469
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,170
Apo.

470
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,370
Apo.

471
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,900
Are you going to eat or not?

472
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:09,300
Fine, I am.

473
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,060
What are you contemplating about?

474
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,360
Are you acting for an MV?

475
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,770
What song?

476
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:15,140
Love me by Arm Weerayuth.

477
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,120
That song is popular.

478
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:22,090
I think it is an auspicious time to celebrate the bride and the groom.

479
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:24,630
Kluay and Achi.

480
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:26,470
That's not it.

481
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:30,650
We're here to welcome 4 new members.

482
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:35,410
Apo, Coach Mai, Fah and Min, who will join us later.

483
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:38,640
But we can start the feast now.

484
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,580
Yay.

485
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:50,530
What's going on?

486
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:57,700
And everyone can leave with a full pocket.

487
00:39:57,710 --> 00:40:01,370
Our sponsor today is Coach Mai.

488
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:05,490
Eat. This is good to go.

489
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:07,710
Touch and see if it's hot.

490
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:08,910
Tell your dad.

491
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:12,770
Where is Waii?

492
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:16,590
Where is our president of the club?

493
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:18,470
He's spending time with his girlfriend

494
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,810
Fay's with him?

495
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:21,950
Yes

496
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,990
Overnight?

497
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:23,950
I think so.

498
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:26,630
If Fay's spending the night, don't go back to your room

499
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:27,740
You'll just get in the way.

500
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:28,630
Yeah?

501
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:31,010
Sure, stay here.

502
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:34,070
Don't be the 3rd, 4th, or 5th wheel.

503
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,370
That's long.

504
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:37,370
Right?

505
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:41,750
Guys,

506
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:47,740
today we finally got rid of that Wan girl,

507
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:54,710
thanks to Min.

508
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,160
We're running out of food.

509
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,900
I'll buy some more.

510
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:10,740
Excuse me

511
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,480
Who asked?

512
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:31,970
I know that you want to know.

513
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,160
You're full of yourself.

514
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,630
The female dorm is near.

515
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:37,070
Why's it taking so long for you to get there?

516
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:39,690
I'm hungry. I'm getting something to eat.

517
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:43,920
I know you're back on Facebook.

518
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,620
Yes. You've been lurking on Facebook, I see.

519
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,300
Not just lurking.

520
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,880
What are you doing?

521
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:56,180
See for yourself. Later.

522
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:27,780
"Nice to meet you."

523
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,190
Eat it.

524
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:31,250
I can't anymore. I'm full.

525
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:33,250
Don't spit it out. Eat.

526
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:34,590
Here's more food.

527
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:40,160
Where did Coach Mai go?

528
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,620
Did you see her?

529
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,520
No.

530
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:47,540
Go after her so you can spend some alone time with her

531
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:51,830
No, I don't want to step on anyone's toes.

532
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,860
You're thinking about it again.

533
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:51,770
No, I'm not.

534
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:56,200
You can lie to anyone else but not me.

535
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:06,180
Apart from being a bad dad,

536
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:10,360
I'm also a lousy coach

537
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:19,280
Will I let you know, too?

538
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:27,330
I love you for who you are.

539
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:32,060
Even if you're worse, I'd love you the same.

540
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,180
Or even more.

541
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:50,640
Will I drown?

542
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:53,300
You're with a swimming coach.

543
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,210
Are you Wan?

544
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,160
Yes.

545
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:21,090
"We will not get what we want, but what we deserve."
