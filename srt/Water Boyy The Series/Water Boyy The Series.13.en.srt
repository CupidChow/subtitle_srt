1
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,780
If you want to start fresh with me,

2
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,420
talk to me when you're sure about me.

3
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:23,680
Do you have feelings for him?

4
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,180
Tell me.

5
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,379
Do you? Do you?

6
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,879
I'll stop.

7
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:32,520
I'll stop whatever this is.

8
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,140
We can go back to the way we used to be.

9
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,120
Tell me

10
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,300
you're just cleaning up.

11
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,379
I've packed my bag.

12
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,539
You've packed it just to clean the room.

13
00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:27,180
I've put everything into my bag

14
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:34,259
because I'm moving out.

15
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:36,739
Get it now?

16
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,439
Why?

17
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,020
Apo...

18
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,960
I'll see you later.

19
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,740
Can you not leave?

20
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,519
For what?

21
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:29,599
For goodbye.

22
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,500
Aquamarine gemstone.

23
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,339
Keep it with you before every race.

24
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,860
It will bring you peace and calm.

25
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,879
I think that's what you need.

26
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,500
I'll see you.

27
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:21,099
Apo.

28
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,019
Can you not leave?

29
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,660
You've moved so far away from your old place.

30
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,839
I don't know where else to go.

31
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,519
What is the problem this time?

32
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:16,739
Actually,

33
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,699
I wasn't supposed to

34
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:19,339
move there in the first place.

35
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,420
You can come and live with us.

36
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,140
No problem.

37
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,520
Tell us if you need anything.

38
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,139
Just don't let Waii know that

39
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:32,339
I'm here.

40
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,139
I met a feisty chick.

41
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,560
A person who has

42
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,000
no sense of logic.

43
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,120
Stubborn and fierce.

44
00:06:53,019 --> 00:06:55,039
Fah was talking shit about me.

45
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:56,639
But

46
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,139
she seemed so real.

47
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,220
Today, she did it again.

48
00:07:00,899 --> 00:07:01,839
Strangely enough,

49
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,219
I couldn't get mad at her.

50
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,379
She'd always come up with weird ideas,

51
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,860
making me feel weird.

52
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,500
How weird is it that

53
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,360
I've fallen for this girl?

54
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,259
Maii

55
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:19,540
If you make a mess like this,

56
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,360
you'll have to clean it up yourself next time.

57
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,019
Want some water?

58
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:55,119
Get it yourself.

59
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,459
This is your home.

60
00:07:57,379 --> 00:07:58,480
Where is Kan?

61
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,060
Is he out?

62
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,220
Do you have a problem?

63
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,740
I just want to come here.

64
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,319
Why did you resign?

65
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,120
Do you not know the reason?

66
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:28,120
If you did it for me,

67
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:30,339
why hadn't you have left Kan instead?

68
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,799
Wow,

69
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,379
we really have to talk about this now, huh?

70
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:39,500
Yeah.

71
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,100
If I'd have chosen to let Kan go,

72
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,519
you wouldn't have had come home anyway.

73
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:47,559
Why do you think that?

74
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,639
Because it's not what you wanted.

75
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:54,659
I'd still

76
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:57,059
feel the same way about Kan.

77
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,560
These feelings just don't change.

78
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,960
Even though he...

79
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:04,339
What?

80
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:09,039
I'm leaving.

81
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:10,819
One day you'll find that

82
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:14,059
it's not possible

83
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,379
to run away from your feelings.

84
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,439
The feelings

85
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,200
may change

86
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,600
if you learn the truth.

87
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,500
P'Kan.

88
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:27,819
Oh, P'Waii?

89
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,820
Maii.

90
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:33,080
First

91
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:35,039
I thought it's P'Kan.

92
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,019
Don't clean it up.

93
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:44,279
I'll do it.

94
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,340
Lock the door for me.

95
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,820
P'Pan.

96
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,220
Namkhaeng.

97
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Fah.

98
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,460
Your hair is messy.

99
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,419
You just woke up, huh?

100
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:23,539
Why did you make such a mess?

101
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:25,039
No, I didn't.

102
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:29,079
When are you coming home?

103
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,080
I don't know.

104
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,940
P'Kan is gone.

105
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,840
Please come back home.

106
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:40,279
Kan is working.

107
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:43,559
He's not coming back,

108
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,779
I know.

109
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,740
How do you know?

110
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:49,799
From seeing dad like this.

111
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:51,279
I know then.

112
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,000
Like what?

113
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,279
You're still here.

114
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,600
You've known for a while

115
00:11:52,419 --> 00:11:54,219
that he's not coming back.

116
00:11:57,659 --> 00:11:59,179
From the first day.

117
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,300
We were going to meet tonight.

118
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,519
I'm busy in the evening going forward.

119
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:46,739
What about in the morning?

120
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,279
I'm busy all the time.

121
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,060
What's up with you?

122
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:52,620
I'm just your friend.

123
00:12:57,299 --> 00:12:58,079
Here.

124
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,699
I want to continue being friends with you,

125
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,200
so please...

126
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:11,579
Don't make things change between us.

127
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:32,960
If I'm serious

128
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,740
but I don't know if he's serious,

129
00:13:35,419 --> 00:13:37,620
what's the point?

130
00:13:38,299 --> 00:13:39,319
Take care of the people

131
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,500
you should take care of.

132
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,319
I'm taking care of my teammate right now.

133
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,290
The final thing

134
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,180
that you will have to

135
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,590
achieve is

136
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:11,930
to forget about everything.

137
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:14,000
You've practiced until

138
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,680
your body is ready.

139
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,480
All that is left is

140
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,090
to clear your mind.

141
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,540
Let go of

142
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,190
your worries.

143
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,520
The one thing that should be on your mind is

144
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,320
to get to the finish line.

145
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:45,190
56.26.

146
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,690
I'll practice harder.

147
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,310
That's good

148
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,920
if the problem lies with your practice.

149
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,580
Maybe I'm stressed out.

150
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,520
About what?

151
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,720
The competition.

152
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,290
Are you sure?

153
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,700
Worry about your problem.

154
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,560
Are you okay?

155
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,970
About what?

156
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:13,800
Well...

157
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,900
about the salary.

158
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,630
Will you be okay working

159
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,470
without salary?

160
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:20,700
Don't worry.

161
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,640
I have some other work as well.

162
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,610
Come on, Min.

163
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,270
Faster, Min

164
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,660
Walk faster.

165
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:45,540
Take it easy.

166
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,100
Faster.

167
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:47,110
Faster.
Faster.

168
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,040
Faster.

169
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,220
I'm not running.

170
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,100
I can't go faster.

171
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,360
Such a whiner.

172
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,560
Put it down.

173
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,190
Thank you.

174
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:58,910
Thanks, Wan.

175
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,850
No,

176
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,030
thank me.

177
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,090
I brought this from the 8th floor.

178
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,310
It's exhausting.

179
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,750
If it hadn't been for her,

180
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,210
you wouldn't have had helped us.

181
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,220
It's a shame.

182
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,850
Wan,

183
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,660
I may have left the room on the 8th floor unlocked.

184
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:19,260
Let me go and check it.

185
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,220
Umm.

186
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:24,810
Ked,

187
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:26,330
what were you talking about?

188
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:28,130
Min.

189
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:30,970
It's a shame that Wan got to him before me.

190
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,600
Tell me

191
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:36,970
how you got a player like Min

192
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,090
wrapped around your finger.

193
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,030
Non-sense.

194
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,250
Let's get to work.

195
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:43,850
Or is it you

196
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,870
who fell for a player?

197
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,940
You lost, huh?

198
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,100
Nobody wraps anyone around a finger

199
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,820
or falls for anyone.

200
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,630
There's nothing serious,

201
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,530
got it?

202
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,090
Okay.

203
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,100
I'm going to the toilet.

204
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,870
Why did you say that?

205
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:11,110
You know that

206
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,100
Ked has her eyes on Min.

207
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,530
You basically gave her your blessings.

208
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,440
She can do whatever she wants.

209
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,000
Do you really think you and Min are exclusive?

210
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:24,980
If I'm serious

211
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,560
but I don't know if he's serious,

212
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,370
what's the point?

213
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,870
I'm tired of

214
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,430
you beautiful people –

215
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,010
all the drama.

216
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,540
I told you

217
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,910
Wan isn't an exclusive relationship kind of girl.

218
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,420
Don't need to remind me.

219
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,990
That's not cute.

220
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,500
I just did you a favor and

221
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,060
asked her the question.

222
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,410
Thanks.

223
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,740
What are you going to do next?

224
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,940
You said you'd go home early.

225
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,920
I thought you'd be home by now.

226
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:28,770
Who are you waiting for?

227
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,120
Fah?

228
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,980
Why him?

229
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,880
Well,

230
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:36,660
you've been close lately.

231
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,030
I'm waiting for Namkhaeng,

232
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,150
my girlfriend,

233
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:39,810
you know.

234
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,600
I know she's yours since you first said it.

235
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:44,160
I don't know.

236
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,910
She's been saying that

237
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:48,180
we're not acting like a couple.

238
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:52,030
She's been sulky a lot lately.

239
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,010
She's kept me waiting for hours.

240
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:54,510
I don't know

241
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,450
if she's mad at me about something.

242
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,210
Talk to Fah.

243
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,600
Fah again!

244
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:08,200
You usually talk to him when you need advice.

245
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,500
What's wrong with you?

246
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:10,830
You've changed.

247
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,310
It's not you!

248
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:13,890
Me?

249
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:14,390
Changed?

250
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:14,890
Yeah.

251
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,270
he's changed.

252
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:26,110
I think

253
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,420
we should head back.

254
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,980
Someone is

255
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,180
hormonal.

256
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,830
P'Pan.

257
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,660
Namkhaeng.

258
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,060
What are you doing here?

259
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,850
Are you messing with me

260
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:03,850
or being serious?

261
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,300
What are you talking about?

262
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,040
We're supposed to hang out.

263
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,520
I told you that

264
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:10,890
I may have a class party.

265
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,030
"May".

266
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,420
Why didn't you call?

267
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:14,830
My phone died.

268
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,770
Why didn't you borrow your friend?

269
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:18,480
You should've thought about that.

270
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:19,850
Don't be a jerk.

271
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,510
A jerk?

272
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,400
You said

273
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:24,510
you wanted a girlfriend

274
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,430
who cares about you.

275
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,720
That's what I'm doing.

276
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:28,980
If you do it because I told you to,

277
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,660
don't.

278
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,240
What the hell?

279
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:45,190
"Where is true love?

280
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,380
In someone's pants

281
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,280
And peek at the stick?"

282
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,970
Are you sure it's a stick?

283
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,540
You can look at it yourself.

284
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,480
I didn't get the name "banana"

285
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,000
from a lucky draw.

286
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:59,590
Where did you get it from?

287
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,920
Me, myself and I.

288
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:04,130
For real?

289
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,220
Got me wonder.

290
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,060
Are you all talk?

291
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,570
A little.

292
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:16,800
Kluay,

293
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,480
Yes

294
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,680
help me clean up.

295
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,180
Sure.

296
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,960
Hey, Waii.

297
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,890
You're not practicing?

298
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,390
Come on.

299
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:27,850
Stop.

300
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:32,720
I told you to stop.

301
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,270
Kluay.

302
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,100
Go and clean up the bathroom.

303
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:39,860
I did.

304
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,560
Locker room.

305
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:41,290
I did.

306
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,120
Pool lanes.

307
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:42,880
I did.

308
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:43,920
Coach Tee's office.

309
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,660
I did.

310
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:54,660
Go.

311
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,480
Oh..

312
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,950
I forgot

313
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,380
to polish the trophies in Coach's office.

314
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,990
Let me do it.

315
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,360
See you.

316
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,120
Apo.

317
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:16,360
Are you disobeying the Captain's order?

318
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:18,950
You want to play this card again?

319
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,330
Take care of the people

320
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:21,350
you should take care of.

321
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,220
I'm taking care of my teammate right now.

322
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,360
This is not taking care of.

323
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:32,720
How?

324
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:35,490
I'm trying to take care of everything,

325
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,760
Including your feelings.

326
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:45,690
See you at your dorm.

327
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:47,690
I have a surprise.

328
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:56,350
You can't take care of everyone's feelings.

329
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:58,310
Spend your time taking care of

330
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,600
someone you should.

331
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,310
I will stay

332
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:24,330
for as long as you want me to.

333
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,520
What if I want you to stay forever?

334
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,880
I will stay with you forever.

335
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:33,830
forever..

336
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,410
I get now

337
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,360
how you must have felt

338
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,710
when Kan betrayed you.

339
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,720
It hurts like this.

340
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:48,850
Fay!

341
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:50,690
Let me go!

342
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:24,370
Fay,

343
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:26,690
you're still awake.

344
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,720
I told you I'd wait to see you.

345
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:41,590
I'm sorry

346
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:42,720
I was...

347
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,740
It wasn't

348
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:46,790
that you're trying to avoid me, right?

349
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,810
That's crazy.

350
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:09,810
Let's eat.

351
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:11,050
The food is cold.

352
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,020
I cooked it early evening.

353
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:38,380
I'm sorry, Fay.

354
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,820
I just...

355
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:46,210
I believed in what you said.

356
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:48,890
That you won't betray me.

357
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,640
Yes,

358
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,380
I won't do that.

359
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:06,100
Then nothing else matters.

360
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,150
I have you with me right here, right now.

361
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,550
I'm good.

362
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,900
Let's eat.

363
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,350
This is your favorite.

364
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,620
You had to go this far?

365
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,380
Don't think about anyone else,

366
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,520
just us.

367
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:41,220
There's no us anymore.

368
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,710
Let's stop it right here.

369
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,480
Kluay,

370
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,120
when you fought with Achi,

371
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:06,460
how did you make it up to him?

372
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,730
I did it in front of everyone.

373
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:12,650
You can watch it.

374
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:15,140
How did you get him to not mad at you anymore?

375
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,410
How would I know?

376
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,560
Ask him.

377
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,200
Why did you

378
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,300
ask me these questions all of the sudden?

379
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,740
When I started doing

380
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,460
something nice for Namkhaeng,

381
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:27,090
why did everything get worse?

382
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:31,700
I don't have the answer.

383
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:34,290
Hey, Kluay!

384
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,840
Can you give any advice?

385
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,960
It's not like you'd normally

386
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:39,270
come to me for advice.

387
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:41,300
When you bombarded me with your questions,

388
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,830
I don't know what to say.

389
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:46,060
If I'd had someone else,

390
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,770
I wouldn't have come to you.

391
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,550
Who do you normally go to?

392
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:56,340
That's my cue to leave.

393
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,410
Hey,

394
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:21,770
Khun Wan.

395
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,700
Do you miss me?

396
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,230
Miss you?

397
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:29,140
You checked in on Facebook

398
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,780
for bait, didn't you?

399
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:33,110
If I hadn't baited you,

400
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:36,080
would you have come?

401
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:36,960
Drama.

402
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:42,230
Or you may worry about your rating.

403
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,640
If someone passes by

404
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,360
and sees us together...

405
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:47,050
Right?

406
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,270
If you keep going like this,

407
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,450
I'm leaving.

408
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,190
Wan,

409
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,190
wait.

410
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,460
Wan,

411
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:56,850
wait.

412
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:07,530
I'll be back.

413
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,360
Wan,

414
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,640
I'm sorry.

415
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,010
My mouth just babbles.

416
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:19,960
That's your problem.

417
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:21,050
I just want

418
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:22,960
you to know me better.

419
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,620
You said you wanted to.

420
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,940
I know about your babbling mouth.

421
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,350
How about something else?

422
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,770
How about this?

423
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:35,020
I'll take you somewhere

424
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:37,050
you've never been before.

425
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:39,020
I've never taken anyone there.

426
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,020
Where?

427
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:43,850
Let me share a location with you tonight.

428
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:44,950
Is that a good idea?

429
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,960
I won't do anything bad.

430
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:50,190
I mean

431
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,400
is it a good idea

432
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,800
to take me to your personal space?

433
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:55,020
Yes,

434
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:55,780
no problem.

435
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,420
Don't be late.

436
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,860
I'll share the location.

437
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,730
I have something important to talk to you.

438
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:13,110
Can you meet me?

439
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:14,830
P'Pan.

440
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:18,120
You know how to write a good letter.

441
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:27,670
Why are you reading it?

442
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:28,980
You wrote it.

443
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:31,230
Are you not mad at me?

444
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:32,830
Yeah,

445
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:35,800
when I read the part about when we first met,

446
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:37,080
I gave in.

447
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:43,050
"I'm a stiff person

448
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,140
but when I met you,

449
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:49,130
I wanted to be better."

450
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:42,330
Waii,

451
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,270
how are you?

452
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,250
Are you tired?

453
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:47,730
I'm here to walk you home.

454
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,370
No need to.

455
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:51,390
Why?

456
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:53,580
I used to come here all the time.

457
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:55,080
I just haven't been lately.

458
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:57,390
Looks like I should go back to that old habit.

459
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:59,430
So you won't be lonely anymore.

460
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:02,290
I'm not lonely.

461
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,830
It's good that you come here.

462
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,960
It's a good thing.

463
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:10,870
I'll going to grab my stuff.

464
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:11,810
I'll be back.

465
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:18,830
What should we eat?

466
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:19,990
I'm getting hungry

467
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:21,770
Anything.

468
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:24,640
How about hamburgers?

469
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:45,080
Are you sleeping at my place?

470
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,080
Don't you go back?

471
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,340
How can I leave?

472
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:04,550
Since we still haven't get to talk.

473
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,200
How's about Fay?

474
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,020
Don't care others.

475
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,800
Just care about us.

476
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,220
Yes,

477
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,400
Captain!

478
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:15,870
What are you trying to do?

479
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,700
What do you want to talk to me, captain?

480
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:21,450
Do you think

481
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,480
I will give up if you do like this?

482
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,340
It should be me who surrender.

483
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,580
If there is nothing between us,

484
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,640
we should stop now.

485
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,900
You said no one would be here.

486
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:43,750
Wan, don't tell anyone.

487
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,050
I'm begging you.

488
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,330
Why are you doing this?

489
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:58,810
You said you wanted to get to know me better.

490
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:02,640
You had to go this far?

491
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,770
As far as when you told others

492
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,660
that you're not taking me seriously.

493
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,200
How can I take you seriously?

494
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:12,610
I don't know what kind of person you are.

495
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:14,890
That's what kind of person I am.

496
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:17,820
That?

497
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:19,080
A player.

498
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,770
A swimmer

499
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:22,850
popular among girls.

500
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:24,610
Seriously,

501
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,640
who are you?

502
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,820
So what?

503
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,460
Whatever.

504
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:58,220
Everyone makes a stupid mistake.

505
00:35:58,750 --> 00:35:59,350
But

506
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:00,900
if you're dragged down by it,

507
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,490
that's when real stupidity begins.

508
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,020
Why are you here?

509
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,320
You're in a good shape.

510
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,600
Your time should be better.

511
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,970
If it's not your body,

512
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:56,610
then it's about your...

513
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,870
How about you focus on your problem?

514
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,550
You have your way of taking care of it,

515
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:06,190
I have mine.

516
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,560
I don't know

517
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:13,690
if I'm doing the right thing.

518
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:18,260
You're a smart boy.

519
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:20,610
Now you're praising your kid.

520
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,020
But you can be very stupid sometimes.

521
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:25,750
Hey!

522
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,190
It's normal.

523
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:34,050
Everyone makes a stupid mistake.

524
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:35,390
But

525
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:37,480
if you're dragged down by it,

526
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,830
that's when real stupidity begins.

527
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:57,090
Why is the person you want to be with

528
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:59,390
is not the person you should be with?

529
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:01,370
Who says

530
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:04,670
which one you should or shouldn't be with?

531
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:07,230
I forgot

532
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,860
I'm talking to someone

533
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,880
who does whatever he wants.

534
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,600
Just be honest with your feelings.

535
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:34,850
That's what you should do.

536
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:15,390
The record in the men's 50-meter freestyle

537
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,210
was made by

538
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:20,030
Napat Wetchasat

539
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,790
at 24.03 seconds.

540
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:44,450
Do you remember

541
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:45,330
you used to play with my medals

542
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:46,890
all the time when you're young?

543
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,380
Of course, I do.

544
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,780
I got yelled at every time.

545
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,320
I don't get why you're so possessive.

546
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,840
The medals are from small competitions.

547
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,170
That's right.

548
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:08,730
They're from small competitions.

549
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:10,410
But

550
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:12,410
they are proofs that I made it.

551
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:16,660
Like

552
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,680
your race today.

553
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:23,690
This is the opportunity to prove your worth.

554
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:31,450
We have some time left.

555
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:34,040
Go and stretch.

556
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:36,690
I'll get someone to help you.

557
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,070
No need.

558
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,100
Please, Apo.

559
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,820
Yes, Coach.

560
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,250
If you don't want to,

561
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:13,050
don't.

562
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,960
Coach ordered.

563
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:22,250
That's fine. I'm fine.

564
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:26,070
Did you bring the gemstone?

565
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:36,660
I keep it with me all the time.

566
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:48,490
Hold on tight

567
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,100
and make a wish for the race.

568
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:12,510
Can I wish for other things?

569
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:23,460
Go and get yourself ready.

570
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:30,400
If I win,

571
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,660
can I ask you one thing?

572
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:36,800
What?

573
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:40,940
It won't be too much.

574
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:46,900
Sure,

575
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:50,330
if you win first place.

576
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,120
