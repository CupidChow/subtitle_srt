1
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,120
It is time for some good fun! Yeah!

2
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:33,519
Come on, guys.

3
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:36,000
Have a seat.

4
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,879
Come on and sit down.

5
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,219
Please sit down, everyone

6
00:02:58,259 --> 00:02:59,579
Hurry up and sit down please.

7
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,240
What are they doing here?

8
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,439
Playing bingo, you think?

9
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:06,319
That'd be great. I have a feeling that I'm getting lucky.

10
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,460
Everybody, get ready.

11
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,120
They're here to see us.

12
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,780
That's my fan club right there

13
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,879
Are you sure that's your fan club?

14
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:18,560
You'll see

15
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,319
Can I hear some voice from my fans out there?

16
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,700
How's that for a fan club?

17
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:48,199
Am I here too late? Has the match already started?

18
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,359
Come and have a seat.

19
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,560
You will get paid later.

20
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,020
Paid for what?

21
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:59,299
Has the match started?

22
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:00,479
Not yet

23
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:02,419
Yeah? Good.

24
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,840
I'm going.

25
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,240
Let's continue with our practice

26
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,860
P'Waii, P'Waii, P'Waii.

27
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,140
P'Waii!

28
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,460
P'Waii!

29
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,960
P'Waii!

30
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,459
Move over!

31
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,339
Am I too late?

32
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,000
That means I'm not too late

33
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,960
Wait, what are you doing?

34
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,819
I'm changing.

35
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:27,259
Here?

36
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,060
What are you doing, Pan?

37
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,220
WTF?

38
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,720
Why did you stop?

39
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,240
Are you here to see the match?

40
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,900
You'll get paid afterwards, okay?

41
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:05,839
For what?

42
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:07,480
For cheering.

43
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,560
Scream at the top of your lungs when P'Waii comes out.

44
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,639
Get paid afterwards...

45
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:22,639
This is a men's match. What are you doing here?

46
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:29,560
Sung, tell me how many girls there are in this club.

47
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,919
None.

48
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,660
Ain't that funny.

49
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:36,719
You're a girl, really?

50
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,160
If I don't compete with boys, then who?

51
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,600
But hey, before you compete with us

52
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,960
don't you think you should change in the bathroom?

53
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:50,900
It'd be too late and the coach wouldn't let me compete

54
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,639
I won't let you even if you're on time.

55
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,180
But Coach...

56
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:00,360
Go sit over there.

57
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,579
The cheering squad is there. Please join them

58
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,480
Kluay, afraid of a little competition, huh?

59
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:11,379
Coach, let her compete. She will lose anyway.

60
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,759
That will shut her up.

61
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,899
Fine.

62
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:20,080
I'll only time you but no rewards, got it?

63
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:24,019
Thank you, Coach.

64
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:26,439
Go get ready.

65
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:33,259
P'Waii!

66
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,600
Damn!

67
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,939
That's so cool.

68
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,339
He stole the show.

69
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:12,939
He had the guts.

70
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,620
The fan club is going wild.

71
00:07:31,579 --> 00:07:34,279
Waii, you got to do that, huh?

72
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:36,679
Please leave some space for others to shine as well.

73
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,540
That was just a warm-up.

74
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,420
Every damn time.

75
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:44,460
Waii, this is the time to compete, not to show off.

76
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:47,579
You actually know right from wrong?

77
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,620
Waii!

78
00:07:54,259 --> 00:07:56,000
Everyone, go to your marks.

79
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,459
I can't wait to see someone lose.

80
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:13,979
Losers buy dinner, okay?

81
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,140
You'll find out soon enough.

82
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,300
Don't let her size fool you.

83
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:54,339
Take your marks!

84
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:04,419
Let me officially introduce him.

85
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:05,439
This is Apo

86
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,940
Who's this guy?

87
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,140
Are you replacing me?

88
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,280
Based on today's result, someone is more ready than you.

89
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,660
Pan.

90
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,770
57.1.

91
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:40,660
Kluay

92
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,870
56.37.

93
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,250
Put and Sung,

94
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,900
57.48.

95
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:55,950
Waii and Apo,

96
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,430
54.61.

97
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,650
Winner again. Are you sure you're not cheating?

98
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:14,410
Let me officially introduce him.

99
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,400
This is Apo, our club's new member

100
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,140
Please give any assistance he needs, especially from you, Waii.

101
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,260
Apo, take a rest at Waii's room.

102
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,080
Okay.

103
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,080
Show him the room afterwards.

104
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,520
I'm Kluay.

105
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:37,860
Pan.

106
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,450
Call her Tom. She won't mind.

107
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:40,980
Put and Sung.

108
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,410
This is Waii.

109
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,120
Let's have a talk.

110
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,130
What the hell?

111
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:02,030
You should have told me first.

112
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:04,920
The room is too big for you alone.

113
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:08,810
Who's this guy? Are you replacing me?

114
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,760
Don't be crazy. Focus on what you have to do.

115
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,820
As a captain, you must take care of your teammates,

116
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,320
and deliver good results.

117
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:25,510
In the past year, you didn't win any medal in an external race for the team

118
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,640
This will be a big issue, I'm warning you, son.

119
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,280
I'm not ready.

120
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,800
Based on today's result, someone is more ready than you

121
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:52,150
Pan, don't you have a class today after this?

122
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,540
That's right.

123
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,740
Will you make it?

124
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,600
Shit!

125
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,380
Is it full?

126
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:24,630
I'm on my way. Can you sign up for me?

127
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,450
Namwan...

128
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:45,990
We just broke up yesterday, and you found someone new.

129
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,880
Isn't it a little too soon?

130
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,660
Not that soon. It's been hours.

131
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,280
And you had to be with this douchebag?

132
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,640
You said you're not into men.

133
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:03,430
Is he tricking you? He must be. Come on

134
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,540
Are you crazy? What kind of girl doesn't like guys?

135
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,220
Guys are better than lesbians anyway.

136
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,240
Better? Look at yourself.

137
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,960
I look good

138
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,260
Good for nothing,

139
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,810
jerkface!

140
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:15,930
What did you say?

141
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,630
Stop! Don't fight over me.

142
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,200
I'm not fighting over you.

143
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,760
This is because I hate his guts.

144
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,320
This is not about you.

145
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,510
Shit! I'm late!

146
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:34,930
I have to go. Hope your love lasts forever

147
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,080
There are a lot of cuter girls out there.

148
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,100
I couldn't care less about you.

149
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,580
You said you'd be here sooner.

150
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,840
What took you so long?

151
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,140
There are only a few spots left.

152
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:01,510
I just saw Namwan and her new boyfriend.

153
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,990
So, I stopped and gave them a piece of my mind.

154
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,810
You met them? I was going to gossip about them.

155
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,360
About what?

156
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,930
If you can't sign up to this section,

157
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:17,230
you'll end up being in the same section as those two.

158
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,660
Guys are better than lesbians anyway.

159
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:25,070
They're also taking this class?

160
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:28,580
Damn right. Stop talking and sign up.

161
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:36,260
It's right there, and there are still so many people.

162
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,290
Can't I catch a little break?

163
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,780
Look, while you're chatting away,

164
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,680
you may miss a chance to sign up.

165
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,010
Wait!

166
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,760
You signed up in my spot.

167
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,260
Nate Hongshan

168
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,200
I don't see your name anywhere.

169
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,810
Here's the thing.

170
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:10,520
I got here a while ago. I just hadn't signed up.

171
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,840
And?

172
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,810
Wait!

173
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:15,630
What now?

174
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,600
You're no longer in this section, got it?

175
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:29,020
For this class, you need to sign up by yourself.

176
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,630
I followed all the procedures required

177
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:34,310
You can't just take what you want.

178
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,670
Here's another thing.

179
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:38,070
The other two sections aren't full yet.

180
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,510
Go and sign up in one of them.

181
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,990
This is not a request.

182
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:51,230
Remove. Your. Name.

183
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:07,870
Sure.

184
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,870
Give me a whiteout.

185
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:12,820
Do you have it?

186
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,460
Yes, hold on a sec

187
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:17,190
Jib, give me a whiteout

188
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,190
Shit! Where did he go?

189
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,320
Calm down.

190
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,350
There's always Section 2.

191
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,100
This is the nerd I told you about.

192
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:46,650
If Fah wants to stay at the dorm, he can stay in my room.

193
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,870
You should look after the kid whom Coach asked you.

194
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,100
Do you know that guy?

195
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,580
He's a friend from my old school, but we're not that close.

196
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,300
You're quite good.

197
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,720
Thank you.

198
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,260
The match is over.

199
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,480
All non-athletes must exit the premises.

200
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:35,120
The swimming pool is reserved for swimmers only.

201
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:36,750
The university gave you a big budget

202
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,980
but you didn't win anything for the team for over a year.

203
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:43,120
There have been only small races within the university.

204
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,590
Isn't this club great?

205
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,910
What are you talking about?

206
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,370
Oh, I know

207
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,590
If you enter an external competition and lose,

208
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,550
you're afraid your budget will be cut, right?

209
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,180
Stop talking when you don't know what you're talking about.

210
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:58,120
Oh, I know. I know a lot about you.

211
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,220
Is this how a groupie gets attention now?

212
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:07,820
If you think that only an admirer pays attention to the swimming club

213
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,130
think again.

214
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:19,300
Wait here. I'll pick you up in the evening

215
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:33,870
P'Sung, you're so cute. These are for you.

216
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,020
Thank you.

217
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,490
Can I take a selfie with you?

218
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,510
Sure.

219
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,930
Wait, you want a photo with Sung only?

220
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,030
What about Put?

221
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,380
And Kluay.

222
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,760
Fine by me

223
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:47,540
Thank you.

224
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,290
Thanks.

225
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,550
I'm going to the stadium now.

226
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,490
Where are you going?

227
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,730
There's a hot guy there. I need to go.

228
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,660
The gifts...

229
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,770
Come with me to the stadium. P'Min is so hot.

230
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,960
I'm not going. Ask Apple.

231
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:02,150
Hey, sister. What's up?

232
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:31,010
P'Min!

233
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,620
Don't mess up my hair. I just styled it.

234
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,410
What's up with you, making us follow this groupie?

235
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,660
I want to know who is stealing my groupie.

236
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:57,440
According to this theory, for someone to steal something from you,

237
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,070
you need to have that something first.

238
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,570
Where did you hear that from?

239
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,820
What kind of theory is this?

240
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,860
Galileo said it.

241
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,960
Go to school and study harder

242
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,130
It's so hot out there

243
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,570
Min.

244
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,570
Do you know that guy?

245
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:16,510
He's a friend from my old school, but we're not that close.

246
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:21,450
He used to be a school athlete.

247
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:24,290
In the university, he's the captain of the running team.

248
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:27,390
Everybody likes him, especially the girls.

249
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,000
But he's not as good as everyone thinks he is.

250
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:32,950
How?

251
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,480
According to this theory...

252
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,070
Enough with the theory. Just say it.

253
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:42,110
You said you're not close, but you know so much about him.

254
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:45,150
That's true. Do you know our grandpas' names?

255
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,100
I do.

256
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:48,350
What's my grandpa's name?

257
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:49,980
Barbapapa!

258
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:52,790
That's not it.

259
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:59,600
Min, first place again. Aren't you getting bored?

260
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,410
That's a little over the top.

261
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:11,980
But today your speed dropped a little.

262
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,990
Did you go soft on me?

263
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,230
Min, what's wrong?

264
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,790
Come on. Got lazy, huh?

265
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,480
Your belly shows.

266
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,480
Engage your core.

267
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,640
Come on.

268
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:09,490
Bummer!

269
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,400
Hit me.

270
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,200
Quicker.

271
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,580
Aren't you going to ask what's wrong with your dear friend?

272
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,350
Do we really have to ask?

273
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:20,430
You will tell us anyway.

274
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,440
I couldn't get a spot in Section A

275
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,620
So? Sign up in Section B.

276
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:32,670
I had to register in Section B where I will find my ex and her new boyfriend

277
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,000
What a major bummer!

278
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:39,220
It's because of that nerd that stole my place.

279
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:43,480
If I see him again, I will...

280
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:49,110
move away

281
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,010
It's this guy.

282
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:53,980
You know each other?

283
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,090
This is the nerd I told you about.

284
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,290
What nerd?

285
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:00,410
You didn't listen to a word I said.

286
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:02,410
You're such shitty friends.

287
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:05,290
What's up with you? This is my friend, Fah.

288
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:07,040
He's a new member of our club.

289
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:10,190
A new member?

290
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,260
Waii, do you know anything about this?

291
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,520
Another new guy?

292
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,840
Why are there so many new guys here?

293
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,750
There's one this morning.

294
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:25,070
Then, there's this nerd here.

295
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,350
When was the audition?

296
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,630
This guy doesn't need an audition.

297
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,980
He's not a swimmer.

298
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:35,210
He's our academic consultant.

299
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,730
Academic consultant.

300
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:39,100
What does that mean?

301
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,630
Like this.

302
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:54,230
Look at the new guy. He keeps going and going.

303
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,900
Another new guy is also the same.

304
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,840
Who?

305
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,780
Does he have a room? He can stay at mine.

306
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:10,520
He lives nearby. And your room is full.

307
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:16,230
It's my room. I choose who to stay and not to stay.

308
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:20,980
If Fah wants to stay at the dorm, he can stay in my room.

309
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,760
I'm the captain. I look after my teammates.

310
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:27,780
No need. He can take care of himself.

311
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,960
You should look after the kid whom Coach asked you.

312
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:34,690
Who took him in should be looking after him.

313
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,840
Where are you going?

314
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:42,160
Jump! Jump!

315
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,980
Look at him go!

316
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:54,220
This is a good picture.

317
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,700
Fah,

318
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,790
you will make it this time

319
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,000
Let's be friends.

320
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:16,390
I told you to leave me alone.

321
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:22,430
If I finish your homework, you have to stop being mad at me.

322
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:50,570
These are our numbers. Call us if you need anything.

323
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:52,810
There's one number you can't call; 911.

324
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,040
Why?

325
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,360
Because it's always busy!

326
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,620
Go back to your room!

327
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:03,700
Enter with your right foot; otherwise, it's a bad omen.

328
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,480
What are you waiting for? Get in!

329
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,770
It's spacious. Where can I put my stuff?

330
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:31,780
Do whatever you want. Stop asking too many questions.

331
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:34,000
Did Coach tell you to follow me?

332
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:37,770
Yes. He told me to shadow you.

333
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:43,360
If Coach told you to die, would you obey?

334
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,280
He did warn me about this.

335
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,540
About what?

336
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,660
Nothing.

337
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,470
Your space is over there.

338
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,430
Here is mine. Stay away.

339
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:00,730
Where am I going to sleep?

340
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,160
Not my problem.

341
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,140
Waii, can I get some hot water?

342
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,570
No answer means yes.

343
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,280
It's still hot.

344
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,180
Do you want some?

345
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,530
Your stomach growls. You must be hungry.

346
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,030
Have some. Come on. Have some.

347
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:05,830
Come on.

348
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,340
Take it.

349
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:12,300
I told you to leave me alone!

350
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,660
Did you get it on you?

351
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:49,160
What are you looking at? Want some?

352
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:55,250
It's late. All the germs have gone to bed.

353
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:57,790
Stop playing.

354
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,940
I'm going to get a towel.

355
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:08,300
Stop. I'll take care of it.

356
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,560
This is not enough. I need more evidence.

357
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,680
The layout!

358
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:03,130
Where is it?

359
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:23,170
Keep your voice down

360
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,450
Who are you? How can...

361
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,180
Keep your voice down.

362
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,680
No need to scream, okay?

363
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,090
Take the cake.

364
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,920
Come on, George.

365
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,890
Light the candles already!

366
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,650
What are you doing?

367
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,230
Can't you tell?

368
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:52,420
We're here to give Aom a birthday surprise.

369
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,690
Keep the door opened.

370
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,200
They're lit. Let's go.

371
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:13,550
Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you.

372
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:16,570
Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday.

373
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:23,980
Happy Birthday to you.

374
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:31,120
Happy Birthday, Aom.

375
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:34,850
Wish you happiness and long-lasting love.

376
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:41,900
Wan, you're in it, too? Thanks so much!

377
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,540
Do you think Min is cute?

378
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,390
Just so-so.

379
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,950
I saw him look at you.

380
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:20,830
I thought you forgot about my birthday

381
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,170
after you threw a fit at me about playing with the doll.

382
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:25,420
In fact, you were pretending to give me a surprise.

383
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,900
Thank you so much.

384
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:31,850
How's my girlfriend's roommate?

385
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,860
Wan from the Faculty of Political Science.

386
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:40,390
They say she's very feisty, especially with boys.

387
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,410
Be careful around her.

388
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:46,250
Or should I warn her to be careful around you?

389
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:47,830
You Jerk!

390
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:52,390
How feisty can she be?

391
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:57,130
Guys, I have something good in the fridge.

392
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:00,180
Something good in the fridge...

393
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,770
Happy Birthday, Aom.

394
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,010
Thank you!

395
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,440
Wish you a lot of happiness.

396
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:07,940
Our baby.

397
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:10,410
What kind of girl has a teddy bear for a baby?

398
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:20,980
At this rate, please continue what you're doing on the bed.

399
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:25,800
Hey, are you serious?

400
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:27,570
I've got to hand it to him.

401
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:35,330
Oh my George.

402
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:40,450
Where are you going?

403
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,310
Wan!

404
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:46,420
What are they doing in there?

405
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,780
I heard some shout.

406
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,620
What hurts?

407
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,890
Guys, wake up!

408
00:34:57,890 --> 00:34:59,720
You had to sleepwalk this far?

409
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,960
Go back to the room!

410
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:03,510
Wake up! Wake up!

411
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:06,250
Do you have medicines?

412
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:08,000
What medicines?

413
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:13,690
Did you get rough?

414
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,130
What are you talking about?

415
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:18,120
Do you have medicines or not?

416
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,410
I'll find some for you.

417
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:24,070
Will you go now?

418
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,430
Don't be so rough next time

419
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,790
So rough that medicines are needed.

420
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,580
What medicines?

421
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,060
Here.

422
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:25,250
It's the medicine for your burn.

423
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:34,100
Thank you.

424
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,820
Can you eat spicy food?

425
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,340
Yeah.

426
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:49,890
Eggs?

427
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:51,380
What?

428
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,340
Do you eat eggs?

429
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,840
Sure.

430
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,720
Here.

431
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,740
And don't ask me to eat something again.

432
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:20,150
I'm going to bed.

433
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:06,380
How's the homework coming along?

434
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,900
Almost done

435
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,160
No need to hurry but it will be finished on time, right?

436
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,450
Sure thing. In just a bit.

437
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:16,710
Why did you lie?

438
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:20,310
I'm almost done.

439
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:21,550
But mine isn't finished.

440
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:24,570
I need it done tonight because I have to hand it in tomorrow.

441
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:27,020
You gave it to me just now. No way I can finish it.

442
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,760
You haven't even started.

443
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,160
You're not going to do it?

444
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,100
Don't you want to be in the club anymore?

445
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,570
I'll tell them.

446
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:34,540
Hey, guys!

447
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,780
Wait!

448
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,120
I'll do it.

449
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,740
Was that so hard? Just do it.

450
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,420
This must be about the sign-up thing.

451
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:48,290
What? What did you say?

452
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:49,690
Nothing.

453
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:53,300
You, Namwan and her new boyfriend are the reason

454
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,260
I couldn't sign up for that section.

455
00:38:55,260 --> 00:39:00,960
If I finish your homework, you have to stop being mad at me

456
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:07,310
No. If you finish it, you'll get to stay in the club

457
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:10,490
If not, then "bye".

458
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,660
Guys, it's my turn next time someone loses.

459
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:37,880
Keep going!

460
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:44,050
I'm sorry for yelling.

461
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:46,020
Are you still awake?

462
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:49,230
I'm going to bed soon.

463
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,880
Go to bed. Everything is fine.

464
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,840
Good night.

465
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:22,380
Many of us want to overcome many things.
Then again, many of us give in to something called 'love'.
