1
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,799
I'm moving out.

2
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:17,919
You've known for a while that

3
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,639
he's not coming back.

4
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,800
Seriously, who are you?

5
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,759
Men's 4x100m freestyle relay

6
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,800
Where is Min?

7
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,360
Why isn't he here yet?

8
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,560
When I woke up this morning,

9
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,599
he wasn't there.

10
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:44,960
The number you're trying to reach is not available.

11
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,680
Is there Saifah Tanchanarak here?

12
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,039
That's me.

13
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,440
Please proceed to the referees' table.

14
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,280
What for?

15
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,759
Coach Tee has signed you up

16
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:02,079
for the final race.

17
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,800
Coach,

18
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,719
I can't compete.

19
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:14,479
You know

20
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:15,840
I don't swim.

21
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:17,400
That's not what it says

22
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,719
in your application.

23
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,199
You represented your school

24
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:25,400
in many competitions.

25
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,120
You've seen that.

26
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,199
Even if you pulled it out  from the file,

27
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,319
it didn't stop me from reading it.

28
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,560
But...

29
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,919
I haven't swum for a long time.

30
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:40,879
You swam this morning.

31
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,439
It hasn't been that long.

32
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,000
Coach!

33
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,080
You've been practicing

34
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,520
alone every morning.

35
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,000
Why practice if you're not going to compete?

36
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,599
But I won't finish first.

37
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,159
So?

38
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:58,719
A medal is important.

39
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,960
Do your best then.

40
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:43,239
Guys,

41
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,879
I'm sorry.

42
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,199
Don't be sorry.

43
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:54,279
You're the man.

44
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:57,519
Yes,

45
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,160
my boy scored a second-place finish.

46
00:05:59,160 --> 00:05:59,840
How cool is that?

47
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,680
I didn't know you're such a good swimmer.

48
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,359
You're a thunder,

49
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,280
just like your name – Saifah.

50
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,719
Mr. Saifah,

51
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,520
please proceed to the referee's table.

52
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,880
How many medals did we decide on?

53
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,759
Five.

54
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,759
Sorry to say this

55
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:32,079
but we're going to have to dissolve the club.

56
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:34,120
I got a medal!

57
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,839
But the result...

58
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,600
I finished second

59
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,920
but the first finisher

60
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,360
was disqualified for doping.

61
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,600
So I became the first-place finisher.

62
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,600
I'm proud of you.

63
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:27,319
Not because you won first place

64
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:29,719
but because

65
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:32,319
you're the real team captain now.

66
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,120
Hey, Min

67
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:56,800
Sawasdee krap, Coach Tee.

68
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,079
You're a few days late.

69
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:00,959
I'm sorry.

70
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,800
Let's talk in my office.

71
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,639
That's okay.

72
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:08,800
I just want to tell you that

73
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,519
I'm not coming back to this club.

74
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,320
Hey, Fah.

75
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,480
Thanks for the letter.

76
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,719
That's what

77
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,159
friends are for.

78
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,279
You're good at making up stories.

79
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,000
I didn't make it up.

80
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,519
I..

81
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:01,919
wrote from...

82
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:03,840
the truth.

83
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,679
That's how

84
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,920
you feel about Namkhaeng, isn't it?

85
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,240
I...

86
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:17,960
broke up with her.

87
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,879
Are you okay?

88
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,720
Yes, I'm fine.

89
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,080
Hope you remember

90
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,120
what you promised me

91
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,159
if I'd win.

92
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:09,399
I do.

93
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,120
See you at midnight

94
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:12,439
at the diving hall.

95
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,399
Are you sure you want to talk about this

96
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:14,519
on your birthday?

97
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,159
You remember?

98
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:17,480
Of course.

99
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,200
How can I forget

100
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,840
my friend's birthday?

101
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,919
Here you are.

102
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,200
So you

103
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,639
can be my birthday gift.

104
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:00,159
Min.

105
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,000
Huh?

106
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,759
Here.

107
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:04,039
George.

108
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:05,959
Thanks.

109
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,799
Let's go.

110
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,799
Get up.

111
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:11,359
What's the hurry?

112
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,440
Let me rest here a bit.

113
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,759
Not too long.

114
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,759
Someone's waiting for you.

115
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,480
Who?

116
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,560
Are you here

117
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,399
to yell at me

118
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,759
because I didn't show up at the race?

119
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,960
No.

120
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:37,079
I...

121
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,480
just want to say thank you.

122
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,159
To me?

123
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:46,080
Coach made me compete in your place.

124
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,600
And you helped the team.

125
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,440
All of us, really.

126
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,440
Why did you just flake out on us like that?

127
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:01,279
I just feel that

128
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,279
I don't belong to the club.

129
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,960
Why?

130
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:07,319
Are you not happy

131
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,519
in the swimming club?

132
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:13,159
It's not that.

133
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:16,199
I just want to step out

134
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,600
and think about what I really want.

135
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:21,299
Min.

136
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:21,919
Hmm?

137
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,879
It's not hard

138
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:25,200
to know you want.

139
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,960
Think about

140
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:29,439
what makes your heart beats faster.

141
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,840
That's

142
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,040
what you want.

143
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,480
If you find it

144
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,000
or her,

145
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,160
hold tight.

146
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,319
Don't let go easily.

147
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:51,000
Wan,

148
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,440
I'm sorry.

149
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:55,080
I don't want to lose another friend.

150
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:57,000
Making a wish

151
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,159
does not get you anything.

152
00:12:58,159 --> 00:12:59,679
You need to take action for yourself.

153
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,340
All done.

154
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,720
Thanks.

155
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,760
Is this a good idea?

156
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,220
I think

157
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,880
you should tell Min about this.

158
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,180
No.

159
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,110
You're just going to

160
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,540
run away from him like this.

161
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,790
Trust me

162
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,470
he wouldn't care if I told him.

163
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,110
It's better to keep him out of this.

164
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,350
Thanks for coming.

165
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,340
Thank you for coming, too.

166
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,580
I have something to tell you.

167
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,070
Can I go first?

168
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,470
Umm.

169
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,780
I know that

170
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,380
what I'm doing to you

171
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,790
and to...

172
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,020
others

173
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,750
isn't fair.

174
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,700
I'm so confused.

175
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,340
You're the only one

176
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,180
who can give me advice.

177
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,550
Is it possible

178
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,630
if we...?

179
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,350
Say no more.

180
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:38,180
Happy Birthday to You!

181
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:44,390
Happy Birthday to You!

182
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,310
Make a wish, Waii.

183
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,150
Making a wish

184
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,260
does not get you anything.

185
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,110
You need to take action for yourself.

186
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,420
Wise words.

187
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:00,940
Blow the candles.

188
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:07,940
May the groom

189
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:08,940
and the bride

190
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,940
cut

191
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,180
the wedding cake.

192
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,620
Go on.

193
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,940
Wish you a lot of happiness, Waii.

194
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,470
Wish you a lot of happiness, Waii.

195
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,150
Wheew!

196
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,620
So sweet.

197
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,500
Wish you a lot of happiness, Waii.

198
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,310
What are you waiting for?

199
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,420
If you have something to say, say it.

200
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,430
Don't keep us hanging.

201
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,820
There's nothing to say.

202
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,390
Fine.

203
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,750
What's on your mind then?

204
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,940
Do you...

205
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,060
remember Jib?

206
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:50,900
Her close friend told her he liked her.

207
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,660
She

208
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,700
didn't know how to react.

209
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,180
Being liked

210
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,270
- isn't that a good thing?

211
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,340
But they're close friends.

212
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,220
They're in the same club.

213
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:05,110
They hang out together all the time.

214
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,260
He told her he liked her,

215
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:09,990
and she didn't know

216
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,140
how to react.

217
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:14,470
Does she like him?

218
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,060
He's good.

219
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,180
Good,

220
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,500
no problem then.

221
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,100
But

222
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,100
they are friends

223
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,100
can you imagine?

224
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,220
If they become more intimate,

225
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,940
things will change.

226
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:36,270
They like each other when they are friends.

227
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,470
If the feelings change

228
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,470
more than it is,

229
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,590
will it

230
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:46,750
mess up everything?

231
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,660
Fah is pretty consistent.

232
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:51,030
Well,

233
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,310
it's true.

234
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,150
Wait,

235
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,780
Fah?

236
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:57,780
What are you talking about?

237
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,420
Yeah,

238
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,780
we totally don't know that

239
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,780
you're talking about you and Fah.

240
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,220
My relationship with Namkhaeng

241
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,940
was screwed because of this.

242
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,150
I don't want to lose another friend.

243
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,030
Can you imagine that?

244
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,900
Don't judge someone

245
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,900
based on someone else.

246
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,390
Wan,

247
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,270
I'm sorry.

248
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,100
I want to confess a crime,

249
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,270
officer.

250
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:47,780
What are you doing this for?

251
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,300
This is not funny.

252
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,780
I'm not being funny.

253
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,830
I want to apologize.

254
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,390
Everyone in the university is seeing this;

255
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,860
your friend is live streaming this now.

256
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,700
They'll talk about it tomorrow for sure.

257
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,710
You don't get

258
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,340
what I've been trying to tell you.

259
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:02,830
You want me to get serious

260
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,070
about our relationship.

261
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:06,230
That's what I'm doing now.

262
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,300
It doesn't mean that

263
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,860
everyone else needs to know about it.

264
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,790
Seriously?

265
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,180
What is it that you want then?

266
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,340
You only care about

267
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,390
what others think of you.

268
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,390
You care about how people see you.

269
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,030
But you don't care about me.

270
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:29,150
Is it so hard to just be sincere?

271
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,540
This is how I roll.

272
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,590
What do you want me to do?

273
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,390
What about you?

274
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,100
Do you have any feelings?

275
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,710
I do.

276
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,180
You have feelings now.

277
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,430
What can you feel?

278
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:54,660
I feel like

279
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,740
I don't want to see you anymore.

280
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,340
Wan.

281
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,980
If you don't get what I'm saying,

282
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,420
it's okay.

283
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:08,310
You will one day.

284
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,100
Wan.

285
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,420
Hello, Wan.

286
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,420
The result is out.

287
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,470
You've got an internship in the US.

288
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,340
Congrats!

289
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:48,750
When you've professed your love to Fah...

290
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,340
We will throw sprinkles like this.

291
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,070
Not yet.

292
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,300
Wait,

293
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,630
profess what?

294
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,110
It's time.

295
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:01,900
Tell him

296
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,470
how you feel about him.

297
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,270
I don't know.

298
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,270
You're happy for him,

299
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:12,270
sad for him.

300
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,340
You care about him.

301
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,060
You think about him all the time.

302
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,150
You like him.

303
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:21,470
And he likes you very much.

304
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:25,190
It's time to tell him.

305
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,260
Don't worry about anything else.

306
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,340
We will create just

307
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,950
the right atmosphere for you.

308
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,620
Let's throw it now.

309
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,270
Did Waii tell you

310
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,710
what he liked about me?

311
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,190
When he's with you,

312
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,630
he felt safe.

313
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:42,780
You helped him a lot.

314
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,220
Now he doesn't need my help anymore.

315
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,950
He's changed.

316
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,150
A lot,

317
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,220
but for the better.

318
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,060
No!

319
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,740
He used to

320
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,900
miss me and

321
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,070
care about me.

322
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,300
I just want my old Waii back.

323
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,340
The Waii who hates everyone

324
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,620
and only cares about you?

325
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,220
I don't understand

326
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,540
why you're shredding so much paper.

327
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:13,540
Enough already.

328
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:16,310
It's got to be magnificent.

329
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,660
I guess...

330
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,660
it's good that we have a lot of sprinkles.

331
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,070
You need to throw them

332
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:23,070
when I tell Fah that...

333
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:24,900
Is there anything I can help?

334
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,150
Sure,

335
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:26,950
come and help.

336
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,950
There's a lot of paper left.

337
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,710
Fah!

338
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,220
Hey,

339
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,220
guys.

340
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,420
Where are you going?

341
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,870
Wait, wait.

342
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,710
What's up with you?

343
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,860
You want to help?

344
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,220
Umm

345
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,470
Listen to this.

346
00:21:58,670 --> 00:21:59,620
When

347
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:02,420
I read what you wrote in your diary,

348
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,190
I was so shocked,

349
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,380
to be honest.

350
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:12,550
I never thought about you that way,

351
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:14,550
and didn't think

352
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:17,270
you'd feel that way about me.

353
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:20,190
Well...

354
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,830
I've

355
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,740
liked you since the first day I met you.

356
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,430
I...

357
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,020
want to

358
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,620
hang out with you

359
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,340
all the time.

360
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:42,100
But I understand you.

361
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:45,260
If things between us changed,

362
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:50,390
I'd be devastated.

363
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,790
If one day

364
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,860
we had to be apart,

365
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,590
I...

366
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,750
wouldn't be able to stand it.

367
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:04,390
I've decided to tell you that...

368
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,500
Fah, I...

369
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,070
I...

370
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,070
We need to stay friends.

371
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,860
Yes,

372
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,660
let's just be friends.

373
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:42,830
I'll keep you in the dark

374
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,660
until Wan...

375
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,590
Do you still want to be together?

376
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,980
Forget it.

377
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,980
Let's pretend I never said it.

378
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,120
Say what you want to say.

379
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,480
What's the hurry?

380
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,960
You said you'd be with me forever.

381
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:35,750
You meant

382
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,990
what you said back at your home, didn't you?

383
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,480
Do you still want to be together?

384
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,200
Forget it.

385
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,630
Let's pretend I never said it.

386
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:46,270
How can I?

387
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:48,230
It happened.

388
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,430
I...

389
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:54,590
felt it.

390
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,920
It's not possible.

391
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,120
Apo,

392
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,280
I like you.

393
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:13,520
I don't know

394
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:15,670
how I will go on

395
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,030
without you.

396
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,520
What about Fay?

397
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,920
How can you leave her?

398
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,710
Will you be able to live with yourself?

399
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,720
If that's the case,

400
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,950
we can't be together.

401
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:45,750
I'll move on

402
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,750
as if I didn't hear what you just said.

403
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,670
Why?

404
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:01,030
Why did I have to choose?

405
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,000
You don't have to.

406
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,560
The answer is clear.

407
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:12,120
I'm not the one.

408
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:39,030
Fay...

409
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,630
I'm sorry.

410
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,630
Did you hear, Apo?

411
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:57,230
I am

412
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,440
not the one.

413
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,960
Let's have lunch.

414
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,120
No.

415
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,840
See you in the evening.

416
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,400
Wait,

417
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,240
what's up with you?

418
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,350
Huh?

419
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:02,110
"See you in the evening"?

420
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,630
We're here now.

421
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,190
Why can't we just have lunch together?

422
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,190
You said you wouldn't change.

423
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,440
What am I supposed to do?

424
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,070
If you

425
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,830
want me to be with you all the time,

426
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:14,150
how can I

427
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:16,000
get over you?

428
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,040
Don't.

429
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,680
Like me.

430
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:29,030
But...

431
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,880
This is the order.

432
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:37,190
Like me like before.

433
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,440
Didn't you hear?

434
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,070
I did.

435
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,600
What did you hear?

436
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,520
You told me to like you like before.

437
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,680
So, do you?

438
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,310
I do.

439
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,510
That's it.

440
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,830
Happy belated birthday.

441
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,190
Must be a lot of trouble for you.

442
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,950
I just remembered it.

443
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,000
Don't forget to eat.

444
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:39,030
Are you leaving?

445
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,310
I'm sleeping here.

446
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,040
Am I allowed?

447
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,280
Umm.

448
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,190
It's relaxing.

449
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
No wonder

450
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,720
why you like to live alone.

451
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,960
Lately,

452
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,240
I haven't wanted to be alone.

453
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:58,750
What are you waiting for?

454
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,680
I don't know.

455
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:06,270
Don't make it so hard.

456
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:08,710
Is it ever easy?

457
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,120
Seriously,

458
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:14,510
when you talked to Kan,

459
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,800
was it easy?

460
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:20,470
It's not easy

461
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:22,830
when you carry others' feelings on your shoulder.

462
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,360
I should be selfish?

463
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,480
Say whatever you want.

464
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,960
Yes,

465
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:37,830
someone will get hurt.

466
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,040
But they will get better

467
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:42,630
and move on.

468
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:46,470
If you leave things unresolved,

469
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,880
they are not happy,

470
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,190
and never will be.

471
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,510
Go.

472
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:03,560
Go to who you want to be with.

473
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,240
Fay,

474
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,400
I've been looking everywhere for you.

475
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,070
What's up?

476
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:22,950
I cannot move on

477
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,360
if I don't talk to you now.

478
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,360
You are special to me.

479
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,800
You're my girlfriend

480
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:35,230
who helps me forget about bad things.

481
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,920
But I'm not the one.

482
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,190
I've never planned to betray

483
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,190
or deceive you.

484
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,510
I'm..

485
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:47,150
a coward

486
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:50,590
who's afraid to own up to the fact

487
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,040
that my feelings...

488
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,600
have changed.

489
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,840
Do you know

490
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:06,440
that I was so mad at you?

491
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,240
So mad that

492
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,240
I promised myself

493
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:14,470
not to ever tell you this.

494
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:17,070
But now...

495
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,750
I should act

496
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,880
like the person whom you loved once.

497
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,030
What is it?

498
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:29,510
Apo is going overseas.

499
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,680
Hurry up and come back.

500
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,880
One year passes by quickly.

501
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:42,070
I'm sorry.

502
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:43,510
Apo.

503
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:44,510
Wan.

504
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,640
Don't tell me...

505
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,270
Kluay,

506
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,790
what's up?

507
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:52,880
What are you doing here?

508
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,270
I just want to see for myself

509
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:57,710
how running can be fun.

510
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,390
If you're coming here to be a smartass,

511
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:00,120
go back.

512
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,600
Fine.

513
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:04,430
I'll keep you in the dark

514
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,840
until Wan...

515
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,390
arrives in America

516
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:10,880
What are you talking about?

517
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,590
Wan

518
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,670
is going to the US.

519
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,590
She's keeping it from you.

520
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,550
Why?

521
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,510
Because of you.

522
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:22,960
The one reason that

523
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,160
will make her stay

524
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,270
is...

525
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,080
Wan,

526
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,080
I like you.

527
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:01,630
Seriously,

528
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,430
I don't know what you want to hear from me.

529
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,480
I just know that right here, right now

530
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,120
I want to tell you that

531
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:09,150
I like you.

532
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,030
Wan

533
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:20,240
Have you thought it through?

534
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:23,000
I haven't

535
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:24,190
I just know that

536
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,080
I want to tell you that.

537
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,070
Could have spared the drama

538
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,080
if you'd just said it earlier.

539
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:47,510
Hi, Min.

540
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,920
Hey, Apo.

541
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,320
What are you doing here?

542
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,800
We're catching the same flight.

543
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:59,110
We're leaving at 3 PM.

544
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,670
We have to go.

545
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:11,670
I just applied to forfeit my internship.

546
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,880
What about Apo?

547
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,270
He's probably reached the airport.

548
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,800
Hey Waii,

549
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,000
Apo gave me this to give to you.

550
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,440
Waii,

551
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:51,600
I'm sorry

552
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,000
for not saying goodbye to you in person.

553
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:59,670
But it's for the best.

554
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,840
One year without me

555
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,280
in your life

556
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:04,750
will help you

557
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:05,600
focus on the things

558
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,920
that are important to you.

559
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,240
Thank you for everything, Waii.

560
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,400
Thank you for showing me what love is.

561
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:17,720
Thank you for making me love you.

562
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:22,190
Good luck, Waii.

563
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,560
Happy anniversary!

564
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,390
Thank you.

565
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:56,080
Can you not go anywhere anymore?

566
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:23,450
Admit it

567
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,780
you don't know shit about love.

568
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:43,970
I will be with you forever.

569
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:02,540
One year later

570
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,360
One year has passed by.

571
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,900
A lot has happened since then.

572
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:08,740
Each of us

573
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,380
has started something new

574
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,130
and different.

575
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,770
Where are

576
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,330
our swimmers?

577
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:17,410
That's right.

578
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:21,060
They never come on time, sir.

579
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:23,620
Aren't you going to stop me?

580
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,130
Put and Sung

581
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,130
have stepped up to be assistant coaches

582
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:28,690
to help train the juniors.

583
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:31,210
They're as thick as thieves, same as before.

584
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:32,570
I miss Coach Tee.

585
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:33,930
Now that I'm here,

586
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,020
I get him completely.

587
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,100
Stop!

588
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:41,570
Don't run.

589
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:44,450
A coach needs to calm down.

590
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:45,260
Kluay

591
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,050
finally has a fan club.

592
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,460
And possibly

593
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:51,460
a real boyfriend soon.

594
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:53,660
Namkhaeng

595
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,660
became a freshman in the university.

596
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,380
It hasn't been long

597
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,690
until she found the right person.

598
00:39:57,690 --> 00:39:59,130
Why are you late?

599
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,660
Happy anniversary!

600
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,660
How sweet!

601
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:07,850
Thank you!

602
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,330
I'll wait in front of your classroom

603
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:12,020
in the evening.

604
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:13,660
Go now.

605
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:16,020
Pan is still as tough as before.

606
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,770
Wait...

607
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,290
But less aggressive

608
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:22,900
after being in a relationship with Fah.

609
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:32,330
Is this less aggressive?

610
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:35,370
I'll win

611
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:36,770
this time.

612
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:38,740
You said you wouldn't compete.

613
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,300
Fine.

614
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,050
Fine,

615
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:43,690
I won't.

616
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,260
You just said you're going to win.

617
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:47,140
If it's you,

618
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,050
I don't want to win or anything.

619
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:50,580
Then I'll win.

620
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,420
The running club

621
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:56,650
has a new member.

622
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:00,050
Although we've learned

623
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,770
and grown,

624
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:04,410
something remains the same.

625
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,220
P'Waii, you're late.

626
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,740
You're late.

627
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,250
I know.

628
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,490
You're going to be late on the first day.

629
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:13,090
No,

630
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,530
I will arrive just in time.

631
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:16,690
Will the club kick you out?

632
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:17,650
No,

633
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,210
once you're in, you're in.

634
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:21,580
Good luck.

635
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:22,900
Thanks,

636
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:23,650
Dad.

637
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:24,860
Come here.

638
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:26,370
Your brother has to leave now.

639
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:28,290
Bye, Dad.

640
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,090
Hey, bye Dad,

641
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,290
bye Maii.

642
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,490
See you.

643
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:38,210
Let's continue with our breakfast.

644
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,900
Dad.

645
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,300
Have you forgotten something?

646
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,930
P'Kan!

647
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,100
Hi, Maii.

648
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:14,690
Where have you been?

649
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,370
I've been gone

650
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:18,370
so I'd miss someone here.

651
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:20,780
Will you come back

652
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,540
and live with us?

653
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:25,100
Can I?

654
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:34,010
I want to hug too.

655
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:39,490
Thailand Swimming Club

656
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:13,770
You're late.

657
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:34,490
I've been waiting here for a while.

658
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:41,260
I've waited longer.

659
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:14,020
Can you not go anywhere anymore?

660
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:24,140
All I can do

661
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,100
is to be here with you

662
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:28,220
forever.

663
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:36,930
Let's go

664
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:38,370
or we'll be late.

665
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:39,740
Come on!

666
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:42,180
Come on!

667
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:56,420
"If the truth is not what you dream of, live with it with great understanding."
