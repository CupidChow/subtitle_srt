1
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,219
Are you planning to take all I have

2
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,639
until I have nothing left, right?

3
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:20,979
I haven't seen you this happy in a long time.

4
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,659
Don't give Wan the wrong idea.

5
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,360
You are not a sissy.

6
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,040
You just date one.

7
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:36,040
You also cleaned up the mess from the party last night in the process?

8
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,099
Thank you, sir, for visiting our club.

9
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,599
How many days do you want?

10
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:47,639
For what?

11
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,180
For cleaning out your things from the pool.

12
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,219
But...

13
00:02:53,259 --> 00:02:58,799
I was hoping that you'd bring good reputation to the university

14
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:03,960
But since Coach Tee left, everything went downhill.

15
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:07,120
And now Coach Mai is resigning.

16
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,420
You, as the Captain, should've handled it better.

17
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,400
Instead, you let things get out of hand.

18
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:19,039
This reminds me of Kan.

19
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:21,299
I wish he never resigned from our university.

20
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,439
If he'd stayed, he would never have let this happen.

21
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:26,159
But...

22
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,420
Allow me to say something, sir.

23
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,259
I'm the Vice-Captain.

24
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:35,259
Do you have any excuse?

25
00:03:35,259 --> 00:03:38,159
Make it a good one.

26
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:40,039
I'm not making excuses.

27
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,039
I want to prove myself...

28
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,299
You've had many opportunities to do so.

29
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,039
without costing the university a dime.

30
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,319
The club will take care of any expenses incurred by itself.

31
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:54,120
Fine but if you can't make it,

32
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,599
be ready to clear out your things.

33
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:21,899
P'Pan, you're late.

34
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:24,659
I asked mom to cook the wrong dish, look.

35
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,539
P'Fah!

36
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,800
Are you free to talk?

37
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,800
Yes. Have a seat.

38
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,199
I'm good. This will not take long.

39
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:38,579
What's up?

40
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,220
What I need to tell you is...

41
00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:46,019
I like you.

42
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:51,059
Yes.

43
00:04:55,279 --> 00:05:01,279
But what I just said is not how I feel.

44
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,860
Pan told me to say it.

45
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:12,599
She created the whole story

46
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,980
Forced me to do all this.

47
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,340
Everything was her plan all along.

48
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,300
I'm tired.

49
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:29,319
Have some rest.

50
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,019
Your proposal wasn't bad.

51
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:36,919
I wasn't going to propose that.

52
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,300
What were you going to propose?

53
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,500
My fist.

54
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:44,159
A few punches as a gift to the Rector.

55
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,699
Tough guy. Bad.

56
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:09,540
But someone held my hand so I wasn't able to.

57
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,540
Can I hold yours?

58
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:33,139
I realized that we never had any photo together.

59
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:38,560
Thanks for coming to the meeting with me.

60
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,460
You're the one I care about the most.

61
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,540
Copycat.

62
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,220
Now what are we going to do?

63
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:01,419
No money, no coach.

64
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:07,039
We'd be better off without that kind of coach.

65
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,400
She's messed up.

66
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,700
If I ever find out where she is now...

67
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,020
Let me lie down.

68
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:42,039
Sawasdee ka.

69
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,700
I have nothing much to say,

70
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,559
except sorry.

71
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:48,560
For what?
except sorry.

72
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,039
For what?

73
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:57,579
Well, I thought you're the reason Min is distracted.

74
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,360
But I found out what the reason really is.

75
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,660
It's another woman.

76
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:10,180
Don't panic. Not just any woman.

77
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,659
It's his ex.

78
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,399
You know that he and his ex were so in love.

79
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,399
Yes.

80
00:09:20,419 --> 00:09:22,699
When the ex met him again,

81
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,419
there was this clip of you and him.

82
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:30,360
Before you, he never was in a serious relationship.

83
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,600
What are you trying to say?

84
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,420
Don't get me wrong.

85
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,060
There's not any problem.

86
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:42,199
The ex is leaving.

87
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:46,339
Why do know so much about Min's personal life?

88
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:49,840
I'm not speaking to you as a coach,

89
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:52,059
but that woman.

90
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,599
I am Min's ex.

91
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,220
Take good care of him for me.

92
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:40,139
Hey!

93
00:10:45,659 --> 00:10:48,319
What are you smiling about?

94
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,100
Thanks.

95
00:10:50,139 --> 00:10:51,179
For what?

96
00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:53,819
Now, Namkhaeng is very sad.

97
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,679
How did you break the news to her?

98
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,239
I told her the truth.

99
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,919
Good job, dude.

100
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:09,439
It's my turn to heal her broken heart.

101
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,759
Grilled pork tonight. I'll buy.

102
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,819
No, well...

103
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,580
Why?

104
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:20,180
Grilled pork isn't good enough for you?

105
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:23,740
No, listen.

106
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:28,960
I told Namkhaeng that...

107
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:33,299
Pan, are you finished?

108
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:34,599
I'm waiting for you to practice.

109
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,759
What? You go ahead and practice.

110
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:39,319
Min is at the pool by himself.

111
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,899
I don't want to be alone with him in the pool.

112
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,100
Come on, keep my company.

113
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,320
Are you crazy? What do you hate him so much?

114
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,460
Don't ask many questions.

115
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,899
Come with me.

116
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,000
Wait.

117
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,879
Has she contacted you?

118
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:22,100
No.

119
00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:25,759
Was I fooled?

120
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:27,980
She's something.

121
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,220
If she's not, I wouldn't end up like this.

122
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,819
I do believe that she dumped that guy and came for you.

123
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:38,720
For me, that is not important.

124
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,659
She must have hurt you badly.

125
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,579
From an innocent high-schooler to a player.

126
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:47,839
Cut it. I'm tired of being a player.

127
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,399
Oh yeah?

128
00:12:50,259 --> 00:12:51,960
I don't think so.

129
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,300
You're stopped by another player.

130
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:57,860
That's not it. I'm tired of being a player.

131
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,120
Right now, I'm focused to be a swimmer.

132
00:13:01,539 --> 00:13:04,039
Oh, you're all talk.

133
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,040
I only bought one.

134
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,539
Are you going to take it from me again?

135
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:21,759
How about you and I race for it?

136
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,039
Who is faster gets it.

137
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:25,639
Game on.

138
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,980
Go.

139
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,419
We have 3,716 baht left.

140
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,120
We need to mobilize funds.

141
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,120
Wait.

142
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,720
Let go.

143
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:07,799
Can you really call yourself the Captain?

144
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,410
Sending a heart sticker...

145
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,430
George.

146
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,480
Are you waiting for Aom?

147
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,230
Yes.

148
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:38,330
Have you seen Min lately?

149
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,200
No,

150
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,860
he spends most of his time at the club,

151
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,280
and

152
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,000
with you.

153
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,100
Aom said something to you, didn't she?

154
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,860
Everyone is following the news of

155
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,510
'the couple in the classroom'.

156
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,610
I'm sorry.

157
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,440
Min has never been like this with anyone.

158
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:02,250
He wouldn't be sweet with anyone publicly.

159
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:07,360
Now you post and tag each other.

160
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,670
You two are dating, aren't you?

161
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,510
I don't know if this is serious.

162
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:17,590
Min may do this to spite someone.

163
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,720
A guy like Min?

164
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,290
He doesn't care about anyone.

165
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:25,810
He used to care a lot about his ex.

166
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,510
Do you know her?

167
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,170
No,

168
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,920
but he made a slip once while he was drunk.

169
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,140
She must have done a number on him,

170
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:43,930
making him scared of a relationship.

171
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:48,070
He said that if he met her again,

172
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,920
he would...

173
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,730
Aom is finished.

174
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,120
I'll go see her now.

175
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,760
Finish your story.

176
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,390
George!

177
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,760
Finish it.

178
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:02,220
You said this wasn't serious.

179
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:06,070
If you have questions, just ask him.

180
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,740
I have to go.

181
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,570
Don't want to keep her waiting.

182
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,240
We have 3,716 baht left.

183
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,190
Why do we have so little?

184
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,860
Our budget has been cut for months.

185
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,590
The pool cleaning fee isn't helping either.

186
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,960
It's not cheap.

187
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,340
We need to mobilize funds.

188
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,590
Otherwise, we'll be swimming in a dirty pool.

189
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,410
Mobilize funds?

190
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,460
That's difficult.

191
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,910
Who would give us money?

192
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,010
Should we sell stuff?

193
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,680
What do we sell?

194
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,420
I don't know.

195
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,020
Waii,

196
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:52,090
we could auction your swimwear.

197
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:56,280
Now we're in the hot seat.

198
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:28,910
We should organize a play to mobilize funds.

199
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,150
At the pool.

200
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:34,970
We can show them that we have something to offer.

201
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,500
I think this is a good idea.

202
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,430
Your idea is good.

203
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,370
Why do you look nervous?

204
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,810
I want this one to be the lead actor.

205
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,220
Who?

206
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,180
Let me have a look.

207
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:52,350
Our friend. He's good looking.

208
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,430
If we get Kan,

209
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:09,030
we'll have a lot of audiences.

210
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,810
The Rector will give us green light.

211
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:13,220
He may even sponsor it.

212
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,360
We can try to come up with something else.

213
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,700
No need.

214
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:24,000
Everyone seemed to be on board with the play.

215
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,040
What about the actor?

216
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,700
If not Kan, the Rector wouldn't approve it.

217
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,300
Let's vote.

218
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:35,670
Fine.

219
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:38,690
Wait, can I have half an hour before the vote?

220
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,590
I need to do a number two.

221
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,640
I'll be back.

222
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:48,620
Let's vote when he comes back.

223
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,200
You won't stop, will you?

224
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:13,070
I'm doing it for...

225
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,240
Don't say it's for the club.

226
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:21,310
I'm doing it for you and you only.

227
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,590
This is my personal life.

228
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,050
Stop meddling,

229
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,420
I'm begging you.

230
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,320
This is not personal.

231
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,440
I'm doing this for the Captain.

232
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,650
You are our only hope.

233
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,990
We have no coach,

234
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,110
no money,

235
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,030
only you.

236
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,290
If you can't show them that you can separate your personal issues

237
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:51,370
from the club's matters,

238
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,280
Can you really call yourself the Captain?

239
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,020
If we have Kan, our club will survive.

240
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,540
But we may not.

241
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,370
If we all vote for Kan,

242
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,460
will Waii stop being friends with us?

243
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,350
Why?

244
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,960
Kan hurt Waii in the past.

245
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,470
He betrayed him.

246
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,550
Min must understand about betrayal.

247
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:34,380
Let's conclude how we will vote.

248
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:40,460
Do we choose the club, or the friend?

249
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:42,610
If we don't have the friend,

250
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,850
we don't have the club.

251
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:49,190
If we don't have the club...

252
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:52,320
It's the CLUB.

253
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:56,470
Shit!

254
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:57,990
Our half an hour is up?

255
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,050
No,

256
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:01,280
but I have a plan with Namkhaeng.

257
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,530
I forgot.

258
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,670
Fah,

259
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:05,780
vote for me.

260
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,840
I'll vote whatever you vote.

261
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,810
Namkhaeng, wait.

262
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,990
I'm sorry. My practice took a long time.

263
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,870
It wasn't finished

264
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,640
but I had to see you first.

265
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:19,530
This is another lie?

266
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,660
What lie?

267
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,670
P'Fah told me all about it.

268
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,810
You being his friend

269
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,820
and Coach Mai...

270
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:28,970
Those are all lies.

271
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,150
Huh?

272
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,140
What do you take me for?

273
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,460
Are you having fun, playing with someone's feelings?

274
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,400
You enjoy seeing me as a fool, right?

275
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:43,220
No, Namkhaeng, wait!

276
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,200
Let go!

277
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,280
Stay away from me.

278
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:17,140
We're at a critical time, and

279
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,080
you're in a mood for some origami.

280
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,260
This is not origami.

281
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,260
I made you ballots for voting.

282
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:25,720
Whatever you draw, that's what you vote.

283
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,730
Let me help you.

284
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,720
Let me help as well.

285
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,970
I'll help you write.

286
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,940
Have you decided?

287
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,490
Here, put the pieces of paper in the glass.

288
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:44,850
It's simple.

289
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,720
If you are my true friend,

290
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,700
you know what to vote.

291
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:50,970
Simple?

292
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:53,220
Let's do it.

293
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,310
Who wants Kan to help, raise your hand.

294
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,260
Don't you want to help our club?

295
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,190
It's not just a toilet,

296
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,680
it's a clogged toilet.

297
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:39,080
You're making things better,

298
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,230
Mr. Director.

299
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:44,350
Our play is...

300
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:04,350
Let's have a meeting tonight to assign tasks.

301
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,510
Tell Pan.

302
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,240
Who will get Kan?

303
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:17,980
That's him.

304
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,580
Kan, perfect timing.

305
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:40,870
How did you know that I'd vote this way.

306
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,080
I have faith in my Captain.

307
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,510
Hey,

308
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,180
sorry I'm late.

309
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,380
We didn't make plans.

310
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,060
Do I need a plan to see you?

311
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,160
You're being a pain.

312
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:16,220
Wanting to see you is being a pain?

313
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,600
Can you talk serious for once?

314
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,420
I'm being serious right now.

315
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:34,380
If I ask you questions,

316
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,930
will you give truthful answers?

317
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:37,030
Yes.

318
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,520
About Coach Mai.

319
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:53,510
You found out, huh?

320
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,020
To be honest, I wanted to talk to you about this.

321
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:04,930
I thought you'd never talk about it.

322
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,390
Of course, I must.

323
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,490
How long ago did it end?

324
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:12,930
Last night.

325
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,020
Last night?

326
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,870
Yes, it ended last night.

327
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:22,950
When I saw Coach Mai took those people to party at the pool,

328
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,620
I told them to stop and go home.

329
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:27,080
Party?

330
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,080
The point isn't that.

331
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,690
The point is

332
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:38,680
the Rector stopped giving us any budget.

333
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,280
The club is basically dissolved,

334
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,040
just not now.

335
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:45,770
What are you going to do?

336
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:47,990
Not me,

337
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,180
us.

338
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,080
Take this, too.

339
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,680
Do it yourself.

340
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:05,400
Don't be a sissy.

341
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,990
Toughen up.

342
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,400
Take them there.

343
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,430
Your job is to work for me.

344
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,560
Our job isn't to work for you,

345
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,700
so come help us out.

346
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,270
I'll help in a sec.

347
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:21,170
Come here.

348
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,400
Where?

349
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,500
Here,

350
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,350
get in there.

351
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:34,840
Let me help.

352
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,320
Min, help me.

353
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:40,110
Aren't you practicing together anymore?

354
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:42,050
You usually pair up.

355
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,630
Let's change things up.

356
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:46,870
Put may want something new.

357
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,880
Sung.

358
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,500
Help. Help. Help.

359
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:51,100
What's wrong, Achi?

360
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,060
Just cleaning the toilet. You have to complain?

361
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,320
It's not just a toilet,

362
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:57,650
it's a clogged toilet.

363
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,020
Okay, I'll help.

364
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,020
Really?

365
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,050
No.

366
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:05,550
Come here.

367
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,550
No! No!

368
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:17,000
Don't just stand there.

369
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:28,380
I'll help you.

370
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,910
He's here and where does he sleep?

371
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,940
In our room.

372
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,490
We have lots of space.

373
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,210
Where?

374
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,440
Your bed.

375
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,440
You sleep there alone.

376
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,500
Is there a problem?

377
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:13,180
I can go back to my home.

378
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,200
Say that again,

379
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,290
your home?

380
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,300
You want to have that conversation now?

381
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:23,490
Kan is helping us with the play.

382
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,400
Let's finish this and

383
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:27,410
you can talk about other stuff later.

384
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,470
Fine.

385
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:35,330
You take care of his sleep arrangements.

386
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:37,670
I'll only see him at work.

387
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,300
Are you busting my balls?

388
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:33,380
No.

389
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,430
You're calmer.

390
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,870
If Coach Tee finds out, he'll be happy.

391
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,990
He won't.

392
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:51,060
I messed up with the club.

393
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,930
You're making things better,

394
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,430
Mr. Director.

395
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,950
By the way, what play will it be?

396
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,620
Don't worry.

397
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:24,610
I've thought about it.

398
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:54,830
Our play is...

399
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:56,670
Tada

400
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:58,530
It's upside down.

401
00:31:58,530 --> 00:31:59,030
Oh.

402
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,050
Cinderella.

403
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:06,260
It's good.

404
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:08,460
We can find a cute actress to play.

405
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,070
That's right.

406
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,670
I see you didn't learn your lesson.

407
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,050
This is our thing.

408
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:17,780
We'll find actors within the club.

409
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:20,620
There are Cinderella,

410
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,950
her stepmother and

411
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,520
two sisters.

412
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:24,660
Who will play these roles?

413
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:27,030
Read the paper.

414
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:30,690
Stepmother

415
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:32,930
Stepsister 1

416
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,040
Stepsister 2

417
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,260
Assistant Director

418
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,660
Producer

419
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:44,010
I will be the director.

420
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,410
Apo will assist me.

421
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,160
I talked to Waii and we agreed to bring in the volunteering club.

422
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,160
They can help with some activities.

423
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:54,970
I'll bring in Wan as well.

424
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:58,140
You just want your girlfriend to be involved.

425
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:01,930
Is there anything wrong with that?

426
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:04,020
Sorry, I'm late.

427
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:06,830
Hi, everyone.

428
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,730
Can I join you guys?

429
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,620
I want to be Assistant Director.

430
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:16,190
That's Apo's job.

431
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:19,730
Fay, you can help with makeup, hairstyle, and costume.

432
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,540
Fah, take care of the budget and benefits.

433
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,640
What about Pan?

434
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,800
Where have you been?

435
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:32,830
We've started out meeting a long time ago.

436
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,910
Give me anything that does not involve Fah.

437
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,880
What's wrong with you?

438
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,220
Nothing.

439
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:41,490
Just tell me what I'm supposed to do.

440
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,140
Here you go.

441
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:46,870
Sure.

442
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,340
Cinderella?

443
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,430
She'll be in a dress.

444
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,780
You said you'd do anything.

445
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:56,990
Yeah, that.

446
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:00,020
I'll be Cinderella?

447
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:01,900
Yes, the role suits you the best.

448
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:02,960
She'll be so beautiful.

449
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,440
"give me anything"

450
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:09,020
You'll get me as a stepsister.

451
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,740
I'll be your evil stepsister.

452
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:13,070
Not to mention the evil stepmom.

453
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:21,240
If I can do it myself, I would have done it a long time ago.

454
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:42,180
Namkhaeng.

455
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,500
Can I talk to you?

456
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,750
What lies did P'Pan tell you to tell me?

457
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,910
I just wanted you to know the truth.

458
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:57,680
I know now that you will never like me.

459
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,500
I'm sorry.

460
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,940
I just like you.

461
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:07,930
Namkhaeng...

462
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:10,340
Don't be dramatic.

463
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:13,810
You're just my type.

464
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,680
It makes me like you,

465
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,270
not love.

466
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,370
I'm sure that

467
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,160
there's one person who loves you,

468
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:26,810
and will make you fall in love.

469
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:46,940
Pan, can I talk to you?

470
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,670
You annoy me.

471
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:52,950
Ride on.

472
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:04,020
What do you have against me to treat me like that?

473
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,420
None.

474
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,940
I just didn't want to keep lying.

475
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,730
It's one last request

476
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:12,250
and I would leave you alone forever.

477
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:14,910
Just one final thing and you couldn't do it for me.

478
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:16,410
Why me?

479
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,730
If I can do it myself,

480
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:22,730
I would have done it a long time ago.

481
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:26,590
But she's into you,

482
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,480
not me.

483
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:46,670
That's not relevant.

484
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,630
If you're serious about her,

485
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,830
there's no need to lie.

486
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:04,110
What do you want me to say?

487
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,440
I like her so much since the day we met.

488
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:11,830
She's the nicest girl I've ever met.

489
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:13,420
The more I know her, the more I like her.

490
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,420
I like her so much. Is that it?

491
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,840
If it's that easy, I would have done it.

492
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,170
That didn't sound so hard.

493
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:28,750
Namkhaeng.

494
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:32,390
Thank you, P'Fah.

495
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,830
You heard everything?

496
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:48,210
From the beginning.

497
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:50,230
"What do you have against me?"

498
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:51,990
"Just one last request."

499
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:54,080
"She's the nicest girl."

500
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,980
"Crushing hard."

501
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,490
Are you making fun of me?

502
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,360
No, the last one is from me.

503
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:04,830
What?

504
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:08,390
"Crushing hard."

505
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:18,310
Can you hurry up? It's hot.

506
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:20,590
It's not like I'm not carrying heavy things in a hot weather.

507
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:27,950
Let me help.

508
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,140
Such a romantic scene in broad daylight.

509
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:36,730
What the hell?

510
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,650
I'm just kidding.

511
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,350
If you don't stop, you have it coming.

512
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,210
You two, too.

513
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:45,470
Fine, I'll leave you alone.

514
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,640
I'm going to play with this sissy instead.

515
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:58,670
Why are you pissed?

516
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,440
I'm just kidding.

517
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:01,530
Are you defending your girlfriend?

518
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:02,610
Shut the hell up.

519
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:05,140
Assholes like you are not my friends.

520
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,430
You said it.

521
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,000
We'll see.

522
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,030
Better watch your back.

523
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,720
Are you sure this is a good idea?

524
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:16,890
I don't give a shit.

525
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:19,770
Are you afraid of them?

526
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:21,210
How can I not?

527
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,470
What if they hit me?

528
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,470
I wouldn't let them do that.

529
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,220
I wouldn't let anyone hurt my homie.

530
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,300
The jump board can be the stepmom's house.

531
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:42,560
This pool can be the palace.

532
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:44,170
Great imagination.

533
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:48,420
The Prince will be in track 1,

534
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:51,150
and Cinderella will be in track 2.

535
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,230
Got it...

536
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,580
That's good.

537
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,710
Waii,

538
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,580
Pan is sick.

539
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,160
What should we do?

540
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:11,710
Apo,

541
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:13,890
can you fill in for Pan?

542
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:14,520
Me?

543
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,320
Yes, you.

544
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,970
Fill in for Pan?

545
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:18,710
Yes.

546
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:19,700
No.

547
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,700
Go.

548
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,950
Come here, Cinderella.

549
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:29,180
Come here.

550
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,830
I'm the mother of all.

551
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:51,240
She's flirting with the prince.

552
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,240
Go!

553
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:47,090
Achi!

554
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:47,710
Shit!

555
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:50,380
No!

556
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:56,430
Come on, Pan.

557
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,440
What do I do?

558
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,540
Put your hand on his shoulder.

559
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:02,950
Follow his lead.

560
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:03,950
I'm doing it.

561
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,650
Twirl.

562
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,970
Feel the rhythm.

563
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,890
It's so difficult.

564
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:20,060
Just follow him.

565
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,390
Like you're dancing.

566
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:27,690
Twirl.

567
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:51,270
Waii, let me show you this.

568
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,260
Isn't it wonderful? Applause.

569
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:57,030
Surprise?

570
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:59,290
I wish you could have told me about this.

571
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:01,290
I asked Apo to do one as well.

572
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,860
OMG. This one is it.

573
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:11,060
Let me see.

574
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:17,100
I think Fay's ad is great.

575
00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:20,810
No, I like your one better.

576
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:22,390
Thanks, Fay.

577
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,440
Guys, show me the rest of the costumes.

578
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:31,550
I'm sorry, Fay.

579
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:38,110
Yours is great.

580
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:40,570
I'll give you this one,

581
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,980
but not the next.

582
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:48,030
Give them to me. You won't be able to give out all of them.

583
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:49,670
No! I can do it.

584
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:50,730
Hello.

585
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:52,740
Please come to the play.

586
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,050
Please come see the play from the swimming club.

587
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,860
Come see the play.

588
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:09,790
There's some serious cross-gender going on.

589
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:11,620
Especially with Pan.

590
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:15,390
What kind of Cinderella acts so manly?

591
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:16,450
Sung is more feminine than her.

592
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:27,760
What about Kan?

593
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,860
How's his acting?

594
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:31,460
It's good.

595
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,170
This is right up his alley.

596
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:35,150
It's nice of him to do this for us.

597
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,760
It may be good for you to chat with him.

598
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:40,930
Yeah, I know.

599
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:45,070
Can you talk to me now?

600
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:52,070
I told you,

601
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:54,650
I'd talk to you at work only.

602
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:07,780
Wait a bit.

603
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:12,420
Do you think he will talk to me after the play is finished?

604
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:28,890
"Everything is a possibility until you take action."
