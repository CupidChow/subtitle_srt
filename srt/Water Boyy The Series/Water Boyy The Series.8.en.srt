1
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,490
Why did I have to complicate things?

2
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,140
If you won't let me, I'll kiss you.

3
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,540
You're all talk.

4
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,080
Photoshoot for a poster as an ambassador.

5
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,080
It's just a photoshoot.

6
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,140
I won't do it.

7
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,530
I don't want to see him.

8
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,310
Why can't we just stay like this forever?

9
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,210
Do we know each other?

10
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,710
You don't remember me?

11
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,710
This is a good angle. Nice.

12
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,710
Give the cat a kiss.

13
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,610
Turn this way a bit more.

14
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:58,460
What?

15
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,460
Wan, congratulations.

16
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:24,270
Umm...

17
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,460
If there's anything we can do...

18
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,310
Why don't you worry about your club for now?

19
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,180
If you didn't mess things up...

20
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,990
Let's agree that we go our separate ways.

21
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,590
Maybe not entirely separate.

22
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,180
Thank you krap, P'Wan.

23
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,410
You think that's cute?

24
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,820
You had to ruin it for me.

25
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,030
I thought I was cute like a cat.

26
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:24,210
You're not even half as cute.

27
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,190
I want to see you the way you were in your freshman year

28
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,760
You saw my photo.

29
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,800
That was a photo. I want to see that in person

30
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,730
How cute you must be.

31
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,210
What are you talking about? I was a nerd.

32
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:43,670
Why did you change? Were you in love?

33
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,060
Exactly.

34
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,640
Really?

35
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,820
No. When my opponent is an entire swimming club

36
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,060
I can't be weak and insecure.

37
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,230
Opponent, huh?

38
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,150
How about now?

39
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,790
Let's see how it goes.

40
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,270
You're tough. You have to wait and see how it goes.

41
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,320
Why, we are tame.

42
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,500
Stop or you'll find yourself in the pool.

43
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,350
No, I'm a cat who's afraid of water

44
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:32,570
Kan!

45
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,320
Thank you for your help.

46
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,320
I just wanted to do the right thing for a change.

47
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,090
Can you do right by Waii, too?

48
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,130
Leave him alone.

49
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:54,120
I'm not a psychopath who messes him up for no reason.

50
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:59,690
Waii should know that his self-centered way causes trouble for others.

51
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,700
I'm not troubled by Waii,

52
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,740
but by you.

53
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,570
Isn't it easier to just go our separate ways?

54
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,530
Coach Tee chose you. You won

55
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,320
I didn't want to win.

56
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,660
I just love him.

57
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,960
I didn't want to be a homewrecker.

58
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,800
I didn't want to lose a friend

59
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:35,870
They are okay with where we are now, but I can't accept that.

60
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,210
I can't take this feeling gnawing at me

61
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,380
What the hell are you doing?

62
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,150
Are you planning to take all I have

63
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:18,270
my dad, my brother, my friends.

64
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,400
until I have nothing left? That will please you, huh?

65
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,400
Waii!

66
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:29,760
No, I didn't want that. Even if I did nothing,

67
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:32,230
people would know that

68
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,060
you're selfish,

69
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,850
self-centered,

70
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,080
and do not give a shit about others

71
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:43,530
Stop it

72
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,580
If you find yourself with no one left,

73
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,230
it's on you.

74
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,250
Why did you stop me?

75
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,710
Waii, Kan isn't all that bad.

76
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,110
Don't mention his name.

77
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,880
Do you want to leave things unsolved like this?

78
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,080
If you don't stop,

79
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,140
you are not my friend.

80
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:13,120
Accept the situation and talk to him.

81
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,960
Stop. I've warned you.

82
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,640
If you still side with him,

83
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,460
you are not my friend

84
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:22,640
Waii!

85
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,560
Are you okay?

86
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:50,490
If it's any consolation, he was worse before.

87
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,380
We couldn't see Kan. We couldn't mention his name.

88
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:58,900
He was pissed even when I said 'Kanban' (homework).

89
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,060
My joke wasn't funny?

90
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,490
Sorry, friend. Bow down.

91
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:09,380
Why did you hit me?

92
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,340
I'm pissed.

93
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,410
I just wanted to lighten up the mood if I 'kan'.

94
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:16,470
Did you just say his name?

95
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:21,990
No, it's a different word.

96
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,450
Stay still.

97
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,360
What are you looking at?

98
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,620
Get this over quickly. The bag is heavy.

99
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,690
One, two...

100
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,220
Let me see.

101
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,430
How is it? Is it okay?

102
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,240
You're quite a good photographer.

103
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,240
Let's take some more.

104
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,120
You said these are fine

105
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,910
I need several photos for posting on Facebook for multiple days.

106
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,880
She wouldn't believe it if I post one time.

107
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,930
She wouldn't believe even if you post several times

108
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:24,400
Why, people like me cannot look smart?

109
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:30,430
One is trying to be a nerd. Another is trying to be edgy.

110
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,260
I don't get it.

111
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:34,170
You have to play your part, too.

112
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,210
Play what part?

113
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:39,190
Now Namkhaeng completely trusts me.

114
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,210
I'm helping her transform into Coach Mai.

115
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:45,140
You have to pretend to like Namkhaeng.

116
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,840
But this plan should not be too effective.

117
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,120
What does 'too effective' mean?

118
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,410
You pretend to like Namkhaeng.

119
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,650
She will think that my help actually works.

120
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,410
But you must tell her that you're already with Coach Mai

121
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,380
Me and Coach Mai?

122
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,670
She wouldn't believe it.

123
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,530
Play along. I'll handle that part.

124
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:16,240
When she is heartbroken, that's when I come in.

125
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,240
If you like her, just tell her.

126
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,570
It's simple. You don't need a plan.

127
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,570
I do need a plan.

128
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,910
Have you ever crushed on someone who's not interested in you?

129
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,600
I don't know.

130
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:44,230
A nerd like you wouldn't know.

131
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,400
You can't make someone like you, but you can manipulate them.

132
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,220
You'll see.

133
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,630
Take more photos.

134
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:01,900
Is it okay?

135
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,570
What are you looking at?

136
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:10,260
Cat!

137
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,290
What is his name?

138
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,290
Whiskas.

139
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,380
That one?

140
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,840
This one is called Kanomtan.

141
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,720
Do you know all the cats on campus?

142
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,720
I can't possibly.

143
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,260
I only know the ones I meet often.

144
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,980
I name them so I have something to call them by.

145
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,310
Whiskas,

146
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:32,120
do you want to play with me?

147
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,050
Do you come here often?

148
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,140
well...

149
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:41,720
Or do you visit the guys on your list?

150
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,760
What do you take me for?

151
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:50,980
I was just kidding. I know you're not like that.

152
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,060
You speak like you know me well.

153
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,720
Well enough to know that you like to build your image.

154
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,740
What do you mean?

155
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:09,450
You want others to see you as bitchy

156
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,140
when in fact

157
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:16,050
you're nice and kind and adorable.

158
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,530
You're not shy when you said that?

159
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:22,740
Don't bring it up.

160
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:28,050
Cute? How about this one? Is he cute?

161
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:32,030
I haven't seen you this happy in a long time.

162
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,070
Ever since you broke up with your first girlfriend,

163
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,850
you haven't been over the moon like this.

164
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:46,230
Mai.

165
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:49,330
Mai...?

166
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,120
Coach, sawasdee kha.

167
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,580
I told you not to 'wai' me.

168
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,770
Do you know each other?

169
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:01,810
How can I not know someone special like Wan?

170
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,020
Coach, what are you doing here?

171
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,240
I'm just checking out the dorm.

172
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,100
So quick to send me away.

173
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,760
Why, are you afraid I tell Wan about your ex?

174
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,400
Don't give Wan the wrong idea

175
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,460
I agree.

176
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:32,020
Let's tell her the truth.

177
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:37,000
So Wan will have the right idea.

178
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:45,330
Wan, I'll take Coach to inspect the dorm

179
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:46,670
I'll call you.

180
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,500
Let's talk.

181
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,150
You're hurting me.

182
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,500
What the hell are you doing?

183
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,820
Why didn't you tell Wan what we are?

184
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,620
You're not someone for me.

185
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:09,100
You're just a coach for the swimming club.

186
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,260
That's it.

187
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:14,870
You're too afraid to tell Wan that she's not the only one for you.

188
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,430
Let me go. What are you talking about?

189
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,380
The thing between us ended a long time ago,

190
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,310
so long that I couldn't even remember.

191
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,710
But I've changed. I've come back for you.

192
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,900
What do I have to do to make you believe that I've changed?

193
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:36,170
Mai, fine, I know that you've changed.

194
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,830
But I've changed as well.

195
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,860
I've grown up.

196
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,630
I'm wiser.

197
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,900
I'm wise enough to know who to love

198
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,330
Someone like Wan?

199
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,660
It's my business.

200
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,240
But definitely not you.

201
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:56,140
Then say it.

202
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,710
Say you don't have feelings for me.

203
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,810
What I think right now is

204
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,660
'when are you going to go away?'

205
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,200
Usually you are not that invested in a girl.

206
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:24,090
When someone I care about the most

207
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,120
side with the person I hate the most,

208
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,900
I've got nothing else to say.

209
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,680
Gotcha!

210
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,220
What?

211
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:03,360
You just left him a second ago? Miss him already?

212
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,200
I don't miss a guy like that.

213
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:09,300
Aom, what type of person do you think Min is?

214
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,590
I don't know. You would know better than me

215
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,510
You spend a lot of time with him.

216
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:21,010
First, he looked like he only cared about his looks,

217
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,630
and a pain in the ass.

218
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,000
Now...

219
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,080
What about now?

220
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,390
Is he being nice to me because he has a hidden agenda?

221
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,190
What kind of hidden agenda?

222
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,060
You're not messing with the swimming team anymore.

223
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,180
You're right.

224
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,920
Or does he like you?

225
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,800
I'm not talking to you anymore. Go away.

226
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,670
Losing – not in my dictionary.

227
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,280
Waii, where are you?

228
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,590
Sung, have you seen Waii?

229
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,980
No, is there something wrong?

230
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:34,970
No.

231
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,030
Thanks.

232
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,530
Where are you off to so early?

233
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:02,830
Class.

234
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:05,570
Where is Kluay?

235
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:08,470
He's taking a dump in the bathroom.

236
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,420
Can you sign my name in this morning class?

237
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,900
Are you skipping?

238
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,560
I have to go to the pool.

239
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,180
To see Coach Mai again?

240
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,660
Usually you are not that invested in a girl.

241
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,140
And now you're skipping class, ditching your friends.

242
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,290
What the hell?

243
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,560
No.

244
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,130
You come to your senses?

245
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,810
I'm not going to see Coach Mai.

246
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:42,590
I'm getting my bicycle at the pool.

247
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,220
That's why I'm going to be late.

248
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,160
You are not...?

249
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,660
No. Here's the thing.

250
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:53,280
I plan to take my best friend to a birthday treat, okay?

251
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,070
You just made that up, right?

252
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,760
Hell no, I've planned it all along.

253
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,430
Okay, I'm taking off. I have an early class.

254
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,050
I'll see you soon.

255
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,400
Don't forget to sign my name.

256
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,340
Fine. Don't take too long.

257
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,590
Go, I'm going to sleep some more.

258
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:30,030
Are you up? Come see me at the pool.

259
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,640
Where are you, Namkhaeng. I'm at the pool.

260
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,850
Okay, I'll see you soon. Hurry along.

261
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,720
Looking forward to seeing Namkhaeng in her new look.

262
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:58,840
Kluay, what are you doing here?

263
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,640
Yeah, what are we doing here?

264
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,910
I want to see.

265
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:04,290
Have you asked me if I want to see as well?

266
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,160
I'm leaving

267
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,640
Wait, where are you going?

268
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:16,090
Why are you taking Achi with you everywhere?

269
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,480
That's what I like.

270
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:20,470
Huh?

271
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,640
Why are you shocked?

272
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:29,090
I like taking him around as my servant. Don't be so shocked.

273
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,240
Why are you spooked many times in a row?

274
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,420
Yeah, why do you look so shocked?

275
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,160
Waii,

276
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,280
where have you been?

277
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:57,050
You didn't reply to my texts or answer my calls.

278
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,910
I've been looking for you all over the campus.

279
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,550
You didn't tell Apo?

280
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,160
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

281
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:09,170
Okay,

282
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,530
bye.

283
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:24,610
Can you be reasonable for once?

284
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,700
Who is the unreasonable one?

285
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:33,720
Just a few words with him and you're on his side?

286
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,590
Just a few words with him and I'm on his side?

287
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:45,260
You're defending him. What's that?

288
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:52,170
When someone I care about the most

289
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,850
side with the person I hate the most,

290
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,660
I've got nothing else to say.

291
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:21,790
What are you laughing at?

292
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,900
I'm copying Coach Mai, can't you see?

293
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,660
Yes, you are copying her,

294
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,970
but you can't quite pull it off.

295
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:29,410
If you want to be edgy

296
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,580
do it your own way.

297
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:37,690
See? This is way cuter.

298
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,410
Shit!

299
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:44,140
I never knew you had the skill to do a makeover.

300
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:47,640
I just know how cute she is and translate it.

301
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,380
If we're not like sisters,

302
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,520
I thought you had the hots for me.

303
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:56,350
A tomboy has her strengths.

304
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,450
She knows women well, and can flirt like a guy.

305
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:00,510
Kluay!

306
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,030
You didn't get me

307
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:04,780
Now I can compete with Coach Mai, right?

308
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:15,930
Namkhaneg, what theme is your outfit today.

309
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:17,530
Coach Mai.

310
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,860
Coach Mai? Not quite.

311
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,570
You don't have her boobs.

312
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:24,450
I'm going to see Coach Mai.

313
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,450
Bigger size.

314
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,210
Different cups.

315
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:31,990
No, different styles.

316
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,050
I'm going home

317
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:34,640
Wait, Namkhaeng.

318
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,260
Don't take this seriously.

319
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:39,000
Remember you have transformed.

320
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,340
You look so cute and stunning.

321
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:45,830
Hope P'Fah will see this as well.

322
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:47,780
Pan,

323
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,140
sorry I'm late.

324
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:58,940
It's cool. Namkhaeng just got here.

325
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:01,450
You don't recognize her, do you?

326
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,160
She looks so cute, right?

327
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:06,520
I'm a woman now, P'Fah.

328
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:09,490
Your pants look nice.

329
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:13,020
Pan, let's go or we'll be late.

330
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:14,960
Come on.

331
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,370
I'll be back.

332
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,840
All dressed up but didn't get the guy

333
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:32,830
You know why?

334
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,740
She loves you, that's why.

335
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,580
You are not a sissy.

336
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:38,810
You just date one.

337
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,310
Min probably wants me to resign.

338
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,350
Do you want to give up like that?

339
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:06,460
It's not like I have a choice.

340
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,810
Of course, you do.

341
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:12,770
All the things you do for him...

342
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:15,980
If he knows, he will come back to you.

343
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,260
Put, do you like me?

344
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,500
Why did you ask me that?

345
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:29,800
You've been helping me getting back with Min.

346
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,480
I like you.

347
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,870
You are determined.

348
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:39,060
If you want something, you will get it.

349
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,500
All you want is Min.

350
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,270
How can I undermine that?

351
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:01,190
If only Min felt the same way.

352
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:04,150
Make him.

353
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,050
Let's go.

354
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,820
Where are we going?

355
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,130
Just come.

356
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,620
What are you doing?

357
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,610
Let me have this one.

358
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,390
Why didn't you buy it yourself?

359
00:28:58,610 --> 00:28:59,730
I meant Coach Mai

360
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,610
Why did you ask me?

361
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,670
You know about us?

362
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:15,950
Can I have this one?

363
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,660
You didn't have to ask me.

364
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,120
Do whatever you want.

365
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,000
Shit, how can you feel nothing?

366
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:26,790
She loves you deeply.

367
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:32,230
Don't talk about things you don't know

368
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,870
You're the one who don't know shit.

369
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:37,890
She didn't come to you because she got dumped.

370
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,580
She left him for you

371
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,660
even though she didn't know if you still loved her.

372
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,410
She came back anyway.

373
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,160
You know why?

374
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:50,490
She loves you, that's why.

375
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,100
Did she tell you to talk to me?

376
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:55,150
Put.

377
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:00,820
No, she didn't.

378
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:06,660
I did this on my own,

379
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:09,050
and you should listen.

380
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:35,290
Want some?

381
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,290
I'm taking off.

382
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,610
Where are you going?

383
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:45,040
I'm late for class.

384
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,500
Why don't you have a shower before leaving?

385
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:48,270
You're sweating bullets.

386
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,840
No, I don't have clean clothes.

387
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,980
Yes. I can lend you my shirt.

388
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:00,110
Why are you so caring all of the sudden?

389
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,790
You're acting like a dad.

390
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:07,230
Do you want me to be your daddy?

391
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,610
Let me go.

392
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,020
Kluay.

393
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,050
What's up, dude?

394
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,690
Long time no see. You've changed.

395
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,740
Yeah? More handsome or more muscular?

396
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:22,200
I mean your orientation.

397
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:24,550
Don't be so rough, honey.

398
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,730
This is my friend. Don't be ridiculous

399
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:33,750
Just kidding. You are not a sissy.

400
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:35,850
You just date one.

401
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:37,850
You son of a bitch.

402
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,910
Kluay dates a sissy.

403
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,260
This is bullshit.

404
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,200
Are you guys really university students?

405
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,490
I'll take a shower here.

406
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,380
Go to class.

407
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:45,330
Sorry to disturb you.

408
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:50,290
Is it true what Put said?

409
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,200
You don't care about me anyway.

410
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:56,910
Is it true or not?

411
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,180
Do you remember?

412
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:06,570
On the day we got together,

413
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,840
you said you would never let me go

414
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:11,890
I couldn't keep my promise.

415
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,550
No, you did.

416
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:16,010
Because I cannot let you go.

417
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:22,430
I miss you so much.

418
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,760
Mai,

419
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:29,810
you know what?

420
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:34,690
After we broke up, I couldn't imagine loving someone else.

421
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:40,490
I gave you all my love.

422
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:51,910
Mai.

423
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:01,280
And you ruined it with your own hands.

424
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:05,610
It frigging hurt.

425
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,230
I learned my lessons.

426
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:11,080
What about Wan?

427
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:19,760
If I ruined all your feelings, why do you have feelings for Wan?

428
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:27,070
The feelings I have for Wan are real.

429
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:33,480
What I have for you is infatuation, excitement and thrill.

430
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:36,720
Bullshit.

431
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:41,130
It feels so good not having you in my life.

432
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:43,340
I should have done it sooner

433
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:44,210
Min!

434
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:45,690
Min!

435
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:24,010
What the hell? You said you'd be here a while ago.

436
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,600
I'm so sorry. I...

437
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,580
If you're not going to buy me lunch, it's fine.

438
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,250
Just tell me.

439
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:34,980
No, I planned to take you out, but Mai

440
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,080
What now?

441
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,720
What's with Mai again?

442
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:08,410
The reason she wants to spend time with you

443
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,140
is the same reason you wants to spend time with P'Fah

444
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:13,230
This is not your place.

445
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:15,340
Do I need to practice late with you and Apo?

446
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,540
I practice alone.

447
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,900
I don't see you go home with P'Fah anymore

448
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,340
I'm meeting P'Pan today.

449
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:43,130
What? Why?

450
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:46,220
You do everything with P'Pan now.

451
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,860
So? She's helping me with P'Fah.

452
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,940
Are you sure?

453
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,290
About what?

454
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:55,580
That she really wants to help you.

455
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,920
Or she may just want an excuse to be with you.

456
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,330
Why would she do that? Don't be ridiculous.

457
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,500
They say women are more perceptive to this kind of thing?

458
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,790
Are you sure you're a woman?

459
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:08,290
What the hell?

460
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:11,720
The reason she wants to spend time with you

461
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,690
is the same reason you wants to spend time with P'Fah.

462
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,970
How so? I like P'Fah.

463
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:19,860
Come to your senses.

464
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:27,530
Come to your senses, Namkhaeng.

465
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,650
Let's have a meeting.

466
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:41,770
Let's have a meeting.

467
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,780
Hey!

468
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,470
let's have a meeting.

469
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,580
Let's do this.Fah, where have you been?

470
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:53,480
Why didn't you stick to the plan?

471
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,200
Let's do this.

472
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:01,090
Pretend to like Namkhaeng, starting now.

473
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:03,390
Tomboy, let's have a meeting.

474
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:05,730
Take a seat.

475
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,150
I'm hanging up.

476
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,920
Where is Apo?

477
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:16,000
How am I supposed to know?

478
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:17,860
I'm here.

479
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:22,720
Let's start our meeting.

480
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:29,780
Wait, Coach Mai is out of reach. Don't know where she is.

481
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,950
Why don't you go out and track her down?

482
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,380
I'm trying to.

483
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:37,810
Enough. Let's focus on the important thing here.

484
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:40,910
The Inter-U Games is approaching.

485
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:44,130
Although it may not be as high profile as the District Games

486
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:46,410
we cannot lose this one.

487
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,120
Here's your practice schedule.

488
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,300
Whoa.

489
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,460
What?

490
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:57,590
So, please be requested to follow your schedule strictly.

491
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,980
Do I need to practice late with you and Apo?

492
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,650
I practice alone.

493
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:09,750
All right. See you tonight.

494
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:02,030
You can really slap someone despite being so small.

495
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:03,950
Do you want the other cheek to be slapped, too?

496
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,190
That's enough.

497
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:05,200
Why would you come up here?
That's enough.

498
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,950
Why would you come up here?

499
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,400
I told you that you can call me to meet you downstairs.

500
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:13,180
If I had, I wouldn't have seen you in...

501
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:16,370
What?

502
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:19,060
Stop or I'll stab you.

503
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:21,750
That's why I didn't want you to come up?

504
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:23,790
Do you know what 'personal space' means?

505
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,740
I do.

506
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:28,060
How far would you let me in?

507
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:31,620
Downstairs.

508
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:38,310
What about your heart space?

509
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,950
What are you talking about?

510
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,750
Do you forget to take your meds or something?

511
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:47,240
Well, I feel like talking cheesy when I'm with you.

512
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:52,530
Hey, the other day...

513
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,980
Come to the pool now.

514
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:59,180
I need to be at the pool now.

515
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,840
Something's up.

516
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:04,130
The other day... I'll hear the rest later. See you.

517
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,740
Go that way.

518
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:07,500
Sorry.

519
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,510
What the hell is this?

520
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,060
Who is the asshole behind this?

521
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:25,110
That one.

522
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:29,370
Let's go in the pool. Come on.

523
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,600
Come on. Come on.

524
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,340
Come here. Come down here.

525
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:48,950
Let me go.

526
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:49,700
Come.

527
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,450
What are hell are you doing?

528
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,370
Getting away from you.

529
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:04,560
And you have to do it here?

530
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:08,970
Why? My pool, my place. What's the matter?

531
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:14,450
No, this is not your place.

532
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:20,480
Leave this club before everybody finds out who you really are.

533
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:23,180
Before I hate you even more.

534
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,770
Guys, the party here is over.

535
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:38,210
Please continue the rest of your night in the pub.

536
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:39,720
Please.

537
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:45,330
Didn't you hear that? This area belongs to the swimming club.

538
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,310
Go away!

539
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,920
Guys, let's clear this up.

540
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,280
For the trash.

541
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,130
Let me help.

542
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:24,420
Do you just take things from other people?

543
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:30,020
Come on, Kluay. It's a trash bag.

544
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:32,070
You can have mine.

545
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:43,710
Can anyone call Fah?

546
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:46,890
I don't know where he is.

547
00:43:56,330 --> 00:43:57,940
So tired.

548
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,540
Wake up.

549
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:22,560
Shut up. I'm trying to sleep here

550
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,890
Wake up. Now

551
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:28,300
Shit.

552
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,890
It's the Rector.

553
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,770
I apologize for our behavior.

554
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:36,210
What are you doing sleeping by the pool?

555
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:38,130
Didn't you sleep last night?

556
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:39,620
Did you practice until morning?

557
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:41,450
No, we just...

558
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:45,970
Today is our big cleaning day

559
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:47,620
We came here very early.

560
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:48,570
So we took a quick nap.

561
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:50,040
Oh yeah?

562
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:55,690
You also cleaned up the mess from the party last night in the process?

563
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,740
Take a look.

564
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:07,310
It was a fun party, wasn't it?

565
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:21,210
"We want to do many things that are too late to do."
