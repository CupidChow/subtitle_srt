1
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,360
Long time no see.

2
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,439
You thought I was Apo or something?

3
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:20,359
You're getting a little bit too chummy with him.

4
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm not a restaurant that you can change when you're bored.

5
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,159
Yeah, you found your new restaurant, didn't you?

6
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:27,699
Are you Wan?

7
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,400
Who do you think you are?

8
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:32,179
What have you done, boy?

9
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:33,219
Where is Waii?

10
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,280
My name is Mai.

11
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,300
The new coach of the swimming club.

12
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,080
Don't ‘wai' me.

13
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:52,840
I have something to consult with you.

14
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,620
This is regarding Min

15
00:02:57,099 --> 00:02:58,659
Are you with Min?

16
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,280
No, that clip is not...

17
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,659
Do you like him?

18
00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:10,219
You don't need to answer.

19
00:03:10,219 --> 00:03:14,500
The point is Min likes you very much.

20
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,740
I don't want him to lose focus in the competition.

21
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:26,179
I hope you understand my point.

22
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:31,319
A guy like Min doesn't get sensitive about this stuff.

23
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,799
He's the kind of guy who can't lose.

24
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:37,099
He won't stop until he gets what he wants.

25
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,840
Like when he plays a game, he means business.

26
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:47,719
But I'm not saying that you are a game to him.

27
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,580
You get me, right?

28
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,860
Our conversation here should be kept between us

29
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,300
See you.

30
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,560
You won't have to tie your shoes ever again.

31
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,000
Will you run with me for the rest of your life?

32
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,700
That didn't startle you at all?

33
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:18,339
Of course, it did.

34
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:21,219
And that's your reaction?

35
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,720
Did you expect me to scream or something?

36
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:30,300
That'd be great. Try it.

37
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:38,939
Where's Fay?

38
00:05:40,819 --> 00:05:43,139
How did you know that I was with Fay?

39
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,860
Is that why you didn't come to practice?

40
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:52,920
I didn't know there's a practice session

41
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,780
Don't lie if you're bad at it.

42
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,379
I'm sorry.

43
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,900
Bipolar much? Sorry for what?

44
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:11,899
I apologize for Fay's behalf

45
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,600
I know my girlfriend well

46
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:17,179
She must have told you not to go to practice.

47
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:19,540
Don't worry about that.

48
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,120
I'll make up for it.

49
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,980
If you do a make-up session, I'll have to go, too.

50
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,120
Why, it's my practice.

51
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:31,500
I want to be with you.

52
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,660
So that I can look out for your techniques

53
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:42,839
You cannot beat me.

54
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,819
Sure.

55
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,819
What's up with you?

56
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,439
Hey.

57
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,439
Hey

58
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,180
Sulk much?

59
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:18,439
Let's feast on the pork barbecue.

60
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,699
Our friends are waiting.

61
00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:25,879
Hey!

62
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,720
Don't puke on me.

63
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,460
Guys, I have to go. I can't eat anymore.

64
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,380
Get home safe.

65
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:01,439
Bye, dude.

66
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,700
Bye.

67
00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:06,899
Kluay, can I borrow your mobile?

68
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:17,279
Guys, I'll be back.

69
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,980
Where's she going?

70
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,620
You disappeared for a while. Where did you go?

71
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,279
I saw that we're running out of drinks,

72
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,720
so I went out and bought some.

73
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,199
Give me.

74
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:41,720
Yeah, give me.

75
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:44,919
Can I have one?

76
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:50,119
Does this mean that the power-crazed Wan will leave us alone?

77
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,700
That's right.

78
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:53,740
That's good.

79
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,879
Actually, Wan is not all bad.

80
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,820
Somebody is defending his girl.

81
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,240
Enough, Kluay.

82
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,220
Min did us a favor.

83
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:11,819
A favor? He just talked to his girlfriend

84
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,519
A pillow talk, in fact.

85
00:09:38,299 --> 00:09:40,519
I'm tired. I'm going to crash out now.

86
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,919
What are you doing here?

87
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,700
Are you practicing on your own?

88
00:10:06,379 --> 00:10:07,360
Have you seen Kluay?

89
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,300
He told me to come here, but there's no sign of him.

90
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,720
He's not coming.

91
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,600
What?

92
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:17,159
I'm the one who told you to come here.

93
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:19,720
What the hell are you up to?

94
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:24,860
I want to apologize.

95
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,080
Huh?

96
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,380
About that.

97
00:10:34,179 --> 00:10:35,359
That...

98
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:39,799
And that's why you're in the pool now?

99
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,180
What else do you want me to do to redeem myself?

100
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:48,279
You're in the water, but I actually drowned.

101
00:10:49,059 --> 00:10:50,659
Do you think that they're the same?

102
00:10:50,659 --> 00:10:53,019
What can I do? I can swim

103
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,280
I'm sorry.

104
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,300
You have a conscience after all.

105
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,639
Of course.

106
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,440
You must be cold

107
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,039
You're not mad anymore, are you?

108
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,419
Pan!

109
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:13,319
I'm sorry.

110
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:15,539
No worries.

111
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,919
Since you're not mad at me, can you do me a favor?

112
00:12:32,379 --> 00:12:35,820
There you go. You're not remorseful at all, are you?

113
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:37,360
Of course, I am

114
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,200
But I wanted to make up with you because I need your help.

115
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,700
Please, please, please.

116
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:47,859
Please.

117
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,379
Another favor again

118
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:50,519
Please.

119
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:53,759
No

120
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:55,779
Will you help me or not?

121
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,759
Want to get in the pool?

122
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:00,399
Yes, I'll help. Let me go.

123
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,560
You don't need to be so forceful.

124
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:08,360
Now you're wet.

125
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,700
It's because of you.

126
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,780
Are you okay?

127
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,519
Why are you sitting here alone?

128
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,200
It's crowded in the room.

129
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,680
I just need some air where it's quiet.

130
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,500
But this is too quiet.

131
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,639
Let's go back to the room.

132
00:14:13,539 --> 00:14:15,139
It's Min, right?

133
00:14:17,299 --> 00:14:20,839
Did it taste nice when you were busy doing it in the classroom?

134
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:08,219
How long were you together?

135
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:21,279
Since Min was a junior in high school and I was a senior in college

136
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:27,479
That was quite a long time.

137
00:15:28,379 --> 00:15:30,379
It didn't end well?

138
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:42,320
I met someone new. I was an asshole.

139
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,539
Why are you here feeling sad?

140
00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:54,979
Because I still love him.

141
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:04,060
Min was very young back then.

142
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,519
He couldn't stay away from me, like a kid with a new toy.

143
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:14,079
He was so young that I needed someone else

144
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,879
Now I know that I wasn't a new toy for him.

145
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:30,539
He loved me and I loved him.

146
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,460
It was as simple as that.

147
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:41,600
Why did I have to complicate things?

148
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,659
So you came back.

149
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,580
But he didn't want me.

150
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:37,339
An event ambassador together with a representative from another university.

151
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,359
It's just a photoshoot.

152
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:40,240
I won't do it.

153
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:56,230
I'll walk you to your place.

154
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:58,940
No need.

155
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,120
It's dangerous.

156
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,780
I'm a grown up man. I can take care of myself

157
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,990
Will you let me walk you home or not?

158
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,950
Do Not Walk Me Home.

159
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:21,040
Fine. If you won't let me, I'll kiss you.

160
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:26,070
You? You're all talk. You won't dare to do it.

161
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:44,730
Eww... what the hell?

162
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,840
Your breath smells.

163
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,590
I'm leaving.

164
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,820
What has he eaten?

165
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:20,960
Kluay,

166
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:22,910
Sung,

167
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,920
Put.

168
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:29,920
You didn't have any sleep last night, did you?

169
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:30,860
Waii,

170
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,980
all this time that we've been friends,

171
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,280
I've never asked you for anything.

172
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:39,090
Yes, you have many times.

173
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:44,200
Add one more. Can we skip practice today?

174
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:46,420
Please.

175
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,680
Enough, guys.

176
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,940
Ask the one who set this up.

177
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,690
Who?

178
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:58,890
Everyone, get it line.

179
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:10,030
Coach, we hung out together last night.

180
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,950
Aren't you feel tired?

181
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:15,090
Can we change the time?

182
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,420
I didn't set up this meeting.

183
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,450
Who did?

184
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,040
Everyone, attention.

185
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,640
Sawasdee ka.

186
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,040
At ease.

187
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:33,350
The Rector has something to talk to you.

188
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,320
I haven't been in this area for a while.

189
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,950
When I saw the swimming club, I just wanted to stop by.

190
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:43,070
I have a request for your club about the inter-uni sports.

191
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,540
I want the club to promote this event.

192
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:55,410
We'll use the pool as a photo shoot setting for the poster.

193
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,790
And...

194
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,390
I would like to request the captain to be an event ambassador

195
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:09,540
together with a representative from another university.

196
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,110
An ambassador?

197
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,730
No need to panic.

198
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,410
He's not a stranger.

199
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:34,130
The student body feels that Kan is a sports celebrity

200
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,610
who has been in the spotlight.

201
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:40,530
Plus, he used to be a member of this club

202
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:43,460
This should be easy.

203
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:46,110
Please take care of this, Waii.

204
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:47,890
Yes, sir.

205
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:06,740
Waii, where are you going?

206
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:11,790
I'm not going to do a photo shoot

207
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,910
Captain, are you going to leave us high and dry?

208
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:21,810
Didn't you hear what the Rector said?

209
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,540
He wanted the Captain to do this.

210
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,270
Waii, please hear me out

211
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:29,570
I thank you for your assistance with this thing.

212
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:30,880
It's not like that.

213
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:34,980
I did do something to help, but I had no idea how it turned out like this

214
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,260
Ask Wan. She must know.

215
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,540
Wan has nothing to do with this.

216
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,290
How can you be sure?

217
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,760
Are you with the club or the student body?

218
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,680
It's just a photoshoot.

219
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,060
I won't do it.

220
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,610
Waii, be reasonable.

221
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:54,350
Our club will not follow someone else's rules,

222
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:56,270
especially the student body.

223
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:58,230
Okay, I'll take care of this.

224
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:03,120
Don't. If you care about this club, stop being involved with the student body.

225
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,900
Especially Wan.

226
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,520
Waii! Waii!

227
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,670
Really?

228
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:40,650
Yes.

229
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,530
That coach wears something like this, right?

230
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:45,540
Oh, you want to be her.

231
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:47,920
Are you serious?

232
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:51,010
P'Fah likes it like this.

233
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,110
But I don't.

234
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:58,620
Hmm?

235
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,740
I mean...

236
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:06,350
I don't like when you dress up like this.

237
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:08,170
Namkhaeng,

238
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:12,290
yesterday when you said ...

239
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:15,420
you're my girlfriend,

240
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:20,530
what's that about really?

241
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,880
Kan, my man. I missed you.

242
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,060
Missed you, too. Doing all right?

243
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:38,440
Great.

244
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,880
Fine, but our club has had our fair share of trouble

245
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,590
How have you been?

246
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:46,610
I check out your Facebook page and all I see is groupies.

247
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,770
I don't even dare to comment.

248
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,440
You're overexaggerating.

249
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,520
Since you're here, we should take a photo together.

250
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:58,200
You want a photo with Kan to attract likes.

251
00:24:58,210 --> 00:24:59,670
Of course.

252
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,040
I'll take a photo for you.

253
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,120
I'm in the photo.

254
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,230
Take a good one.

255
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,030
Clear and crisp.

256
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,240
One, two, three.

257
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,360
Great.

258
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,700
This is what a true friend is for.

259
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,380
Or a shitty friend.

260
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:21,240
Sung, you want some of this?

261
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,740
Waii won't do it, right?

262
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,060
Umm

263
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,200
How long have you known about this photoshoot?

264
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:37,060
They contacted me a while ago.

265
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:39,120
But they just changed the promotion concept.

266
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,080
Do you know whose idea is this?

267
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:45,090
It's mine.

268
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,760
Stop!

269
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:55,850
You're such a prankster

270
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,820
You know Kluay's Facebook's password, don't you?

271
00:25:58,830 --> 00:25:59,880
Yes.

272
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:03,420
Let's post a fake status update.

273
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,180
How about...

274
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:11,690
"Practiced swimming earlier. Couldn't stop farting. Bubbles all over the pool.

275
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:14,110
The secret is out!"

276
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,640
Let's put some hashtags.

277
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,590
Ooh, hashtags.

278
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:18,910
Let's do #cantfacefriends

279
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:21,610
#cantfacecoachmai

280
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,040
Coach Mai.

281
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,620
Why?

282
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,050
Coach Mai this, Coach Mai that.

283
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,470
It's a little much.

284
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:36,050
I just want to pull a prank on Kluay.

285
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:37,450
Don't deny it.

286
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:40,360
You're all about Coach Mai now.

287
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:44,850
This is Coach Mai, too?

288
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:47,620
Yes, she calls me.

289
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:51,430
And you. She calls everyone.

290
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:52,280
Let's go

291
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:53,180
Me, too?

292
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:54,260
Yes, come.

293
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:58,180
The student body contacted me about the press conference.

294
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:00,520
They wanted me to help promote the event

295
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:03,140
That's when I proposed to involve the swimming club.

296
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:07,780
Do you know that the club is having problems with the university.

297
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,030
I do.

298
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:12,510
Do you want us to have more problems?

299
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:16,910
Why don't you think of this as a way to help the club?

300
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:21,610
If this event turns out well, it will be good for the club.

301
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,900
What about Waii?

302
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,540
It's his problem.

303
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:30,690
If you know Waii won't follow along, why do it?

304
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,270
I'll make him.

305
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:35,210
It's time for him to face the problem

306
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,300
Everybody is running away from problems.

307
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,320
If you mean Coach Tee, yes he is.

308
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:46,240
But these two won't be able to for long.

309
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,680
What are you up to?

310
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,500
You'll see.

311
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:57,310
But now, let's start with getting Waii here

312
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:10,980
Are you saying this is the poster?

313
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,330
Who's shooting what?

314
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:14,780
They're shooting photos at the pool now.

315
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:17,520
If the shooting won't start in 10 minutes, I'm leaving.

316
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:19,690
Why can't we just stay like this forever?

317
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,140
You're late.

318
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:43,590
Didn't Coach Mai call us for a meeting?

319
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:48,010
Nothing is as important as what I'm about to ask.

320
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,090
Namkhaeng.

321
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:54,330
Smart. Fit to be the brain of the club.

322
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:57,110
There's only one important thing for you.

323
00:28:58,010 --> 00:28:59,750
What is it that you want my help with?

324
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:09,040
Teach me to be you.

325
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,390
To be me?

326
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,280
Will you or won't you?

327
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,340
You sneaked up on me again.

328
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,630
Someone might see you.

329
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:43,330
What are you looking at?

330
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,420
Why are you acting like you've never seen this room before?

331
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,440
I wasn't paying attention the last time.

332
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,120
This time I am.

333
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,320
Is this you?

334
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,910
When was this? You've come so far

335
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,230
You're wearing glasses.

336
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:00,320
Go back the same way you came in.

337
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:02,190
I need to work.

338
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,320
The inter-u sports games.

339
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:11,330
You're still working on this shit?

340
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,340
I thought you're out.

341
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:15,290
I wasn't involved with the press conference.

342
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,010
But I can work on something else, like PR.

343
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:22,730
We cannot be on good terms, can we?

344
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,910
What are you saying?

345
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:28,970
Why do you have to involve the swimming team?

346
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:33,510
Your club has nothing to do with it.

347
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:36,930
Look, see the cats?

348
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:40,040
I want to work with the volunteering club,

349
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,470
and mobilize fund to save the cats.

350
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:42,670
Aren't they cute?

351
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,940
Are you saying this is the poster?

352
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:49,160
What they're shooting is totally different from what you just said.

353
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:52,000
Who's shooting what?

354
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,220
They're shooting photos at the pool now.

355
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:56,770
There are no cats involved.

356
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:21,950
You're here to get me to the set?

357
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:26,350
First I was.

358
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:28,750
Now I'm not.

359
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:30,770
Oi!

360
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,600
You're a grown man.

361
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,500
You're capable of coming to your senses.

362
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:49,330
What if I decide not to go.

363
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:52,230
Don't. I won't go either.

364
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:54,080
What if I go.

365
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,970
Then we'll go together.

366
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:18,880
All my life I've been told to do this and that.

367
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:24,790
Only you give me choices.

368
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:28,720
Really?

369
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,780
Come here.

370
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:32,210
You see through me.

371
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:37,600
Kan is the one who ruined everything,

372
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,300
and I'm told to be friends with him.

373
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:43,600
What are you going to do?

374
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,760
I don't know.

375
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:50,450
I don't want to see him.

376
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,490
Why can't we just stay like this forever?

377
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:58,630
Like what?

378
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:08,430
Just you and me.

379
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:15,900
Waii!

380
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,850
What are you doing here?

381
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,790
Everybody is looking for you.

382
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:23,630
Why are you looking for me?

383
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,930
You just left.

384
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,570
Kan doesn't have all day.

385
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:29,610
It's his problem.

386
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:30,810
It's our problem.

387
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:35,350
The Rector said if you don't do this, we'll be in trouble.

388
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,200
I need to sort this out.

389
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,780
Waii! Waii!

390
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,940
They must gather at the pool.

391
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:06,340
Wan, you didn't really know about the shoot, did you?

392
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:09,990
I didn't. How many times do I need to say it?

393
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,220
Yes.

394
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:16,550
What's up with you?

395
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:20,870
I'm happy that you didn't hide anything from me.

396
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:24,690
Come to think about it, why didn't Aom tell me about this?

397
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:28,080
Maybe it is very sudden.

398
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,230
She should tell me regardless.

399
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,550
True.

400
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,220
This is good, though.

401
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:40,490
It's the first time that you agree with the swimming club.

402
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:45,450
Your club is strange, though.

403
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:48,440
This is good for your publicity. Why don't you want it?

404
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:54,040
I don't know. Waii doesn't seem to want to work with the other guy.

405
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,460
His name is...

406
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,720
Kan.

407
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,280
Kan?

408
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,140
Yes.

409
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:06,850
Is he the one who used to be in the swimming club?

410
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,660
Why, do you know him?

411
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,680
Now I know why Aom didn't tell me about this

412
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,960
Namkhaeng wants to imitate someone whom you like.

413
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:28,100
I think I can imitate someone whom she likes.

414
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:34,190
And I like Coach Mai?

415
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,490
Don't ask.

416
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,440
Tell me something about you.

417
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:42,110
I wrote all the stuff about me in the diary that I gave you

418
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,510
It's not detailed.

419
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,520
Not detailed or you haven't read it.

420
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,070
Spill it.

421
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:49,930
Yeah.

422
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,640
Typical you.

423
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:56,910
I can't go through it. It's so long.

424
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:03,170
If you tell me, I'll see your action and I can copy you.

425
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,460
What should I tell?

426
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:12,090
Start with...

427
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,640
There.

428
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,600
The pool.

429
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,220
Come here.

430
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:25,710
You haven't even started.

431
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,930
It's started right here. Follow me.

432
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:32,370
Are you really going to tell a story?

433
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:41,520
Stop. Walk like a normal person.

434
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,020
You, walk like a normal person.

435
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,910
You don't walk like a normal person.

436
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:46,280
Don't argue with the teacher.

437
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,260
What teacher?

438
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,620
Don't be too cocky.

439
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:05,400
Guys! Give me some attention, will you?

440
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:10,170
Don't tell me I have to do that.

441
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:12,120
Are you a member of the club?

442
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,040
If you are, then you'll do it.

443
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:17,630
If I have to, so do you.

444
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:33,210
If the shooting won't start in 10 minutes, I'm leaving

445
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:35,730
Let's start it then.

446
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:38,990
Come here. Do some poses.

447
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,550
Practice your poses.

448
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:41,830
I'm ready.

449
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,410
Smile.

450
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,270
Waii.

451
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:51,490
Can I talk to Wan for a minute?

452
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,620
Talk about what?

453
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:00,340
Waii, Wan has nothing to do with this.

454
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:03,160
What did I tell you?

455
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,900
Wan didn't do it.

456
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:08,620
The poster wasn't supposed to be like this.

457
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:11,020
Do you expect me to believe it?

458
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,480
Waii.

459
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:15,310
Kan proposed this idea.

460
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:31,850
Everyone has high expectations on this project.

461
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,020
I messed it up.

462
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:38,690
Do you two have anything to tell me?

463
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:56,770
Waii isn't coming, is he?

464
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:07,900
Come on, photographing with us is more fun than with Waii.

465
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,610
The Rector will note that the captain is uncooperative.

466
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,040
Kan, what's up, man?

467
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:22,610
I'm sorry. I'm here to work. You guys, go play.

468
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:29,420
I'm sorry for my tardiness. Let's start the shoot.

469
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:39,110
Okay, now that we're ready, let's do it.

470
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:41,150
Waii, do you want to change your clothes?

471
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,240
Why?

472
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:45,220
Do you want to go in the pool in this outfit?

473
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,700
We'll go back to the original concept.

474
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,960
Is this a joke?

475
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,940
The joke is on you.

476
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:54,360
You can't just make any change that you feel like.

477
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:56,010
You should talk to the Rector.

478
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:03,010
I forgot. You're his pet.

479
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:06,400
Anything you propose to him will get green light.

480
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:09,910
Do we know each other?

481
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:11,970
You don't remember me?

482
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:22,010
Freshman year when you received an overseas scholarship.

483
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:30,580
Hope your cat shelter project will get approved.

484
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:37,090
P'Pop said that it should be because the Rector likes the proposal.

485
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:39,140
I just have to be interviewed for formality.

486
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:42,950
Calm down

487
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:47,200
The previous candidate is in there for a long time.

488
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,520
Is he submitting a proposal as well?

489
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,310
Good luck, Kan.

490
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:55,680
Thank you for support to the swimming club.

491
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,680
Win medals for us.

492
00:41:57,690 --> 00:41:59,280
Thank you.

493
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,300
What are you doing here?

494
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:12,510
I'm here to ask for funding

495
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:15,520
I'm from the volunteering club,

496
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,640
and I'm working on a cat shelter project

497
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:19,370
I see, come in.

498
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:29,100
It's okay. You'll get another opportunity next year

499
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:32,350
Everyone has high expectations on this project.

500
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:34,820
I messed it up.

501
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,340
Don't cry.

502
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:44,690
Do you think they will help us?

503
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:48,000
We're only asking for advice to do a presentation.

504
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,940
It should be fine.

505
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:52,550
Where are you going?

506
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:54,840
None of your business.

507
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,590
It's not my fault that we lost.

508
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:03,370
You lost or you didn't show up.

509
00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:05,460
You think I don't know?

510
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:11,630
The organizer sent me a letter saying you didn't show up.

511
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,630
What did you do with my dad then?

512
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:17,370
We thought the race was at a different time.

513
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:19,070
My dad is not like that.

514
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:22,410
Since you joined the team, my dad has made a lot of mistakes.

515
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:27,940
He's distracted, forgetful, and late

516
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:33,910
Seriously, do you two have anything to tell me?

517
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:36,340
Those are accidents.

518
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,300
I got the time wrong. It can happen.

519
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,970
This match was very important.

520
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:56,450
The club funded your ticket and application.

521
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:58,240
How did you screw up?

522
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,480
It's just the university's fund.

523
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,810
I can always apply for more. Don't take it too seriously.

524
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:19,350
The uni's fund was wasted, with no return.

525
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:22,200
But you didn't get told off or anything.

526
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:26,580
You remain the Rector's pet even when you're not a student here

527
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,120
I commend you

528
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:32,390
I didn't know that your project was canceled.

529
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:36,440
Now you know and you have a chance to set things right.

530
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:55,690
"Some people spend all their time learning about love. Some find love when they learn to love themselves."
