you were hanging upside down.

And

53
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,470
your legs were like this.

00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,320
Bai Qijia, you know sand painting.

Because even my parents
don't know about it,

Why?

61

Because even if I mention it,

62
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,600
it's useless.

In this universe,

67
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,320
there are many parallel worlds.

88
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,790

as long as I'm by your side.

94
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,000

Speak.

00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,110
What kind of girls do you like?

143
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:19,840
Why did you stop?

144
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,030
I'm taking a rest.

145
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,670
It's tiring to talk while carrying you.

146
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,520
What kind of girls

147

do you think I like?

148
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,350
She has to be smart.

149
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,550
Because if she isn't,

150
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:41,590
she won't understand you

151
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:42,760
and will be bullied by you.

152
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,550
Besides, she must be cheerful.

153
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,670
You're a quiet person,

154
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,880
if she's not talkative,

155
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,080
the two of you will be bored.

156
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,520
Most importantly, she must be pretty.

157
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,470
Why should she be pretty?

158
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:54,910
Because

159
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,400
pretty people get together.

160

Do you think I'm right?

I think we're lost.

165
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,320
Impossible.

you have no sense of direction.

172
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,030
.You were looking at the map

173
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,350
and you planned the route.

174
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,710
Why do I have no sense of direction?

175
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,000
I don't care.

176
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,320
What do we do now?

177
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,470
The scenic spot is closing soon.

178
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,030
I have many wishes to make.

179
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,280
It's okay.

180
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,520
You don't necessarily need
a wishing tree to make wishes.

181
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,470
Look.

182
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,080
The fireworks are so beautiful.

183
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,520
You don't necessarily need

184
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,910
a spiritual wishing tree to make wishes.

185
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,230
We're also lucky to be able

186
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,590
to see such beautiful fireworks.

187
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:04,960
Hurry, make a wish.

188
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,030
Would it work?

189
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,790
I'm done with my wishes.

190
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,840
I'm done with my wishes.

191
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,960
What did you wish for?

192
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,590
I wished

193
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,320

Nothing.

I won your painting trial lesson

about the law of attraction?

Why did you eavesdrop?

Breakfast from the canteen.

306
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:37,190
Breakfast from the canteen isn't good.

307

What day is today?

308

Did you buy them?

312

I'm quite lucky

to have guessed your taste.

314
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,000
Awesome.

315
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,070
If I don't eat now, I may faint.

316
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,110
Here, eat.

317
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,160
It's hot.

318
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,560
Eat slowly. Don't choke.

319
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,070
I'm so hungry that

320

everything tastes good to me.

Aren't you planning to share it with me?

322
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,710
I also haven't eaten anything

323

since last night.

324
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,070
These

325
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,230
are not enough for me.

326
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,640
Why don't you buy more in the canteen?

327
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,160
The canteen is closed.

328
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,000
In your heart,

329
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,230
I'm not as important as a dumpling.

330
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,880
You can have one dumpling.

331
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,760
It's better to be home.

332
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,760
I can eat anything I want.

333
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,310
When will I be discharged?

334
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,070
Take a good rest
so you can be discharged sooner.

335
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:09,190
I need my basic equipment
in the hospital.

336
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,520
Comics, doujinshi,

337
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,560
graphic tablets
and postcards from readers.

338
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,830

00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,040
I won't change the proposal anymore.

508
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,640
Take it or leave it.

509
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,160
I know that this cooperation

510
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,000
is very important to you

511
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,400
and Bubaiqi Plan.

512
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,800
But believe in me,

513
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:47,040
we'll have
a better cooperation chance next time,

514
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,160
okay?

515
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:49,470
Xuezhou.

516
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,920
You're awesome.

517
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:53,280
This is the real you.

518
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,190
You should know that the next one

519
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,430
will be better.

520
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:59,040
I'll work hard to be your money tree.

521
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,160
Just hide in my shade

522
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,190
while counting money, okay?

523
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,710
You promise?

524
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,680
Then you should

525
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,950
take good care
of yourself on my behalf, okay?

526
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,710
I'm counting on you
for the rest of my life.

527
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,830
Xuezhou.

528
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,400
Counting on me?

529
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:17,800
I'm not Tai Sui,
I can't be counted on forever.

530
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,110
Why are you talking nonsense?

531
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,640
Do you know what Tai Sui is?

532
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,800
Why are you always so outspoken?

533
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,950
Silly girl.

534
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:30,280
Here you go.

535
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:30,830
Your food.

536
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,590
Thank you.

537
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,950
This is the shop you meant?

538
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:39,800
I'm sorry.

539
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,560
I have work to be done.

540
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,350
I have no time to waste.

541
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,400
If you leave,
you've to pay 100 thousand yuan.

542
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,920
One hundred thousand yuan?

543
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,880
What do you mean?

544
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:53,040
That car belongs to my uncle.

545
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,430
He's a very petty person.

546
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,880
If he found out that you're responsible,

547
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,590
you would have to pay in full amount.

548
00:29:59,070 --> 00:29:59,760
However,

549
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,190
I told him a little lie.

550
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,110
I said I was the one who caused it,

551
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,430
so he didn't pursue the matter.

552
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,190
But I don't like to lie for no reason.

553
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:16,280
Besides,
I like to be friends with cartoonists.

554
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:18,310
If you agree to
accompany me for a few days,

555
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:19,430
I'll forgive you.

556
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,800
What do you mean?

557
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,350
Accompany you for a few days?

558
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,400
Accompany me to eat, drink and have fun.

559
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:31,040
I didn't mean that.

560
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,880
I'm really sorry.

561
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,830
I can't play games

562
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:38,880
with rich girls like you.

563
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,000
I'm serious.

564
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,070
Think about it.

565
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:47,830
Take it as the payment

566
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:49,000
for the scratches on the car.

567
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:50,230
Please.

568
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,680
If you leave,
you've to pay 100 thousand yuan.

569
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,710
One hundred thousand yuan.

570
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,110
One hundred thousand yuan.

571
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,680
One hundred thousand yuan.

572
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,880
Please take a seat.

573
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,160
What about this? I'll be fair.

574
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:16,310
Just accompany me for two days, okay?

575
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:17,710
I'll never bother you in the future.

576
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:52,310
Why aren't you talking?

577
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:55,350
You were sleeping. What should I say?

578
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,430
You knew I was pretending.

579
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,190
Why did you pretend then?

580
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,920
I...

581
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,640
What's going on?

582
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,160
Are you not feeling well?

583
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,040
I have something to talk to you.

584
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,760
I miscalculated. There's no star.

585
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,920
You took me out to watch the stars?

586
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,230
No.

587
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,000
I think stars

588
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,760
make the atmosphere
better for heart-to-heat talks.

589
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,230
Why don't we talk inside?

590
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:45,950
You're weak now.

591
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,190
You shouldn't catch a cold.

592
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,590
I get it.

593
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,800
Thank you, Dr. Bai,

594
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,520
for caring for this patient so much.

595
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,190
You're not a patient to me.

596
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:55,800
You are who you are.

597
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,350
The one and only.

598
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,070
Irreplaceable.

599
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,230
Dr. Bai, do you know?

600
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,560
In fact,

601
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,160
in the past years,

602
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:11,470
I tried my best
to live like a normal person.

603
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,590
However,

604
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:16,680
covering it up
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

605
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,400
Qin Ge.

606
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:28,760
I understand your concerns.

607
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,680
I also hope that you can trust me.

608
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,590
Give yourself to me with confidence.

609
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,110
Okay?

610
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,680
Dr. Bai.

611
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,280
Is such a person

612
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,430
worth being given to you?

613
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,430
Can such a person

614
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,710
spend her whole life with you?

615
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,000
I can.

616
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,430
I can't.

617
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:24,040
I can't accept myself like this.

618
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,280
Qin Ge.

619
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,760
I hope you can give us

620
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:36,320
more time.

621
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,910
I'll prove with practical actions

622
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,630
that I can.
