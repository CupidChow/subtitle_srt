00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:52,720
Thank you for the hard work.

20
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:54,720
I bought some snacks for you all.

21
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,760
This time,

22
00:01:55,839 --> 00:01:57,720
we managed to convince
Mr. Su from Qianye Film & TV

23
00:01:57,919 --> 00:01:59,799
to give us a chance to make corrections.

24
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,680
We only have one week to complete it,

25
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:05,320
but please finish your mission.

26
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:06,479
Can you do it?

27
00:02:06,839 --> 00:02:07,919
Yes!

28
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,279
What is our motto?

29
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,000
- No pain, no gain!
- No pain, no gain!

- All the best!
- All the best!

00:02:13,839 --> 00:02:14,640
Come on.

33
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:16,079
I want one too.

34
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,480
You can take that.
This is mine.

35
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:20,239
Give me one too.

36
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:22,280
-Thanks.
-I want one too.

37
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,560
-I want that one.
-I want that.

38
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,320
Min, I drew some characters.

39
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,239
Take a look.

40
00:02:34,359 --> 00:02:36,560
I don't think I'm qualified.

41
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,519
If you don't check them for me,

42
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:40,999
I must go to Miss Bai Qi.

43
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:43,680
And since she is so busy, she might...

44
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:45,599
Bring it here.

45
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,079
Alright.

46
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,480
Look.

47
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,480
The shadowing is done wrong.

48
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:02,120
This isn't the right angle either.

49
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:03,840
And the trace lines
are not precise enough.

50
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:04,599
And look,

51
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:06,920
the color here is too bright.

52
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,480
Make it lighter.

53
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,040
That makes the part less conspicuous.

54
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,439
Okay, noted!

55
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:13,480
Really?

56
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,439
Yes.

57
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,719
Get back to your work.

58
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,879
Okay, Min.

59
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:17,799
Hold on.

60
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:21,999
Please address me
as Chen Min in the office.

61
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,200
No. I'm calling you Min anyway.

62
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:25,960
Only I can call you that.

63
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,879
Look at this part.

64
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,840
The eyes are important
for the characters.

65
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:41,719
See?

66
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,519
This makes the character more lively.

67
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,040
Well, did you get it?

68
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:50,639
I'll pay attention to it, Miss Bai Qi.

69
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,079
It's going to look rough at first,

70
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:54,480
but practice makes perfect.

71
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,760
If you still can't get the hang of it,

72
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,359
refer to my previous drafts.

73
00:03:58,599 --> 00:03:59,719
Pay attention to how the lines

74
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,760
were drawn

75
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,599
to make

76
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:03,159
the presentation more lifelike.

77
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,079
Thanks, Miss Bai Qi.

78
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,999
Stop calling me that.

79
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,560
That makes me feel old.

80
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,280
What should I call you, then?

81
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,960
You may call me

82
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,159
Qin Ge?

83
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,599
Qin Ge?

84
00:04:18,999 --> 00:04:20,960
Is that a little too distant?

85
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,200
Yeah.

86
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:23,319
Well...

87
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:25,799
Qin Ge...

88
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,440
How about Bai Qi?

89
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,720
Too formal?

90
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:33,519
Maybe...

91
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,799
I could call you "Boss"?

92
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:38,840
Boss?

93
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:40,560
That's interesting.

94
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,960
That will do.

95
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,519
Alright.
From now on,

96
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:45,319
only I can call you that.

97
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:46,759
Alright.

98
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:49,759
Try saying it.

99
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:51,840
Boss.

100
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:53,440
Boss?

101
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,840
Boss!

102
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,120
I didn't know you could make coffee.

103
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,120
Of course.

104
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:15,519
Thanks.

105
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:28,000
Min.

106
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:30,000
Get some sleep
after you finish the coffee.

107
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,960
I'll take care of the rest for you.

108
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:34,160
No.

109
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:36,199
I must stay and help Qin Ge out.

110
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,440
When we worked over time,

111
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,319
I was always there for her.

112
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,120
We finished great undertakings together.

113
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:47,519
We shared memories of important moments.

114
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:51,079
But you must

115
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,280
take care of your health.

116
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,799
Miss Bai Qi wouldn't want the job

117
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,199
to take a toll on your body.

118
00:05:57,479 --> 00:05:58,639
It's not.

119
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,479
I'm not working hard enough.

120
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:03,319
This isn't enough for you?

121
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,639
Min, I'll be honest with you.

122
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,039
Miss Bai Qi has always been

123
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,000
a legendary comic artist in my eyes.

124
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:12,039
You've worked with her for years.

125
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:14,280
That's more than enough hard work.

126
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,880
But still,

127
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,720
I must ask.

128
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:21,639
With your competence,

129
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,199
you can surely

130
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:25,319
start your own independent studio.

131
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,160
Why are you willing to stay here?

132
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:28,600
Qin Ge

133
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,600
was my guide when I first stepped

134
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,600
into the field of comic.

135
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,239
She was a ray of light for me.

136
00:06:35,239 --> 00:06:37,120
She helped me envision my future.

137
00:06:37,799 --> 00:06:40,280
As long as I follow this light,

138
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,239
I will never be lost.

139
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,720
You will understand what I mean

140
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,039
after spending more time with her.

141
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,000
But does she know?

142
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,880
That doesn't matter.

143
00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:53,680
This is my own opinion.

144
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,639
I will follow through with this path.

145
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,880
I believe

146
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,560
I'm the one

147
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,680
who will be with her till the end.

148
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,280
Thanks for your coffee.

149
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,359
It's nice.

150
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,239
Min, I'm so nervous.

151
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:51,799
My palms are covered in sweat.

152
00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:56,199
Calm down.

153
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,919
We'll know the result soon.

154
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,799
Given the short time frame,

155
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,680
your quality doesn't disappoint us.

156
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,560
It seems the previous issues

157
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:10,759
weren't your fault after all.

158
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,919
I hope this partnership
goes well for all.

159
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,280
Thanks.

160
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:24,280
Thank you.

161
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:26,280
Su Mu!

162
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:28,239
I told you I had good taste.

163
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:30,519
See? I was right to have picked them.

164
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,680
Brother, we can inform
the legal department

165
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,919
to begin composing the contract.

166
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,440
Alright. That can wait.

167
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,519
You're a grown-up,

168
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,799
-so act like one!
-Brother, I love you!

169
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,679
Guru Bai Qi.

170
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,639
This series has earned
a place in my heart.

171
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,480
It's almost dinner time.

172
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,400
Allow me to treat everyone to dinner

173
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:59,639
as a token of appreciation
for your hard work.

174
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,679
Sure. Thank you, Mr. Su.

175
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,679
Lead the way.

176
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,439
Sure.

177
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:05,840
Miss Bai Qi.

178
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,639
We are officially business partners.

179
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:14,040
Can I call you Qin Ge?

180
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,559
That's a little more friendly.

181
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:17,759
Sure.

182
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:19,280
Min, do you think the nickname

183
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,079
makes us close too?

184
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,199
Not at all.

185
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,240
All the best to us, Mr. Su.

186
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:27,999
All the best!

187
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:28,720
Thanks.

188
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,879
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

189
00:09:35,119 --> 00:09:36,119
This wine tastes great.

190
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,559
Qin Ge.

191
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,119
Your outstanding hard work

192
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,119
helped me convince my brother.

193
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:45,639
That was because
you placed your trust in me.

194
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:46,879
Qin Ge.

195
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:48,800
I admire you.

196
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:50,439
Will you be my girlfriend?

197
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,119
I believe

198
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,759
we can find success and
fortune together as a couple!

199
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:00,759
We are going to make waves

200
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:03,040
in the local comic industry!

201
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,519
I didn't catch that.

202
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:07,960
I said

203
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:10,199
I admire you.

204
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,319
I adore you for your passion for comics.

205
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:17,360
That sense of adoration turns into love!

206
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:18,999
Right? Cheers!

207
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:25,319
Thank you for the compliment, Mr. Su.

208
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:28,160
Many fans have
expressed their admiration

209
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,240
just as you did.

210
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,679
We all know

211
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:33,439
this shows their love

212
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:34,720
for Miss Bai Qi's comics.

213
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,280
Our studio

214
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,800
will work hard and create
even more great comics.

215
00:10:39,119 --> 00:10:41,280
We will live up to the
expectations of fans

216
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,079
such as you, Mr. Su.

217
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,119
-But I'm saying...
-He's right!

218
00:10:45,439 --> 00:10:47,600
The entire staff of Bai Qi Studio
will work as one.

219
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,160
We won't let you down.

220
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,319
She is right, Mr. Su.

221
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,360
Expect great things from us.

222
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,879
All the best.

223
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,519
All the best.

224
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:06,759
Hello?

225
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:08,840
Brother?

226
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,639
I'll be right back.

227
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:12,720
It seems

228
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,240
Mr. Su has work to tend to.

229
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,119
Let's not take up any more of his time.

230
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:16,999
Chen Min.

231
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,720
-See him off.
-Okay.

232
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:20,920
Mr. Su.

233
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,679
Mr. Su, you should go home.

234
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,639
You've had too much drink tonight.

235
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:27,759
Mr. Su.

236
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,319
Follow me.

237
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:34,920
I'm sorry for the interruption.

238
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:36,960
When we celebrate our success,

239
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,240
I'll raise a proper toast for everyone.

240
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,079
We are flattered.
You've had too much drink.

241
00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:41,960
- That way.
- That way. Watch your steps.

242
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:43,079
Bye, Mr. Su.

243
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,480
Bye!

244
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,960
I am an outstanding young man.

245
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,040
When I confessed to her,

246
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,679
she should have been happy.

247
00:12:04,199 --> 00:12:05,079
Is she

248
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,920
playing hard-to-get?

249
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:11,439
No.

250
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:15,360
She has a boyfriend already?

251
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,160
No.

252
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,040
But even if she is single,

253
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,040
she won't fall for you.

254
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:24,720
Sir, are you alright?

255
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,960
He got drunk.

256
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:27,319
Bring him home.

257
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:28,319
Yes.

258
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,240
I can date anyone I want!

259
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,280
Bye, Mr. Su.

260
00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:40,360
He's gone.

261
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,160
Boss.

262
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,360
I'd like to walk you home.

263
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,720
I want to have
a word with you in private.

264
00:12:51,119 --> 00:12:52,040
You two...

265
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:53,679
Sure.

266
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,400
Min will go with Miss Bai Qi.

267
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,040
I'll go with Xuezhou.

268
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,480
Go on.

269
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:02,360
Min,

270
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,639
make sure Miss Bai Qi

271
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:04,840
arrives home safely.

272
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:06,480
Bye!

273
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:11,759
Don't you know why he is

274
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:12,679
walking her home?

275
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,879
Why are you not upset?

276
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,879
I know.

277
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,559
So why aren't you upset at all?

278
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,280
Min will definitely get rejected.

279
00:13:19,439 --> 00:13:21,040
That gives me an opening.

280
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:23,439
Why would I go after him

281
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:25,960
if he would make himself
vulnerable to me?

282
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,879
He has a plan,

283
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,079
but I am five steps ahead of him.

284
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,400
You millennials are
certainly impressive with your ideas.

285
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,280
I am going home for my beauty routine.

286
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,240
I need to sleep early.

287
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,160
Let's go!

288
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,240
Min, the show you put on just now

289
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,240
could have won you an Oscar award.

290
00:13:47,439 --> 00:13:49,119
If you ever become an actor,

291
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,439
I'll give you a thumbs-up!

292
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:55,960
Okay, we're here.

293
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:59,360
Rest well. See you.

294
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:02,999
What are you doing?

295
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,240
Boss.

296
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,160
If it was me,

297
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,360
would you say yes?

298
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,199
Wait.

299
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,519
What...

300
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:15,119
What is this about?

301
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:17,040
If I told you

302
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,240
I admire you and like you,

303
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,199
would you be my girlfriend?

304
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:29,119
Well, well! Min is all grown up now.

305
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:29,960
He's become

306
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,679
brave enough to crack a joke.

307
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:48,119
Min.

308
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,319
I appreciate

309
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:51,439
your feelings for me.

310
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,679
I like you too.

311
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:55,519
However,

312
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,639
being in a romantic relationship

313
00:14:57,639 --> 00:14:58,679
is a different matter.

314
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:00,319
If you want,

315
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:02,079
I can make it happen!

316
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:03,480
I can do anything for you.

317
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,720
My answer is no.

318
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:08,439
See?

319
00:15:09,439 --> 00:15:10,160
The world of grown-ups

320
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,920
is very plain and simple.

321
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,600
It's not too late to make a change, kid.

322
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,800
I'm not a kid anymore!

323
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:31,119
I won't give up!

324
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:05,999
What was that all about?

325
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:09,480
Give me a break.

326
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,319
I just want to draw my comics.

327
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,840
It's been a day.

328
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:37,360
He hasn't called or texted me.

329
00:16:41,119 --> 00:16:42,800
Men are all unreliable.

330
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,480
This isn't right.

331
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,759
It's already late at night.

332
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,319
The meeting should be over by now.

333
00:17:08,999 --> 00:17:10,079
Could it be...

334
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,120
Cheers!

335
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:18,600
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

336
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,159
-Cheers!
-Bottoms up!

337
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,159
Impressive!

338
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:27,240
No way.

339
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:29,559
He can barely handle alcohol.

340
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,720
He wouldn't go to a bar.

341

00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:25,199
to be with Bai Qijia.

511
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,199
Correct.

512
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,799
Why is that?

513
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,760
How is Bai Qijia better than us?

514
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,919
That is up to Qin Ge to decide.

515
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,360
We have no right to interfere.

516
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,480
Why not?

517
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,480
We are Qin Ge's closest friends.

518
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,559
We have the right
to keep her from harm.

519
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,760
Min, you know

520
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,000
Qin Ge's personality.

521
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,039
Once she's made her decision,

522
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,439
there is no way to change her mind.

523
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,720
Getting obsessed
with changing the inevitable

524
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,960
will only make the obsession run deeper.

525
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:53,559
It will be the shackles that bind you.

526
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:56,279
When she is back,

527
00:26:56,439 --> 00:26:58,039
you need to talk it through.

528
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,399
Sometimes, communication is the answer.

529
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,760
Get back to your work.

530
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:09,000
Min, how are you feeling?

531
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,960
I didn't think you'd bring me here

532
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:25,439
and get me a set of Hanfu.

533
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,640
What are you doing?

534
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,840
It looks great on you.

535
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:32,799
Is that what you think?

536
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:33,880
People are staring at us.

537
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:34,840
You look great.

538
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:36,679
You look great to me
no matter what you wear.

539
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,439
You look the most dashing to me.

540
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:40,000
Should we try some snacks?

541
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,439
Let's see.

542
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:43,640
Let's try some of those.

543
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:48,200
♪Those miseries
which I'm the sole audience♪

544
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:55,320
♪In the imagination of our future♪

545
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:01,920
♪You appear in every scroll♪

546
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:08,558
♪I think I have lost my mind♪

547
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:09,760
Try mine.

548
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,559
Try mine too.

549
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:14,399
Do you want some?
I'll buy you some.

550
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,079
Wait here.

551
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:20,559
Young lady!

552
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,120
Is this your first time here?

553
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Would you like to buy a flower ring?

554
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,799
The locals believe

555
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,760
it symbolizes good luck.

556
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,240
Put this on

557
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,399
and good things will happen!

558
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:35,199
Really?

559
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,199
Yes.

560
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:37,960
I'll have two.

561
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:38,760
Sure.

562
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,000
Wonderful things come in pairs.

563
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,039
Allow me to pay for them.

564
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,720
Flowers for the beauty.

565
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:46,840
I hope

566
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,399
to forge a bond with you, Miss.

567
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,240
We don't know each other.

568
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,480
This doesn't seem adequate.

569
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,439
Fate brings us together
from distances apart.

570
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,439
You seem familiar to me.

571
00:28:57,799 --> 00:28:59,720
Perhaps we've met

572
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:00,720
in our past lives.

573
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,960
Buddy, you speak with fancy words.

574
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,600
Are you a playwright?

575
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,000
I do write literature sometimes.

576
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:09,319
What do you do for a living?

577
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,720
I am an artist.

578
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:13,039
We are a match made in heaven!

579
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,039
That's enough for a match?

580
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I work with my hands too.

581
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:19,360
Are we meant to meet as well?

582
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:20,520
Do you work with a brush too?

583
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:21,799
I work with a scalpel.

584
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:25,120
I bought you some snacks.

585
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,919
What took you so long?

586
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:28,319
There was a long line.

587
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:30,559
You should try it first.

588
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,960
Feed me.

589
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:34,039
Fine.

590
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,600
I must take my leave now.

591
00:29:46,199 --> 00:29:47,079
Hold on.

592
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,919
The lady had already found her love.

593
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,600
May you have better luck next time.

594
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:56,720
You got into trouble

595
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,399
as soon as I left you.

596
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:01,000
Stop laughing.
You became a match for him

597
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,559
while I was gone.

598
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,319
I'm too charming.
It can't be helped.

599
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,039
I'm just as charming.

600
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:09,000
But someone got jealous

601
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,760
and traveled far to check on me.

602
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:12,640
We are different, Bai Qijia.

603
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,039
You promised me

604
00:30:14,199 --> 00:30:15,319
you'd be

605
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,840
a behaving and abstaining boyfriend.

606
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,439
What? Do you regret it now?

607
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,960
So, you are my girlfriend.

608
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:22,079
Does that mean

609
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,640
I won't need to be abstaining for you?

610
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,480
The bath water is ready.

611
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:12,799
Take a bath.

612
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,720
Why are you still wearing clothes?

613
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,520
Of course.

614
00:31:21,199 --> 00:31:22,279
What do you have in mind?

615
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,840
Come here. I'll dry your hair.

616
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,159
I thought it through just now.

617
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
About what?

618
00:32:29,199 --> 00:32:30,919
You've been too busy lately.

619
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,600
You need a good rest.

620
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,559
A good girlfriend should know that.

621
00:32:38,199 --> 00:32:39,840
So, where do I sleep?

622
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,000
I think

623
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,480
I'll sleep on the floor.
You get the bed.

624
00:32:44,199 --> 00:32:45,039
No.

625
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,079
Calm yourself down.

626
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,919
I need to buy some stuff.

627
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,039
You smell like body wash!

628
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:15,760
Your breath smells like barbecue!

629
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,119
Pretending to be asleep?

630
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,839
You were taking too long.

631
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:37,240
Why did you put on perfume?

632
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,679
I want to have a sweet dream.

633
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:42,359
Well...

634
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,599
Let's have this dream together.
