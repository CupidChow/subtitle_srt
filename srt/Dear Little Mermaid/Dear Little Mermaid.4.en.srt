00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,040
shall treat everyone to dinner, okay?

173
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,670
Okay.

174
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,190
(Why did they run away so quickly?)

175
00:10:59,400 --> 00:10:59,960
Careful.

176
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,160
Let go of me.

177
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,960
I...

178
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,070
I...

179
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,190
I can walk myself. Let go.

180
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,870
It's a rugged mountain.
There are only the two of us.

181
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,310
What if you get lost again?

182
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:08,990
You...

183
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:09,750
Be careful.

184
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,870
Let me go.

185
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,070
Dare you say the grouping

186
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,280
isn't your doing?

187
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,960
If you say so.

188
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,840
But let me remind you,

189
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,400
if we don't hurry up,

190
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,750
we'll be the slowest.

191
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,110
That's dinner for a dozen of people.

192
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,190
I might be broke after the meal.

193
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,720
Hurry up. We have to catch up.

194
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,600
Hurry up.

195
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,430
Mr. Li.

196
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,240
It's clearly written on this contract

197
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,750
that you should have sent the material

198
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,240
to the venue yesterday afternoon.

199
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,720
Look at the time now.

200
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,840
Where's the material?

201
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,110
What do you mean by this?

202
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,190
Your order

203
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,990
was changed many times.

204
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,110
I've told you that it'll be delayed.

205
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,070
What now?

206
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,040
Do you want to go by the book now?

207
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,400
You're not being reasonable.

208
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,480
But we've had

209
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,990
this kind of situation before.

210
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,360
Why can't you get it done this time?

211
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,870
How much was the previous budget?

212
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,550
And how much is the budget now?

213
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,240
Our factory has a lot of work.

214
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,070
I don't have time to serve you alone.

215
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,510
Alright then.

216
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,040
So you admitted that

217
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,160
you work according to
the amount of money.

218
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:15,920
Let me tell you,

219
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,110
my event starts tomorrow.

220
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,630
If you dare ruin my project,

221
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,480
I'll make your life hard.

222
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,480
What's up?

223
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:28,920
What's going on?

224
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:32,280
A little girl like you

225
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,630
is trying to threaten us?

226
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,600
That's right.

227
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,400
Bro, luckily I met you.

228
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,920
Only people like you know such places.

229
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,070
No big deal.

230
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:49,750
Be careful.

231
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:50,920
Give your backpack.

232
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,070
It's fine.

233
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:55,990
Thank you.

234
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:04,990
Stairs.

235
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,190
I can't go on.

236
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:11,870
Slow down.

237
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,070
I can't go on.

238
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,510
I can't walk anymore.
My legs are breaking.

239
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,190
Drink something.

240
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,160
Thank you.

241
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,800
I'm so tired.

242
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:25,480
Don't move.

243
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,400
What are you doing?

244
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,160
You covered your face
with so many things.

245
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,630
They affect your breathing.

246
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,430
Hey.

247
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,430
We're alone in the forest.

248
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,430
Don't touch me.

249
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,720
As the saying goes,
"After a few days together,

250
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,550
things are no longer like day one."

251
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,480
You've lost

252
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,480
interest in me so soon.

253
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:58,360
Dr. Bai, shouldn't you

254
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,750
reflect on yourself?

255
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,480
Haven't we met too often recently?

256
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,670
Carry this.

257
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:16,990
You!

258
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,070
What are you doing?

259
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,310
I think it's not enough.

260
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,110
What's not enough?

261
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:24,960
We haven't seen each other enough

262
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,800
that you get used to having me around.

263
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,430
Let me tell you.

264
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,310
I'm fatter than I was in school.

265
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,550
Let's see how long you can endure it.

266
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,430
Odd.

267
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,920
We aren't walking very fast.

268
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:43,960
Why didn't they catch up?

269
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,480
I bet they took the shortcut.

270
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:47,960
Shortcut?

271
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,840
There's a shortcut?

272
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,600
Oh no. I can't let them be faster.

273
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,670
Hurry up.

274
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,360
I didn't know
you're so desperate to win.

275
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,160
You have no idea.

276
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,840
Every single cent
is my hard-earned money.

277
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,920
I have to spend them carefully.

278
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,960
I want to watch concerts.

279
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,040
I want to shop for clothes.

280
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:03,990
I have to raise my son.

281
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,280
-Right?
-You're right.

282
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,160
Don't try to behave like a hoodlum.

283
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,240
So what?

284
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,070
I know all of you

285
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,430
very well.

286
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,360
Let me tell you.

287
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,960
Load my things into the car right now.

288
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:15,040
Don't delay my work.

289
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,960
So we can at least
have a good ending, get it?

290
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,160
What you said is funny.

291
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,920
I can give you your stuff.

292
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,160
But you're not following the process.

293
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:24,870
As loaders,

294
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,430
we can't work without permission.

295
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,480
Carry them yourself if you can.

296
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,670
Yes, carry them yourself.

297
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,110
It's so happening.

298
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,800
What are you recording?

299
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:45,990
Who are you?

300
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,240
Stop recording.

301
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,190
A few men

302
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:51,630
are bullying a young lady.

303
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,600
Let's see

304
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,480
how people react

305
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,800
when I post this video online.

306
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,920
Exactly.

307
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,240
Weren't you being harsh just now?
Hit me.

308
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,240
Let me tell you,

309
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,110
I'll sue you until you go bankrupt.

310
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,720
Well done.

311
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,990
You even hired a helper.

312
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,240
Alright.

313
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:10,310
You're a nasty young lady.

314
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,990
Your order is there.

315
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,550
You can just sign and take them.

316
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,480
Don't bother me next time.

317
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,480
Get back to work.

318
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:20,960
Let's go.

319
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,990
How was it? Was I good?

320
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,840
Why are you here?

321
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,720
I came...

322
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,960
to save the beauty.

323
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,920
You're cheesy.

324
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,840
Don't delay my work.

325
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,670
Do you need my help?

326
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,280
Let me tell you,

327
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,720
don't expect me to be grateful

328
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,040
just because you helped me.

329
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,310
I haven't gotten even
with you regarding my car.

330
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,840
Wait for it.

331
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:52,310
Okay.

332
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,990
I was afraid you would ignore me.

333
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,240
Give it to me.

334
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,640
Bai Qijia.

335
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,550
I forgot that
you're bad with directions.

336
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,240
If we were in Russia,

337
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,910
we would have been eaten by bears.

338
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,790
Why don't we go upwards?

339
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,150
Perhaps we can see the path

340
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,600
when we're standing higher up.

341
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,240
This pavilion is still here.

342
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,760
Bai Qijia.

343
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,190
Do you remember this pavilion?

344
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,910
I remember that

345
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:46,550
when we had
our last trial exam in the senior year

346
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,150
you said we should make a wish here.

347
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,360
Please, bless me.

348
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:00,150
I must pass.

349
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,360
I must pass.

350
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,240
Bless me.

351
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:07,000
I can do it. I can surely do it.

352
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,270
What are you doing?

353
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:13,840
I'm praying to God of Exams.

354
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,120
Will you pass after praying?

355
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,390
It's just a psychological comfort.

356
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:20,960
By the way,

357
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,670
there's a spiritual wishing tree
on the mountain.

358
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,150
Why don't we give it a try?

359
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:26,270
Revision

360
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,030
is the best psychological comfort.

361
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,190
You are...

362
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,880
Up to you. I'll try it myself.

363
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,670
Because of you

364
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,120
we're lost.

365
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,670
If it weren't for this place,

366
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,520
where would we spend the night?

367
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,840
You wanted to come to this place.

368
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,670
I haven't been there myself.

369
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,070
Couldn't you pay more attention?

370
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:00,000
I reminded you just now.

371
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,070
But you were so sure of yourself,

372
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,960
so I didn't know what else to say.

373
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:12,760
Look over there.

374
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,030
There's light.

375
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,790
Where?

376
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,720
Over there.

377
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,310
Let's go and have a look.

378
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:21,720
-Where?
-There.

379
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,390
Look.

380
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,760
Look there.

381
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,190
Just like stars in the sky.

382
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,310
I see it.

383
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,790
Where is our school?

384
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:41,310
Over there.

385
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,790
Where?

386
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,240
There.

387
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,030
I can't see it.

388
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,640
Do you see it now?

389
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:55,430
Look.

390
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,550
That's the station
where we always take our bus.

391
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,360
That's the school library.

392
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,430
And that's

393
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:08,070
the street we often go for snacks.

394
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,150
Do you see it?

395
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,150
I see it.

396
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,480
That's your home.

397
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,790
Look.

398
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,520
The fireworks are so beautiful.

399
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,150
To make a wish,

400
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,120
you don't necessarily need
a spiritual wishing tree.

401
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,550
We're also lucky to see

402
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:32,840
such beautiful fireworks.

403
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,270
Hurry, make a wish.

404
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,310
Would it work?

405
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,790
Then I will make wishes.

406
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,120
I may have a little too many wishes.

407
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,430
Wait for me.

408
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,150
Okay.

409
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,030
God of Luck.

410
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,360
Thank you

411
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,960
for giving me so many precious things

412
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,120
so far in my life.

413
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:58,120
But from now on,

414
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,310
I would exchange my future luck

415
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,640
with you.

416
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,190
I wish the person next to me

417
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,960
gets everything he wants.

418
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:08,840
I wish that he'll be safe,

419
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,790
healthy and happy.

420
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,480
May all his wishes come true.

421
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,910
I'm done with my wishes.

422
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,840
I'm done with my wishes.

423
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,840
What did you wish for?

424
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,240
I wished

425
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:39,960
to become

426
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,240
a smart, cheerful

427
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,270
and beautiful girl.

428
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:49,120
Your wish has come true.

429
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:11,520
I didn't expect you
to remember all that.

430
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,310
Of course, I do.

431
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,390
After all these years,

432
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,790
your IQ has not improved

433
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,190
yet your memory has gotten worse.

434
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,880
I remember, I was just lamenting.

435
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,790
How did

436
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,640
the gentle little boy

437
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,520
become like this?

438
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,000
Why did you take me here?

439
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,240
I was wrong.

440
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:38,390
In the past years,

441
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,520
your IQ did improve.

442
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:44,910
We're alone in the forest.

443
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,910
Don't touch me or I will...

444
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,640
(What if I can't control myself?)

445
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,190
Alright.

446
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,030
I want to ask you something.

447
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,150
(What must come, will come.)

448
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,550
You're torturing me

449
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,150
because I stood you up eight years ago.

450
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,960
I stood you up eight years ago

451
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,480
so you're taking revenge on me.

452
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,360
Was that necessary?

453
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,430
You hold a grudge for eight years.

454
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,880
Exactly, it was eight years.

455
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,720
You suddenly cut off
contact with me eight years ago,

456
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,310
and disappeared in my life.

457
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,270
It's all up to your liking.

458
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,030
You come and go as you like.

459
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,790
Because you're mad with me,

460
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,030
you're taking revenge on me?

461
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:21,840
Yes.

462
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:25,000
I'm mad with you.

463
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,190
I thought about taking a cruel revenge

464
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,240
to make you regret it.

465
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:29,480
I...

466
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,390
We're old now.

467
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,790
It was just a small matter,

468
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:38,030
don't be so petty.

469
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,120
But I'm angrier with myself
for not knowing how to deal with you.

470
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,720
I don't care about

471
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,550
the no-show eight years ago anymore.

472
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,670
Qin Ge.

473
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,310
Today,

474
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,240
I hope that you'll give us

475
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,480
an opportunity.

476
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,360
Besides, as you mentioned,

477
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,880
we're old now.

478
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,120
It didn't work out

479
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:16,310
with bankers or lawyers.

480
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,520
Why don't you try it out with a doctor?

481
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,760
Qin Ge.

482
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,360
I want to start it
all over again with you.

483
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,960
Can you give me another chance?

484
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,360
I can't.

485
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,390
I'll disappoint you.

486
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,640
You won't.

487
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:09,070
There are many things I didn't tell you.

488
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,960
I'm afraid you may be disappointed.

489
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,840
I'll never be disappointed in you.

490
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,760
Besides, you don't have to do anything.

491
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,720
Just let me

492
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,390
walk towards you.

493
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,480
Qin Ge.

494
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,240
Promise me,

495
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:46,960
okay?

496
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:53,720
Fireworks.

497
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,640
What a coincidence.

498
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:04,640
Did you arrange this as well?

499
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,030
Of course not.

500
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,760
Perhaps...

501
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,360
this is fate.

502
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,000
Well,

503
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,600
I have a question for you.

504
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,760
Say it.

505
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:54,550
Can we eat now? I'm hungry.

506
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,430
Let's go.

507
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:32,200
♪Light shines through window
before a mirror♪

508
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:36,670
Here you go.

509
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:38,150
Thank you.

510
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:44,520
♪Enclosed in the vivid past♪

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,390
Wow, well cut.

512
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,840
Don't forget that I'm a medical student.

513
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,120
I get a lot of chances to cut.

514
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,270
But don't be afraid,

515
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:57,670
I'm talking about rabbits, lab rats,

516
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:58,880
hen and so on.

517
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,270
After practicing so much,

518
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,310
I became an expert in cutting.

519
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:05,840
I'm not afraid at all.

520
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,480
Tell me,

521
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:12,120
are there many scary stories

522
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,390
in medical school?

523
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,310
Tell me some.

524
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,000
Have you heard about

525
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,670
Mr. Corpse?

526
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,390
Before we attend our autopsy class,

527
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,840
someone will always
specially invite him.

528
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,760
It's said that

529
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,910
one will have to pass
a very long underground passage.

530
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:48,790
That's the passage to the other world.

531
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,270
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

532
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,480
Don't alarm Mr. Corpse.

533
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,240
I'm not afraid.

534
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,270
I'm not afraid at all.

535
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:37,720
This is just a trick
to deceive children.

536
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,960
I believe in materialism.

537
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,000
Yes. When a person is dead, he's gone.

538
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,310
Horror stories

539
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:45,640
never happen.

540
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,030
That's right.

541
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,270
Therefore,

542
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:50,910
we have to spend
every second at its best.

543
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:52,390
Lest it'll be a loss.

544
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:56,190
Medical student, so what?

545
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,790
Qin Ge, I have a question.

546
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:07,480
Have you heard that

547
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,360
the weight of a soul

548
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,120
is 21 grams?

549
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,480
Sometimes I think,

550
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,310
when your shoulders

551
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:25,760
feel heavy for no reason,

552
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,790
could it be

553
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,960
that the ghosts

554
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:34,430
are greeting you?

555
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Don't be afraid.

556
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:46,360
You believe in materialism.

557
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,240
Let's change the topic.

558
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,600
Let's change the topic.

559
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,150
Why don't we talk about Lu Tian?

560
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,150
Lu Tian?

561
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,880
When did you know Lu Tian?

562
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,360
Lu Tian and I
are roommates in university.

563
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,070
I was annoyed by him in the beginning,

564
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:12,480
because he was very talkative.

565
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,720
Every time he was crossed in love,

566
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,520
he asked me out for a drink.

567
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,720
After getting sober the next day,

568
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:21,190
he would be fine again
to look for the next one.

569
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:24,000
Why did he come to you
when he was crossed in love?

570
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:25,670
Because you're experienced?

571
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,670
I don't think so.

572
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,270
But it's enough.

573
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,150
Enough?

574
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,240
So are you experienced or not?

575
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,270
None of your business.

576
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,720
What about you?

577
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,790
You failed on

578
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,000
so many blind dates.

579
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,310
Could you have no experience at all?

580
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,640
My experience

581
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:56,360
has been used as ideas
in comics for three years.

582
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,150
It's enough for another 10 years.

583
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,030
I made it so delicious.

584
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:16,190
But your reaction

585
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,550
is enough for another 10 years.

586
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,520
Bai Qijia.

587
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:25,310
Eat!

588
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:26,790
Eat all you want.

589
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,550
I was talking to you about Lu Tian.

590
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,790
Stop teasing me.

591
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:35,360
How many girlfriends

592
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:38,000
did Lu Tian have?

593
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,030
If we take him as the center and

594
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,720
make a circle with a 10-m radius,
all the girls

595
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:45,390
in the circle have dumped him.

596
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,910
So many?

597
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,640
Why?

598
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:56,000
I think he's quite handsome.

599
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,240
You think Lu Tian is handsome?

600
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,190
That's not important.

601
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,640
Keep talking.

602
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,520
Well, Lu Tian

603
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,480
may be noisy,
but he's very simple-minded.

604
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,190
If he thinks someone is the one,

605
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,790
he'll give it all out.

606
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,520
However,

607
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:21,430
I think this feeling

608
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:23,520
might put too much pressure on someone.

609
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,310
Oh no.

610
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,430
What's going on?

611
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,840
Xuezhou hates it
when someone puts pressure on her.

612
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,030
Especially

613
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,390
boyfriends.

614
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,760
What's wrong?

615
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,640
What are you talking about?

616
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,360
What marriage?

617
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,070
Since you're pregnant,

618
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,190
I, of course, must be responsible.

619
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,640
Give me a chance.

620
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,600
I'll give you the best life.

621
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,560
Don't be embarrassed

622
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,830
nor feel touched.

623
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:18,870
This is what I'm supposed to do.

624
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:25,830
Isn't this outfit good?

625
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,350
I think a Chinese dress
suits you very well.

626
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,150
When you put it on, you'll be...

627
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,280
Are you insane?

628
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:32,800
Do you want a piece of me?

629
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,190
Don't hit me. Let's talk about it.

630
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:38,590
Speak up.

631
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,190
Where did you hear it from?

632
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,040
Don't be agitated.
It'll affect the baby.

633
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:42,960
I saw that you had

634
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,280
many maternity products in the hospital.

635
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:45,320
But you denied it.

636
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:47,040
So I asked my friend to help.

637
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,390
Which friend? Tell me.

638
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,350
Bai Qijia.

639
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,630
And your friend,

640
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:54,910
Guru Bai Qi.

641
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,110
Alright, it's late now.

642
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,520
Get back to sleep.

643
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,390
I think your tent

644
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,430
is quite big.

645
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,080
Two people can fit in.

646
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,240
There's no space for you.

647
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,080
Don't you know my legs are long?

648
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,240
I'll go to sleep then.

649
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,520
I'm leaving now.

650
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:41,150
What's going on?

651
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,080
I just felt a gust of wind.

652
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:51,080
It's okay. I'm here.

653
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,800
Since you're an honest man,

654
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,080
I'll just let you

655
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,520
sleep in a tent with me.

656
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,520
This is the border.

657
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,320
If you cross the border,

658
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:06,520
I'll kill you.
