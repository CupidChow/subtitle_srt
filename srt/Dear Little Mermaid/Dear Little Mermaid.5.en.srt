unwillingly, I allow you

00:01:50,936 --> 00:01:52,176
to stay in the same tent with me.

This is the boundary between us.

You better watch out

24
00:01:57,216 --> 00:01:58,176
if you cross the line.

00:03:40,256 --> 00:03:41,376
Fortunately, it's only a dream.

Good morning.

28
00:03:58,816 --> 00:03:59,497
Good morning.

29
00:03:59,937 --> 00:04:01,937
Go wash up and let's watch the sunrise.

00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,897
Didn't you sleep well yesterday?

31
00:04:28,536 --> 00:04:30,816
How could I sleep

32
00:04:31,056 --> 00:04:32,577
when a handsome guy was beside me?

33
00:04:33,457 --> 00:04:34,536
You should've told me.

34
00:04:34,897 --> 00:04:35,737
Why?

35
00:04:36,056 --> 00:04:37,697
If you'd told me, I wouldn't have slept

36
00:04:37,936 --> 00:04:39,056
so you can appreciate my dashing look
the whole night.

37
00:04:40,536 --> 00:04:43,577
You're the cheekiest man
I've ever met.

38
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:45,216
Are you fully awake now?

39
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:46,376
Yes.

40
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,017
I'm fully awake to the limit.

41
00:04:48,577 --> 00:04:50,776
Let me take you to an interesting place.

42
00:04:52,697 --> 00:04:53,297
Let's go.

43
00:05:00,697 --> 00:05:03,417
We've finally found it
after so many years.

44
00:05:33,897 --> 00:05:35,857
What wish do you make?

45
00:05:37,577 --> 00:05:39,376
I'll tell you when I'm done.

46
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:57,417
Are you done?

47
00:05:57,656 --> 00:05:58,376
Yes.

48
00:05:59,737 --> 00:06:00,977
What did you wish for?

49
00:06:01,297 --> 00:06:03,697
I wish Bai Qi's new comic

50
00:06:03,816 --> 00:06:05,897
sells like a hot cake
for ten years long.

51
00:06:08,256 --> 00:06:09,177
That's all?

52
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:11,297
What else do you want?

53
00:06:12,496 --> 00:06:13,096
Nothing.

54
00:06:13,216 --> 00:06:15,056
It took you a long time

55
00:06:15,256 --> 00:06:16,697
to make just one wish.

56
00:06:16,816 --> 00:06:17,737
I thought...

57
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:19,056
You were watching me just now.

58
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:26,376
Well, I have one more wish.

59
00:06:28,017 --> 00:06:28,737
What's it about?

60
00:06:33,297 --> 00:06:35,496
I wish you won't run away from me again.

61
00:06:38,977 --> 00:06:40,177
You're not a cat

62
00:06:40,417 --> 00:06:41,577
nor I'm a rat.

63
00:06:41,737 --> 00:06:43,216
Why should I run away from you?

64
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:45,216
Only if your words count.

65
00:06:50,017 --> 00:06:51,096
Give me the strip.

66
00:07:25,536 --> 00:07:26,297
You can tie it now.

67
00:07:37,536 --> 00:07:38,617
What wish did you make?

68
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,617
Put me down first.

69
00:07:40,697 --> 00:07:42,417
Just tell. I'll let you down later.

70
00:07:42,536 --> 00:07:43,977
-Put me down.
-Tell me.

71
00:07:44,336 --> 00:07:45,417
Please let me come down first.

72
00:07:45,496 --> 00:07:46,256
Fine.

73
00:07:46,617 --> 00:07:47,536
Let's go.

74
00:07:47,656 --> 00:07:49,336
No, put me down.

75
00:07:49,737 --> 00:07:50,936
No.

76
00:07:51,936 --> 00:07:52,617
I won't.

77
00:07:52,977 --> 00:07:54,496
Bai Qijia.

78
00:07:55,177 --> 00:07:56,536
Put me down.

79
00:07:56,697 --> 00:07:57,977
No.

80
00:08:36,577 --> 00:08:38,096
What's wrong with those guys?

81
00:08:38,256 --> 00:08:39,817
I've told them that I'll send you home.

82
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:41,857
Yet they insisted to drive us home
one by one.

83
00:08:43,776 --> 00:08:44,776
You've miscalculated it.

84
00:08:48,776 --> 00:08:49,536
Dr. Bai.

85
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:50,617
Thank you.

86
00:08:51,696 --> 00:08:52,456
Wait.

87
00:08:55,057 --> 00:08:55,896
You have a fever.

88
00:08:56,257 --> 00:08:57,016
Why is your temperature so high?

89
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:57,737
I...

90
00:08:58,096 --> 00:08:59,656
It's fine. I'm prone to be feverish.

91
00:08:59,776 --> 00:09:00,817
I got to go now. Bye-bye.

92
00:09:00,937 --> 00:09:01,696
Qin Ge.

93
00:09:03,617 --> 00:09:04,497
Are you not feeling well?

94
00:09:04,497 --> 00:09:05,096
I...

95
00:09:13,617 --> 00:09:15,177
I...I'm fine.

96
00:09:15,776 --> 00:09:16,656
Min.

97
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:19,817
Min, what a loyal assistant you are.

98
00:09:20,336 --> 00:09:21,696
You didn't forget to fetch your boss.

99
00:09:24,336 --> 00:09:25,776
I'll take it.

100
00:09:29,776 --> 00:09:31,896
Take me inside now.
I can't take it anymore.

101
00:09:32,456 --> 00:09:33,177
Got it.

102
00:09:33,937 --> 00:09:34,456
Qin Ge.

103
00:09:34,617 --> 00:09:35,336
-Are you feeling...
-Min.

104
00:09:35,456 --> 00:09:37,737
You come at the right time.
I have some work for you.

105
00:09:38,016 --> 00:09:39,417
Dr. Bai, see you.

106
00:09:40,656 --> 00:09:42,057
See you, Dr. Bai.

107
00:09:44,257 --> 00:09:46,016
Do take a good rest.

108
00:09:57,817 --> 00:09:58,896
Finally, I'm revitalised.

109
00:09:59,977 --> 00:10:00,696
Lift your head.

110
00:10:08,297 --> 00:10:09,257
You're wrong

111
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,016
but you will repeat the same mistake.

112
00:10:11,617 --> 00:10:12,896
Xuezhou will definitely reprimand you

113
00:10:13,016 --> 00:10:14,057
if she knows about this.

114
00:10:15,576 --> 00:10:16,857
I feel a little tired.

115
00:10:17,057 --> 00:10:18,977
But, I'll be fine after a good rest.

116
00:10:19,216 --> 00:10:21,336
It's not necessary to report this
to Xuezhou, right?

117
00:10:24,776 --> 00:10:25,536
Min.

118
00:10:26,057 --> 00:10:27,257
My backpack.

119
00:10:27,937 --> 00:10:28,617
Backpack.

120
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:38,857
It's an amulet

121
00:10:38,937 --> 00:10:40,336
I specially asked for you
from the temple.

122
00:10:43,057 --> 00:10:43,896
Min.

123
00:10:44,497 --> 00:10:46,297
You've been working hard these two days.

124
00:10:46,497 --> 00:10:47,576
You can have two days off.

125
00:10:47,737 --> 00:10:49,297
Take a good rest, okay?

126
00:10:49,536 --> 00:10:51,497
I'm not going to tell Xuezhou.

127
00:10:52,456 --> 00:10:54,336
But, you have to promise me

128
00:10:54,776 --> 00:10:56,896
to stay home from now.

129
00:10:57,057 --> 00:10:57,937
If your sickness takes a turn,

130
00:10:58,016 --> 00:11:00,096
Xuezhou and I will
be dreadfully worried.

131
00:11:00,417 --> 00:11:01,456
Alright. It's my fault.

132
00:11:01,576 --> 00:11:03,617
I promise I'll listen to you.

133
00:11:03,737 --> 00:11:04,737
Min.

134
00:11:08,136 --> 00:11:10,456
Well, I'll take your promise.

135
00:11:11,297 --> 00:11:13,696
But, I stay here to look after you
tonight.

136
00:11:14,617 --> 00:11:16,016
Seriously?

137
00:11:16,177 --> 00:11:17,776
I just went out one day.

138
00:11:17,937 --> 00:11:19,857
I...

139
00:11:23,737 --> 00:11:25,177
Alright.

140
00:11:25,497 --> 00:11:27,456
The mattress you slept on
for work previously is still here.

141
00:11:27,817 --> 00:11:28,776
Just help yourself.

142
00:11:33,257 --> 00:11:34,057
Goodnight.

143
00:11:38,257 --> 00:11:38,937
Goodnight.

144
00:11:52,297 --> 00:11:53,776
Gosh! Who was that?

145
00:11:56,696 --> 00:11:57,656
Are you blind?

146
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:58,937
This deep scratch will cost me
at least one hundred thousand to fix it.

147
00:11:59,016 --> 00:11:59,896
Do you know that?

148
00:12:00,776 --> 00:12:01,937
I'm so sorry.

149
00:12:02,177 --> 00:12:03,377
I'll comply with you

150
00:12:03,576 --> 00:12:04,737
to settle this.

151
00:12:09,336 --> 00:12:10,377
It's you?

152
00:12:10,977 --> 00:12:13,456
(Blimey, isn't this Senior Chen Min?)

153
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:16,057
(Your obsession with someone
will appear before you one day.)

154
00:12:16,417 --> 00:12:18,377
(Wong Kar-wai, you're right.)

155
00:12:21,016 --> 00:12:23,737
Have we met before?

156
00:12:24,096 --> 00:12:25,617
(He remembers me.)

157
00:12:28,896 --> 00:12:29,456
Yes.

158
00:12:29,737 --> 00:12:31,617
We met at the pub last time.

159
00:12:32,016 --> 00:12:32,937
I'm Tian Cheng.

160
00:12:33,096 --> 00:12:34,257
You can call me Little Orange.

161

Miss Tian.

162
00:12:37,016 --> 00:12:37,896
I'm Chen Min.

163
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:40,136
Well, we can discuss

164
00:12:40,576 --> 00:12:42,016
how this can be settled.

165
00:12:43,377 --> 00:12:44,937
Frankly, I can claim from
my car insurance.

166
00:12:45,257 --> 00:12:47,656
But, I have something urgent now.
I'm afraid...

167
00:12:47,937 --> 00:12:48,536
How about this?

168
00:12:48,817 --> 00:12:50,057
I have something on as well.

169
00:12:50,177 --> 00:12:51,576

00:21:21,296 --> 00:21:21,657
What's wrong?

339
00:21:21,737 --> 00:21:23,617
I...I need to go to the washroom.

340
00:21:23,936 --> 00:21:24,737
I take you there.

341
00:21:25,056 --> 00:21:26,897
No need. I can find my own way there.

342
00:21:27,056 --> 00:21:28,857
Fine. I'll go myself.

343
00:21:32,216 --> 00:21:32,936
Are you done?

344
00:21:34,017 --> 00:21:34,737
Let's go.

345
00:21:43,617 --> 00:21:44,096
It's Xuezhou.

346
00:21:44,176 --> 00:21:44,936
Hurry up. Move.

347
00:21:45,017 --> 00:21:45,977
Hide ourselves.

348
00:21:46,296 --> 00:21:47,857
Who are you looking for?

349
00:21:48,777 --> 00:21:50,857
A rich second-generation
with a unique hobby.

350
00:21:51,257 --> 00:21:52,377
Are you sure

351
00:21:52,696 --> 00:21:53,737
a rich second-generation

352
00:21:54,497 --> 00:21:55,537
would come to such a place?

353
00:21:57,537 --> 00:21:59,377
Can you ask your friend?

354
00:21:59,537 --> 00:22:00,216
Wait.

355
00:22:00,497 --> 00:22:01,857
This is about privacy.

356
00:22:01,977 --> 00:22:03,176
I don't think it's appropriate.

357
00:22:06,216 --> 00:22:07,336
Do you want to help me?

358
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:08,936
I...

359
00:22:09,056 --> 00:22:09,857
Forget it.

360
00:22:11,017 --> 00:22:12,336
Our room is over there.

361
00:22:20,537 --> 00:22:22,137
(When Bai Qijia comes close to you,)

362
00:22:22,137 --> 00:22:23,216
(do you)

363
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:24,857
(feel breathless)

364
00:22:25,017 --> 00:22:26,857
(and your heart beats fast?)

365
00:22:33,416 --> 00:22:34,897
(You're so lame, Qin Ge.)

366
00:22:35,216 --> 00:22:36,497
(Don't lean on him.)

367
00:22:36,857 --> 00:22:39,296
(You just haven't been so close
to a handsome guy for a long time.)

368
00:22:39,537 --> 00:22:41,657
(You can't let Lin Xuezhou see this.)

369
00:22:45,056 --> 00:22:47,336
Bai Qijia, let's go back to our room.

370
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:12,977
Why do Lu Tian and Lin Xuezhou

371
00:23:13,377 --> 00:23:14,737
come here together?

372
00:23:15,497 --> 00:23:16,096
I'm in trouble now.

373
00:23:16,977 --> 00:23:18,977
Don't tell me Xuezhou wants
to catch me red-handed

374
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:20,696
when she knows I'm not working.

375
00:23:22,696 --> 00:23:23,857
Are you curious about it?

376
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,017
Let's check it out.

377
00:23:34,257 --> 00:23:35,017
Close the door.

378
00:23:38,897 --> 00:23:40,617
When Xuezhou speaks of Lu Tian,

379
00:23:40,816 --> 00:23:41,777
she flares up and
wants to reap him into pieces.

380
00:23:41,936 --> 00:23:43,056
But now, they come to a theatre
together.

381
00:23:43,176 --> 00:23:44,257
Think about it.

382
00:23:44,377 --> 00:23:45,456
Isn't that intriguing?

383
00:23:45,456 --> 00:23:47,017
Don't you scare she spots you here?

384
00:23:47,096 --> 00:23:47,777
I do fear.

385
00:23:47,977 --> 00:23:48,857
Alright.

386
00:24:08,336 --> 00:24:09,257
What are you doing here?

387
00:24:09,777 --> 00:24:11,777
Dear customers, this is your fruit dish.

388
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:13,377
Did you order this?

389
00:24:13,816 --> 00:24:14,936
No.

390
00:24:16,737 --> 00:24:19,657
What's Lu Tian doing then?

391
00:24:20,216 --> 00:24:22,257
He likes doing weird things.

392
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:23,537
I've used to it.

393
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:28,257
Are you curious about it?

394
00:24:29,456 --> 00:24:31,017
You came to the wrong customer. Go out.

395
00:24:31,696 --> 00:24:33,056
I'm so sorry.

396
00:24:42,497 --> 00:24:43,257
Procrastinator Bai.

397
00:24:43,657 --> 00:24:44,456
Why are you here?

398
00:24:44,617 --> 00:24:45,497
I have something to ask you.

399
00:24:45,977 --> 00:24:47,336
Come. Faster.

400
00:24:50,617 --> 00:24:51,537
Be careful.

401
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:54,657
She has something to ask you.

402
00:24:56,176 --> 00:24:57,017
Dr. Lu,

403
00:24:57,936 --> 00:24:59,777
do you and Xuezhou come for dating?

404
00:25:00,576 --> 00:25:02,096
I wish I could.

405
00:25:02,537 --> 00:25:03,977
She's looking for someone.

406
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:06,056
Is it me?

407
00:25:09,617 --> 00:25:10,617
No.

408
00:25:11,897 --> 00:25:12,897
She said

409
00:25:13,336 --> 00:25:14,936
she's looking for
a rich second-generation.

410
00:25:19,576 --> 00:25:21,017
Both of you...

411
00:25:21,696 --> 00:25:23,416
I bring Qin Ge here to relax.

412
00:25:27,696 --> 00:25:28,537
Lu Tian.

413
00:25:29,096 --> 00:25:30,056
Lu Tian.

414
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:31,537
Bai Qijia.

415
00:25:32,977 --> 00:25:34,336
I...I need to go now.

416
00:25:34,456 --> 00:25:35,497
Otherwise, she'll be suspicious.

417
00:25:39,576 --> 00:25:40,537
Coming, Xuezhou.

418
00:25:42,216 --> 00:25:43,216
By the way, we did nothing wrong.

419
00:25:43,296 --> 00:25:44,497
Why do we have to hide from her?

420
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:45,977
Quiet.

421
00:25:53,137 --> 00:25:54,176
Any discoveries?

422
00:25:54,257 --> 00:25:55,617
I didn't find the one you want.

423
00:25:59,336 --> 00:26:00,176
Come. Go over there.

424
00:26:02,977 --> 00:26:04,017
Sorry, but please take it.

425
00:26:04,176 --> 00:26:05,576
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

426
00:26:06,017 --> 00:26:07,096
Let's go.

427
00:26:07,977 --> 00:26:08,816
Bai Qijia.

428
00:26:09,576 --> 00:26:10,576
It's quiet outside.

429
00:26:10,657 --> 00:26:11,576
Perhaps they've gone.

430
00:26:11,936 --> 00:26:12,977
Let's leave.

431
00:26:18,137 --> 00:26:19,296
I think they've left.

432
00:26:19,816 --> 00:26:20,537
Let's go.

433
00:26:23,696 --> 00:26:24,456
My purse.

434
00:26:26,977 --> 00:26:27,696
Come on.

435
00:26:34,416 --> 00:26:35,456
That man is Bai Qijia, right?

436
00:26:35,657 --> 00:26:36,497
Is that Qin Ge?

437
00:26:36,617 --> 00:26:37,377
No.

438
00:26:37,777 --> 00:26:39,216
That's not Qin Ge.
You've seen it wrongly.

439
00:26:40,657 --> 00:26:41,576
Who's that woman then?

440
00:26:41,576 --> 00:26:43,056
That's Procrastinator Bai's
ex-girlfriend.

441
00:26:45,017 --> 00:26:46,696
His ex-girlfriend?

442
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:49,096
They're back together.

443
00:26:50,137 --> 00:26:51,537
Jerk.

444
00:27:10,657 --> 00:27:11,537
Boys and girls,

445
00:27:12,056 --> 00:27:13,416
today is a special day

446
00:27:13,576 --> 00:27:15,096
for us.

447
00:27:15,897 --> 00:27:17,137
It's one hundred days left

448
00:27:17,257 --> 00:27:18,737
before the national college
entrance examination.

449
00:27:19,017 --> 00:27:20,897
On such a special day,

450
00:27:21,096 --> 00:27:22,657
I have some requests for you.

451
00:27:23,456 --> 00:27:24,537
First of all,

452
00:27:24,857 --> 00:27:25,777
We have to...

453
00:27:25,857 --> 00:27:26,576
Well said.

454
00:27:33,336 --> 00:27:34,056
Very good.

455
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:43,056
Well, since all of you're
in high spirits,

456
00:27:43,176 --> 00:27:44,657
I won't say much.

457
00:27:44,816 --> 00:27:46,176
How about this?

458
00:27:46,257 --> 00:27:47,737
I play the documentary of

459
00:27:47,857 --> 00:27:48,777
the school's pep assembly last year.

460
00:27:49,257 --> 00:27:50,377
Do watch it with full attention.

461
00:27:55,657 --> 00:27:57,056
Why did you nudge me?

462
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:59,257
I thought Chen has finished talking.

463
00:28:02,017 --> 00:28:04,296
What were you doing last time?
Didn't you sleep?

464
00:28:08,497 --> 00:28:09,897
You're to be blamed.

465
00:28:10,576 --> 00:28:12,456
Your questions are too difficult for me.

466
00:28:12,576 --> 00:28:14,336
I stayed up to solve them but I failed.

467
00:28:15,416 --> 00:28:17,377
Just tell. What reward do you want?

468
00:28:18,336 --> 00:28:19,816
Let me lean on your shoulder.

469
00:28:19,936 --> 00:28:21,416
I need to get some more sleep.

470
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,280
(Bai Qijia: Good night.
Chen Min: ?)

471
00:29:36,416 --> 00:29:37,497
Is this me?

472
00:29:37,897 --> 00:29:39,096
It can't be.

473
00:29:40,257 --> 00:29:41,257
It's me.

474
00:29:46,176 --> 00:29:47,017
Bai Qijia.

475
00:29:47,216 --> 00:29:49,056
Delete the photo now.

476
00:29:49,137 --> 00:29:50,416
Right now. Immediately.

477
00:29:51,696 --> 00:29:53,777
Who are you talking to?
You were grinding your teeth together.

478
00:29:54,576 --> 00:29:57,657
Nothing. I've ordered you
a cup of coffee.

479
00:29:58,137 --> 00:29:59,936
It's Americano, with no sugar and milk.

480
00:30:01,696 --> 00:30:04,056
Friend, I have something to tell you.

481
00:30:07,056 --> 00:30:07,977
Look at this.

482
00:30:19,257 --> 00:30:20,137
Xue...Xuezhou.

483
00:30:20,257 --> 00:30:21,737
Actually, I...

484
00:30:21,857 --> 00:30:22,816
I know it's not you.

485
00:30:22,977 --> 00:30:24,176
It's his ex-girlfriend.

486
00:30:25,296 --> 00:30:26,137
His ex-girlfriend.

487
00:30:26,296 --> 00:30:27,617
Lu Tian told me this.

488
00:30:27,777 --> 00:30:29,456
This shameless jerk

489
00:30:29,777 --> 00:30:31,777
got back together
with his ex-girlfriend

490
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:33,497
while seeing you.

491
00:30:33,737 --> 00:30:34,936
He's a scumbag.

492
00:30:35,456 --> 00:30:36,657
Calm down.

493
00:30:36,777 --> 00:30:37,617
He isn't worth it.

494
00:30:37,777 --> 00:30:39,056
I lose my cool because of you.

495
00:30:39,377 --> 00:30:40,737
I should tell his ex-girlfriend.

496
00:30:41,497 --> 00:30:42,936
I don't think so.

497
00:30:43,137 --> 00:30:45,977
We better not pry into their business.

498
00:30:46,096 --> 00:30:47,216
Why not?

499
00:30:47,416 --> 00:30:48,336
We're all women.

500
00:30:48,456 --> 00:30:49,977
I must tell his ex-girlfriend.

501
00:30:50,296 --> 00:30:51,096
I'm telling you,

502
00:30:51,336 --> 00:30:52,416
it's good that you can

503
00:30:52,497 --> 00:30:54,777
find out his true colours now.

504
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:56,216
Stay away from the trash.

505
00:30:56,456 --> 00:30:57,816
Yes.

506
00:30:58,137 --> 00:30:58,777
You're right.

507
00:30:59,096 --> 00:30:59,857
But,

508
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,617
isn't this a private theatre?

509
00:31:02,176 --> 00:31:03,416
How did you go there?

510
00:31:04,017 --> 00:31:04,857
I found out

511
00:31:04,936 --> 00:31:07,096
that Su Lun likes to go
to private theatres.

512
00:31:07,176 --> 00:31:08,537
So, I was planning to encounter him
there

513
00:31:08,657 --> 00:31:10,216
for your project.

514
00:31:11,017 --> 00:31:12,296
Since you failed to meet him,

515
00:31:12,657 --> 00:31:14,096
we'll go to him.

516
00:31:15,936 --> 00:31:18,056
I'm sure we can meet him.

517
00:31:21,416 --> 00:31:22,537
Procrastinator Bai, please listen to me.

518
00:31:22,657 --> 00:31:24,377
I didn't mean to mention
ex-girlfriend to her.

519
00:31:24,497 --> 00:31:25,857
I was too anxious.

520
00:31:26,096 --> 00:31:27,017
It's fine.

521
00:31:27,336 --> 00:31:28,456
But, you have to explain

522
00:31:28,576 --> 00:31:29,657
to Lin Xuezhou.

523
00:31:30,137 --> 00:31:30,977
I won't go.

524
00:31:32,336 --> 00:31:33,617
Even you aren't let Lin Xuezhou

525
00:31:33,696 --> 00:31:35,216
to know about your relationship
with Guru Bai Qi,

526
00:31:35,497 --> 00:31:36,257
neither do I.

527
00:31:37,137 --> 00:31:39,377
It's Qin Ge, not me.

528
00:31:42,416 --> 00:31:45,497
It seems Guru Bai Qi has yet
to admit the relationship.

529
00:31:46,657 --> 00:31:48,657
Serve you right, Procrastinator Bai.

530
00:31:49,336 --> 00:31:50,576
You've had dinner together,

531
00:31:50,897 --> 00:31:52,537
gone on an outing and watched movies,

532
00:31:52,816 --> 00:31:54,737
yet you haven't made any progress.

533
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,977
You better call yourself Pitiful Bai.

534
00:31:59,336 --> 00:32:00,777
Qin Ge needs some time.

535
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:02,216
Besides,

536
00:32:02,537 --> 00:32:04,816
I like how we are now.

537
00:32:05,096 --> 00:32:07,816
You'll end up holding her hands

538
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,897
and giving her to another man.

539
00:32:11,257 --> 00:32:12,537
Nonsense.

540
00:32:13,737 --> 00:32:14,696
I think

541
00:32:14,936 --> 00:32:16,416
if you really want some responses
from her,

542
00:32:16,537 --> 00:32:17,857
You should take the initiative

543
00:32:18,137 --> 00:32:19,537
to guide her.

544
00:32:19,696 --> 00:32:20,737
Why didn't you ask Guru Bai Qi

545
00:32:20,816 --> 00:32:22,056
straightaway?

546
00:32:22,216 --> 00:32:23,737
Did you ask Lin Xuezhou previously?

547
00:32:24,257 --> 00:32:24,977
No.

548
00:32:25,816 --> 00:32:26,537
Get out of here.

549
00:32:26,936 --> 00:32:28,257
But, we're in different situations.

550
00:32:28,257 --> 00:32:29,416
-I...
-Get out of here.

551
00:32:55,216 --> 00:32:57,096
Mr. Su read the comic
and he said it's good.

552
00:32:57,377 --> 00:32:59,176
But, there are some minor problems.

553
00:32:59,416 --> 00:33:00,416
You may come back first.

554
00:33:00,537 --> 00:33:01,977
Later, I'll sort them out

555
00:33:01,977 --> 00:33:02,816
and send it to your email.

556
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:05,137
If Mr. Su is in the office,

557
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:05,816
we can respond to these questions

558
00:33:05,816 --> 00:33:07,416
face to face.

559
00:33:07,537 --> 00:33:09,777
I'm sorry. Mr. Su can't meet you.

560
00:33:10,537 --> 00:33:11,137
It's fine.

561
00:33:11,137 --> 00:33:12,416
We can wait for him in the meeting room.

562
00:33:12,537 --> 00:33:13,977
How about this?
After you sort out his questions,

563
00:33:14,056 --> 00:33:15,936
we'll resolve his confusion
on the spot.

564
00:33:18,216 --> 00:33:18,977
Alright.

565

Well done.

569
00:33:28,456 --> 00:33:30,456
I thought we won't be able
to meet him today.

Xuezhou, do you want any drinks?

I can buy it for you.

Sure.

Yes.

(Doctor's Office)
Yesterday night,

579
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:57,897
you were trying to hide
from Lin Xuezhou,

580
00:33:58,056 --> 00:33:59,497
so we didn't watch the movie.

581
00:33:59,696 --> 00:34:00,936
Hence, you should make it up to me.

582
00:34:01,576 --> 00:34:03,017
What if I don't.

583
00:34:03,257 --> 00:34:05,296
I'll go to Lin Xuezhou and Lu Tian

584
00:34:05,456 --> 00:34:06,617
to ask them for my compensation.

Don't you worry.

588
00:34:12,537 --> 00:34:14,936
I just want to eat with you.

589
00:34:15,497 --> 00:34:16,656
Alright. Fine.

I send you the address.

Hold on.

595
00:34:28,337 --> 00:34:30,656
You mentioned
that I have to make it up to you.

596

It means the treat is on me.

597
00:34:33,656 --> 00:34:35,097
It must be hefty.

598

Hefty food is delicious.

Don't stand me up and don't be late.

I need to talk to them.

612

Forget it.

this mysterious man has given us.

00:35:24,136 --> 00:35:25,017
Sure.
