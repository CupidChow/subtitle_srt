00:10:45,793 --> 00:10:46,834
Unexpectedly,

169
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,394
your classmate is a doctor.

170
00:10:49,913 --> 00:10:51,954
He even sent you here.

171
00:10:52,713 --> 00:10:54,353
You both are close, right?

172
00:10:54,874 --> 00:10:55,874
Not at all.

173
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:58,074
We met each other by chance.

174
00:10:58,153 --> 00:11:00,514
Perhaps we have personal grudges.

175
00:11:01,033 --> 00:11:03,194
Why did you lie to him
that you're a nobody?

176
00:11:03,874 --> 00:11:05,074
To save myself from trouble.

177
00:11:05,473 --> 00:11:06,913
What if he borrows money from me

178
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:08,153
after knowing my situation?

179
00:11:08,353 --> 00:11:09,194
(True.)

180
00:11:09,314 --> 00:11:10,233
Of course.

181
00:11:10,834 --> 00:11:11,713
Qin Ge.

182
00:11:13,913 --> 00:11:15,394
Your lipstick is smudged.

183
00:11:15,834 --> 00:11:16,713
Is it?

184
00:11:18,033 --> 00:11:18,793
It can't be.

185
00:11:18,913 --> 00:11:20,634
It was perfect just now.

186
00:11:22,874 --> 00:11:23,994
It's fine though.

187
00:11:32,593 --> 00:11:33,754
Why are you here?

188
00:11:34,113 --> 00:11:35,793
I brought you here.

189
00:11:35,954 --> 00:11:38,113
So, I must take you back safely as well.

190
00:11:38,994 --> 00:11:40,994
The draft has arrived safely, right?
Let's go.

191
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:42,874
Erm...

192
00:11:43,673 --> 00:11:47,153
Min, may I leave first?

193
00:11:51,314 --> 00:11:52,394
No.

194
00:11:52,634 --> 00:11:55,074
Qin Ge is in charge of this project.

195
00:11:55,233 --> 00:11:56,713
So, she has to go to the clients

196
00:11:56,834 --> 00:11:59,473
to update on the progress.

197
00:12:02,314 --> 00:12:04,673
Erm...Min, you may go in first.

198
00:12:05,033 --> 00:12:06,874
Tell them I'm coming.

199
00:12:06,954 --> 00:12:08,514
Sure. We're waiting for you then.

200
00:12:13,994 --> 00:12:14,913
Bai Qijia.

201
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:16,553
Thank you for sending me here.

202
00:12:16,913 --> 00:12:18,434
I must grab this opportunity

203
00:12:18,673 --> 00:12:20,274
for the reversal luck.

204
00:12:20,394 --> 00:12:21,274
You can do it, Qin...

205
00:12:22,553 --> 00:12:23,353
Qin.

206
00:12:26,153 --> 00:12:28,434
My apologies, everyone.
Sorry to keep you waiting.

207
00:12:28,913 --> 00:12:30,033
Bai Qi, the comic author

208
00:12:30,113 --> 00:12:31,754
has rushed hotfoot to here
with her draft.

209
00:12:31,874 --> 00:12:32,994
She will present her work

210
00:12:33,074 --> 00:12:35,194
to everyone with full sincerity.

211
00:12:41,754 --> 00:12:42,233
Hello, everyone.

212
00:12:42,314 --> 00:12:45,113
I'm the author of Bubaiqi Plan, Bai Qi.

213
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,113
Bai Qi? Guru?

214
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:48,754
Bai Qi is her pen name.

215
00:12:48,874 --> 00:12:49,754
She's well-known

216
00:12:49,874 --> 00:12:51,194
and she has millions of followers.

217
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,233
What's the title of her work?

218
00:12:52,353 --> 00:12:53,314
Bubaiqi Plan.

219
00:12:53,514 --> 00:12:55,153
She's been a best selling-comic author
for three consecutive years.

220
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,473
Is the contract

221
00:12:56,634 --> 00:12:57,793
her sole comic project?

222
00:12:57,793 --> 00:12:58,314
Yes.

223
00:12:58,394 --> 00:12:59,994
Our company is going
to sponsor Guru Bai Qi

224
00:12:59,994 --> 00:13:01,434
on the promotion plan for the coming year.

225
00:13:01,713 --> 00:13:02,874
(Qin Ge)
Hi, I'm Qin Ge.

226
00:13:02,954 --> 00:13:04,033
(Qin Ge)
and also known as

227
00:13:04,113 --> 00:13:05,954
(Qin Ge)
Bai Qi, the author of Bubaiqi Plan.

228
00:13:06,834 --> 00:13:08,314
Today, I'd like to share with you

229
00:13:08,434 --> 00:13:10,274
how I form a tie
with my comic career.

230
00:13:10,473 --> 00:13:11,874
When I was a high school student,

231
00:13:12,194 --> 00:13:13,994
I read my first comics.

232
00:13:14,153 --> 00:13:15,913
I fell for it at the first glance.

233
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:22,473
The world of comics

234
00:13:22,634 --> 00:13:26,113
(Comics Gang)
is full of imagination and out-of-bound.

235
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:28,954
It's like a parallel universe.

236
00:13:29,314 --> 00:13:32,074
I wish I can stay there and never leave.

237
00:13:33,834 --> 00:13:36,074
However, to be a comic author is tough.

238
00:13:37,074 --> 00:13:38,713
Every job is a tough job.

239
00:13:38,994 --> 00:13:39,634
Growing up

240
00:13:39,713 --> 00:13:41,673
is tough in nature.

241
00:13:42,153 --> 00:13:43,634
If one has something he or she prefers

242
00:13:43,834 --> 00:13:46,274
it's like adding sugar to the coffee.

243
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:48,954
If one has someone he or she likes,

244
00:13:49,113 --> 00:13:50,913
it's like pouring milk into it.

245
00:13:51,954 --> 00:13:54,394
Plus, family, friends,

246
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:56,874
and someone you like
or someone who likes you,

247
00:13:56,994 --> 00:13:58,353
it resembles a layer of milk foam
floating on top.

248
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:00,874
There you go,

249
00:14:00,954 --> 00:14:01,913
a cup of fragrant tasty latte.

250
00:14:02,233 --> 00:14:04,194
No one ever thinks drinking latte
is tough.

251
00:14:04,634 --> 00:14:05,954
Seeking joy amidst sorrow?

252
00:14:07,553 --> 00:14:08,634
Kind of.

253
00:14:09,233 --> 00:14:10,473
But, nothing's wrong with that.

254
00:14:10,834 --> 00:14:11,874
Yes, nothing's wrong.

255
00:14:12,514 --> 00:14:13,634
Ms. Latte.

256
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:27,194
Lastly,

257
00:14:27,394 --> 00:14:28,793
life is tough, however,

258
00:14:28,913 --> 00:14:30,634
I wish you can seek joy amidst sorrow.

259
00:14:30,793 --> 00:14:31,793
Hopefully, Bubaiqi Plan

260
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:33,593
may bring love and warmth

261
00:14:33,793 --> 00:14:35,994
to more readers.

262
00:14:38,153 --> 00:14:39,194
(Bai Qi)
Thank you for listening.

263
00:14:42,394 --> 00:14:44,473
I hope Bai Qi's coffee shop

264
00:14:44,713 --> 00:14:46,233
never close.

265
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:47,113
Editor Lin.

266
00:14:47,233 --> 00:14:48,754
The contract is nailed, right?

267
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:50,593
Appreciate your trust in us.

268
00:14:50,754 --> 00:14:52,074
Good, I'm looking forward to
working with you.

269
00:14:52,274 --> 00:14:53,194
Me too.

270
00:14:59,713 --> 00:15:00,673
Luckily, we reached on time.

271
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:02,153
Everything sailed through today.

272
00:15:03,314 --> 00:15:05,233
I've got the contract.

273
00:15:05,353 --> 00:15:06,274
I can go to

274
00:15:06,353 --> 00:15:07,673
my son's concert now.

275
00:15:09,514 --> 00:15:11,314
My effort of escaping from the hospital
didn't turn up in vain.

276
00:15:11,434 --> 00:15:12,314
You even have a son?

277
00:15:12,434 --> 00:15:15,913
I'm the fan that has motherly loyalty.

278
00:15:17,473 --> 00:15:20,194
Why haven't you left yet?

279
00:15:20,314 --> 00:15:21,713
So, you were rushing here

280
00:15:21,834 --> 00:15:23,153
for the down payment?

281
00:15:23,994 --> 00:15:24,874
Well,

282
00:15:25,274 --> 00:15:26,834
one must have enough monetary support

283
00:15:26,954 --> 00:15:29,194
while pursuing dreams.

284
00:15:30,593 --> 00:15:32,353
Very good. As you've promised me,

285
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,113
we should return to the hospital now.
Let's go.

286
00:15:36,194 --> 00:15:37,913
Who are you?

287
00:15:37,994 --> 00:15:40,353
I'm Bai Qijia, the doctor
of Qingchuan Hospital.

288
00:15:40,634 --> 00:15:41,913
Bai Qijia?

289
00:15:43,954 --> 00:15:44,994
Do you know me?

290
00:15:47,793 --> 00:15:50,074
I seem to be a famous character to you.

291
00:15:52,553 --> 00:15:53,713
Please, don't.

292
00:15:55,074 --> 00:15:57,673
It's my first time hearing this name.

293
00:15:58,793 --> 00:16:00,834
Which department are you from, Dr. Bai?

294
00:16:01,074 --> 00:16:01,834
Department of Nephrology.

295
00:16:01,954 --> 00:16:02,913
Really?

296
00:16:03,673 --> 00:16:05,713
Don't tell me Qin Ge is your patient.

297
00:16:09,353 --> 00:16:10,473
No, please.

298
00:16:11,194 --> 00:16:11,874
No matter what,

299
00:16:11,954 --> 00:16:13,634
Qin Ge can't go back with you now.

300
00:16:13,713 --> 00:16:14,834
Because something is wrong

301
00:16:14,913 --> 00:16:15,713
with the company's network now.

302
00:16:15,834 --> 00:16:16,754
The data hasn't been restored yet.

303
00:16:16,754 --> 00:16:20,314
So, I need Qin Ge to go back to work.

304
00:16:20,434 --> 00:16:21,074
Yes.

305
00:16:21,233 --> 00:16:22,194
If there's a job

306
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,153
that must be done by a patient
who hasn't been discharged,

307
00:16:24,353 --> 00:16:26,194
the leader fails to fulfil the task.

308
00:16:26,394 --> 00:16:27,834
Besides, she's a patient
of Qingchuan Hospital.

309
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:29,153
Someone has to be blamed
if anything happens to her.

310
00:16:29,314 --> 00:16:30,434
She must go back with me.

311
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:35,274
You've poked your nose
into our business, Dr. Bai.

312
00:16:35,434 --> 00:16:36,553
It's ridiculous for a doctor

313
00:16:36,634 --> 00:16:38,754
to force the patient
back to the hospital.

314
00:16:39,033 --> 00:16:39,673
That's right.

315
00:16:39,793 --> 00:16:40,553
Min.

316
00:16:41,074 --> 00:16:42,353
We will settle the bill

317
00:16:42,353 --> 00:16:44,074
in these two days, right?

318
00:16:44,353 --> 00:16:46,913
Please follow Dr. Bai
to settle the bill.

319
00:16:47,033 --> 00:16:48,394
Thank you in advance, Dr. Bai.

320
00:16:49,593 --> 00:16:50,394
Let's go.

321
00:16:52,793 --> 00:16:53,434
I'm off.

322
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:55,754
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

323
00:16:57,754 --> 00:16:59,113
He's back.

324
00:17:00,954 --> 00:17:02,353
Why didn't you tell me?

325
00:17:04,153 --> 00:17:05,074
(Contract)
How do you feel about

326
00:17:05,353 --> 00:17:07,074
reuniting with your first love
who you stood up

327
00:17:07,153 --> 00:17:08,954
after eight years?

328
00:17:09,033 --> 00:17:11,433
Wonder how does Guru Bai Qi
think about this?

329
00:17:11,994 --> 00:17:13,554
I'm as calm as the stagnant water.

330
00:17:13,914 --> 00:17:16,233
It's unbearable to recall.
Let bygones be bygones.

331
00:17:17,274 --> 00:17:18,634
You're like

a love rat who leaves after flirting.

333

You failed to turn up for him
many years ago.

334
00:17:23,914 --> 00:17:25,953
And now you turn your back on him.

335
00:17:26,193 --> 00:17:27,914
I didn't mean to do so.

336
00:17:28,154 --> 00:17:30,394
How could I know I would get sick then?

337
00:17:30,874 --> 00:17:31,433
Qin Ge.

338
00:17:31,554 --> 00:17:32,874
Qin Ge, you'll be alright. Qin Ge.

339
00:17:32,994 --> 00:17:34,193
Dad is with you, Qin Ge.

340
00:17:34,313 --> 00:17:36,313
Qin Ge, can you hear me? Qin Ge.

341
00:17:36,433 --> 00:17:37,554
You'll be fine. Dad is here.

342
00:17:37,674 --> 00:17:39,313
Qin Ge, everything will be alright.

343
00:17:39,473 --> 00:17:40,313
You'll be fine.

344
00:17:41,754 --> 00:17:43,514
Doctor, thank you so much.

345
00:17:43,634 --> 00:17:45,034
Thank you. Qin Ge.

346
00:17:45,113 --> 00:17:45,754
Sorry, sir.

347
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,193
Sorry, you can't go in.

348
00:17:54,634 --> 00:17:56,833
I was scared stiff at that time.

349
00:17:57,113 --> 00:17:58,914
I didn't even have time
to think about my last word.

350
00:17:59,034 --> 00:18:00,914
How would I have time for Bai Qijia?

351
00:18:01,154 --> 00:18:02,634
He's back now.

352
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,514
Don't you want to explain to him?

353
00:18:04,634 --> 00:18:05,713
How?

354
00:18:06,154 --> 00:18:08,914
I'll tell him that I have
systemic lupus erythematosus

355
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:11,034
which almost took away
my life eight years ago.

356
00:18:11,274 --> 00:18:12,433
So, he'll

357
00:18:12,554 --> 00:18:14,394
worry about me and feel sorry for me.

358
00:18:14,953 --> 00:18:17,674
It's such a melancholic youth romance
that's beyond absurdity.

359
00:18:17,874 --> 00:18:20,514
Cut it out. You're evading the question.

360
00:18:22,473 --> 00:18:24,473
I know it's shameless
to evade questions,

361
00:18:24,674 --> 00:18:26,154
but it helps.

362
00:18:28,994 --> 00:18:31,154
Except for Min and you,

363
00:18:31,274 --> 00:18:32,713
I don't wish the others to know

364
00:18:32,713 --> 00:18:33,953
about the sickness.

365
00:18:34,193 --> 00:18:36,154
Think about it. It's been eight years.

366
00:18:36,713 --> 00:18:38,794
I've been trying
to interact with others.

367
00:18:38,953 --> 00:18:40,233
And you've seen the consequence.

368
00:18:40,754 --> 00:18:43,634
I can't either be tired
or exposed to the sunlight.

369
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:46,353
I can't eat or drink anything I want.

370
00:18:46,754 --> 00:18:47,994
Even though the other acted

371
00:18:48,313 --> 00:18:49,754
as if they understand my situation,

372
00:18:49,914 --> 00:18:52,514
they spoke ill of me behind my back.

373
00:18:53,313 --> 00:18:54,274
Why should I torture myself again?

374
00:18:54,554 --> 00:18:55,874
I think it's good now.

375
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:56,713
That's not your problem,

376
00:18:56,713 --> 00:18:58,154
but theirs.

377
00:19:00,193 --> 00:19:00,874
Anyway,

378
00:19:00,994 --> 00:19:03,154
I've given up my social life.

379
00:19:03,353 --> 00:19:06,634
I don't mind if Bai Qijia thinks

380
00:19:06,754 --> 00:19:07,754
that I'm a love rat.

381
00:19:08,233 --> 00:19:09,313
After all,

382
00:19:09,514 --> 00:19:12,394
you owe him an explanation.

383
00:19:12,754 --> 00:19:14,554
If possible, please explain to him.

384
00:19:15,514 --> 00:19:16,394
But, no rush.

385
00:19:16,514 --> 00:19:18,874
You deal it with your way.

386

Regardless of your decision

387

388

She's my Muse.

We first met at an auction.

However, after the event,

she disappeared unwittingly.

00:25:25,073 --> 00:25:25,994
Permitted.

499
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:26,914
What?

500
00:25:27,274 --> 00:25:28,713
I said you're permitted.

501
00:25:29,113 --> 00:25:30,433
You're just discharged
from the hospital,

502
00:25:30,554 --> 00:25:32,154
yet I asked you to work overnight.

503
00:25:32,233 --> 00:25:33,154
I should let you

504
00:25:33,233 --> 00:25:34,713
have a good rest.

505
00:25:35,353 --> 00:25:36,433
Lin Xuezhou.

506
00:25:37,113 --> 00:25:39,193
Something's off.
Something's wrong with you.

507
00:25:39,874 --> 00:25:42,634
Such workload means nothing

508
00:25:42,914 --> 00:25:44,473
compared to the past.

509
00:25:44,713 --> 00:25:45,754
Didn't you always tell me

510
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:47,353
to step out of my comfort zone?

511
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:49,034
Something's weird about you.

512
00:25:49,473 --> 00:25:51,514
I'm sure something must have happened.

513
00:25:54,353 --> 00:25:56,353
How could it be, Boss?

514
00:25:56,473 --> 00:25:57,034
Well.

515
00:25:57,113 --> 00:25:59,313
We're concerned about your health.

516
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:01,154
The problem is that you can't drink.

517
00:26:01,274 --> 00:26:02,794
You can only drink lemonade or lemon tea

518
00:26:02,914 --> 00:26:04,473
in the pub.

519
00:26:04,754 --> 00:26:05,914
-It's so boring.
-It's so boring.

520
00:26:05,914 --> 00:26:06,994
Let's go, Xuezhou.

521
00:26:10,634 --> 00:26:11,554
Hold on.

522
00:26:13,794 --> 00:26:17,274
My favourite band is having a live show

523
00:26:17,394 --> 00:26:18,554
tonight.

524
00:26:18,794 --> 00:26:21,634
How dare you keep that from me?

525
00:26:23,367 --> 00:26:24,394
Help me up.

526
00:26:24,634 --> 00:26:26,794
I still have the energy
to hang out with you.

527
00:26:27,994 --> 00:26:29,554
-Come on.
-Let's go.

528
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:34,473
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

529
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,240
(Tipsy Pub)

530
00:26:56,754 --> 00:26:57,794
Come on.

531
00:27:38,193 --> 00:27:39,473
Boss, you're drinking alcohol.

532
00:27:39,473 --> 00:27:40,274
Be careful.

533
00:27:40,274 --> 00:27:41,034
Where are you going?

534
00:27:41,154 --> 00:27:41,794
Come on.

535
00:27:41,874 --> 00:27:42,473
We're colleagues,

536
00:27:42,554 --> 00:27:43,713
but, I haven't got a chance
to drink with you.

537
00:27:43,833 --> 00:27:44,674
Come on. Sit here.

538
00:27:44,794 --> 00:27:45,953
Boss, get me a cup.

539
00:27:50,193 --> 00:27:51,034
Come, drink it.

540
00:27:51,233 --> 00:27:51,953
Cheers.

541
00:27:56,034 --> 00:27:57,034
Let's drink.

542
00:28:40,473 --> 00:28:41,433
Be careful.

543
00:28:49,073 --> 00:28:50,154
What are you up to?

544
00:28:51,353 --> 00:28:52,313
Gent's room.

545
00:28:52,713 --> 00:28:53,914
I did nothing at all.

546
00:29:03,994 --> 00:29:05,713
Young lad,

547
00:29:06,874 --> 00:29:08,674
you're handsome.

548
00:30:20,674 --> 00:30:22,353
You deceived me eight years ago.

549
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:23,473
Eight years later,

550
00:30:23,713 --> 00:30:25,433
you won't have the second chance.

551
00:30:27,313 --> 00:30:28,473
Guru Prodigy.

552
00:30:28,794 --> 00:30:29,833
Perfect Goddess.

553
00:30:30,193 --> 00:30:31,274
Dreammaker Master.

554
00:30:31,953 --> 00:30:33,274
These are all your camouflage, right?

555
00:30:39,994 --> 00:30:42,394
Little liar.

556
00:30:51,233 --> 00:30:52,313
Where are you going?

557
00:30:56,274 --> 00:30:57,274
Min.

558
00:30:58,713 --> 00:30:59,394
My clothes.

559
00:30:59,473 --> 00:31:00,674
Sorry.

560
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:02,914
Are you going to leave me like this?

561
00:31:03,073 --> 00:31:03,754
Next time.

562
00:31:03,914 --> 00:31:05,113
Something urgent has come up.

563
00:31:05,233 --> 00:31:06,554
I will pay you next time.

564
00:31:06,754 --> 00:31:07,593
You...

565
00:31:42,874 --> 00:31:44,794
