It has only been half a day,

That's impossible.

Don't worry.
I'll always be on your side.

He told me a lot.

34
00:02:49,763 --> 00:02:51,923
He said he'd neglected your feelings

35
00:02:52,642 --> 00:02:54,362
for choosing to remarry.

36
00:02:54,843 --> 00:02:56,483
You had to join a new family suddenly.

37
00:02:56,763 --> 00:02:58,242
He'd failed to consider your feelings.

what I care about.

00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:05,043
Ever since I could remember,

41
00:03:06,203 --> 00:03:07,002
my mom had been tortured

42
00:03:07,123 --> 00:03:09,002
by systemic lupus erythematosus.

43
00:03:10,563 --> 00:03:11,522
This disease

44
00:03:13,123 --> 00:03:15,283
had killed her gentleness bit by bit.

45

I didn't do well in the exam.

Have you found the cause of the mistake?

50

Yes.

51
00:03:43,843 --> 00:03:45,483
Actually, it was because

52
00:03:45,483 --> 00:03:47,602
I went off track in my revision.

53
00:03:48,002 --> 00:03:49,403
I've consulted my teacher.

54
00:03:50,683 --> 00:03:52,802
Dad, I won't

Mom, why did you come out here?

Why didn't you rest on your bed?

Qin Ge, tell me the truth.

63
00:04:23,242 --> 00:04:24,482
Was going off track in your revision

64
00:04:24,683 --> 00:04:26,403
the reason for the mistake?

65
00:04:26,963 --> 00:04:27,762
I...

66
00:04:29,963 --> 00:04:31,123
Take a look at this question.

67
00:04:31,642 --> 00:04:33,642
The problem-solving process is correct.

68
00:04:34,322 --> 00:04:35,723
But you made a mistake at the last step.

69
00:04:36,883 --> 00:04:38,482
Wasn't this due to your carelessness?

70
00:04:39,202 --> 00:04:41,123
Mom, I know.

71
00:04:41,443 --> 00:04:43,082
But this is the only question
where I made a mistake.

72
00:04:43,163 --> 00:04:44,642
You've learned to talk back to me.

73
00:04:45,482 --> 00:04:46,922
All right. No matter what the reason is,

74
00:04:47,042 --> 00:04:48,163
what is done is done.

75
00:04:48,443 --> 00:04:49,922
She feels bad too.

76
00:04:50,042 --> 00:04:51,042
Don't make things difficult for her.

77
00:04:51,362 --> 00:04:53,762
I'm making things difficult for her?
She's telling lies here.

78
00:04:54,202 --> 00:04:56,003
Qin Ge, I'm very disappointed with you!

79
00:04:59,522 --> 00:05:00,802
All right. It's fine.

80
00:05:08,922 --> 00:05:10,963
Similar incidents occurred every day.

81
00:05:12,283 --> 00:05:14,603
But at times like this,
I really admired my dad.

82
00:05:15,123 --> 00:05:15,683
He silently

83
00:05:15,683 --> 00:05:17,802
tolerated my mom

84
00:05:18,603 --> 00:05:20,003
whenever she lost her temper.

85
00:05:20,683 --> 00:05:21,723
He never left her.

86
00:05:24,202 --> 00:05:25,322
That was when I realized

87
00:05:25,843 --> 00:05:27,603
that love isn't just about

88
00:05:27,883 --> 00:05:29,362
loving her strengths,

89
00:05:30,802 --> 00:05:32,322
but also accepting her weaknesses.

90
00:05:35,003 --> 00:05:36,642
This is what love is about.

91
00:05:39,482 --> 00:05:41,522
But everything that happened after that

92
00:05:42,443 --> 00:05:44,003
shattered my fantasies.

93
00:06:30,482 --> 00:06:31,522
From that moment onwards,

94
00:06:33,683 --> 00:06:35,322
no one cared about me anymore.

95
00:06:38,163 --> 00:06:39,202
It was a regret

96
00:06:41,522 --> 00:06:42,922
that I failed to see my mom
for one last time

97
00:06:45,362 --> 00:06:47,202
before she passed on.

98
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:58,642
I dared not feel sad.

99
00:07:01,723 --> 00:07:03,202
I was afraid if I did,

100
00:07:04,563 --> 00:07:06,362
my dad would feel worse than I.

101
00:07:18,123 --> 00:07:19,403
But later, I realized

102
00:07:20,963 --> 00:07:22,443
I'd overthought it.

103
00:07:23,202 --> 00:07:26,322

Your dad has been living
a tough life all these years.

117
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,403
You should be sensible.

Yes. Your dad has fulfilled his duties

119

for years.

120
00:08:14,443 --> 00:08:16,242
It's time for him
to pursue his own happiness.

121
00:08:16,802 --> 00:08:19,403
You should be happy for him.
Don't you think so?

122
00:08:19,883 --> 00:08:21,723
Look at how happy your dad is now.

123
00:08:21,922 --> 00:08:23,642
Finally, he looks like
the person he used to be.

124
00:08:31,642 --> 00:08:33,563
Actually, I didn't mind him
getting remarried.

that it was so unreal.

00:12:21,483 --> 00:12:22,682
I'm worried.

171
00:12:23,163 --> 00:12:24,803
Aren't you going to coax me?

172
00:12:26,283 --> 00:12:27,322
So sorry.

173
00:12:28,363 --> 00:12:29,442
I'll do it.

174
00:12:31,723 --> 00:12:33,442
Qin Ge, let me tell you.

175
00:12:35,163 --> 00:12:39,002
I'm the most talented doctor
at Qingchuan Hospital.

176

If I say your disease can be treated,

177
00:12:44,843 --> 00:12:46,803
then it definitely can.

178
00:12:48,762 --> 00:12:50,562
If I tell you to believe in love,

179
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,762
then you must believe in it.

180
00:12:55,322 --> 00:12:56,122
Okay?

181
00:12:56,322 --> 00:12:56,963
Okay.

182
00:12:57,163 --> 00:12:59,043
All right then. Let's go home.

185
00:13:04,562 --> 00:13:06,082
Give me a kiss first.

186
00:13:07,442 --> 00:13:09,363
I promise. Let's get home first, okay?

187
00:13:11,603 --> 00:13:13,522
All right. All right.

188
00:13:14,403 --> 00:13:15,243
So sorry.

189
00:13:21,483 --> 00:13:25,762
Qin Ge, you must believe in love.

190
00:13:33,002 --> 00:13:33,923
Don't worry.

191
00:13:34,363 --> 00:13:36,163
There was an even more
embarrassing incident after that.

192
00:13:44,243 --> 00:13:45,803
Be careful.

193
00:13:49,403 --> 00:13:50,163

194

why aren't you asleep yet?

195
00:13:53,562 --> 00:13:54,762
What... What are you two doing?

196
00:13:55,122 --> 00:13:56,403
Why are you two touching each other?

197
00:13:56,882 --> 00:13:58,483
You're asking me before I asked you?

198
00:13:58,603 --> 00:13:59,723
It's not that. He...

199

Stop asking. Or else
you two will end up arguing again.

200
00:14:02,963 --> 00:14:03,843
He's drunk?

201
00:14:04,002 --> 00:14:05,122
Dad!

202
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:09,803
What is this?

203
00:14:10,562 --> 00:14:12,202
Dad, don't worry.

204
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:15,522
I'll take good care of Qin Ge.

205
00:14:18,723 --> 00:14:19,243
I...

206
00:14:19,322 --> 00:14:21,803
You two have had a tough life.

207
00:14:22,122 --> 00:14:22,483
This...

208
00:14:22,483 --> 00:14:25,202
Obviously, you two care for each other
but refuse to speak your mind.

209
00:14:25,522 --> 00:14:27,122
You do concern about her.

210
00:14:27,243 --> 00:14:28,723
Stop pulling my pants.

211
00:14:29,043 --> 00:14:30,403
Qin Ge resents you now.

212
00:14:30,562 --> 00:14:32,762
You'd caused her
to stop believing in love.

213
00:14:33,002 --> 00:14:33,882
That's not so. Stop it.

214
00:14:33,963 --> 00:14:35,442
Why are you spitting everything out?

215
00:14:36,562 --> 00:14:38,043
Stop crying.

216
00:14:38,322 --> 00:14:39,522
Stop it, please.

217
00:14:41,403 --> 00:14:43,762
-All right. Stop shouting.
-Dad!

218
00:14:43,963 --> 00:14:46,963
-Dad!
-Drink less if you can't drink.

219
00:14:48,002 --> 00:14:49,522
Stop pulling me.

220
00:14:50,603 --> 00:14:54,243

222

And then,

223
00:15:04,843 --> 00:15:08,082
you kept crying.

224
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:13,082
You ended up vomiting all over my quilt.

225
00:15:15,363 --> 00:15:16,283
Did you know

226
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:17,682
that we took tremendous effort

227
00:15:17,882 --> 00:15:19,963
to get you up here from downstairs?

228
00:15:22,603 --> 00:15:23,283
It's fine.

229
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:25,803
There will be a second time.

230
00:15:28,603 --> 00:15:29,322
Never mind.

231
00:15:31,002 --> 00:15:32,843
But I accidentally

232
00:15:33,043 --> 00:15:35,122
vindicated your
and your dad's intentions.

233
00:15:36,043 --> 00:15:37,202
Then, did we talk

234
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:38,762
about anything else after that?

235
00:15:43,682 --> 00:15:44,723
We have ample time.

236
00:15:45,442 --> 00:15:46,642
There's no time like the present.

237

You can't just do nothing

238

239
00:15:49,403 --> 00:15:50,803
for you, right?

240
00:16:02,122 --> 00:16:04,243
Qin Ge, have a good talk with your dad.

241

I'll go get some breakfast.

you've supported me to study arts.

You've been trying
to understand my feelings.

I'm especially grateful to you.

255

In fact, it's my fault.

256

I've been feeling entangled.

257

understood your thoughts earlier.

All right. All right.

I won't wait for Jia to get back.

I'll go straight to the airport.

to chase you away.

But I have something to deal with there.

I have a question for you too.

You suffered a lot with Mom.

Have you ever regretted it?

283

How should I put it?

284
00:18:15,322 --> 00:18:16,763
It was rather suffering,

285
00:18:18,003 --> 00:18:19,523
but I never regretted it.

286
00:18:20,523 --> 00:18:22,162
Your mom and I were truly in love.

287

I know you're worried about love.

288

But you must trust Jia.

289

I can see that he's ready

290

to walk the future with you.

00:20:31,322 --> 00:20:32,402
I did mention to Mr. Su

338
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:33,922
not to touch the core content.

339
00:20:34,042 --> 00:20:35,162
But I'd only provided him

340
00:20:35,243 --> 00:20:36,082
with the latest data

341
00:20:36,082 --> 00:20:38,402
so he could choose
and consider it carefully.

342
00:20:38,843 --> 00:20:40,202
How childish you are.

343
00:20:40,442 --> 00:20:41,883
Do you really think
the operation of a project

344
00:20:42,003 --> 00:20:43,802
will change just because of
your personal persistence?

345
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:45,763
The Bubaiqi Plan is a project
the company has invested most

346
00:20:45,883 --> 00:20:47,322
in terms of manpower
and material resources this year.

347
00:20:47,523 --> 00:20:49,243
How are you going
to clean up such a big mess?

348
00:20:52,682 --> 00:20:53,363
I'm sorry.

349
00:20:53,963 --> 00:20:55,363
I'll go look for Su Lun now

350
00:20:55,562 --> 00:20:56,243
and find out

351
00:20:56,363 --> 00:20:57,603
what happened along the way.

352
00:20:57,802 --> 00:20:59,843
Lin Xuezhou, don't blame me
for not reminding you.

353
00:21:00,643 --> 00:21:01,963
If you can't seal the deal again,

354
00:21:02,082 --> 00:21:03,322
you'll pack up and leave.

355
00:21:03,402 --> 00:21:04,162
Understood.

356
00:21:05,363 --> 00:21:07,042
If I can't salvage the situation,

357
00:21:07,802 --> 00:21:09,162
I'll voluntarily resign.

358
00:21:19,322 --> 00:21:20,123
Hi, Xuezhou.

359
00:21:25,003 --> 00:21:27,322
Xuezhou seems to be in big trouble now.

360
00:21:27,682 --> 00:21:28,603
Manager Xia has

361
00:21:28,723 --> 00:21:29,802
never liked our department.

362
00:21:30,082 --> 00:21:32,162
At times like this,
we must watch our steps.

363
00:21:32,483 --> 00:21:33,922
We must not bring about
our own destruction.

364
00:21:34,562 --> 00:21:35,282
Boss,

365
00:21:36,042 --> 00:21:37,603
the situation doesn't seem to look good.

366
00:21:38,003 --> 00:21:40,523
Xuezhou left the office in a hurry.

367
00:21:40,922 --> 00:21:43,042
I think she's going to find Su Lun.

368
00:21:43,442 --> 00:21:44,202
Min,

369
00:21:44,682 --> 00:21:46,082
tell Xuezhou to wait.

370
00:21:46,442 --> 00:21:48,003
Su Lun's assistant just called

371
00:21:48,123 --> 00:21:49,322
and asked me to go
to Qianye Film & TV alone

372
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:50,402
to discuss with them.

373
00:21:50,802 --> 00:21:52,082
I'm on my way to meet them.

374
00:21:52,402 --> 00:21:54,442
I'll find out why they wanted
to terminate the agreement.

375
00:21:54,802 --> 00:21:55,442
Boss,

376
00:21:55,843 --> 00:21:57,282
you're going to meet them alone?

377
00:21:57,763 --> 00:21:59,442
What if they bully you?

378
00:21:59,643 --> 00:22:01,322
Wait for me. I'll get there now.

379
00:22:01,562 --> 00:22:03,123
No need. Don't worry.

380
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:05,282
I want them to let their guard down

381
00:22:05,483 --> 00:22:06,483
so that I can see

382
00:22:06,603 --> 00:22:08,123
what on earth is on their mind.

383
00:22:08,643 --> 00:22:09,282
That's all for now.

384
00:22:09,402 --> 00:22:10,603
I'll find you all at the office later.

385
00:22:11,562 --> 00:22:12,243
Bye.

386
00:22:12,922 --> 00:22:13,682
Boss.

387
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,100
(Qianye Yingshi)

388
00:22:19,483 --> 00:22:20,243
Please come in.

389
00:22:22,843 --> 00:22:23,643
Please have a seat.

390
00:22:26,162 --> 00:22:27,322
Mr. Su isn't here yet?

391
00:22:27,723 --> 00:22:30,162
Aren't I already here, Miss Bai Qi?

392
00:22:48,042 --> 00:22:49,042
Good day, Mr. Su.

393
00:22:52,883 --> 00:22:54,723
Save the pleasantries
and self-introduction.

394
00:22:54,843 --> 00:22:56,523
Here's a document. Sign it,

395
00:22:56,643 --> 00:22:58,402
and your current problem will be solved.

396
00:23:08,723 --> 00:23:10,723
Hey, Su! Let me tell you!

397
00:23:11,003 --> 00:23:12,282
I hate people like you,

398
00:23:12,402 --> 00:23:13,963
the second-generation insiders
who disrespect others, the most.

399
00:23:14,243 --> 00:23:15,562
Even if Bai Qi Studio

400
00:23:15,682 --> 00:23:16,963
has to close down permanently,

401
00:23:17,322 --> 00:23:18,963
I'll never collaborate
with people like you.

402
00:23:22,763 --> 00:23:24,483
What is this?

403
00:23:30,763 --> 00:23:32,042
That's all you've got there?

404
00:23:50,363 --> 00:23:52,042
(Calm down.)

405
00:23:52,363 --> 00:23:54,442
(You're here to spy
on the enemy and save the team.)

406
00:23:54,603 --> 00:23:56,243
(It's not the time to get pissed off.)

407
00:23:59,282 --> 00:24:00,282
Excuse me, Mr. Su.

408
00:24:00,483 --> 00:24:02,042
May I know what you mean

409
00:24:02,162 --> 00:24:03,123
by this document here?

410
00:24:04,322 --> 00:24:05,243
Well,

411
00:24:05,562 --> 00:24:07,243
withdrawing from the collaboration

412
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:09,963
is under our company's
major restructuring plan.

413
00:24:10,123 --> 00:24:12,003
Mad Eye Comics has offered us

414
00:24:12,123 --> 00:24:13,282
their entire collection of works.

415
00:24:13,363 --> 00:24:15,202
We will enjoy the priority rights
to adaptation.

416
00:24:15,603 --> 00:24:16,243
This way,

417
00:24:16,363 --> 00:24:18,363
our costs will be greatly reduced.

418
00:24:19,162 --> 00:24:20,562
But

419
00:24:20,843 --> 00:24:22,763
I personally want to give you all

420
00:24:22,843 --> 00:24:23,763
a chance.

421
00:24:23,883 --> 00:24:25,162
This is the supplementary agreement

422
00:24:25,162 --> 00:24:26,363
I'd drawn up the whole night.

423
00:24:26,562 --> 00:24:27,442
As long as you agree

424
00:24:27,562 --> 00:24:30,483
to give Qianye all the adaptation rights

425
00:24:30,603 --> 00:24:31,963
to your future comics

426
00:24:32,363 --> 00:24:33,963
and pass us your copyright fees

427
00:24:34,123 --> 00:24:35,282
in exchange for investment shares

428
00:24:35,402 --> 00:24:37,003
and develop the company together,

429
00:24:37,202 --> 00:24:38,483
I'll be able to convince

430
00:24:39,123 --> 00:24:42,082
the board of directors
to change their mind.

431
00:24:44,523 --> 00:24:45,682
I'm sorry, Mr. Su.

432
00:24:46,042 --> 00:24:47,363
I'm just a creator.

433
00:24:47,562 --> 00:24:49,123
I don't understand

434
00:24:49,282 --> 00:24:50,123
how your business operates.

435
00:24:50,442 --> 00:24:52,003
You don't need to.
You just have to cooperate.

436
00:24:52,763 --> 00:24:53,402
Regarding this matter,

437
00:24:53,402 --> 00:24:55,042
I need to seek advice
from Xuezhou first.

438
00:24:55,162 --> 00:24:56,202
I can't call the shot alone here.

439
00:24:56,402 --> 00:24:57,603
You're running out of time.

440
00:24:57,843 --> 00:24:59,963
Our collaboration with Mad Eye
is already in progress.

441
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:01,922
If you don't agree to it now,

442
00:25:02,082 --> 00:25:03,243
Fingertip Comics will lose

443
00:25:03,363 --> 00:25:04,523
the last initiative rights.

444
00:25:04,643 --> 00:25:05,643
By then,

445
00:25:05,883 --> 00:25:07,843
you're the sinner of Fingertip Comics.

446
00:25:09,682 --> 00:25:11,523
(Talking about ethics with me?)

447
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:14,282
(So sorry. You got the wrong person.)

448
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:17,883
Thank you for your kindness.

449
00:25:18,123 --> 00:25:19,723
But please stop forcing me.

450
00:25:19,922 --> 00:25:21,082
You're putting me in a bad spot.

451
00:25:21,483 --> 00:25:23,003
Xuezhou and I are united.

452
00:25:23,243 --> 00:25:24,963
Before we reach a consensus,

453
00:25:26,603 --> 00:25:28,082
I won't sign the agreement.

454
00:25:39,322 --> 00:25:41,562
Who wants to be a villain, right?

455
00:25:42,963 --> 00:25:45,442
I'm also in spite of myself.

456
00:25:48,162 --> 00:25:49,042
So shameless.

457
00:25:49,322 --> 00:25:50,603
That scoundrel Su Lun

458
00:25:51,243 --> 00:25:52,603
is asking for the copyright
without anything in exchange.

459
00:25:53,523 --> 00:25:54,282
Shameless.

460
00:25:55,003 --> 00:25:55,682
Scoundrel.

461
00:26:07,603 --> 00:26:09,202
Su Lun is so mean.

462
00:26:09,963 --> 00:26:11,682
He wants to lead us around by the nose.

463
00:26:12,202 --> 00:26:13,243
And that Xia Chuyun,

464
00:26:13,402 --> 00:26:14,922
who doesn't understand
anything about content,

465
00:26:15,322 --> 00:26:17,082
relied on her networks
to climb the corporate ladder.

466
00:26:17,322 --> 00:26:18,723
She's so arrogant.

467
00:26:20,603 --> 00:26:21,322
Xuezhou,

468
00:26:22,042 --> 00:26:23,483
let's leave together

469
00:26:24,603 --> 00:26:25,802
after I've saved enough indemnity fee.

470
00:26:27,802 --> 00:26:30,042
Boss, just wait until we have money.

471
00:26:30,243 --> 00:26:32,963
Don't be angry.
It will bring harm to your health.

472
00:26:33,202 --> 00:26:34,282
It's all thanks to you.

473
00:26:34,682 --> 00:26:35,643
If you hadn't stopped me,

474
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:37,243
I'd have already gone
to reason with them.

475
00:26:37,483 --> 00:26:39,003
Reasoning never works

476
00:26:39,123 --> 00:26:41,363
in the business world.

477
00:26:41,483 --> 00:26:42,922
You'll find people like Xia Chuyun

478
00:26:43,723 --> 00:26:44,963
everywhere.

479
00:26:45,723 --> 00:26:46,483
What's most important now

480
00:26:46,562 --> 00:26:48,202
is the issue with Qianye Film & TV.

481
00:26:49,562 --> 00:26:52,643
Su Lun has a good hand in this.

482
00:26:53,682 --> 00:26:56,363
But he's way too young
and has revealed his flaws.

483
00:26:57,082 --> 00:26:58,643
God Xuezhou, what kind of tricks

484
00:26:59,162 --> 00:27:00,682
have you seen through?

485
00:27:01,723 --> 00:27:03,003
It's thanks to your probing

486
00:27:03,282 --> 00:27:05,442
that he showed
his true colors in the chaos.

487
00:27:06,123 --> 00:27:07,442
But he's too impatient.

488
00:27:07,682 --> 00:27:08,523
I've asked around.

489
00:27:08,883 --> 00:27:11,003
Mad Eye Comics didn't even have
better resources on hand.

490
00:27:11,123 --> 00:27:12,682
And Qianye Film & TV has no reason

491
00:27:12,763 --> 00:27:14,162
to reject such a good project like ours.

492
00:27:14,243 --> 00:27:16,723
His rejection shows

493
00:27:17,243 --> 00:27:19,603
that the problem lies
within Qingye Film & TV.

494
00:27:20,442 --> 00:27:21,243
Brother,

495
00:27:21,603 --> 00:27:22,603
isn't it agreed upon that I'll take over

496
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,202
the company's comics adaptation project?

497
00:27:24,322 --> 00:27:26,442
You asked someone to interfere.
What do you mean now?

498
00:27:26,883 --> 00:27:28,082
This is the office.

499
00:27:28,562 --> 00:27:30,123
It's not a place for you
to behave atrociously.

500
00:27:30,643 --> 00:27:32,643
The board of directors
has given you such a long time.

501
00:27:34,123 --> 00:27:35,363
Have you produced any results?

502
00:27:36,802 --> 00:27:39,082
You always want me to be independent.

503
00:27:39,562 --> 00:27:41,042
Now that I'd put
so much effort into the project,

504
00:27:41,162 --> 00:27:42,562
you started to pick on everything I do.

505
00:27:42,763 --> 00:27:44,603
You got to show me

506
00:27:44,922 --> 00:27:45,843
some results，

507
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:47,442
and your attitude in life and career...

508
00:27:47,603 --> 00:27:49,802
All right. All right.
There you go again.

509
00:27:50,042 --> 00:27:52,523
Calluses have formed
in my ears after hearing this.

510
00:27:54,202 --> 00:27:55,162
Give me your word.

511
00:27:55,483 --> 00:27:56,723
Are you going to let me handle

512
00:27:56,802 --> 00:27:58,243
the Fingertip Comics project or not?

513
00:27:58,483 --> 00:27:59,562
If you don't,

514
00:27:59,723 --> 00:28:00,643
then stop saying

515
00:28:00,763 --> 00:28:01,843
that I'm being irresponsible
and fooling around.

516
00:28:01,963 --> 00:28:03,523
It's you who drag me down!

517
00:28:04,322 --> 00:28:05,322
Shut up!

518
00:28:10,883 --> 00:28:11,603
I think

519
00:28:11,763 --> 00:28:13,402
you'd better not come
into the office again.

520
00:28:13,682 --> 00:28:14,723
Just do what you want.

521
00:28:15,042 --> 00:28:16,523
Save me from feeling upset.

522
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:20,202
Fine, I'll leave then.
I won't wait on you anymore!

523
00:28:21,363 --> 00:28:22,402
Why do you think

524
00:28:22,402 --> 00:28:24,042
he's so eager to trick you?

525
00:28:24,322 --> 00:28:25,562
It's because he thinks that you

526
00:28:25,682 --> 00:28:26,603
are his most important bargaining chip

527
00:28:26,723 --> 00:28:28,363
to fight against his brother.

528
00:28:29,603 --> 00:28:31,123
When the powerful fight, commoners
will get caught in the crossfire.

529
00:28:31,763 --> 00:28:33,963
But still, they don't have
to stop our project.

530
00:28:34,243 --> 00:28:35,843
It's Tian Zhan from Mad Eye Comics

531
00:28:35,843 --> 00:28:37,003
who is causing all these troubles.

532
00:28:37,243 --> 00:28:38,282
He collected

533
00:28:38,402 --> 00:28:39,562
vast copyright resources

534
00:28:39,682 --> 00:28:41,363
and exchanged them
with Qianye Film & TV.

535
00:28:41,603 --> 00:28:42,843
There's no other way?

536
00:28:43,963 --> 00:28:44,643
That's not so.

537
00:28:44,802 --> 00:28:45,963
Now that we know

538
00:28:46,082 --> 00:28:47,723
the cause of the issue,

539
00:28:47,843 --> 00:28:49,082
it's our turn

540
00:28:49,202 --> 00:28:51,363
to turn things around.

541
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:52,322
Can't we speak directly

542
00:28:52,442 --> 00:28:54,082
with Su Mu himself?

543
00:28:54,202 --> 00:28:54,843
No.

544
00:28:55,003 --> 00:28:56,402
I've talked to his assistant.

545
00:28:56,723 --> 00:28:58,603
They rejected us outright.

546
00:29:01,402 --> 00:29:02,963
I feel that our breakthrough point

547
00:29:03,883 --> 00:29:05,003
lies in Su Lun.

548
00:29:05,123 --> 00:29:05,802
That's right.

549
00:29:07,322 --> 00:29:09,243
I decided to stop Su Lun tomorrow

550
00:29:09,523 --> 00:29:11,202
and drag him onboard

551
00:29:11,402 --> 00:29:13,562
and fight with them
till the end together.

552
00:29:13,802 --> 00:29:14,843
I'll go with you.

553
00:29:15,123 --> 00:29:17,282
Xuezhou, when I encountered
issues in the past,

554
00:29:17,442 --> 00:29:19,483
I often evaded them behind your back.

555
00:29:19,723 --> 00:29:21,682
This time around,
I will fight together with you.

556
00:29:22,162 --> 00:29:23,123
Yes, Xuezhou.

557
00:29:23,402 --> 00:29:26,483
We, the Bai Qi team, will always
advance and retreat together.

558
00:29:27,162 --> 00:29:28,282
Come on. Go!

559
00:29:29,243 --> 00:29:30,523
Go!

560
00:29:31,162 --> 00:29:31,843
Go!

561
00:29:40,282 --> 00:29:41,922
When are you all going to cook again?

562
00:29:42,162 --> 00:29:43,802
I want to find a chance
to ask Lin Xuezhou out.

563
00:29:45,402 --> 00:29:46,883
Why do you keep thinking about food?

564
00:29:47,042 --> 00:29:48,442
Can you come up with something fresh?

565
00:29:48,763 --> 00:29:49,922
You're really vengeful.

566
00:29:50,042 --> 00:29:51,042
You're getting even with me now?

567
00:29:51,483 --> 00:29:53,883
You're already a winner in life
with a cat and a girlfriend.

568
00:29:54,123 --> 00:29:54,922
But it has been a long while

569
00:29:54,922 --> 00:29:56,202
since I saw Lin Xuezhou.

570
00:29:56,322 --> 00:29:57,963
She was always busy when I texted her.

571
00:29:58,282 --> 00:29:59,643
Didn't you see her just yesterday?

572
00:30:00,322 --> 00:30:02,363
Besides, your frequency
in sending her messages

573
00:30:02,723 --> 00:30:03,843
has become an act of harassment.

574
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:04,483
Well...

575
00:30:05,922 --> 00:30:06,763
But

576
00:30:07,402 --> 00:30:09,562
Qin Ge didn't sound good today.
