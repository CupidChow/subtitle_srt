I can't believe that you work

raise the baby together.

to become a good father.

is messed up.

115

Everything is just dreadful to me,

116
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,220
do you know that?

117
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,100
Xuezhou, fret not.

118
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,180
Even though I can't give birth
to the baby

119
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,580
on your behalf,

120
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,140
I assure you

121
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,220
I'll be fully responsible

122
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,340
after the baby is born.

123
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,180
I'm willing to be a househusband
for your sake

124
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,940
so as not to give up your career.

125
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,100
You can go work outside and
I take care of the house and the baby.

126
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,260
Alright?

127
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:10,900
Are you sure?

128
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:12,900
I am.

129
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,420
We're in the hospital now.

130
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,660
Please don't despise me

131
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,180
for being a sponger.

132
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,660
Can't you make your own money?

133
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,380
But, I don't mind sponging on you.

134
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,220
How cheeky of you.

135
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,300
The winds of change have come.

136
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,140
It's finally your time to serve me.

137
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,380
Cut it out.

138
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,100
Since you've finished eating
and come around to this reality,

139
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,260
go to bed now.

140
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,740
Fine. You may leave now.

141
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:55,940
Understood.

142
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,940
I shall take my leave now.

143
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,300
Be careful with your leg.

144
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,980
Be careful with your abdomen.

145
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,660
This will happen to you too.

146
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,660
Congratulations.

147
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,060
But, has Xuezhou accepted this yet?

148
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,540
Of course.

149
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,700
After all, this pregnancy is born
from our love.

150
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,060
Why don't you share this happy moment
with me?

151
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,620
Didn't I just congratulate you?

152
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,620
It's not enough.

153
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,900
Now, I want to pass this happiness

154
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,340
to you.

155
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,780
What do you mean?

156
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,940
Xuezhou is at the early pregnancy stage
at this moment

157
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,180
and she's averted to work and exertion.

158
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,540
Therefore, our wedding

159
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,860
must be postponed.

160
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,100
However, it'll be such a waste

161
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,260
of the venue and reservation.

162
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,180
Why not give you and Qin Ge a chance

163
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,540
to advance your relationship
to another stage?

164
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,380
I'd love to.

165
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,900
But, I don't think Qin Ge will
accept my proposal.

166
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,500
You're such a coward.

167
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,460
The challenges in your relationship

168
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,380
have been long resolved already,

169
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,740
yet you've not taken any action.

170
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,740
I tell you what,

171
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,100
prepare some rose petals

172
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,980
and spread them all over the bed tonight.

173
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,220
When she comes back home, you...

174
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,820
Xuezhou is sleeping now.

175
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,540
I came here to fetch Bai Qijia
to go home.

176
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,420
I...I'll go and take a look at Xuezhou.

177
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:50,980
Procrastinator Bai,

178
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,140
don't forget what I told you just now.

179
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,340
Give it a thought.

180
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,180
(What do I do?)

181
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,020
(I didn't know Bai Qijia)

182
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,500
(has thought of the marriage proposal.)

183
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,580
(But, if he proposes to me,)

184
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,820
(should I accept it?)

185
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,740
(What will he do then?)

186
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,460
(Don't tell me)

187
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,740
(he'll kneel in the restaurant again.)

188
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,300
Don't worry.

189
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,940
I won't force

190
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,020
something you dislike on you.

191
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,180
Good night.

192
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,580
Do you mean both of you laid on one bed

193
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,700
and just slept?

194
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,940
He's letting you evade the issue again.

195
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,460
I don't think I was evading.

196
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,060
I just

197
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,660
feel that

198
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,020
something is lacking.

199
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,660
What's that?

200
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:34,820
Listen,

201
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,260
both of you have been through
so many obstacles

202
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,140
after you've united with each other.

203
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,380
I tell you what,

204
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,420
you have experienced so much

205
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,900
and Bai Qijia has taken
as many steps as he could

206
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,740
towards you.

207
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,020
You should take the final step.

208
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,980
The final step?

209
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,100
Watch out.

210
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,660
Dr. Bai.

211
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,340
Your hand is hurt.

212
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,380
I'm fine.

213
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,580
You need to bandage now.

214
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,420
Did you see that?

215
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,100
What's it?

216
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,020
Dr. Bai is bleeding a lot.

217
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,740
Yes, I did. I overheard

218
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,340
that Director Cao was reprimanding him just now.

219
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,700
Would his hand be handicapped?

220
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,700
Handicapped?

221
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,140
Dr. Bai.

222
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,660
Bai Qijia.

223
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,620
What has happened to you

224
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,740
this morning?

225
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,420
And you didn't tell me about this.

226
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,540
I'm alright.

227
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,540
Come on in. I'll explain to you.

228
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,100
Come, have a seat.

229
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,980
Honestly, it's nothing to worry about.

230
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,780
When I was outside this morning,

231
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,580
a brick fell out of the blue.

232
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,660
I'm not sure about the wound
until the bandage is removed.

233
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,060
That's serious.

234
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,300
Ouch.

235
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,620
I'm sorry.

236
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,020
You're the pillar of the hospital.

237
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,900
What if the injury

238
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,900
doesn't recover?

239
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,180
Well.

240
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,300
I'll work at the back end.

241
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,340
At least I still can come to my own

242
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,900
in the hospital.

243
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,620
Don't worry.

244
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,860
We can find you the best doctor

245
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,460
from all over the world.

246
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:01,180
It's fine even if your hand

247
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,500
can't be healed,

248
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,260
I'll look after you
for the rest of my life.

249
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,580
Besides, you're an excellent character.

250
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,380
I'm sure you'll excel

251
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,220
in every job.

252
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,460
Certainly.

253
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,620
In that case,

254
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,540
I'll be counting on you then.

255
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,020
Don't move. Your hand is hurt.

256
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,060
My hand hurt,

257
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,540
but my lips are fine.

258
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:27,780
Hold on.

259
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,500
Bai Qijia.

260
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,820
What exactly has happened?

261
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,460
You'd better own up

262
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,860
or heavy punishments await you.

263
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,580
It's a small wound. Thank you.

264
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,700
Everyone in the hospital

265
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,860
has heard about your courageous deed.

266
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,260
Luckily, it's not serious.

267
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,540
It's just a flesh wound
and will recover within one week.

268
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,300
I heard

269
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,260
you're given a few days off.

270
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,460
You may use it
to keep your girlfriend company.

271
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,060
All of us

272
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,220
have learnt about you and Qin Ge.

273
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,540
What a romantic love story.

274
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,260
Forget it.

275
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,940
We're quite compatible though.

276
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,500
One with an injured leg,
while another with a wounded hand.

277
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,380
Well, tell me then.

278
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,900
Why did you move back here?

279
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,460
I don't want you to worry about me.

280
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,500
I'd be more worried
if you didn't tell me.

281
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,980
I'm sorry.

282
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,860
Please don't do this again.

283
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,580
I'll spare you this time.

284
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:40,980
Thank you.

285
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,300
It's already cooled.

286
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,060
Is it?

287
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,500
It is.

288
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,500
Eat this.

289
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,780
I don't like it.

290
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:10,740
Egg?

291
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,180
Too big for me.

292
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,580
Here, a smaller piece.

293
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,500
How was it?

294
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,540
Yesterday,

295
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,900
I got to muddle through.

296
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,500
Besides,

297
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,580
I still can't make up my mind.

298
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,060
Is it because of your sickness?

299
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:48,980
I think

300
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,460
I should give everything to my loved one
if I love him.

301
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,300
But, I just can't give him
a complete family.

302
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,820
Quit saying nonsense.

303
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,060
You're everything to Bai Qijia.

304
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,660
You're the only antidote
to bring him back to his senses.

305
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,780
I can't bear to expose

306
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,980
his past to you.

307
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,660
Tell us.

308
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,620
Fine.

309
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,620
You have no idea how pitiful he was

310
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,060
after you've left him.

311
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,060
He was indeed cold and aloof back then.

312
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,660
I was afraid that someone might
retaliate against him.

313
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:16,820
Seriously?

314
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,460
Tell us

315
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,260
about Procrastinator Bai
when he was in the university.

316
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,260
Well,

317
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,940
I shall start from our university days.

318
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,460
Buddies,

319
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,180
we're going to share this room

320
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,860
for the coming years.

321
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:35,660
I've bought

322
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,700
something delicious for you.

323
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,940
Please help yourself.

324
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,380
-Thank you.
-Thank you, bro.

325
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,020
Bro, you're finally here.
We're waiting for you.

326
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,940
My name is Lu Tian, I'm from Qingchuan.

327
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,300
My father is the president
of Qingchuan Hospital.

328
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,500
So, he forced me to study medicine.

329
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,740
What's your name?

330
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:52,900
Bai Qijia.

331
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,500
I see.

332
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,460
It's rest time.

333
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,660
Please keep your voice down.

334
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,220
How cocky of you.

335
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,860
I couldn't care less

00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,060
You're always in good form.

502
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,820
Mr. Bai, you're thoughtful.

503
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,780
Are you both getting married soon?

504
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,780
We've already registered for marriage.

505
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,660
Mr. Bai.

506
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,740
May I show Miss Qin the wedding plan

507
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,180
you prepared before?

508
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,980
When did you prepare it?

509
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:29,980
Who were you going to marry?

510
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,300
Certainly,

511
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,460
it's you.

512
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,180
After you left last time,

513
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,500
Mr. Bai requested

514
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,860
some references

515
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,020
for the wedding.

516
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,180
He said

517
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,820
he'll show it to you

518
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,900
when you come again.

519
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,980
How would you know

520
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,540
that I'd come here with you again?

521
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,340
Because the fact

522
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,860
proved what I thought.

523
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,100
Your delivery girl has arrived.

524
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,060
Here's your coffee.

525
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,300
Thank you.

526
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,380
Little Orange.

527
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,260
Why are you here instead of working
in the office

528
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,260
at this hour?

529
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:13,140
Because I want to ask you for a favour.

530
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,500
What's it?

531
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,300
Miss Bai Qi and Dr. Bai

532
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,660
are getting married soon

533
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,220
and I wonder what should I prepare
for their gift.

534
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,740
Could you please help me
choose the present?

535
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,380
What's that look on your face?

536
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,260
Don't tell me you haven't let go yet.

537
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:28,980
No.

538
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,820
You've overthought.

539
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,060
Min, you're naughty.

540
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,740
Come on. Let's go to the stores nearby.

541
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:36,940
Let's go.

542
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,820
This little duck resembles you.

543
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,300
This looks like you.

544
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,060
-It's chubby.
-Not at all.

545
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,140
Look at the fat and round tummy.

546
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:59,140
Just like you, you two are chubby.

547
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,940
Sunglasses over there.
Let's take a look at them.

548
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,660
Come on.

549
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,100
What about these?

550
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,500
Put them on.

551
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,380
-Put them on.
-No.

552
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,860
This looks really nice.

553
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,500
Look in the mirror.

554
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,140
It's funny.

555
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,700
Oh goodness, these don't suit me.

556
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:22,580
What about we choose sunglasses

557
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,420
as the present
for Miss Bai Qi and Dr. Bai?

558
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,500
These?

559
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,140
I don't think it's a good idea.

560
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,620
True though.

561
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,900
Maybe we choose the tableware?

562
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,620
It brings auspicious blessing
to the couple and is useful as well.

563
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,700
Tableware is a great choice.

564
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,260
However,

565
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,540
do you mean "us"?

566
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,500
We pick this together

567
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,380
and of course, we're giving
this present to them.

568
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,620
Why? Are you not happy about this?

569
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,460
Not at all.

570
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,860
Let's go over that section

571
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,380
and look for the tableware. Come.

572
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,900
Which design do you prefer?

573
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,460
This one or that one?

574
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,260
This is beautiful.

575
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,860
I think this is good.

576
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,420
Simple and elegant.

577
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,580
It's suitable for Qin Ge and Bai Qijia.

578
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,940
Sure. We'll take this.

579
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,380
Please wrap this up for me.

580
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,180
Thank you.

581
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,220
Sure.

582
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,180
I just remember

583
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,540
that my mug was missing

584
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,980
and I haven't found it yet.

585
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,380
Pick one from here

586
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,740
since we've come here.

587
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,340
Let's go. It's over there.

588
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,540
How about this?

589
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,540
Not bad.

590
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,180
Just say it's good or not

591
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,420
based on what you think.

592
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,820
Don't give a vague answer.

593
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,020
This one is not bad

594
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,020
for being alone.

595
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,180
But, when it comes in a pair,

596
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,100
they look good.

597
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,500
I just need one for myself,

598
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,500
two mugs are just too many.

599
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,260
I'll take one.

600
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:01,620
I lost my mug

601
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,500
a few days ago.

602
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,620
I'll buy it

603
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,180
as a gift for you.

604
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,300
Little Orange.

605
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,740
I just received a call from the office

606
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,500
as something urgent came up.

607
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,980
I need to go back to the office.

608
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,420
Alright.

609
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,100
I'll send this to you later.

610
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:36,980
Sure.

611
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,060
Well...

612
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,620
I'm off then.

613
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,500
Show yourself.

614
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,260
Why did you come again?

615
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,140
Didn't I tell you

616
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,060
that I won't collaborate with you
anymore?

617
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,860
Hold that thought.

618
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:10,500
Manager is waiting for you in the restaurant.

619
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,140
We'll talk about it when you meet him.

620
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,860
Open your mouth.

621
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,500
Are you treating me like a kid?

622
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,220
Aren't you the kid...

623
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,780
kid's mother?

624
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,420
Chop-chop. Drink it now.

625
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,740
I don't want to.

626
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,380
I've put on weight lately.

627
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,060
If this keeps on going,

628
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,780
I can't fit into my bridesmaid dress.

629
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,300
Can it be altered to one size bigger,
can't it?

630
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,820
No way.

631
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,420
The other bridesmaids will

632
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:39,700
dress up beautifully.

633
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:42,100
But I have to wear a plus size dress
and flats.

634
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,460
This is not fair.

635
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,460
Because you're pregnant now.

636
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,580
So what?

637
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:49,100
Why can't pregnant women wear makeup

638
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,420
and dress up?

639
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,500
I won't comply with it.

640
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,420
I'm telling you,

641
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,900
I'm going to plaster myself in makeup
and wear high heels.

642
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,700
I want to outshine
the other bridesmaids.

643
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,420
No problem. I'm behind you all the way.

644
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,300
But, you just had a pregnancy check-up

645
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,020
and the doctor said
your blood volume is low.

646
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,060
You need food that contains iron.

647
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,820
The soup is rich in iron.

648
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,140
Drink it.

649
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:09,660
-Open your mouth.
-You're a doctor,

650
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,140
yet you still need advice
from another doctor?

651
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,900
How does it taste? Is it nice?

652
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,020
Taste good.

653
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:17,820
Drink some more.

654
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,260
