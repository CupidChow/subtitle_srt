19
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,570
Why are they here?

20
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:57,890
Xuezhou!

21
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:10,930
What are they doing?

22
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,420
I'm going inside.

23
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,100
Whatever for?

24
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,250
Do you know who that man

25
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,140
that went inside there with Min is?

26
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,530
It's Cheng Jun.

27
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,660
He works for Tian Zhan
from Mad Eye Comics.

28
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,140
And?

29
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,690
They had a fallout.

30
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,420
So why are they here together?

31
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,220
Revenge?

32
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:30,420
It can't be.

33
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,970
They can't exactly do something like that

34
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,420
in broad daylight.

35
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,580
Besides, even if you're right,

36
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,580
they wouldn't do that in a restaurant.

37
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,500
You have a point.

38
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,220
Is he trying to get trade secrets

39
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,300
of Qianye Film & TV through Min?

40
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:48,530
Xuezhou,

41
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,530
you shouldn't think the worst of them.

42
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,500
Maybe they are just here for a meal.

43
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,170
Me? Think the worst of someone?

44
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,940
I'm sorry. Wrong choice of words.

45
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,940
What I mean is

46
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:02,220
you're pregnant right now.

47
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,220
Your emotions are unstable.

48
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,450
Don't think the worst of this just yet.

49
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,300
Min is an adult.

50
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,170
I'm sure he can handle himself.

51
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,530
Let's go back to our table.

52
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,380
The baby is hungry. Come on.

53
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:15,380
Let's go.

54
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,890
It has been a while, Mr. Chen.

55
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,220
What do you want?

56
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,610
If there's nothing else,

57
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,810
I'll begin to make the arrangements

58
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:35,780
according to your requests.

59
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:37,450
Okay. Thank you.

60
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,580
You're welcome.

61
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,890
Both of your parents will be expected
to give a speech at the wedding.

62
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,450
Please confirm that with your parents

63
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,020
and inform the officiant in advance.

64
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,220
All right.

65
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,450
Got it. Thank you.

66
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,500
You're welcome.

67
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:57,500
Are you still thinking

68
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,170
about the wedding banquet?

69
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:00,890
Don't overthink it.

70
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,250
I'll handle everything.

71
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,860
No. It's not that
I don't want her to come...

72
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:06,810
But...

73
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,890
I don't want anyone
to take my mother's place.

74
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,020
I understand.

75
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,530
You don't want to make things hard
for your father either.

76
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,020
In that case,

77
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,860
I'll talk to him.

78
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,090
No need.

79
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,820
I'll talk to him.

80
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,660
It's my wedding,

81
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:26,820
but I want

82
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,980
the people who come to my wedding
to enjoy it too.

83
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,940
All right. Here, I'll give you strength.

84
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,130
Be careful.

85
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,130
Put me down. I can walk by myself.

86
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,660
We aren't even married yet, and you're
already telling me what not to do.

87
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,010
What will happen after we get married?

88
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,730
I just don't want you
to tire yourself out.

89
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,260
I want to do this.

90
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,060
Put me down.

91
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,700
Qin Ge, did you miss me?

92
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,700
No. I have something to tell you.

93
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:10,330
I'm getting married.

94
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:14,130
What?

95
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:15,410
I said I'm getting...

96
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:16,540
Married?

97
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,890
No, I... Qin Ge is getting married!

98
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,290
I... Qin Ge!

99
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,780
When... When did you decide that?

100
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,260
Why didn't you tell me this sooner?

101
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:24,660
When is she getting married?

102
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,570
I'm asking her that now.

103
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,260
Dad...

104
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,220
We must choose a good date.

105
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,380
Let's check the calendar.

106
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,500
We must choose an auspicious day.

107
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,610
Tell us everything

108
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,540
you need.
We will make all the arrangements!

109
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:37,100
Everything has to be perfect!
Only the best for your wedding!

110
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,220
What about her wedding dress?

111
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,220
I know. I'm asking her.

112
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,700
Okay. It's settled then.

113
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,170
I'm so happy!

114
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,100
I...

115
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,450
I...

116
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,730
Careful.

117
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,980
What is it? Did it not go well?

118
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,980
My dad is over the moon.

119
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,610
I couldn't even get a word in edgeways.

120
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,170
I said,

121
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,610
"I'll leave it up to you guys.

122
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,130
I just wanted to let you guys know."

123
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,780
Don't worry.
I'm sure he'll discuss things with you

124
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:20,820
once he calms down.

125
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,060
I hope so.

126
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,450
What are you looking at?

127
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,570
I'm checking the flow of the wedding. Look.

128
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,000
(Wedding Hotels and Themes)

129
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,220
You've looked that up many times.

130
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:33,940
Bai Qijia,

131
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,500
are you

132
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,570
nervous?

133
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,730
A little.

134
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,570
It can't be helped.
It's my first wedding.

135
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,060
It'll be better the second time.

136
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,170
The second time?

137
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,220
Bai Qijia, answer me.

138
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,290
How many times do you plan
to get married, and with whom?

139
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:53,540
With you.

140
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,850
I would marry you a hundred times.

141
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,940
Getting married is so much work.

142
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:05,500
I don't want to get married anymore.

143
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:06,450
What did you say?

144
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:07,500
What did you just say?

145
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:08,330
-I don't want to get married.
-What did you say?

146
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:09,450
I don't want to get married.

147
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,060
I don't want to get married...

148
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,170
Stop that!

149
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,780
I don't want to get married. Bai Qijia!

150
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,570
Miss Bai Qi,

151
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,570
Liang and I

152
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,010
can be part of your bridal party
on your wedding day.

153
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,130
We'll help you with the gatecrashing.

154
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:25,850
Sure!

155
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,010
Make sure you guys stand in front of me
and guard that gate.

156
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,010
Don't let them in so easily.

157
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,660
Don't worry. We won't let them through

158
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,940
until they give us
a big enough red packet.

159
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,700
Take it easy, guys.

160
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,540
Don't go overboard.

161
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,570
Miss Bai Qi is soft on her fiance.

162
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,380
Eat the candies.
All those candies and still not enough

163
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,330
-to shut your mouths.
-All right, everyone.

164
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,260
You've had the wedding candies.
Time to get back to work.

165
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:45,330
You guys aren't
the ones getting married.

166
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:46,780
Why are you guys so excited about this?

167
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:47,700
Get back to work.

168
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:48,890
Let's go.

169
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:49,940
-Back to work.
-Let's go.

170
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,330
Careful.

171
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:54,570
Xuezhou.

172
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:56,850
Did your belly get bigger again

173
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:57,980
in the few days since I last saw you?

174
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,450
Oh, don't bring that up.

175
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:02,450
The doctor said my blood sugar was low
during my maternity checkup.

176
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,660
Lu Tian kept feeding me
all those nourishing stuff.

177
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,260
I gained a lot of weight.

178
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,730
It's a pain.

179
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,130
Here. This is good for you.

180
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:15,290
Take it.

181
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,220
All right. Thanks.

182
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,610
Well, do it for the sake

183
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,380
of the baby.

184
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:23,940
I know.

185
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,220
Oh, right.

186
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,380
I saw Min and Cheng Jun
together yesterday.

187
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:31,610
Where?

188
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,260
At the restaurant.

189
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,260
I saw them go inside
a VIP room together.

190
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,610
They didn't come out for a long time.

191
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,940
I'm worried.

192
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,090
You don't think Tian Zhan

193
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:41,410
is going to do something
to Min again, is he?

194
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,700
I heard Qin Ge is getting married.

195
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,610
Yes.

196
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:09,460
Oh, my poor unrequited love...

197
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,090
Who is she marrying?
I'm going to object to her marriage.

198
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,850
Oh, drop the act.

199
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,970
You just got a girlfriend overseas,
didn't you?

200
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,850
Actually, I've learned something

201
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,090
from being overseas all these years.

202
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,170
Life is short.

203
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:25,530
Why bother wasting your time and energy

204
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:26,940
on something that won't happen?

205
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:27,970
Right?

206
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,090
You're right.

207
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,260
So maybe it's about time
for you to move on too.

208
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,500
Don't make things difficult
for yourself.

209
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:39,410
Me?

210
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,260
Yes.

211
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,290
I can tell you really like Qin Ge.

212
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:43,500
But she

213
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,460
isn't interested in you
in that way at all.

214
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,260
Min!

215
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:50,850
Little Orange?

216
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,060
Come with me!

217
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:54,210
Bye.

218
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:58,060
So you've already moved on.

219
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,850
Young people these days.

220
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:01,610
Heartless.

221
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:04,500
Little Orange,

222
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,260
why did you bring me here?

223
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,530
Min,

224
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,580
you went to see
my uncle yesterday, didn't you?

225
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:11,580
How did you know that?

226
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:12,730
Did he talk to you

227
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:14,210
about us?

228
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:19,900
I knew it.

229
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,060
Come with me.

230
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,290
Look at this.

231
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,140
It's good.

232
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,170
What do you think?

233
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:30,460
Not bad.

234
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,290
This will do.

235
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,020
Little Orange.

236
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:32,500
It's fine.

237
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,340
Why are you two here?

238
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,140
Uncle, listen up.

239
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,090
I like Min very, very much.

240
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,650
I've liked him for a long time.

241
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,340
My feelings for him are sincere,

242
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,580
and he is the same.

243
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,580
If you try to stop us,

244
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:49,460
I'll...

245
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,460
I'll make sure it's too late
for you to object!

246
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,580
Little Orange.

247
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,340
Don't stop me, Min.

248
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,940
I'm going to defend our love

249
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:58,940
today!

250
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:04,970
Why are you laughing?

251
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:08,500
Min.

252
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,700
Tell her what I told you

253
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,060
yesterday.

254
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,410
Don't be nervous.

255
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,650
I just want to know

256
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,020
where you stand in your relationship

257
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,650
with Little Orange.

258
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:25,650
That's none of your business.

259
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,820
Young man,

260
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,900
I suggest you come clean now

261
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,900
to avoid unnecessary trouble.

262
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,060
Trouble?

263
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:38,170
I'm not afraid of trouble.

264
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:39,410
But if you guys

265
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:41,060
dare to give Little Orange any trouble

266
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,530
and upset her,

267
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,210
you guys
will find yourselves in trouble.

268
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,940
Us? In trouble?

269
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:52,170
It sounds like

270
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,650
you guys have a close relationship.

271
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,410
Little Orange is true to me.

272
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,170
I won't let her down,

273
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,460
and I definitely won't
let you guys intimidate her.

274
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,970
Tell me how much you want.

275
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,340
What?

276
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,380
Five million.

277
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,060
Is that enough?

278
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:20,340
If that's not enough,
I can give you the entire corporation.

279
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:22,850
What do you mean?

280
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,410
What do I mean?

281
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,650
I want you...

282
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,260
To marry her as soon as possible!

283
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,650
Please, Mr. Chen!

284
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:57,940
Please!

285
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,340
-Please!
-Please!

286
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,460
How about it, Little Orange?

287
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:09,090
I didn't disappoint you, right?

288
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,290
What the heck?

289
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,700
Mr. Tian

290
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,380
didn't know
about your relationship before this.

291
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,650
Now that he knows

292
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:16,820
how slowly you guys are moving,

293
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,820
he had to give you guys an extra push.

294
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,140
Our Little Orange

295
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,460
is finally taken.

296
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:26,410
That's right. She is already talking

297
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:27,210
about

298
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,020
skipping the proper steps now.

299
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:30,770
The Tian Family

300
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,730
is the best when it comes to surprises.

301
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,500
Am I so desperate to get married?

302
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,770
I am the most beautiful woman
in the world.

303
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,020
There's a line of people who want me
from here all the way to Paris.

304
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,730
My goodness...

305
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,940
Well, it doesn't matter
if you are serious or not.

306
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,060
You guys will follow
the proper procedure.

307
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,900
Min, you heard

308
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:55,940
what she said.

309
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,610
As a man,

310
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,410
you mustn't lose the initiative.

311
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,770
Come on. Let's leave this space to them.

312
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,260
Min,

313
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,460
why didn't you stop me earlier?

314
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,770
Given your personality,

315
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:22,460
do you think I would've been able to?

316
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,290
Don't give me that.

317
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,020
I have the perfect reason to believe

318
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,260
that you just wanted
to see me embarrass myself.

319
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:40,530
Little Orange.

320
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:44,020
I owe you a proper answer.

321
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,380
Because I've been thinking

322
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,380
about what I should do

323
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,140
to make you happy
and give you what you deserve.

324
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,260
The more I think about it,
the more I feel that I'm not good enough.

325
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:57,940
That I need to do more and work harder.

326
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:00,290
You think too much.

327
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:02,730
I would be happy

328
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,850
as long as we're together.

329
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,820
Little Orange,

330
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,290
thank you for being by my side

331
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:13,380
and supporting me.

332
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,290
I've finally realised

333
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,940
my true feelings as well.

334
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:18,650
Don't worry.

335
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,820
You're not a replacement for anyone.

336
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,900
You've made your way into my heart.

337
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,850
Will you do me the honour
of becoming my girlfriend?

338
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,260
I want you

339
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:34,850
to be with me forever.

340
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,340
All right.

341
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,850
-Dad!
-Uncle!

342
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:33,820
What took you two so long to get back?

343
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,210
I've been sitting here all day.

344
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:36,380
What is the meaning of this?

345
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,460
You're getting married,

346
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:38,730
so you won't let your father
into your house anymore?

347
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,410
You changed the password.

348
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:41,970
-Dad...
-No.

349
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,970
Why did you come all of a sudden?

350
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,500
You didn't tell us you were coming.

351
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:46,650
We could've picked you up.

352
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,210
Well, I figured
since you guys were getting married,

353
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,850
you must have a lot of work to do.

354
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:51,770
I have free time on my hands,

355
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,970
so I thought I would come over and help.

356
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,900
There are days to go before the wedding.

357
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,340
Why are you here so early?

358
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,210
Oh, enough about that.
Just let me inside.

359
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,090
Come on.

360
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,060
I brought lots of things for you.

361
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:02,090
What?

362
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:03,210
I'll show them to you later.

363
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,090
Dates,

364
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,460
peanuts,

365
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:10,610
longan,

366
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,100
and lotus seeds.

367
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:15,580
These are to bless you with children.

368
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:17,530
Thank you, sir.

369
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,650
And this.

370
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,220
For the bed.

371
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,860
The embroidery is hand-stitched.

372
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,340
Beautiful and intricate.

373
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,650
Do you guys have dolls?

374
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:29,740
Dolls?

375
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:30,940
Dolls?

376
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,770
I knew you guys didn't prepare that.

377
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,620
So I brought them for you.

378
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,940
Here. One each.

379
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,460
Thank you.

380
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,410
You can't have a wedding room

381
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:41,650
without wedding dolls.

382
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:42,980
Dad, you...

383
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,370
What nonsense are these?

384
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,460
Thank you

385
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,890
for preparing all these for us.

386
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,060
See? Bai is an understanding boy.

387
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:51,740
Your stepmother

388
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,650
prepared all these.

389
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:56,170
Oh, right. Why isn't she here with you?

390
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,130
She won't be coming.

391
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:00,370
She said a wedding is a big event.

392
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,820
She can't take your mother's place.

393
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,130
But she can prepare

394
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,220
all these things for you.

395
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:10,410
Tell her I said thanks.

396
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:14,290
Let's go, Bai.

397
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:16,340
We need to set these up on the bed.

398
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,130
Okay.

399
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,060
Don't you do that on the wedding day?

400
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,940
Well, we need to know
if everything fits.

401
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,100
If not, we'll have to change them.

402
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:24,650
We'll be upstairs.

403
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:03,890
To Miss Bai Qi's

404
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,460
last night as a single woman!

405
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:10,340
A toast!

406
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:10,980
Cheers!

407
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,220
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

408
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,460
If only we could've gone

409
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,490
to a bar or club.

410
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,340
Why do you need a bar or a club?

411
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,940
Isn't Little Orange
enough entertainment?

412
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:21,770
That's right.

413
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:22,770
Well,

414
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,620
Little Orange
will be guarding the door tomorrow.

415
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:25,700
I think Bai Qijia

416
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,980
has a tough battle ahead of him.

417
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,700
As long as Dr. Bai gives us
a big enough red packet,

418
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:30,860
nothing will be a problem for him.

419
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,620
Money grubber.

420
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,700
Little Orange,
have you hidden the shoes?

421
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,890
Yes, ma'am!

422
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,490
Now, onto something serious.

423
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:40,340
Tomorrow,

424
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,340
they will be here to pick up
the bride at 11 a.m.

425
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,700
The makeup artist will be here at 5 a.m.

426
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,890
So no one is to oversleep.

427
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,580
Especially you, Little Orange.

428
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,220
Did you hear?

429
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,490
Yes, Xuezhou.

430
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,860
You've told me that three times.

431
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,170
I won't disappoint you.

432
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,250
Miss Bai Qi,
don't just stuff your face with food.

433
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:00,460
Say something.

434
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,530
I may be getting married,

435
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:07,170
but my soul will forever be free!

436
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,370
To the single life!

437
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:10,410
I

438
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,410
may be giving birth to a child,

439
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:14,940
but my soul will forever be free!

440
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,290
To the single life!

441
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:17,700
I am in a relationship now,

442
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,700
but my soul will forever be free!

443
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:21,290
To the single life!

444
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,100
Cheers!

445
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,720
(Double Happiness)

446
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:34,700
You should put one on too.

447
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,340
That's all right. I don't need it.

448
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,530
I'm still young. I don't need this.

449
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:42,010
But he is the one
getting married tomorrow.

450
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,940
Why do you have a mask on?

451
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,340
What do you know?

452
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,340
I'm his groomsman.

453
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:48,700
I need to look my best.

454
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:51,130
I can't embarrass Xuezhou.

455
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,890
Maybe I'll steal
the bride away tomorrow.

456
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,290
-Sure.
-As if you would dare.

457
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:00,820
Here.

458
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,530
Don't you even dare.

459
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:03,490
Here. Drink.

460
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:04,770
I still have some left.

461
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:06,250
Just kidding.

462
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:07,700
We'll pick her up together tomorrow.

463
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,620
Let's drink to our hearts' content!

464
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,620
Let's drink to our hearts' content!

465
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,820
Bottoms up.

466
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,620
I can't believe

467
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:19,250
that our school's famous bachelor

468
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,460
will be getting married before me.

469
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,370
Well,

470
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,890
thanks for letting me have that.

471
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,010
I'm not finished.

472
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:31,580
Fortunately, I overtook you
using another way

473
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,620
and got ahead of you.

474
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:35,170
Congratulations.

475
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,740
Haven't they always said

476
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:39,940
that marriage is where love goes to die?

477
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:43,170
Marriage means the death of romance.

478
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,010
I don't know

479
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:46,820
what you guys are competing about.

480
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,740
What do you know?

481
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,410
If

482
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,250
Qin Ge is in that grave,

483
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,820
I would be happy to stay there
with her forever.

484
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:01,340
My goodness.

485
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:02,410
Cheers.

486
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,170
How about it, Min?

487
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:14,620
The happiness of a married couple

488
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:16,940
is something you unmarried ones

489
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,940
can't understand.

490
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,530
Well, you guys won't ever be able

491
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,650
to get a taste of the freedom

492
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,740
we unmarried people have ever again.

493
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:30,290
Everyone is a free individual,

494
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,060
regardless of their marital status.

495
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,770
Come. Let's drink.

496
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,620
Deep.

497
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,060
Procrastinator Bai,

498
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:49,770
I'll sacrifice myself for you tonight

499
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,340
and spend your last night
as a single man with you.

500
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:53,370
Come on. To the bed.

501
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:54,410
Me too.

502
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,860
You two will be sleeping

503
00:23:58,130 --> 00:23:59,370
on the sofa tonight.

504
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,740
You're heartless.

505
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:02,740
We're your groomsmen.

506
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,700
We've got a lot of work to do tomorrow.

507
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,100
And you won't even let us
have a good night's rest.

508
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,060
Isn't that right, Min?

509
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:06,980
That's right.

510
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:08,460
You're inhumane.

511
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:13,220
All right. I'll grab the blankets.

512
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,580
That's more like it.

513
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:15,620
Oh, my.

514
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:17,410
Someone isn't actually here
to steal the bride, are they?

515
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:19,100
What nonsense are you talking about?

516
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:26,220
If you're here to snatch the bride,

517
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:27,980
then you've got the wrong place.

518
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:29,980
What?

519

Your bed...

523
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,940
Do you need another groomsman?

524
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,290
No!

525
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,290
I come bearing red packets.

526
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:48,290

Drink.

Bottoms up.

534
00:24:58,370 --> 00:24:59,370
Not that one.

535
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,250
This one.

536
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,290
All right.

537
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:02,340
Let's drink to our hearts' content.

then show me the red packets!

-The red packets.
-Red packets!

This isn't enough! More!

566

Keep it coming.

-The red packets.
-Red packets.

You can't join them and cheat.

588

I won't.

589

Red packets!

No.

604

Let us in.

605
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:11,220
No way.

I'll handle my wife.

607

Here. I'll handle this.

-Lu Tian.
-Go, Lu Tian!

609
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:15,940
Lu Tian.

610

Lu Tian.

611
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,700
All right.

612

-What?

613
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,650
What is this?

614
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:23,530
My beloved queen,

615
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,890
please let us inside.

616
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:25,860
Who are you?

617
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:26,980
Beat it.

618
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,490
Fine. You don't need to recognise me.

619
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:32,650
But do you know this?

620
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,820
Lu Tian has betrayed us!

621
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,460
He is a traitor!

622

He is one of us now.

626
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,740
What do we need to do to get inside?

627
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:46,530
All right.

628
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,290

629
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,060
you'll need to pass this challenge.

630
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:52,940
You will need to do push-ups, drink,
and answer questions.

631
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:53,980
All right?

632

No problem!

633
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,290
I'll do it.

634
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:58,410
I'll drink. You do the push-ups.

635
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,620
Five push-ups. Come on!

636
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:03,460
-Go, go, go!
-You can do it!

637
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:06,250
What are the questions?

638
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,490
When did you guys first meet each other?

639
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:10,370
How was the weather that day?

640
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,770
10 April 2013.

641
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,290
It was a clear sunny day.

642
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:21,170
That's right.

643
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:23,060
That's correct!

644
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:25,010
-Next question.
-I'll take this!

645
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,010
-I'll do it.
-Here.

646
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:30,820
You have to finish it!

647
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,860
When was the first time
you guys held hands?

648
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:36,100
What was the bride wearing?

649
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,220
April 2013...

650
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:42,580
17 April...
She was wearing a school uniform!

651
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,410
-Is that correct?
-Did he get that right?

652
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,410
Yes!

653
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,100
All right. He got it right.

654
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:47,940
He was correct.

655
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:48,490
Next question.

656
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:49,250
-I'll do it.
-Next question.

657
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,490
Next.

658
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,740
Next question.

659
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,370
What was the first gift
you gave the bride?

660
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:58,820
How much did it cost?

661
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:00,650
Hurry!

662
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:01,860
I remember it was...

663
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:04,410
It was an error book!
I spent RMB5 on it!

664
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:05,620
Did he get it right?

665
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:06,860
Yes!

666
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:09,290
Okay. He got it right.

667
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:10,940
All right. Great!

668
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:11,890
All right. Next.

669
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:12,940
Groom.

670
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:13,740
I'll do it!

671
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,740
Drink up.

672
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:22,460
Bottoms up!

673
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,580
When did you guys have your first kiss?

674
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:29,620
And where did you have it?

675
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,170
Our first kiss...

676
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,340
May 2021...

677
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,130
13 May 2021.

678
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,700
Inside a tent on a mountain

679
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:37,740
at night!

680
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,890
Is that right?

681
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:42,530
Is that correct?

682
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,370
No!

683
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,980
She said no!

684
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:47,650
No?

685
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,650
Qin Ge, that wasn't a dream!

686
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,250
Let me in!

687
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:57,170
Open the door!

688
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,010
He's in! We're going in!

689
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:01,220
Let's go!

690
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:02,340
Excuse me!

691
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,460
Find the bride's shoes!

692
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:05,460
You've done it now, Bai Qijia.

693
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,580
You hid that from me for so long.

694
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,250
Come home with me, honey.

695
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,410
What's the rush?

696
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:11,410
Have you found her shoes?

697
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:12,820
How is the bride supposed to walk
without her shoes?

698
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:13,490
That's right!

699
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:15,130
-That's right! Look for her shoes!
-Find the bride's shoes!

700
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:16,530
Find the bride's shoes!

701
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:18,620
I'm guessing it's here!

702
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:20,410
Not here!

703
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:25,650
-Not here!
-No!

704
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,010
Not up there!

705
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,860
Honey, are the shoes in here?

706
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:31,740
No!

707
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,250
Get him!

708
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,460
Where are the shoes?

709
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,770
-Not here.
-Not there!

710
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:38,410
-No.
-I found them!

711
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:39,620
There's another one!

712
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,940
One more.

713
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:41,940
Did anyone find it?

714
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,060
One more shoe!

715
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:44,170
One more, Dr. Bai!

716
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,980
You can't miss the auspicious hours.

717
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,740
Better come up with something quick.

718
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,650
Su Lun!

719
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:50,980
Is this enough?

720
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:51,580
Is this enough, ma'am?

721
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,250
Let me see them.

722
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,490
-No!
-Not enough!

723
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,700
No problem. I have more!

724
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,410
All right. This will do.

725
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:56,620
That's enough.

726
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,010
Where is it?

727
00:30:58,290 --> 00:30:59,410
Over there!

728
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,460
-Here!
-No!

729
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,700
-I think it's here.
-No!

730
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,740
-Found it!
-This is it!

731
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:04,740
Right here!

732
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:06,340
All right! Put them on her!

733
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,860
Let's go!

734
