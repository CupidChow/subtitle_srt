You're right.

Rather than act like a mad man,

you should figure out

we should reignite

Come on, eat up.

340
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:04,000
You have to eat something.

341
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:06,319
I don't have the appetite.

342
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,799
Come on, I spent my morning making this.

343
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,159
At least try some.

344
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,279
I'll feed you.

345
00:18:18,399 --> 00:18:19,120
Come on.

346
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,600
I can do it myself.

347
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:22,880
Eat up.

348
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,860
(Yue Qiqi)

349
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,720
It's Qiqi.

350
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:32,120
Whatever the others think,

351
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,559
Qiqi always has your back.
Answer the call.

352
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:38,960
Here.

353
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:41,600
Hello, Qiqi.

354
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,360
Miss Bai Qi,

355
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:45,679
when will you visit me again?

356
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,240
I've missed you over the past few days.

357
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:50,919
Qiqi, I've been busy.

358
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:52,679
I might not have the time to visit you.

359
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:54,360
If you can't go out,

360
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:55,760
I can go to you.

361
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,880
No.

362
00:18:57,439 --> 00:18:58,319
You heard Dr. Bai.

363
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,880
Your condition is unstable.

364
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,240
You can't just leave the hospital.

365
00:19:02,399 --> 00:19:04,679
But I have something really important

366
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,520
to tell you.

367
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,720
Could you make the time to visit me?

368
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:10,760
Alright.

369
00:19:11,439 --> 00:19:13,919
I'll pay you a visit later.

370
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,679
Eat up.

371
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,079
Here.

372
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,799
Try this.

373
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,450
(Qingchuan People's Hospital)

374
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:33,600
Miss Bai Qi,

375
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:35,480
Thank you for spending time with me.

376
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,000
I'm so happy.

377
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,039
I'm glad you are.

378
00:19:39,399 --> 00:19:40,679
By the way, you said

379
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:41,640
you had

380
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,559
something important to tell me.
What is it?

381
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:48,640
I mentioned to you I had been

382
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,279
keeping a list of my wishes.

383
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,120
And before I knew it,
the whole notebook was full.

384
00:19:53,399 --> 00:19:54,360
I wonder if I will

385
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,760
ever get the chance to realize them.

386
00:19:57,399 --> 00:19:58,919
You will get the chance.

387
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:00,399
We made a promise.

388
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:01,679
We'll make it happen.

389
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,760
But I want to finish
them before my birthday,

390
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,600
no matter what it takes.

391
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,520
Miss Bai Qi, do you know

392
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,120
what my first wish is?

393
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,799
I want to be like you.

394
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,279
I'll leave the hospital

395
00:20:15,439 --> 00:20:16,760
and go wherever I want.

396
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,279
Don't get your hopes up.

397
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,919
You promised

398
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,679
to get your treatment.

399
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,159
Where do you think you're going?

400
00:20:25,439 --> 00:20:27,720
But when you get well,
you can go traveling.

401
00:20:29,199 --> 00:20:30,840
Can I visit your studio?

402
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:31,960
I want to see

403
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,079
the birthplace of the
popular girl comics on the internet.

404
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,799
I want to visit the art gallery too.

405
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:38,000
I want to take all kinds of fun photos.

406
00:20:38,439 --> 00:20:39,480
I want to draw.

407
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:41,720
Sure, these are pretty simple.

408
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,559
I'll take you there myself.

409
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,039
That's great!

410
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,000
But I already had a plan.

411
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:49,760
I must finish everything on the list

412
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,559
before my upcoming birthday.

413
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,439
If I must, I'll ask my parents

414
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,120
to take a leave and go on my behalf.

415
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,039
They can see the wonderful world for me.

416
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,360
But that's a lot of work for them.

417
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,640
That'd be tough for them as well.

418
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,840
Perhaps

419
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,960
I can help with that.

420
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,159
No.

421
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,439
I can't ask you

422
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,880
to go on a trip just for me.

423
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,720
I can't draw anything at the moment.

424
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:24,640
I might as well do something
that might make me happy.

425
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,840
Miss Bai Qi,

426
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:28,000
don't say that.

427
00:21:28,399 --> 00:21:30,039
You are my greatest idol.

428
00:21:30,399 --> 00:21:32,720
The other fans and I
are all waiting for you.

429
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:35,319
Alright, I get it.

430
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:49,880
You're here.

431
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:51,840
Come on in.

432
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,880
You two talked for quite a while.
You must be tired.

433
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,720
Sit down and take a break.

434
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,960
I'm alright.

435
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:06,279
I felt relieved

436
00:22:06,399 --> 00:22:07,640
when I saw Qiqi fall asleep.

437
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:10,399
Qiqi's condition

438
00:22:11,199 --> 00:22:12,279
doesn't look too good.

439
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,240
Her condition is a little unstable,

440
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,399
but the data seems

441
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:18,799
pretty positive.

442
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,960
Don't worry about it.

443
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,679
But Qiqi is just a little girl.

444
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,919
She hasn't seen the world.

445
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,679
I want her to get well soon.

446
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,880
Don't worry. I'm here for her.

447
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:36,240
I'll do my best

448
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,399
to cure her.

449
00:22:44,399 --> 00:22:45,240
Come on.

450
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,919
Act natural.

451
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:49,600
Do as we discussed yesterday.

452
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,319
-You're...
-With the way you act now,

453
00:22:51,439 --> 00:22:52,399
even a fool can tell

454
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,799
you're up to no good.
Come on.

455
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,919
You know pretty well

456
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:57,079
how cunning my uncle can be.

457
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:58,120
If our plan fails,

458
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,319
he'll see right through us.

459
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:01,240
You mustn't tell yourself that.

460
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,439
The more nervous you are,
the easier it is to make a mistake.

461
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,559
But this really stresses me out, Min.

462
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,439
If we mess up,

463
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,279
Miss Bai Qi

464
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:12,079
will be in deeper trouble.

465
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:14,000
That is why

466
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,799
we cannot afford to fail this mission.

467
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:18,439
You must believe in yourself.

468
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:20,039
Show them your acting skill

469
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,480
just as you did with the interview
back at Fingertip Comics.

470
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:24,799
You must start with that.

471
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,600
Come on.

472
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,079
Why must you bring that up again?

473
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:30,240
Listen,

474
00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:33,199
we are still each other's nemesis.

475
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,600
Show everyone it's either you,

476
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,079
or me.

477
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,520
I should go in now.

478
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,439
Give it some thoughts and plan it out.

479
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:42,120
All the greatest to you!

480
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,000
I should...

481
00:24:23,199 --> 00:24:25,919
Uncle, you must help me!

482
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:27,880
What do you mean?
What did you get yourself into?

483
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,880
I can't spend another second
at Bai Qi's studio.

484
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:31,880
Their business is closing down soon.

485
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:33,640
See?

486
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,760
I told you so.

487
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:36,199
You are too young

488
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,199
and ignorant of the world's cruelty.

489
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:41,079
They told you some fancy words
and gave you empty promises,

490
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:42,319
and you wouldn't

491
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,159
stop talking about passion and dreams,

492
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:46,039
and all the unrealistic things.

493
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:49,360
Uncle,

494
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,799
can I come and work for you
after I graduate?

495
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,600
Wipe away the tears.

496
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,039
You're a grown-up,
stop embarrassing yourself.

497
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,720
Of course you can come back.

498
00:25:03,199 --> 00:25:04,319
Thanks, Uncle.

499
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,159
I know you care about me.

500
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,439
Of course I care about you the most.

501
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,880
And you called me a traitor

502
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,360
as if you were so righteous.

503
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,760
Now that it's all over for you there,

504
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,439
you come asking for mercy.

505
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,480

521

Okay! See you there, Miss Bai Qi.

544

you two are working together on this.

547
00:26:58,039 --> 00:26:58,960
Not at all.

548

Qiqi said

559
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,960
she had wanted to visit
this light art museum.

560
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,439
She wants to be the
light-runner under the moonlight,

561
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,240
and have the moon follow her.

562
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,399
That helps her forget her worries.

563
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,559
When she sees the light again,

564
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,120
she will be reborn.

565
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,079
She will feel at ease.

566
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,240
Well, let's become light-runners.

567

00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,600
That is uncalled for.

673
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,039
We are doing this to make a living.

674
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:11,039
Besides,

675
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,799
we are not the one
who wants to bring down Bai Qi.

676
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:17,439
Well, who is it?

677
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:18,960
Tell me,

678
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,960
and I might just
let you off the hook for now.

679
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,480
It was Mad Eye Comics.

680
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:27,720
It was Tian Zhan.

681
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,720
I told my friends

682
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,480
we should stay out
of the ACG subculture.

683
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,720
We used to

684
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,919
step on the gray area
with all kinds of celebrities,

685
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:37,000
but we never got into any trouble.

686
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:38,120
I knew it.

687
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:40,520
Of course this was his doing.

688
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,039
Well,

689
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,640
Editor Lin,

690
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,840
I've told you everything I know.

691
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,399
I hope you hold up

692
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:53,480
your end of the deal.

693
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,760
This is between you and Mad Eye Comics.

694
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,039
I wouldn't want to
get caught up in the fight.

695
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,360
I never break my promises.

696
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,319
You can go now.

697
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,520
Goodbye.

698
00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:05,760
Goodbye.
