Your renal biopsy report

20
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,890
should be out today.

21
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,180
Everything will be fine.

22
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,930
Qiqi, although you can
get out of bed now,

23
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,060
you'd better lie down often
and rest well.

24
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,610
Don't run around, okay?

25
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,060
Don't worry, Miss.

26
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,290
I'm used to it now.

27
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:13,690
Qiqi,

28
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,330
it's me! May I come in?

29
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:17,660
It's Miss Bai Qi.

30
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:18,890
Miss,

31
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,450
my idol is here to visit me.

32
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,730
If she inquires about my condition,

33
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,380
can you cover for me?

34
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,020
I don't want her to be worried.

35
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,420
Miss Bai Qi, please come in.

36
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:40,580
Qiqi,

37
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:43,660
it has only been days.

38
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,250
How come you've become so weak?

39
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:46,730
I'm fine.

40
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,690
It's just a normal check-up.

41
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,500
I'm a bit tired due to the pain.

42
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:52,890
Still denying it?

43
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:54,580
You did a renal biopsy.

44
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:57,810
Miss,

45
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,810
how's her condition now? Is it serious?

46
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:04,450
We've only reached

47
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,020
the phased examination stage.

48
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,250
Moreover, she has not been
very disciplined lately.

49
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,140
She'll be well
after taking some good rest.

50
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,170
Thank you.

51
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:19,420
Qiqi,

52
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,090
didn't you promise Bai Qijia and me

53
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,940
that you'll cooperate
with the doctor in your treatment?

54
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,020
Why did you torture yourself?

55
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,170
If you do it again,
I'll be very angry with you.

56
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,170
Do you know how grave your illness is?

57
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,660
I'm sorry, Miss Bai Qi.

58
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,970
I'll definitely give my full cooperation
in my treatment.

59
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,060
After all, I want to watch

60
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,330
the blockbuster Bubaiqi Plan.

61
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,860
By then, I'll book the entire movie hall

62
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,300
to support you.

63
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,330
You don't need to do so.

64
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,580
When the movie is released,

65
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:53,580
I'll take you to the premiere.

66
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,610
I'll save the best seat for you.

67
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,580
Really?

68
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,250
That's a deal then.

69
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,690
Dr. Bai.

70
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:12,610
Qiqi, how are you feeling today?

71
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,300
I feel much better.

72
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,450
What brings you here out of the blue?

73
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:19,660
My shift has just ended.

74
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,300
I came from my office

75
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,540
and dropped by to see you two.

76
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,380
Are you hungry?

77
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,170
Let's have lunch.

78
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,010
Let Qiqi take a good rest.

79
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,170
Qiqi, I won't disturb you then.

80
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:33,980
You must remember our promise, okay?

81
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:39,060
We shall get going.

82
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:40,660
Let's go.

83
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,060
What's wrong?

84
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:10,940
Bai Qijia,

85
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,980
tell me the truth.

86
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,010
Has Qiqi's illness

87
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,010
turned worst?

88
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,940
I'm afraid you'll be worried.

89
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,410
So I dare not tell you.

90
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,450
Qiqi

91
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,100
shares the same thought.

92
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,410
I understand the worries you two have.

93
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,730
But I'm also very worried about Qiqi.

94
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,660
I don't want her efforts

95
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,130
to end up in vain.

96
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:39,780
Director Cao is very skillful.

97
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:40,780
And you're there for her too.

98
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,010
You two won't let anything
happen to Qiqi, right?

99
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:45,660
Don't worry.

100
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:55,100
Hi, Dr. Bai.

101
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:55,850
Hi.

102
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,330
Isn't this

103
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,980
the doctors' secret garden?

104
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,500
Is it appropriate for me to come here?

105
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,660
Why not?

106
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,700
You're the doctor's family.

107
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,130
-Take a look at this name list.
-Sit down.

108
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,010
Got it.

109
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,170
-Hi, Dr. Bai.
-Hi.

110
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,540
Didn't you say you'll bring me to lunch?

111
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,660
Why did you bring me here?

112
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,570
This place gives us a temporary escape

113
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:27,730
from the internal atmosphere.

114
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,820
We'll be able to figure out
many things here.

115
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,730
Hospital is a cruel place.

116
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,100
But many a time,

117
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,540
it's filled with hope.

118
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,330
It's our responsibility as doctors

119
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,290
to safeguard these hopes.

120
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:42,730
Qin Ge,

121
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,780
promise me.

122
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:46,410
No matter what happens in the future,

123
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,700
you must not give up easily

124
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,220
just because of your worries,

125
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,450
okay?

126
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,100
Okay.

127
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:54,380
I believe in you.

128
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:55,940
With you by my side,

129
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,130
I'm not afraid of anything.

130
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,850
It's easier for a girl to pursue a boy.

131
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,660
Hard work will lead to victory.

132
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,820
Hard work will lead to victory.

133
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,660
Min.

134
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,660
Little Orange.

135
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,730
Just go for it if you like him.

136
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:27,380
Just go and find Chen Min.

137
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:28,940
What's wrong with you two?

138
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,410
Who said I wanted to find him?

139
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:31,780
You've been looking

140
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,570
at this worn photo for two hours.

141
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,220
That's right. And you keep muttering

142
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,940
"Min."

143
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,540
I can't stand it.

144
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:40,890
Didn't you two say

145
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:43,170
Min is Fingertip Comics's traitor?

146
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,060
Why are you supporting me
so generously now?

147
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,700
We might not like him,

148
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,540
but you do.

149
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,290
That's right.

150
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:50,570
We've even accepted your identity

151
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:51,220
as Tian Zhan's niece.

152
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:52,660
What else can't we accept?

153
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,330
You two already know it?

154
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:58,540
But I don't know where to find him.

155
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:59,850
I know.

156
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,130
We've been monitoring his movement.

157
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:03,260
By the way,

158
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:04,540
he's sketching now.

159
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,660
I'll share the venue with you.

160
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,660
Done. Go and find him now.

161
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,380
Okay.

162
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,260
But this isn't right.

163
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,170
It's fine if you two don't mind.

164
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,060
Why do you even take
the initiative to support me?

165
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,820
Because we feel

166
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,100
that you're his best retribution.

167
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,850
Mind your own business.

168
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,260
-Mind our own business?
-Bye.

169
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,020
Quick! It's falling!

170
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:42,850
The kite is flying high up.

171
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,460
It's so beautiful. Let's run over there.

172
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,090
Come on.

173
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,260
Faster. That way.

174
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,260
Run faster!

175
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,020
Run faster!

176
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,580
Min, I've finally found you!

177
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,970
It's too late for you to pretend now.

178
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:18,970
You must not disappear

179
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,210
without a word again.

180
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,210
If not, I'll install

181
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:22,290
a locator on you.

182
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,610
Min.

183
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:41,020
Madam, what on earth do you want?

184
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,090
Min,

185
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:48,650
there's no hope

186
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:49,770
between you and Miss Bai Qi.

187
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:50,970
Why don't we give it a try?

188
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,090
What if I'm a better fit?

189
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,460
What are you talking about?

190
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,580
I've never treated you as a substitute.

191
00:09:58,170 --> 00:09:58,940
Let go.

192
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:01,730
Let go now.

193
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:02,650
I won't.

194
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,290
Unless you promise you won't leave.

195
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:06,650
What if I can't find you?

196
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,530
Give it to me.

197
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,170
Come on.

198
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:25,410
Open your palm.

199
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:32,940
It hurts.

200
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,820
Are you a fool?

201
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,850
Yes. So what?

202
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,380
Would I come to you otherwise?

203
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:44,820
Min,

204
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,410
give me your new contact number.

205
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,650
As long as you do so

206
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:48,970
and promise not to blacklist me,

207
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:49,940
I won't disturb you anymore.

208
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,530
You know that I walk the talk.

209
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,060
Min.

210
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,380
Min, your new contact number please.

211
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,770
You should have given in earlier.

212
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:07,340
Here's the cab.

213
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,140
Get in.

214
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,260
Let me know when you reach home.

215
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,970
Okay. I'll let you know
I've arrived home safely by then.

216
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,460
Min, I won't give up.

217
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,090
(Tian Cheng)
Congratulations. You're remarkably brave.

218
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:58,260
But it's totally unnecessary.

219
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,730
You're home.

220
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,020
What are you looking at?

221
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:05,530
Come and take a look.

222
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:07,210
Little Orange has posted on her Moments.

223
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:08,410
Let me have a look.

224
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:10,850
Little Orange

225
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:13,260
has sacrificed her sweat,
blood, and tears

226
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:15,530
for her love.

227
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:19,610
By the way,

228
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,580
has Qiqi's medical report

229
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,610
been released today?

230
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,090
All indicators are stable.

231
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,580
Director Cao and my colleagues

232
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,970
are studying the next treatment.

233
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,060
Don't worry.
Everything will go smoothly.

234
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,580
That's great then.

235
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,170
Look, Xuezhou and Lu Tian's relationship

236
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,610
is stable now.

237
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,730
As for Big Orange,

238
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,580
she has won her first battle.

239
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:47,410
Qiqi's condition has also entered
a stable period.

240
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,730
What a lucky day.

241
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:55,610
Bai Qijia,

242
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,460
are you free after work tomorrow?

243
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,580
Yes. Why?

244
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,020
Can you go to a place with me?

245
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,170
Where?

246
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:07,650
I want...

247
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,060
I want to take you to see my mom.

248
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,060
Sure.

249
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,410
What about this?

250
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,820
I'll pick you up after work tomorrow.

251
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,340
We'll stop by to buy your mom
her favorite lily.

252
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,290
We'll go there together, okay?

253
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:32,410
Dr. Bai!

254
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,650
Something is happening to Yue Qiqi!

255
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,610
Director Cao,
what's her current situation?

256
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,170
It's most likely
congestive heart failure.

257
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,770
Based on our past observations,

258
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,410
her condition doesn't look good.

259
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:49,060
You must be prepared for the worst.

260
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:50,730
Inform the patient's kins.

261
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,380
(Surgical Patient Entrance)

262
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,500
I'm not skilled yet.

263
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:35,530
It's fine. I'll eat it anyway.

264
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:39,940
Miss Bai Qi,

265
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,970
I'll wait for Dr. Bai
to return before leaving.

266
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:47,020
He should be back by now.

267
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,580
Is he caught up with something?

268
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,210
I'll call and ask him.

269
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,580
Bai Qijia, when will you be reaching home?

270
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,060
Bai Qijia, are you okay?

271
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,340
My condolences.

272
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,580
Bai Qijia, did something happen to Qiqi?

273
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,820
What's wrong?

274
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:15,730
What happened?

275
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:18,850
We failed

276
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:20,970
to save Qiqi.

277
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,290
She has passed away.

278
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:31,940
We've done our best.

279
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,940
What's wrong, Miss Bai Qi?

280
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,020
What's going on? Someone has been hit.

281
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:16,060
Let's take a look.
Someone has been hit. Hurry up.

282
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,770
Is she okay?

283
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,380
Hurry up and call the ambulance.

284
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:23,970
Miss Bai Qi!

285
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,210
Miss Bai Qi!

286
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,530
Dr. Bai,

287
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,860
I'll be frank then.

288
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:14,580
There are signs of collapse
on both femoral heads.

289
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,820
She can barely walk now.

290
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:16,940
Surgery

291
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,620
is the only solution.

292
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,940
But she has a history
of systemic lupus erythematosus.

293
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,220
It will increase the surgery risk.

294
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,740
An infection will definitely lead
to complications.

295
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:29,980
You two

296
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,340
have to make the decision quickly.

297
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,410
Okay. Thank you.

298
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,370
I'll definitely give my full cooperation
in my treatment.

299
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,650
After all, I want to watch

300
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,890
the blockbuster Bubaiqi Plan.

301
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,620
By then, I'll book the entire movie hall

302
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,770
to support you.

303
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,890
You don't need to do so.

304
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,130
When the movie is released,

305
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,130
I'll take you to the premiere.

306
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,220
I'll save the best seat for you.

307
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,130
Really?

308
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:11,770
That's a deal then.

309
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,250
Director Cao is very skillful.

310
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,490
And you're there for her too.

311
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,700
You two won't let anything
happen to Qiqi, right?

312
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,060
Don't worry.

313
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,700
(We failed to save Qiqi.)

314
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,940
(She has passed away.)

315
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:35,890
(We've done our best.)

316
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:02,580
Qin Ge.

317
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,010
Qin Ge, are you okay?

318
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,700
Come on.

319
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:06,770
Be careful.

320
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,170
Didn't you say you had a solution?

321
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:31,130
Didn't you say she'd be all right?

322
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,340
Why did it end up like this?

323
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,740
I'm sorry.

324
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,130
I didn't mean to blame you.

325
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,250
I know...

326
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:06,130
I know you all have done your best.

327
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:10,170
I'm just blaming myself.

328
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,130
I thought all promises

329
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,940
could be fulfilled.

330
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,060
I thought writing wishes
on the wish list

331
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,100
could make them come true.

332
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,220
I was so naive.

333
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,370
I couldn't stop anything from happening.

334
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:41,410
Qin Ge,

335
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,130
don't worry.

336
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:47,370
Dr. Yu will definitely cure you.

337
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:48,770
You don't have to comfort me.

338
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,700
I...don't have the mood...

339
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,770
to think about other matters.

340
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:00,130
I want to be alone.

341
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,650
Qin...

342
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,940
Miss Bai Qi.

343
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:08,940
Miss Bai Qi,

344
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:12,010
what happened to you?

345
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,650
Qin Ge, we're late.

346
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,290
Are you okay?

347
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:20,860
Don't worry. I'm fine.

348
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,740
Don't worry.

349
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,340
I'm fine.

350
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,340
Well, Bai Qijia and I

351
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:36,620
will get some drinks
for you all. Come on.

352
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:46,220
We heard what happened

353
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:48,620
to Yue Qiqi.

354
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,370
Don't dwell on it, okay?

355
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:55,060
That's right, Miss Bai Qi.

356
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:56,250
Yue Qiqi wouldn't be happy

357
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:58,010
seeing you like this.

358
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:01,250
You're right.

359
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,980
Qiqi must be very disappointed now.

360
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:08,370
The idol she viewed
as someone omnipotent

361
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:11,130
is losing her grip

362
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,410
and only talks about

363
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:14,770
beautiful dreams

364
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:17,170
and self-deceptive words.

365
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,170
I...

366
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:20,370
That's not what I mean, Miss Bai Qi.

367
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,010
Qin Ge,

368
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,460
don't be so dismayed.

369
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,290
What has happened has happened.

370
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:27,820
It cannot be undone.

371
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,980
We should not amplify
our regrets, right?

372
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,820
What's most important now

373
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:35,060
is to take good care of yourself.

374
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,650
You must not

375
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:38,940
let anything happen to yourself again.

376
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:47,650
The visiting hours are up.

377
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:49,130
Please leave now.

378
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:50,410
The patient needs to rest.

379
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,100
Take a good rest.

380
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:57,770
Take good care of yourself.

381
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,100
Never forget

382
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:02,700
that you still have us, your friends.

383
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,890
And also your family

384
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:06,700
and Bai Qijia.

385
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,860
We'll always be by your side.

386
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:11,890
Okay?

387
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,220
Take good care of yourself, Miss Bai Qi.

388
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,010
Let's go.

389
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:27,700
Take good care of yourself.

390
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,940
I heard about Qin Ge's injury

391
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:50,010
from Little Orange.

392
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,860
No one expected it.

393
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,580
It's not your fault.

394
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,290
Don't blame yourself.

395
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,100
I know.

396
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:02,250
We're doctors.

397
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,860
We've been mentally prepared
for such situations.

398
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,170
I'm just worried about Qin Ge.

399
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:13,940
You've already done your best
for Yue Qiqi.

400
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,340
No one hopes to see such an outcome.

401
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,410
What's most important now

402
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:20,940
is comforting Qin Ge.

403
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:25,130
I know.

404
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,220
I can't help but worry.

405
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,490
Just like

406
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,130
when she left me eight years ago,

407
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,490
Qiqi has become

408
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,130
her hope.

409
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,130
It took her great effort
to overcome her fear.

410
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:45,740
I'm just very afraid

411
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:49,530
that she'll close herself up again.

412
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:55,220
Stop thinking the worst.

413
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:57,700
You could even make up
for the lost eight years.

414
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,060
What's more, it's only a few days now.

415
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,370
Well,

416
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:05,290
I've been wondering

417
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,650
why the new patient Qin Ge
who met a minor accident

418
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,980
looks seriously ill.

419
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:13,460
It turns out that she has
systemic lupus erythematosus.

420
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,010
This disease is a ticking bomb.

421
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:17,620
-Her entire life is ruined, isn't it?
-Yes.

422
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,250
She won't be able
to get married and work.

423
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:22,460
Why is Dr. Bai so unfortunate?

424
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,100
You know nothing. This is called love.

425
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,890
What kind of good deeds
has the girl done

426
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,620
to deserve Dr. Bai's love?

427
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:29,250
That's right.

428
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,650
I feel pity for Dr. Bai.

429
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:31,580
He's so outstanding.

430
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,980
That's right.

431
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:44,890
Qin Ge,

432
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:46,650
why did you run around?

433
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,370
Do you know you can't walk around

434
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:49,490
in your current condition?

435
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,250
Come on. I'll send you back
to your room.

436
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,060
Dr. Bai,

437
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,890
calm down. The nurse is looking for her.

438
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,340
She can't have
gotten out of the hospital.

439
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,100
Forget it. I'd better find her myself.

440
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:16,460
Come on. Watch your step.

441
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:19,340
Qin Ge.

442
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:21,700
Be careful.

443
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:23,700
Be careful.

444
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,170
Qin Ge.

445
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:28,060
Dr. Yu,

446
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,100
did you come to tell me something?

447
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:34,980
No.

448
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,460
Come on. Be careful.

449
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:42,940
Lie down properly.

450
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,530
Dr. Yu,

451
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,740
just cut to the chase.

452
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:51,740
Look at my condition now.

453
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,370
There's nothing worse than this.

454
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,770
I'll be frank then, Qin Ge.

455
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:03,010
You know I've been recommending

456
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:04,980
a conservative treatment
for femoral heads.

457
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:06,940
But your recent injury

458
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,820
has aggravated the bone injury.

459
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,460
If they continue to collapse,

460
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,770
you may not be able to walk again.

461
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:14,890
So I suggest

462
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:17,100
getting the replacement surgery done
as soon as possible.

463
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:18,530
But you do know

464
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:21,490
that your systemic lupus
erythematosus condition

465
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,620
can cause infection

466
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,860
and complications during the surgery.

467
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:27,770
So, you need to think carefully

468
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,220
about whether to undergo surgery or not.

469
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:31,860
No need to think about it.

470
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:32,740
Qin Ge.

471
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:33,820
I've decided

472
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:35,060
not to undergo surgery.

473
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,770
I'll discharge when my condition
is relatively stable.

474
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,370
I'll need to trouble you
by then, Dr. Yu.

475
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:41,250
No.

476
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:42,170
Qin Ge,

477
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:45,060
given your current situation,
it will only turn worst

478
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,220
if you don't do surgery.

479
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,130
Dr. Bai,

480
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,170
I'm already in grave condition.

481
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,490
There are two choices before me.

482
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,460
But none of them leads to good outcomes.

483
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:54,650
Why don't I

484
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,370
just enjoy every moment?

485
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,010
Isn't this a good thing?

486
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,620
Well,

487
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,410
I shall get going.

488
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,250
Discuss it

489
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:06,370
and let me know then.

490
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,650
Okay.

491
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:17,170
Qin Ge,

492
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:18,700
what's wrong?

493
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,170
Given your condition,

494
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,460
you must undergo surgery.

495
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:24,530
If you're worried,

496
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,290
I can apply for leave and stay
by your side throughout the procedure.

497
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,650
I'm sure nothing will happen to you.

498
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,770
Dr. Bai,

499
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,100
I've had enough of your guarantee.

500
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:40,170
And from now on,

501
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:42,650
you don't have to take care of me.

502
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,340
We'll break up.

503
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,740
I disagree.

504
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,620
I think

505
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,700
you should calm down now.

506
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:58,860
Let's wait for the test results

507
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,940
before talking about it.

508
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:02,010
Bai Qijia, I'm very calm now.

509
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,580
Can you please listen to me?

510
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,060
Can you please stop being
so self-righteous?

511
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:08,740
Do you think everyone
ought to listen to you?

512
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,170
Who do you think you are?

513
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:12,340
You didn't even
put yourself in my shoes!

514
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,460
You have no idea what I want!

515
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:25,770
Sorry, Dr. Bai.

516
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,530
Please leave.

517
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:29,770
I want to rest.

518
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,460
How did it go?

519
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:27,410
Did it go well?

520
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,250
The worst has happened.

521
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:42,410
Qin Ge refuses to undergo surgery.

522
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,770
Surgery is risky.

523
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,890
It's quite understandable.

524
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,100
Convince her again.

525
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:53,410
I think there's still hope.

526
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,130
But she wants to break up with me.

527
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:02,490
Qin Ge wants to break up with you?

528
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:12,650
I've always been very confident,

529
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,580
just like when she left me

530
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,530
without a word eight years ago.

531
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,490
I always believe

532
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,820
as long as I put in the effort,

533
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,740
I can start over with her.

534
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,250
But now,

535
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,580
I'm unsure of it.

536
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:36,490
Procrastinator Bai,

537
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,820
are you going to give up just like that?

538
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,980
You've persevered for eight years.

539
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:45,490
Bai Qijia,

540
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:47,370
as a friend

541
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,170
and your only friend,

542
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,940
I must solemnly suggest this to you.

543
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,580
I know better than anyone else

544
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:55,980
how you've endured the past eight years.

545
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,860
We can see

546
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,370
how much you and Qin Ge

547
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,170
love each other.

548
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,530
This matter is a heavy blow to Qin Ge.

549
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:04,820
She's indeed

550
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:07,060
suffering from
systemic lupus erythematosus.

551
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,650
No one

552
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:10,220
can undergo the suffering for her.

553
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:11,890
As the person she trusts the most,

554
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:13,820
what you need to do now

555
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:16,650
is to guide her in rediscovering
her original intention.
