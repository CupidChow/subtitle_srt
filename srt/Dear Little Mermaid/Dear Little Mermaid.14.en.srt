Okay.

31
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:03,880
Check out the photos I took.

32
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:11,961
Bai Qijia.

33
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,360
Now I regret it.

34
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:16,520
I was totally wrong about you.

35
00:03:16,961 --> 00:03:18,041
Go away.

36
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,880
What's wrong?

37
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,961
You took great photos of the patients

38
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,600
in the hospital.

39
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,240
So why can't you do the same for me?

40
00:03:27,561 --> 00:03:28,761
You have no sense of aesthetics.

41
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,561
I think it looks nice.

42
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,240
You look adorable.

43
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,201
I look like a warped alien!

44
00:03:39,121 --> 00:03:40,080
Don't be upset.

45
00:03:40,201 --> 00:03:41,000
Don't touch me.

46
00:03:48,921 --> 00:03:50,520
I've never taken
photos of my girlfriend.

47
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,961
I didn't have the experience.

48
00:03:52,681 --> 00:03:54,160
I'll start learning.

49
00:03:54,681 --> 00:03:55,561
Bai Qijia.

50
00:03:55,761 --> 00:03:57,401
I thought you're good at everything.

51
00:03:59,761 --> 00:04:00,681
So, what do you think

52
00:04:00,961 --> 00:04:03,321
I'm good at?

53
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,240
Bai Qijia!

54
00:04:09,121 --> 00:04:10,681
Stop messing around.
It's broad daylight.

55
00:04:10,921 --> 00:04:12,000
How dare you make lewd jokes!

56
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,160
Did you even see how many pretty girls

57
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,401
were looking at you this morning?

58
00:04:19,561 --> 00:04:20,921
That's because they envy me

59
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,240
for having such a beautiful

60
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,961
and adorable girlfriend.

61
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,681
You have a smooth tongue.

62
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:26,961
Am I that scary?

63
00:04:27,281 --> 00:04:28,561
But I'm telling the truth.

64
00:04:29,881 --> 00:04:30,681
Really?

65
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,570
(Lu Tian)

66
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,480
It's Lu Tian.

67
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,080
What is it, Lu Tian?

68
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,961
Procrastinator Bai, are you with Qin Ge?

69
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,721
Ask her

70
00:04:41,721 --> 00:04:43,320
if Xuezhou has contacted her lately.

71
00:04:43,721 --> 00:04:45,200
She hasn't.

72
00:04:45,401 --> 00:04:46,920
What's wrong?
What happened to her?

73
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,161
Xuezhou left a letter and left.

74
00:04:49,441 --> 00:04:50,480
She left?

75
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:51,681
It's complicated.

76
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,961
It's a long story.

77
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,040
If she contacts you,

78
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,281
you must inform me immediately.

79
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:56,281
Yes, sure.

80
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,320
I must get back to work.

81
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,640
Call Xuezhou.

82
00:05:03,881 --> 00:05:06,520
(Hello.
The number you dialed is unavailable.)

83
00:05:07,401 --> 00:05:08,281
She turned off her phone.

84
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:09,800
Try giving

85
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,920
Chen Min a call.

86
00:05:17,681 --> 00:05:18,520
Min.

87
00:05:19,441 --> 00:05:21,841
Did something happen to Xuezhou?
What is going on?

88
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:23,640
I was just about to call you.

89
00:05:23,841 --> 00:05:25,040
She came this morning

90
00:05:25,161 --> 00:05:26,320
and left after taking her annual leave.

91
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,401
I couldn't get in touch with her.

92
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:30,001
Tian Cheng has gone missing too.

93
00:05:30,161 --> 00:05:32,360
There are piles of work
to do in the studio.

94
00:05:33,841 --> 00:05:34,760
We'll be right back.

95
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,760
Yes, we'll be there as soon as possible.

96
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,920
Welcome home!

97
00:05:46,281 --> 00:05:47,200
Surprise.

98
00:05:54,001 --> 00:05:54,841
Carry on.

99
00:05:55,001 --> 00:05:56,601
I should report back to the hospital.

100
00:05:56,961 --> 00:05:58,360
Dr. Bai, are you leaving already?

101
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:00,080
Have fun.

102
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,040
See you!

103
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,441
-Bye!
-Bye.

104
00:06:13,121 --> 00:06:14,841
You two went missing.

105
00:06:15,841 --> 00:06:18,281
Care to explain why?

106
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,441
I'll go first.

107
00:06:21,961 --> 00:06:23,401
I got what was coming for me.

108
00:06:23,721 --> 00:06:25,040
I couldn't live in
my rental house anymore.

109
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,961
I've finally found it.

110
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,841
Min?

111
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,800
Min?

112
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,520
What are you doing here?

113
00:06:40,961 --> 00:06:41,760
Hold on.

114
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,200
How do you know my address?

115
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,161
I helped you
deliver some files, remember?

116
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,920
Let me go inside.

117
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,200
Let go.

118
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:50,040
Let me in.

119
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,480
-Let go.
-But first, let me in!

120
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,320
Don't close the door.

121
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,320
Fine, let go.

122
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:02,360
You carry the luggage with you.

123
00:07:02,601 --> 00:07:03,601
What do you want?

124
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,800
The faucet was leaking.

125
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,681
The whole house was flooded.

126
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,480
Min, let me stay for a couple of days.

127
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:11,841
I promise

128
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,721
I won't be a nuisance to you, okay?

129
00:07:16,681 --> 00:07:17,920
What happened to your leg?

130
00:07:18,961 --> 00:07:20,561
The floor was wet.

131
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,640
I slipped and fell.

132
00:07:23,121 --> 00:07:24,401
That looks serious.

133
00:07:25,001 --> 00:07:26,281
It must have been rough for you.

134
00:07:28,841 --> 00:07:29,760
Wait here.

135
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,200
Wait here.

136
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,121
This is

137
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,920
the plumbing company's phone number.

138
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,281
They operate 24/7.

139
00:07:47,961 --> 00:07:49,881
This is the phone number
of the pharmacy nearby.

140
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:51,281
It opens 24/7 as well.

141
00:07:52,441 --> 00:07:53,281
All the best to you.

142
00:07:54,121 --> 00:07:54,681
Hey...

143
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,800
Open up!

144
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,961
Little Orange, with all due respect,

145
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,441
I think you're a little

146
00:08:20,961 --> 00:08:21,800
weird.

147
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,800
I learned from Dr. Bai.

148
00:08:25,961 --> 00:08:28,080
I want to have
a sweet romance as well.

149
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,640
But you should've used a better excuse

150
00:08:31,401 --> 00:08:33,640
than leaking pipes

151
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,721
to move into his house.

152
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:35,800
It's not an excuse.

153
00:08:36,841 --> 00:08:38,800
She pulled out the faucet.

154
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,760
Her house was indeed flooded.

155
00:08:41,961 --> 00:08:43,520
So, I came to you for help.

156
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,120
But I was surprised to see Xuezhou here.

157
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,361
Miss Xuezhou,

158
00:08:50,921 --> 00:08:52,361
what did you get yourself into?

159
00:08:52,481 --> 00:08:56,000
You're the editor-in-chief.
Why did you run away from home?

160
00:08:56,241 --> 00:08:58,000
My situation is less complicated.

161
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,601
Indeed. You are right.

162
00:09:00,721 --> 00:09:03,041
You can overcome anything by yourself.

163
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:04,241
What happened?

164
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,161
It was my mother,

165
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:07,080
Madam Zhou Wan.

166
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,721
She caught Lu Tian and me red-handed.

167
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,880
She wants us to get married right away.

168
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,440
Put on your clothes and go.

169
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,281
This isn't your first drill.

170
00:09:18,361 --> 00:09:19,880
No dilly-dallying.

171
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,401
Just go.

172
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,361
I'm not preparing breakfast for you.

173
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,320
But I could.

174
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,241
Who said that?

175
00:09:31,961 --> 00:09:32,640
Mother.

176
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,880
Mother?

177
00:09:34,961 --> 00:09:37,320
Lin Xuezhou, not bad.

178
00:09:37,921 --> 00:09:39,320
You've brought a man home.

179
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,241
Mother, hear me out.

180
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,200
I don't know this man.

181
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:43,041
Madam, I'll take full responsibility!

182
00:09:43,281 --> 00:09:44,281
Just shut it!

183
00:09:46,601 --> 00:09:47,961
At this point,

184
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,801
you should get married.

185
00:09:54,721 --> 00:09:56,161
That's what happened.

186
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,481
My mother is living in my house.

187
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,361
She demands

188
00:09:59,361 --> 00:10:01,320
that I get the marriage
certificate today!

189
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,200
I made up an excuse
saying I had a meeting

190
00:10:03,481 --> 00:10:05,281
and came here for shelter.

191
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,200
Are you going to get married?

192
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,801
Of course not!
I don't want to get married.

193
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:22,841
If we got married,

194
00:10:23,161 --> 00:10:25,320
she'd force me to get a child.

195
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,281
The slightest tolerance
will bring endless demands.

196
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,481
Then,

197
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,841
I'd lose my office

198
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,880
and my job as the editor-in-chief.

199
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,120
I'd give birth to a child
and become a mother.

200
00:10:37,481 --> 00:10:39,041
I won't have any time for myself.

201
00:10:39,361 --> 00:10:41,481
I'd ask for my husband's permission
before I spend my money!

202
00:10:44,401 --> 00:10:45,721
There is no such thing

203
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,000
as the elderly and children living
peacefully as a harmonious family.

204
00:10:50,481 --> 00:10:51,721
There is only

205
00:10:52,241 --> 00:10:53,841
a couple gazing at each other

206
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:57,000
with endless disappointment.

207
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,640
Lu Tian!

208
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,921
Put your video game aside!

209
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:06,520
This is your child too!

210
00:11:06,921 --> 00:11:07,680
Did you hear me?

211
00:11:07,841 --> 00:11:08,921
The game will be over soon!

212
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,041
Enough!

213
00:11:10,601 --> 00:11:11,841
It is disappointing.

214
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,481
My sisters.

215
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,760
Do you understand my woes?

216
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,161
Of course we can.

217
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,440
However...

218
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,041
Forget it. I'm calling my mother.

219
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,560
I don't want to get married.

220
00:11:24,721 --> 00:11:25,200
I...

221
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,401
- No!
- No! You need to calm down!

222
00:11:28,961 --> 00:11:30,120
Calling your mother now

223
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,440
will only make things worse.

224
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,680
You are going to make
her even more upset.

225
00:11:33,921 --> 00:11:35,041
You don't want that.

226
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,041
Yeah.

227
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:37,560
Parents are very stubborn nowadays.

228
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,120
It's hard to explain to them.

229
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,921
What should I do then?

230
00:11:44,481 --> 00:11:46,880
You should turn on your phone

231
00:11:47,361 --> 00:11:48,640
and call Lu Tian.

232
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,560
He's been worried sick.

233
00:11:51,401 --> 00:11:53,161
This is his fault!
Why should I call him?

234
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,241
At least he sincerely wants to

235
00:11:55,361 --> 00:11:56,200
marry you.

236
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,161
I don't want that.

237
00:11:57,281 --> 00:11:58,281
He's wrong to force me into

238
00:11:58,281 --> 00:11:59,281
doing what I don't want to!

239
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,000
But you shouldn't make him worry.

240
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,640
You've changed.

241
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,281
What's wrong with me?

242
00:12:02,281 --> 00:12:03,281
After your trip with Bai Qijia,

243
00:12:03,401 --> 00:12:04,640
you've been acting differently.

244
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,320
I'm still the same.

245
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,481
You're forcing me into getting married.

246
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,880
No, I still love you.

247
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,820
(Doctor's Office)

248
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,241
Are you not worried about her anymore?

249
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:17,841
I know where Xuezhou is now.

250
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,841
Why would I be worried?

251
00:12:18,961 --> 00:12:20,921
Besides, while she is away,

252
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,041
I've managed to convince her mother.

253
00:12:23,361 --> 00:12:24,361
As of now,

254
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,041
I am her future son-in-law.

255
00:12:27,161 --> 00:12:28,041
Judging by the look,

256
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,281
you're taking her family name.

257
00:12:29,401 --> 00:12:30,921
As long as I can marry her,

258
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,481
our child can take her family name.

259
00:12:32,841 --> 00:12:34,560
The happy life I've dreamt of

260
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:40,120
will soon begin!

261
00:12:46,361 --> 00:12:48,281
Did you ask for Xuezhou's consent?

262
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:49,801
You're making the same mistake.

263
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,880
Don't bother. She will definitely

264
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,041
say no.

265
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,560
And you're still daydreaming.

266
00:12:54,721 --> 00:12:55,601
What else can I do?

267
00:12:55,721 --> 00:12:56,841
I've been wooing her for so long,

268
00:12:56,961 --> 00:12:58,120
not to mention the recent incident.

269
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,401
Procrastinator Bai,
you have some experience.

270
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,801
Help a buddy out, okay?

271
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,721
Let's discuss it tomorrow.

272
00:13:11,921 --> 00:13:13,161
I'm having dinner with my girlfriend.

273
00:13:13,841 --> 00:13:15,560
Please go out.
I must get changed.

274
00:13:15,721 --> 00:13:17,440
Procrastinator Bai!
I am your friend!

275
00:13:18,161 --> 00:13:19,880
Bai Qijia, you're a traitor!

276
00:13:28,801 --> 00:13:29,401
Try this.

277
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,601
Honey, eat up.

278
00:13:31,921 --> 00:13:32,801
Thanks.

279
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,560
Thank you!

280
00:13:43,721 --> 00:13:45,281
I love you.

281
00:13:49,801 --> 00:13:50,801
I must say,

282
00:13:52,161 --> 00:13:53,721
Dr. Bai's cooking is great.

283
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,320
You're in charge of our meals

284
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:56,560
for the entire week.

285
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:57,921
Thanks.

286
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,760
Thanks, Miss Bai Qi!

287
00:14:04,721 --> 00:14:05,481
Eat up.

288
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,680
Don't worry.

289
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,161
There is plenty of food to go around.

290
00:14:11,841 --> 00:14:13,320
I wish I could live with you.

291
00:14:13,481 --> 00:14:14,161
My uncle wants me

292
00:14:14,161 --> 00:14:15,921
to stay at his place instead.

293
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,080
Little Orange,

294
00:14:17,401 --> 00:14:18,880
I've wanted to ask you.

295
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,680
Your family seems suspiciously wealthy.

296
00:14:22,961 --> 00:14:24,361
What does your family do for a living?

297
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:29,680
My family

298
00:14:29,801 --> 00:14:31,440
is a middle-class family.

299
00:14:32,161 --> 00:14:33,961
My uncle is an entrepreneur.

300
00:14:34,281 --> 00:14:35,241
He's usually a busy person.

301
00:14:35,401 --> 00:14:36,801
We're not that close.

302
00:14:36,921 --> 00:14:37,760
Did you hear that?

303
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,241
Middle class and an entrepreneur.

304
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,880
He must be quite something.

305
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,041
Qin Ge,

306
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,680
I met someone back in the hospital.

307
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,921
(Cheng Jun)
Miss Bai Qi, my uncle is here.

308
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,200
I must get going. Bye.

309
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,320
Thanks, Miss Bai Qi.

310
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,560
-Bye.
-See you!

311
00:14:52,401 --> 00:14:53,161
Qin Ge, I...

312
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:54,841
Qin Ge!

313
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,760
Listen.

314
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:58,000
I bought a new outfit yesterday.

315
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,680
Come on, you should check it out.

316
00:15:00,161 --> 00:15:00,880
Come on.

317
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,401
Cheng Jun!

318
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,880
You must go!
Your identity is compromised!

319
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,841
I don't want the others
to get the wrong idea. Let's go!

320
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,601
Will pink look good on me?

321
00:15:42,721 --> 00:15:43,721
I think beige looks better.

322
00:15:43,841 --> 00:15:44,721
You know pink

323
00:15:44,961 --> 00:15:46,601
makes the skin dull!

324
00:15:46,801 --> 00:15:47,601
That's right.

325
00:15:47,921 --> 00:15:49,361
You like pink.
You can have this.

326
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,841
No, I don't like hot pink!

327
00:15:50,961 --> 00:15:51,880
It looks better on you.

328
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,560
Hot pink looks great on you.

329
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,401
You like softer colors.

330
00:15:54,401 --> 00:15:55,041
I do.

331
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:55,880
But I don't like hot pink.

332
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,721
It's too bright.

333
00:15:56,841 --> 00:15:58,841
It looks great on you!

334
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,320
Ladies, it's bedtime.

335
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,921
Come on, it's not even 11 pm yet.

336
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,080
Are you an old man?

337
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,161
Normal sleeping hour

338
00:16:06,241 --> 00:16:08,120
begins at 9 pm and ends at 6 am.

339
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,841
You must go to bed before 11 pm.

340
00:16:09,961 --> 00:16:12,000
After 11 pm, your body
will go into deep sleep.

341
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,841
It increases detoxification.

342
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,000
Is he always like this?

343
00:16:20,481 --> 00:16:22,841
Bai Qijia, Lu Tian is also a doctor.

344
00:16:22,961 --> 00:16:25,361
The more you act like this,
the longer she's staying.

345
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,721
He's not a doctor to me.

346
00:16:30,801 --> 00:16:32,601
You can have the bed.

347
00:16:32,801 --> 00:16:34,481
I'm sleeping on the sofa.

348
00:16:35,601 --> 00:16:38,000
Are you going to let your girlfriend
share a bed with me?

349
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,640
I have plenty of chances anyway.

350
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,520
Good night.

351
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,440
Good night.

352
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,801
I'm off.

353
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,120
Go to bed.

354
00:16:47,241 --> 00:16:48,080
Good night.

355
00:16:53,241 --> 00:16:54,080
Well?

356
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,640
Do you feel honored?

357
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,601
I deserve as much.

358
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,640
Love your older sister
like she's your mother.

359
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:04,041
Lights off.
It's bedtime.

360
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,560
You took advantage of me.

361
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,080
I'm going to bed.

362
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,800
Good night.

363
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,080
Good night.

(No. Why aren't you asleep?)

366
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,241
(I was, but Xuezhou
hit me in her sleep.)

00:18:17,761 --> 00:18:18,761
(I feel sorry for you.)

369
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,521
(get some sleep.)

370
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,241
What's wrong?

371
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:57,040
Why are you here?

372
00:18:57,601 --> 00:18:59,001
It's Xuezhou.

373
00:18:59,881 --> 00:19:01,280
She moves when she sleeps.

374
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,521
She slapped my phone.

375
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,200
Let's see.

376
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,920
She hit my nose.

377
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,521
It hurts.

378
00:19:14,641 --> 00:19:15,560
Perhaps

379
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,920
we could share this sofa tonight.

380
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,721
No.

381
00:19:20,881 --> 00:19:22,001
I'm hungry.

382
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,641
I'll make you some noodles.

383
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,241
Wait here.

384
00:19:34,601 --> 00:19:35,320
It's done.

385
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:36,761
Eat up.

386
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,800
This looks hearty.
There's even an egg.

387
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,080
You've had a rough night.

388
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,601
You need some nutrients.

389
00:19:43,481 --> 00:19:44,160
Eat up.

390
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,481
I should stock up

391
00:19:52,601 --> 00:19:53,920
on more food.

392
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,001
You might get hungry at night.

393
00:19:56,121 --> 00:19:57,200
Save yourself the trouble.

394
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,601
All I need is instant noodles.

395
00:19:58,761 --> 00:19:59,641
That's not enough.

396
00:19:59,881 --> 00:20:01,400
Instant noodles lack nutrients.

397
00:20:01,521 --> 00:20:02,641
There are too many additives.

398
00:20:02,761 --> 00:20:05,001
Eating too much
will affect your liver functions.

399
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,080
Bai Qijia.

400
00:20:11,521 --> 00:20:12,601
Are all medical students

401
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,680
so particular with their food?

402
00:20:15,001 --> 00:20:16,160
It's like there is nothing

403
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,361
you can eat.

404
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,560
Doesn't that make life boring?

405
00:20:19,721 --> 00:20:21,320
Who says there is nothing

406
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,200
we can eat?

Trust me,

the street food alley
behind the hospital

409

sells everything.

410
00:20:25,961 --> 00:20:27,721
It's the best
street food spot in the city.

411
00:20:27,841 --> 00:20:29,080
You can find anything there.

Let's not wake her up.

415
00:20:45,601 --> 00:20:46,361

416
00:20:46,521 --> 00:20:48,200

I feel the same.

No.

423
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,440
You shouldn't lie down
after finishing your food.

424
00:21:14,241 --> 00:21:15,961

429
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,160
What about you?

430
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,440
I'd watched them with my parents
when I was little.

431
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,080
Then, it's with you.

432
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,280
Thankfully, I met you.

433
00:21:41,961 --> 00:21:43,121
You helped me

434
00:21:43,361 --> 00:21:45,241
walk out of that lonely life

435
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,841
and pick up the wonders
in life that I'd missed.

436
00:21:52,721 --> 00:21:55,641
My entire youth

437
00:21:56,001 --> 00:21:57,641
was spent with you.

438
00:22:00,001 --> 00:22:01,241
Every time I see you,

439
00:22:01,761 --> 00:22:03,160
I feel so happy.

440
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,881
And then, we broke up.

441
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,601
I often reminisced
the memories we shared.

442
00:22:12,241 --> 00:22:13,721
That was when I realized

443
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,800
I could never forget you.

444
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:22,560
Am I really that important to you?

445
00:22:24,481 --> 00:22:26,040
You really are.

446
00:22:26,761 --> 00:22:28,560
You are

447
00:22:28,761 --> 00:22:31,761
just as important to me.
Very, very important.

448
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,560
I must emphasize it.

449
00:22:36,721 --> 00:22:37,680
Look!

450
00:22:37,961 --> 00:22:39,121
It's a shooting star!

451
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,481
Quick, make a wish.

452
00:22:42,641 --> 00:22:44,200
I wish we could always

453
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,361
watch the stars together.

454
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,200
That's all.

455

Why aren't you making a wish?

456

Your wish is mine too.

I need to see this.

460
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,601
Slow down.

Get up.

470
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,400
Let me see it.

Where does it hurt?

472
00:23:40,241 --> 00:23:41,121
Oh no.

473
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,440
Rub it for me.

474
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,320
Is it here?

475
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,001
Yes.

He kicked me!

481
00:23:53,481 --> 00:23:54,761
This is outrageous.

482
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,920
Why was he in my dream?

483

What you think goes into your dream.

No way.

485
00:24:03,601 --> 00:24:05,721
If you miss him,
go check on him.

486

Are you kicking me out?

487

No. I wouldn't dare.

Weren't you sleeping here?

in the bathroom.

493

Alright, go back to sleep.

494

506
00:24:59,361 --> 00:25:00,961
Procrastinator Bai, what's got into you?

507
00:25:03,761 --> 00:25:04,961
Listen,

508
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,601
if you ever need my help,
just let me know.

509
00:25:13,121 --> 00:25:15,521
Are you the same man I know?

510
00:25:15,841 --> 00:25:16,920
Get your filthy hands off me.

511
00:25:17,881 --> 00:25:19,800
Now that felt familiar.

512
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,440
My goodness...

513
00:25:25,761 --> 00:25:27,040
That's so silly.

514
00:25:30,881 --> 00:25:31,761
Xuezhou.

515
00:25:32,521 --> 00:25:34,280
You've been hiding here for two days.

516
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,241
Do you have a plan now?

517
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:37,241
What's wrong?

518
00:25:37,881 --> 00:25:38,881
Am I a nuisance to you?

519
00:25:41,601 --> 00:25:43,121
You never complained no matter

520
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:44,641
how long I stayed before.

521
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,400
Now that you have Bai Qijia,

522
00:25:47,641 --> 00:25:48,881
you think I'm a nuisance.

523
00:25:49,241 --> 00:25:51,040
No, I wouldn't dare.

524
00:25:51,521 --> 00:25:53,400
I understand you don't
want to get married.

525
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,961
But you can't hide from your mother

526
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,320
and Lu Tian forever.

527
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,001
Don't worry.

528
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,841
As long as I can hold out,

529
00:26:02,001 --> 00:26:04,121
my mother will get
disheartened over time.

530
00:26:06,241 --> 00:26:07,361
What about Lu Tian?

531
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:11,440
Lu Tian...

532
00:26:13,361 --> 00:26:14,200
It's been his dream

533
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,440
to marry me.

534
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,160
So is that a yes or a no?

535
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,361
I...

536
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,160
Wait, Qin Ge.

537
00:26:25,521 --> 00:26:27,440
Are you baiting me?

538
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,080
Whose side are you on?

539
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,881
No, I'm not baiting you.

540
00:26:31,001 --> 00:26:32,841
I'm analyzing the situation.

541
00:26:35,001 --> 00:26:37,241
Do you have a plan after analyzing?

542
00:26:40,121 --> 00:26:41,761
You could try

543
00:26:42,241 --> 00:26:43,160
faking getting married.

544
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,721
Get married first, love later.

545
00:26:45,961 --> 00:26:47,881
You might actually
fall in love for good.

546
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:48,800
You do it.

547
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,881
After you.

548
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:52,400
(Mother)

549
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,241
It's my mother.

550
00:26:56,361 --> 00:26:57,080
Answer the call.

551
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,560
Go on, answer it.

552
00:27:02,001 --> 00:27:02,920
Xuezhou?

553
00:27:03,601 --> 00:27:04,920
Have you made up your mind?

554
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,361
If you don't answer me,

555
00:27:06,521 --> 00:27:07,601
I'm coming to your office.

556
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,800
No, Mother!

557
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,121
I'll be back tomorrow.

558
00:27:10,641 --> 00:27:11,080
Don't worry.

559
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,721
I'll give you an answer tomorrow.

560
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,881
Don't go to my office.

561
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,241
That's more like it.

562
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,641
Carry on.

563
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,280
I'm making you
a hearty meal tomorrow.

564
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,560
See you.

565
00:27:23,361 --> 00:27:24,641
What now?

566
00:27:26,361 --> 00:27:27,280
Do it.

567
00:27:29,721 --> 00:27:30,400
By the way,

568
00:27:30,761 --> 00:27:31,961
how has Xuezhou been?

569
00:27:32,121 --> 00:27:33,560
Has she contacted you?

570
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,361
She has.

571
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,440
But I feel anxious

572
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,761
unless I can see her in person.

573
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,601
I even had a dream last night.

574
00:27:40,721 --> 00:27:42,400
She said she'd fallen off the bed.

575
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,320
She did fall from her bed.

576
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,680
Why didn't she tell me?

577
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,881
Is she hurt?

578
00:27:50,481 --> 00:27:51,160
Lu Tian.

579
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,841
I think Lin Xuezhou

580
00:27:53,001 --> 00:27:54,521
has been touched by your resolve.

581
00:27:55,001 --> 00:27:56,841
But she is still hesitating.

582
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,481
I feel the same.

583
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,040
But what should

584
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,400
I do next?

585
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:04,121
I don't want to make it worse

586
00:28:04,361 --> 00:28:05,641
and scare her off.

587
00:28:07,241 --> 00:28:08,841
Xuezhou is not a baby.

588
00:28:08,961 --> 00:28:09,800
She won't get scared

589
00:28:09,881 --> 00:28:10,961
so easily.

590
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,040
You must tell her your stance.

591
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,680
Tell her you're willing to spend
the rest of your life with her.

592
00:28:16,121 --> 00:28:17,560
Don't show her the carefree

593
00:28:17,721 --> 00:28:18,841
and unreliable side of you.

594
00:28:20,881 --> 00:28:21,680
How do I do it?

595
00:28:27,001 --> 00:28:27,761
Welcome.

596
00:28:27,881 --> 00:28:28,721
Hello.

597
00:28:29,761 --> 00:28:30,481
Madam.

598
00:28:31,521 --> 00:28:32,241
Have a seat.

599
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,601
Lu Tian.

600
00:28:40,841 --> 00:28:42,400
We could just talk at home.

601
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,920
So why must we come to a coffee shop?

602
00:28:45,961 --> 00:28:47,641
I wanted to treat you to a meal.

603
00:28:47,881 --> 00:28:50,001
But there isn't a restaurant

604
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,361
in Qingchuan

605
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:52,881
that can match your cooking.

606
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,601
So, I bought you coffee instead.

607
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,560
How sweet of you.

608
00:28:57,841 --> 00:28:58,881
Listen.

609
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,721
Xuezhou is coming home tonight.

610
00:29:01,001 --> 00:29:02,121
She's made up her mind.

611
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,400
She will give us an answer tonight.

612
00:29:05,881 --> 00:29:06,961
Madam, did she mention

613
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,680
anything about the answer?

614
00:29:10,001 --> 00:29:11,001
What else could it be?

615
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,761
She must have agreed to get married.

616
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,001
What is it?
Are you not glad to hear this?

617
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,641
That's not it, Madam.

618
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:21,001
I'm not upset about it.

619
00:29:25,641 --> 00:29:27,320
Madam, I don't want to marry Xuezhou.

620
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,121
No,

621
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,721
it's not that I don't want to.

622
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,400
I don't want her

623
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:34,761
to be forced into marrying me.

624
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,761
Did Xuezhou say anything to you?

625
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,761
No.

626
00:29:39,961 --> 00:29:41,280
This is my own opinion.

627
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,400
I want to make it clear to you

628
00:29:43,601 --> 00:29:45,560
before Xuezhou comes home.

629
00:29:54,601 --> 00:29:55,721
That's the whole truth.

630
00:29:56,241 --> 00:29:56,841
I know

631
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,761
Xuezhou and I are making great progress.

632
00:29:59,001 --> 00:30:00,481
We are adjusting to this relationship.

633
00:30:00,761 --> 00:30:01,521
But I believe

634
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,400
we will get married eventually.

635
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,400
We only need more time.

636
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,080
Madam.

637
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,440
Madam?

638
00:30:12,841 --> 00:30:13,920
Sorry, Lu Tian.

639
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,200
I spaced out.

640
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,521
It's alright.

641
00:30:17,601 --> 00:30:19,721
I think this is a little hard to fathom

642
00:30:19,881 --> 00:30:21,121
for any parents.

643
00:30:21,481 --> 00:30:23,400
But please
understand Xuezhou's concerns.

644
00:30:23,961 --> 00:30:25,601
She understands your concerns.

645
00:30:26,121 --> 00:30:27,601
I believe she will give you

646
00:30:27,721 --> 00:30:29,721
an answer that you'll be satisfied with.

647
00:30:30,601 --> 00:30:31,521
I know that.

648
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,680
She is my daughter.

649
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,160
I know her too well.

650
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,560
Lu Tian, I can tell

651
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,841
you really love her.

652
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,200
I appreciate that

653
00:30:42,881 --> 00:30:44,680
you're willing to tell me everything.

654
00:30:44,961 --> 00:30:45,841
Actually,

655
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,560
I want Xuezhou to be in the company

656
00:30:48,761 --> 00:30:51,361
of someone who is
thoughtful and sensible.

657
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,200
That will be a relief
to both her father and I.

658
00:30:54,601 --> 00:30:55,200
I will

659
00:30:55,361 --> 00:30:57,121
always be there for her, Madam.

660
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,440
Thank you.

661
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,841
Mother, I'm home.

662
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:08,800
Mother?

663
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,721
(Xuezhou, I left.)

664

674
00:31:47,881 --> 00:31:49,761
(Come home during the Lunar New Year.)

675
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,800
(Your father and I miss you.)

676
00:32:25,121 --> 00:32:26,080
Why are you here?

677
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,400
I want to fight for my chances.

678
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,721
These are the certificates I received,

679
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,320
my salary slip,

680
00:32:38,641 --> 00:32:40,200
the keys to my car and my house,

681
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,320
my household register,
and my tax payment receipt.

682
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,080
And also...

683
00:32:47,721 --> 00:32:49,521
All my credit and debit cards are here.

684
00:32:51,881 --> 00:32:53,280
My phone has access to online banking.

685
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,241
The password is your birthday.

686
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,920
Procrastinator Bai told me

687
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,560
loving someone

688
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,080
means giving her everything

689
00:33:01,241 --> 00:33:02,361
and my heart.

690
00:33:03,121 --> 00:33:04,641
Here is everything I have.

691
00:33:06,601 --> 00:33:07,560
My heart is yours too.

692
00:33:10,881 --> 00:33:11,920
Whatever you want

693
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,280
is up to you.

694
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,641
I am willingly

695
00:33:27,761 --> 00:33:29,560
giving everything I have to you.

696
00:33:30,361 --> 00:33:31,440
Everything.

697
00:33:36,721 --> 00:33:37,440
And of course,

698
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,920
I'll be glad if you could

699
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,280
give me RMB 500
as my allowance per month.

700
00:33:48,521 --> 00:33:49,601
You jerk.

701
00:33:55,601 --> 00:33:57,361
Bai Qijia! Bai Qijia!

702
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,241
Here you are.

703
00:34:00,001 --> 00:34:00,680
What's wrong?

704
00:34:02,521 --> 00:34:04,680
I have good news for you.

705
00:34:05,241 --> 00:34:06,001
What is it?

706
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,121
Well...

707
00:34:07,961 --> 00:34:09,241
I now have

708
00:34:09,641 --> 00:34:11,361
exclusive rights to
the studio's management.

709
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,521
I am going to have

710
00:34:12,601 --> 00:34:14,320
my own studio soon!

711
00:34:14,521 --> 00:34:15,160
Really?

712
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,521
You'll be more independent
from now on?

713
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,241
See? You're the first person

714
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,840
to learn this good news.

715
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,880
I haven't even told Xuezhou

716
00:34:25,001 --> 00:34:26,481
and Min.

717
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,721
Lately,

718
00:34:34,001 --> 00:34:35,200
we've had both good news

719
00:34:35,321 --> 00:34:36,961
and bad news coming at us.

720
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,840
I wish everything could go as we wish.

721
00:34:40,241 --> 00:34:41,081
Well then,

722
00:34:41,961 --> 00:34:43,600
we should celebrate.

723
00:34:44,321 --> 00:34:45,281
For what?

724
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,761
I haven't started preparing.

725
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,880
An early celebration
is still a celebration.

726
00:34:49,481 --> 00:34:50,241
Besides,

727
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,880
we should celebrate
getting our love life back online.

728
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,640
Hold on.

729
00:35:00,041 --> 00:35:02,840
Why are you on my bed?

730
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,081
It's also my bed from now on.
