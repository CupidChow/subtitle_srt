Bai Qijia,

you're getting better at this.

What's the matter?

28
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,800
Nothing. There's an ad hoc consultation
at the hospital.

29
00:02:28,119 --> 00:02:29,119
They need me to go back at once.

30
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,080
Go on then. I wouldn't want
to take up any more of your time.

00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,360
I'll see you later.

34
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,360
Take care.

35
00:02:43,559 --> 00:02:44,160
See you later.

36
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,639
Hello, Mr. Chen Min.

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,960
Who are you?

38
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,199
I'm the assistant to the editor-in-chief
of Mad Eye Comics, Cheng Jun.

39
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,360
Our editor-in-chief
would like to talk to you.

40
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,479
Mad Eye Comics

41
00:03:10,559 --> 00:03:12,440
has been giving our project
nothing but trouble.

42
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:14,679
I have nothing
to say to your editor-in-chief.

43
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,119
Not right now.

44
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:18,559
But that might change in the future.

45
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,960
Fingertip Comics plays it too safe.

46
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,839
It's a waste for someone of your talents

47
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,880
to stay there.

48
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:26,080
If you ever come to your senses,

49
00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:27,559
feel free to contact me at any time.

50
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:33,479
Dr. Bai,

51
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,720
you and Miss Bai Qi

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,600
have finally gotten together.

53
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,919
I can die

54
00:03:40,399 --> 00:03:41,960
in peace now.

55
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:44,639
You're still young.
Don't say such nonsense.

56
00:03:44,839 --> 00:03:45,919
Dr. Bai,

57
00:03:46,279 --> 00:03:49,160
I know what's going on.

58
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:53,119
I've been experiencing
more difficulties lately.

59
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,360
But

60
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:57,720
please don't tell her

61
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,679
about my condition.

62
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,559
It's a fan's job

63
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:04,080
not to drag their idol down.

64
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:09,720
Don't worry.

65
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:12,520
You will get better.

66
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:18,399
Dr. Bai,

67
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,080
judging from Qiqi's records
for the past two weeks,

68
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:21,240
things aren't looking good.

69
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,839
Should I contact her family
and transfer her into intensive care?

70
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,079
Let's hold that off for a bit longer.

71
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,760
If we put her
into intensive care right now,

72
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,160
she will have a breakdown,
given her state of mind.

73
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,519
This is what we'll do.

74
00:04:29,799 --> 00:04:30,799
Keep an eye on her.

75
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,399
Let me know if anything comes up.

76
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,160
All right.

77
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,320
Thank you.

78
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,040
It's all right.

79
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,559
Hey!
Who said you could kiss my plush toy?

80
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,480
I did!

81
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:40,160
Stop that.

82
00:04:44,799 --> 00:04:45,359
Doesn't this look like you?

83
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,399
This is a dog.

84
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,320
This is a lion.

85
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,399
That's a cat.

86
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:58,799
Look at that motherly smile on you.

87
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:00,239
What?

88
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:01,440
Don't you think it's nice

89
00:05:01,559 --> 00:05:03,519
seeing the lovebirds
have fun bantering and fooling around?

90
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,119
It must be nice to be young.

91
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,320
You're only in your twenties.

92
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:09,880
Why are you having such thoughts?

93
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:10,720
Haven't they always said

94
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,200
that love could make

95
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,559
a woman glow?

96
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,239
But you sound so old
with your lamenting.

97
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,279
Why can't you say nicer things?

98
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,359
Besides,

99
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,679
who says one has to be
tender and gentle when they're in love?

100
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,399
Either way,

101
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:25,359
I'm not in an ordinary romance.

102
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:28,279
Back to business.

103
00:05:28,559 --> 00:05:30,640
The cover of the new book
and the content layout

104
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,000
have basically all been settled.

105
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:34,359
I'm sending Chen Min and Little Orange

106
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,559
to the printing house
to keep an eye on them in the afternoon.

107
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,480
All right.
But don't make them stay for too long.

108
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:41,160
It's Min's 23rd birthday.

109
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,799
I want him to come back early

110
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,480
so we can throw him
a birthday party to celebrate.

111
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,040
Right. I almost forgot about that.

112
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,920
We've been so packed with work lately.

113
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,720
He has been working hard.

114
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,279
As his big sisters,

115
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,920
we should give him

116
00:05:54,119 --> 00:05:55,279
a proper celebration.

117
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,359
You're right.

118
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:02,839
Boss. Xuezhou.

119
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,399
It's almost time.

120
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:05,880
I'll get ready to leave now.

121
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,279
The printing house
is in a remote location.

122
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,760
Come back early.

123
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,839
Be careful on your way.

124
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,239
Will do, Boss.

125
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:14,440
Don't worry, Miss Bai Qi, Xuezhou.

126
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:16,200
I will keep Min safe!

127
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:17,160
Little Orange.

128
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,320
Why do I feel like

129
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,160
you're a danger

130
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,440
to him?

131
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,079
Nothing of the sort. Bye!

132
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,000
Min!

133
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,079
You're so bad.

134
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:31,440
Can you please not hold me so tightly?

135
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:33,640
I can hardly breathe.

136
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,200
Besides,
the company pays for transport expenses.

137
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:39,119
Why can't you get a cab?

138
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,119
No. This is the treatment
a female protagonist should get

139
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,160
in those dramas.

140
00:06:42,359 --> 00:06:44,200
I want to savor this moment.

141
00:06:45,359 --> 00:06:46,880
Try to cut down on those dramas.

142
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,399
Well, on the contrary,
I think you should watch more of them.

143
00:06:49,559 --> 00:06:50,640
That way,

144
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,720
whenever we're together,

145
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:53,040
we'll be surrounded
by love bubbles.

146
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:55,160
If you keep this up,
I'm getting a cab instead.

147
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,399
Fine. I'll stop teasing you.

148
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,239
Relax.

149
00:07:17,799 --> 00:07:19,079
Not going to call it a day yet?

150
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:21,600
I have a prior engagement tonight,
so I won't be staying back with you.

151
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,200
Got it.

152
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,600
Go do your thing, Editor Lin.

153
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,720
Listen.

154
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,320
Try to leave early and get some rest.

155
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,839
I don't want Bai Qijia to think

156
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:32,480
that I'm overworking you.

157
00:07:32,679 --> 00:07:34,720
All right. Got it.

158
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:37,559
Make sure you drink more water.

You're as enchanting as ever.

why?

169

That's too heavy-worded, Editor Lin.

170
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,559
It's business competition.

171
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,799
There are things we must do.

174

You're incredibly competent
and capable yourself, Editor Lin.

175
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:45,919
The subordinates you've led

176

they'll need a better platform
to maximize their potential.

181
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,359
They'll need to find other places
to spread their wings.

182

Sorry, Mr. Tian.

no matter what they decide.

00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:27,479
Your wish is my wish.

335
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,280
All right.

336
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,880
I hope our studio

337
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,239
becomes independent soon!

338
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,880
I hope the four of us
can always be together

339
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,880
and do what we love, comics.

340
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:42,359
Go, go, go!

341
00:16:42,479 --> 00:16:44,159
Go, go, go!

342
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,599
Let's blow out the candles together.

343
00:16:45,719 --> 00:16:46,280
Okay.

344
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:53,840
Qin Ge, once you have your own studio,

345
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,440
make sure you sign Min first.

346
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:57,760
Of course. That's a given.

347
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,679
Min is my best assistant.

348
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,280
What about me?

349
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,880
You? You're my best

350
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,159
follower.

351
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:07,400
That's good too.

352
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,479
Here.

353
00:17:10,159 --> 00:17:11,599
Cut the cake.

354
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:14,520
Boss,

355
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,079
I have something I want to tell you.

356
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,199
Thank you.

357
00:17:29,239 --> 00:17:31,640
Oh, you don't have
to be so formal with me.

358
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,079
Qin Ge, from now on,

359
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:51,520
I don't want

360
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,920
to play a good little brother
to you anymore.

361
00:17:53,199 --> 00:17:54,239
I like you.

362
00:17:54,959 --> 00:17:56,520
Please be my girlfriend.

363
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,479
Procrastinator Bai,

364
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:12,839
they should just be starting now.

365
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:14,199
It's not too late
for us to head over there.

366
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:16,359
Lu Tian,

367
00:18:16,479 --> 00:18:18,880
people need space from each other.

368
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:20,319
If you're too suffocating,

369
00:18:20,439 --> 00:18:21,880
you might get opposite results.

370
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:23,359
Procrastinator Bai,

371
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,640
the well-fed cannot know
how the starving suffer.

372
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:27,040
We're not like you guys,

373
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,239
who get to be together every day.

374
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,160
Of course, I would want
to be with her whenever I can.

375
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:32,280
Isn't that what people do
when they're in love?

376
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:41,040
Fine. Since you're ignoring me too,
I might as well head home.

377
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:45,680
Min,

378
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,719
it's your birthday,

379
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,599
but there are things
that shouldn't be made a joke of.

380
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:53,400
I'm not joking.

381
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,199
I'm serious about Qin Ge.

382
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:57,119
Min!

383
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:07,400
Min,

384
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:10,119
both you and Qin are family to me.

385
00:19:10,479 --> 00:19:12,359
I've told you what I should.

386
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:15,119
You can't force these things.

387
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:26,680
Xuezhou,

388
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:30,439
take Tian Cheng back first.

389
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,560
I need to talk to Min.

390
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,119
Let's go, Little Orange.

391
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:40,079
I'm not leaving.

392
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,880
Come on. Let's go.

393
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,719
Min.

394
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:58,160
Min,

395
00:19:58,719 --> 00:19:59,959
you know this.

396
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:01,479
You're my assistant,

397
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:03,400
but I've always thought of you
as my little brother.

398
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,119
No.

399
00:20:04,719 --> 00:20:05,599
You only think that

400
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,560
because Bai Qijia came back.

401
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:10,160
His return has nothing to do with this.

402
00:20:10,479 --> 00:20:11,239
Even if he didn't come back,

403
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:12,920
I wouldn't be able
to find myself loving anyone else.

404
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,880
Really?

405
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,439
But you said you like me.

406
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,800
If he didn't come back,

407
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,119
then what we have

408
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:20,319
might have become romantic love.

409
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,199
Min,

410
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:23,239
is that why you think
Bai Qijia stole me from you

411
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:24,400
and why you were making things hard
for him on purpose?

412
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,839
Isn't that true?

413
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:27,199
He is just a part of your memory.

414
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,800
He should stay there.

415
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,680
What gives him the right

416
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,119
to come back and take you from me?

417
00:20:31,199 --> 00:20:33,079
Calm down, Min!

418
00:20:34,479 --> 00:20:35,760
It's not like that.

419
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,199
Eight years ago,

420
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,760
I was diagnosed
with systemic lupus erythematosus.

421
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,040
I was suffering, so I chose to run away.

422
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:46,359
But eight years later,
Bai Qijia came back.

423
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,959
It was his support and encouragement

424
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,319
that made me realize

425
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,880
that love

426
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:53,119
could withstand everything.

427
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,880
It was he
who made me pick up the courage

428
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,040
and confidence to love again.

429
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,719
What about me?

430
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:02,239
If Bai Qijia can do it, then so can I!

431
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:04,000
Did he tell you to say these things?

432
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:04,880
Did he?

433
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,880
No!

434
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,199
You guys are different!

You guys are different.

436
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,599
I don't belong to anyone.

437
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:17,160
Every decision I made

438
00:21:17,239 --> 00:21:19,000
was of my own choice.

439
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,839
So you never let him go.

440
00:21:30,479 --> 00:21:32,079
You've been lying to me all this time.

00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,239
You better get out of here right now.

502
00:25:34,719 --> 00:25:36,560
Or you might pay for staying.

503
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,439
Guru,

504
00:25:38,479 --> 00:25:40,040
I really, really

505
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,680
like your works.

506
00:25:42,439 --> 00:25:43,920
Please just take a look at mine.

507
00:25:44,439 --> 00:25:45,319
Just one look.

508
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,640
One glance.

509
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:56,280
Not bad.

510
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,239
Your drawings look lively.

511
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,599
I've been complimented by the guru!

512
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,800
I've been blessed!

513
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,560
Stop.

514
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,359
But look here.

515
00:26:08,479 --> 00:26:10,079
Try to refine

516
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,400
the shading here.

517
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,479
See? If you do,
it'll look even livelier.

518
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,239
And this part. Adjust the composition

519
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,119
of the character here,

520
00:26:19,239 --> 00:26:20,439
and it'll improve the balance.

521
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,239
Overall,

522
00:26:23,439 --> 00:26:26,079
you have good drawing skills,
but there's still room for improvement.

523
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,560
Keep it up.

524
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:29,439
Thank you, Miss Bai Qi.

525
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,040
Miss Bai Qi,

526
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,959
would you consider taking an apprentice?

527
00:26:36,239 --> 00:26:37,119
Apprentice?

528
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:38,040
Yes.

529
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,359
I can give you
a free trial for three months.

530
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,119
No. Ten.

531
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:45,199
You can return the goods
for any reason if you aren't satisfied.

532
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,079
But I don't feel like signing up.

533
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:50,880
I'm good value for your money.

534
00:26:51,199 --> 00:26:52,479
Please think about it.

535
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:54,920
I prefer someone expensive.
The more expensive, the better.

536
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,439
Miss Bai Qi,

537
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,800
I went through many comic studios

538
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,760
to find you.

539
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,239
It was fate
that we ran into each other here.

540
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:02,239
Please give me a chance, Miss Bai Qi.

541
00:27:04,239 --> 00:27:06,160
You've been to many comics studios

542
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:07,680
and met so many comic artists.

543
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,199
Why does it have to be me?

544
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:09,959
Well,

545
00:27:09,959 --> 00:27:11,560
since our previous collaboration,

546
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,599
I've been deeply impressed

547
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,920
by your grasp of creativity,

548
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:18,119
your sense of colors,

549
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,119
and your solid basic art skills.

550
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,439
Well-said.

551
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,400
Now,

552
00:27:23,479 --> 00:27:25,760
you can use those words
on every comic artist.

553
00:27:26,719 --> 00:27:27,400
Miss Bai Qi.

554
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,560
Hands off.

555
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,400
Just one last thing.

556
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,400
I can feel

557
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,959
your passion and commitment
to your work.

558
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:35,800
Of course,

559
00:27:36,199 --> 00:27:38,319
I don't want to be a name
attached to your works,

560
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,599
but I guarantee

561
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,000
that I can make your works famous.

562
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:42,839
I promise!

563
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,239
Young man, you're very conceited.

564
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:48,760
I can be conceited too,

565
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,160
but we aren't compatible.

566
00:27:50,719 --> 00:27:52,640
Miss Bai Qi. Miss Bai Qi!

567
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,160
(Fingertip Comics)

568
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,040
Miss Bai...

569
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,839
Listen to me.
You need to attend this meeting!

570
00:28:00,199 --> 00:28:00,839
Did you see

571
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:02,800
a woman with a guilty look on her face?
Where did she go?

572
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,079
She went that way. That way.

573
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,599
Thanks!

574
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,599
Qin Ge, get back here!

575
00:28:15,479 --> 00:28:16,439
Miss Bai Qi,

576
00:28:16,719 --> 00:28:17,680
the coast is clear.

577
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:20,319
You're safe.

578
00:28:20,719 --> 00:28:21,839
She went that way.

579
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,400
Thanks.

580
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:28,079
This way.

581
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,520
Are you a stalker?

582
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,719
Of course not.

583
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,040
I helped someone out,

584
00:28:36,199 --> 00:28:37,640
but she hasn't repaid me yet.

585
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,800
So I can't leave.

586
00:28:40,439 --> 00:28:42,520
All right. Name your price.

587
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,400
I told you.

588
00:28:44,719 --> 00:28:47,040
A free trial for three to six months.

589
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:49,520
You can change your mind
anytime, without reason.

590
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,199
What?

591
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,680
Are you interested?

592
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:57,680
If I accept,

593
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,160
that makes you my employee.

594
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:02,319
You would have your salary deducted

595
00:29:02,479 --> 00:29:03,640
for talking to your boss like that.

596
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,119
I would even be willing to pay

597
00:29:05,239 --> 00:29:06,880
to be able to work with you.

598
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,959
Are you from a rich family?

599
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:08,800
No.

600
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,760
Can you cook?

601
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,839
No. But I know the best food deliveries.

602
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:12,760
Are you a clean freak?

603
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,439
No.

604
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,920
But I can adapt to any environment.

605
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,400
All right. Stop following me.

606
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:24,400
Report for duty
at Bai Qi Studio tomorrow.

607
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,760
Miss Bai Qi...

608
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:38,239
Boss...

609
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:42,640
So, all this while,

610
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,560
I was chasing the light.

611
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,599
I was never meant to stand beside you.

612
00:29:58,079 --> 00:29:59,079
Another.

613
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:06,520
You need to stop drinking.

614
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:08,800
I'll call your boss
to come and pick you up.

615
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:11,359
Boss?

616
00:30:16,199 --> 00:30:17,520
I don't have a boss anymore.

617
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,560
What?

618
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,319
I don't have a boss anymore.

619
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,199
Not anymore...

620
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:38,800
There, there. Don't cry.

621
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,239
You're back.

622
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,800
It's all right. Don't think too much.

623
00:30:44,479 --> 00:30:45,680
Xuezhou told me

624
00:30:46,239 --> 00:30:48,280
what happened on my way back.
It's all right.

625
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:51,920
But I feel so guilty.

626
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:55,199
I should've told him sooner.

627
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,599
I was his boss.

628
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,719
I should've protected him forever.

629
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,439
But I was careless.

630
00:31:08,439 --> 00:31:11,160
I didn't consider his feelings at all.

631
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,959
It's all right. It's not your fault.

632
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:15,000
Don't overthink it.

633
00:31:18,479 --> 00:31:20,479
But it wasn't wrong of him

634
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,599
to express his feelings either.

635
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,439
It's inevitable.

636
00:31:24,719 --> 00:31:26,680
It's not a result we want,

637
00:31:27,439 --> 00:31:29,719
but we have to accept it.

638
00:31:31,719 --> 00:31:32,479
It'll be all right.

639
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,079
Then,

640
00:31:35,959 --> 00:31:38,040
do you think he will come back?

641
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:40,920
It'll be fine.
Don't think about these now.
