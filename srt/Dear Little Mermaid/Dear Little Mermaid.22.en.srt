Miss Bai Qi's body has given up on her.

with a solution.

I think

Qin Ge doesn't want to burden Bai Qijia.

So, she wants

How about you pay her a visit?

69
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,330
Pay her a visit?

70
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,660
But she'll be even upset

71
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,730
if she sees me.

72
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:52,220
She won't be.

73
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,610

that everything is in the past now.

75
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:00,570

that she has always thought of you
as a companion.

80

333
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:07,130
about something so serious?

334
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:08,620
Why did you refuse to get treated?

335
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,010
What if anything happens...

336
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,460
Dad.

337
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,650
Stop it.

338
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,340
Please move aside.

339
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:16,860
It's time for her surgery.

340
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:17,980
Okay.

341
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:18,940
Okay.

342
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,130
Miss Bai Qi, all the best.

343
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,450
(Surgical Ward)

344
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,410
Bai.

345
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,820
My daughter has such a hard life.

346
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,460
Mr. Qin, don't worry.

347
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,770
Dr. Yu is
the best orthopaedic specialist

348
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:00,980
in our hospital. She'll be fine.

349
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:01,860
She'll be fine.

350
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,890
I'm just waiting
for this promise from you.

351
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:06,250
It's good to have
a doctor in our family.

352
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,620
I feel at ease with you here.

353
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,620
Besides, Mr. Qin, think about it.

354
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,100
Qin Ge is under the knife now.

355
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:12,980
I'm sure

356
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,370
she doesn't want
to see you like this, right?

357
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,740
Yes.

358
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:19,010
Yes. She'll be fine.

359
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:23,940
Dr. Bai, there's an emergency
with a patient of ours.

360
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,620
Director Cao has asked you
to attend to it right away.

361
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,370
Bai.

362
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,250
It's okay. Go and do your job.

363
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:30,490
I'll be back soon.

364
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,250
Dr. Bai, don't worry.

365
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:35,370
She has us here.

366
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,410
This patient has a unique condition.

367
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:49,820
So, we have to be well prepared
before the surgery.

368
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:50,860
I'm sorry for being late,

369
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:51,370
Director.

370
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:52,060
Okay.

371
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:53,340
Take a look at this first.

372
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:42,860
Qin Ge.

373
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:43,770
Qin Ge.

374
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,530
-Miss Bai Qi.
-How is she?

375
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:47,770
The replacement surgery is a success.

376
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:50,580
She can recover as soon as three days
or one month at most.

377
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,100
Then, she can start
with her rehabilitation treatment.

378
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:54,890
Thank you.

379
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:55,700
Thank you.

380
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,940
Mr. Qin.

381
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:58,460
The surgery is a success.

382
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,620
You should let Mr. Yu rest.

383
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:01,890
That's right.

384
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:02,890
I'm sorry.

385
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:04,530
-I'm too excited.
-It's okay.

386
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:05,370
Let's go back to the ward.

387
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:06,290
Let's go.

388
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:07,490
Let's go.

389
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,650
Thank you.

390
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:39,890
Qin Ge.

391
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:42,820
Don't move first.

392
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,410
I've asked Xuezhou
to send the others back.

393
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,890
They'll visit you again tomorrow.

394
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,010
Okay. Drink some water first.

395
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,700
You look so calm.

396
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,700
The surgery must be a success.

397
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:20,170
I'm indeed the chosen one.

398
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,290
Of course. You have me.

399
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,410
I promised that you'll recover.

400
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,370
I believe in you.

401
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:45,940
My mouth is still a little bit dry.

402
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:06,130
Slowly.

403
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:12,740
Qin Ge is adapting very well
to the replaced joints.

404
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:15,290
She can already walk slowly
two days after the surgery.

405
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,370
If she follows the rehabilitation
treatment of the hospital,

406
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:18,980
although the process
will be hard on her,

407
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:21,250
she can walk normally again

408
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:22,250
-in a month's time.
-I'm fine.

409
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:24,770
Other than that, she needs
to get more leg massages

410
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,700
-Be careful.
-to prevent venous thrombosis.

411
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,220
Okay. Don't worry, Dr. Yu.

412
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:29,650
She'll be fine under my care.

413
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:30,490
Thank you.

414
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,290
Okay. That's it for now.

415
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:36,220
Take it slowly.

416
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:37,890
I can do it.

417
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:42,460
Be careful.

418
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,290
Are you okay?

419
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:45,170
I'm fine.

420
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,370
I can do it.

421
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:52,740
I can do it.

422
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:53,890
-Take a rest.
-I can do it.

423
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:01,130
It's okay.

424
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:01,980
I can do it myself.

425
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,370
Be careful.

426
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:27,890
Qin Ge.

427
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,290
-Be careful.
-I'm fine!

428
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:36,370
You did it.

429
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:41,290
I told you that you can do it.

430
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,410
I walked all the way here.

431
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:46,100
Yes, you did.

432
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:47,370
I walked all the way here.

433
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:49,460
I did it!

434
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,980
Who is this princess?

435
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:21,460
You are wearing

436
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,460
the magical dress of Cinderella.

437
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,100
The iron lady in the past

438
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,220
has become a princess on the run.

439
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:29,100
Thank you.

440
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:34,370
Have I gotten fatter lately?

441
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:38,820
You ate all of my hospital food.

442
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,060
Of course you'll get fatter.

443
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,130
Besides, why did you choose
a western wedding dress?

444
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,460
Don't you like the Chinese wedding dress
I chose for you?

445
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,460
Are you doubting my taste?

446
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,010
That's right.

447
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:50,580
Don't you think

448
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:53,940
that a western wedding dress

449
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,410
can show off my curves better?

450
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:58,980
Besides, think about it.

451
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,770
That Chinese wedding dress

452
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,460
suits you better.

453
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,860
It's fate that binds
the two of you together.

454
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,100
I can't wait.

455
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:07,530
What kind of a betrothal gift

456
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:09,460
will Bai Qijia prepare for you?

457
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,100
I don't know.
I've heard nothing about it.

458
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:15,410
You are going on a honeymoon, right?

459
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:18,060
What about the follow-up
for the Qianye Film & TV?

460
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:21,010
Don't worry. Leave it to Little Orange.

461
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:22,250
When the time comes,

462
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,250
you just need to be a tool.

463
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:26,490
You are putting her
in charge of everything?

464
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:28,170
You are abusing child labour.

465
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,980
Don't worry.

466
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:33,890
If Little Orange can't handle it,
she can

467
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,740
charge herself with love.

468
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,290
Charge herself with love.

469
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,700
Don't I look beautiful today?

470
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,410
You are my queen today.

471
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:53,940
Come and take a photo with me now.

472
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:55,010
Yes, Your Majesty.

473
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:57,340
Here I come.
