Xuezhou? Why are you here?

00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,000
You...

24
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:05,799
Come... Come inside first.

00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,040
-Take a seat.
-Come inside.

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,839
What... What's the matter, Xuezhou?

27
00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:15,799
Take a seat.

28
00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:22,239
Have some water.

29
00:02:25,999 --> 00:02:26,840
What's the matter?

30
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,079
What exactly happened?

31
00:02:29,359 --> 00:02:31,920
Lu Tian will move out
of my place tomorrow.

32
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,439
He might never come back.

33
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,680
I don't want to be at home

34
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,120
when he leaves.

35
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,480
I'll be troubling you guys
in the meantime.

36
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,680
I... you...

37
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:43,999
Did you guys break up again?

38
00:02:47,359 --> 00:02:48,079
Yes.

39
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,560
No need to drag it out.

40
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,439
Go back.

41
00:02:58,359 --> 00:03:00,280
You guys carry on.
I'll head back upstairs.

42
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,439
What happened between you two?

43
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,960
Why did you guys break up again?

44
00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:13,879
We had a huge argument.

45
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:16,599
I think I've been too selfish.

46
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,320
All this while,

47
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:20,400
I've taken everything he did for me,

48
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,480
all his efforts and his understanding,

49
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:23,680
for granted.

50
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:24,599
I never considered

51
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:27,120
his feelings in this relationship.

52
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:28,999
So...

53
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:31,120
Was he the one who wanted to break up?

54
00:03:31,999 --> 00:03:32,799
No.

55
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:34,879
It was me.

56
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,840
I can't give him the happiness he wants.

57
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,840
So I shouldn't drag it out any longer.

58
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,920
I can't be sure of myself

59
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,280
in this relationship.

60
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:52,439
I worry

61
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:55,239
that he'll only grow disappointed
the longer he stays with me.

62
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,439
No, I mean... Xuezhou.

63
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,400
Why aren't you sure of yourself?

64
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,120
Lu Tian has always wanted

65
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,200
a family of his own.

66
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,320
He wants us to have a child

67
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,799
and for us to live as a happy family.

68
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,920
But... All of this

69
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:18,280
is too soon for me.

70
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,079
I'm not ready

71
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:21,079
for those yet.

72
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:22,439
So...

73
00:04:27,799 --> 00:04:29,079
And I don't want

74
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:31,639
to give up the job
I love so much right now.

75
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,280
We're moving
at completely different paces.

76
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,359
Do you get it?

77
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:38,440
In that case,
it would be better to set him free

78
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:42,160
and let him go after what he wants.

79
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,519
Xuezhou.

80
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,960
Let's sleep on it tonight.

81
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,840
Tomorrow,
I'll tell Little Orange to come over,

82
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,600
and we'll figure something out.

83
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,919
Let's not make hasty decisions.

84
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,319
Who knows? Maybe you'll change your mind

85
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,079
when you wake up.

86
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,160
The future is unknown.

87
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:07,919
It's all right.

88
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,639
It'll be fine.

89
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,639
What am I supposed to do this time?

90
00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:21,079
No idea.

91
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,560
(Present)

92
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,440
But figure out a way

93
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,319
to get Xuezhou
out of my place as soon as possible.

94
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:31,799
I'm pouring my heart out to you here,

95
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,160
and you're showing off.

96
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,759
Have you no heart?

97
00:05:35,239 --> 00:05:37,280
Besides,
what do you mean by "your place"?

98
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:39,759
Are you on Qin Ge's household register?

99
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,720
I will be. Soon.

100
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,680
Well, tell me then.

101
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,560
Why do you want to leave?

102
00:05:45,799 --> 00:05:47,000
Is it really about the parents?

103
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,400
Of course not.

104
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,440
I don't think I matter to her at all.

105
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:55,319
It isn't the first time for
this to happen.

106
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,239
We haven't seen each other

107
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:58,479
in almost a year, right?

108
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,239
Yes.

109
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,319
Let's drink to our hearts' content then.

110
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,400
I'll go first.

111
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,799
-Here.
-A toast.

112
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:04,720
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

113
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,680
-Here.
-Cheers.

114
00:06:09,799 --> 00:06:11,720
-The food looks good.
-Looks delicious.

115
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,359
Sorry.

116
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,359
I wanted

117
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,160
to introduce my fiancée to all of you.

118
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:22,560
But she suddenly had
to work overtime today,

119
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,840
so she might be late.

120
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,680
Let's start without her.

121
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:27,759
That's fine.

122
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,400
Besides, we saw her

123
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,880
at Bai Qijia's place last time.

124
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:32,639
Working life is hard.

125
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,400
Nothing unusual to work overtime.

126
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,759
Yes. It's normal.

127
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,680
It can't be helped.
It's the life of an employee.

128
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,000
Let's eat.

129
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:40,880
-All right. Let's dig in.
-Let's eat.

130
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:43,199
-Here.
-Have some of this.

131
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,079
We haven't seen each other

132
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,039
since graduation, right?

133
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:46,840
That's right.

134
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,039
Where have you been since?

135
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,079
All around the country.

136
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,239
All around the country?

137
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:51,639
Do you have a boyfriend now?

138
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,079
With my situation? No way.

139
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:55,359
When I become rich,
I'll find a younger man.

140
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:56,840
I'm still single too.

141
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,680
Which city are you based in right now?

142
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,919
Hangzhou.

143
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,199
Excuse me.

144
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,639
Sorry, everyone...

145
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,880
I'm sorry, Lu Tian.

146
00:07:57,239 --> 00:07:59,160
We had a work summary meeting

147
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,280
today.

148
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:02,039
That's why I came late.

149
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,120
We've been done eating
for some time now.

150
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,000
So I told them to leave first.

151
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:18,039
I don't understand.

152
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,960
Why couldn't you tell me sooner

153
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,759
that you had a meeting?

154
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,799
I honestly forgot
that I had another meeting today.

155
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:27,840
But I texted you

156
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,720
at the soonest, didn't I?

157
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,440
But it was already at night.

158
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,000
I can't even be sure

159
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,000
if you actually had a meeting

160
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,720
or you just didn't want to come.

161
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,480
What do you mean by that?

162
00:08:45,999 --> 00:08:47,040
Tell me.

163
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,040
What else is there to say?

164
00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:55,160
Time and time again,

165
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,079
I've tried to introduce you
to my friends.

166
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,800
But you've always
come up with all sorts of excuses.

167
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:01,519
This time, you even told me

168
00:09:02,119 --> 00:09:03,559
you forgot you had a meeting.

169
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:11,319
Of all the people I know,

170
00:09:11,439 --> 00:09:13,199
you have the best sense of time.

171
00:09:15,439 --> 00:09:16,679
So what do you expect me to think

172
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,720
when you pull something like this?

173
00:09:36,319 --> 00:09:38,280
There have been
too many similar incidents.

174
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:41,280
She wouldn't even spend a second on me.

175
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,040
I thought

176
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,559
her work was my biggest competitor.

177
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,400
But now,
it looks like I won't stand a chance

178
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,160
even if work
is taken out of the picture.

179
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,639
Alas,
I've nothing left in the end, after all!

180
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,319
Do you regret

181
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:02,160
telling her how you feel then?

182
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,559
Well, no.

183
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,559
I just think

184
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:13,160
I should've told her how I felt sooner,

185
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,400
instead of dumping it all on her
all of a sudden like this.

186
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,400
I feel awful

187
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:17,960
when I think about

188
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,559
the things I said to her.

189
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,999
I don't know
what you guys were thinking.

190
00:10:26,319 --> 00:10:27,759
You guys could have

191
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:29,400
just talked about this peacefully.

192
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,400
But you two just had
to create this whole mess.

193
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:34,960
Well, what do you think I should do now?

194
00:10:38,199 --> 00:10:39,960
If you regret it,

195
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,319
you should think
about what you should do next.

196
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,840
I think there's still hope
for you guys to fix this.

197
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:52,319
It's time for me to do my rounds.

198
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,639
Clear your head.

199
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:11,519
Xuezhou,

200
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,480
if Dr. Lu upsets you that much,

201
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:14,679
you should just break up with him.

202
00:11:14,999 --> 00:11:16,519
There is plenty

203
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:18,280
of other fish in the sea.

204
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,199
All right. You can shut up now.

205
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,079
I shouldn't have brought you here.

206
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:22,720
I...

207
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,160
Xuezhou,

208
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,840
don't think about those things first.

209
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,040
We respect your decision,

210
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:32,079
but you need to think things through

211
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,679
before making your decision.

212
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:35,480
Honestly,

213
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,800
I don't know what I want either.

214
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,439
But I don't want him

215
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:43,920
to keep accommodating me.

216
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,999
I think he is right.

217
00:11:47,119 --> 00:11:49,040
Sometimes,
I don't even know what my problem is.

218
00:11:49,199 --> 00:11:51,319
I have so many expectations of him,

219
00:11:51,439 --> 00:11:52,199
but he...

220
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:54,960
He always compromises.

221
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,439
Xuezhou,

222
00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:00,240
you're a fierce
and assertive career woman

223
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,999
at work.

224
00:12:02,439 --> 00:12:03,360
But why do you

225
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,960
always retreat
when it comes to relationship?

226
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,480
I don't know either.

227
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,439
Xuezhou,

228
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,319
don't cry.

229
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,160
I think

230
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,720
you just didn't sleep well last night.

231
00:12:20,999 --> 00:12:23,160
Go and get a bit more rest.

232
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,519
Think about it again

233
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,600
after you've freshened your mind.

234
00:12:26,999 --> 00:12:28,679
In any case, we will support you

235
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,759
no matter what you decide to do.

236
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,679
Okay?

237
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:35,800
Okay.

238
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:38,559
Miss Bai Qi,

239
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:39,800
I think we need to do something

240
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,759
to get Dr. Lu and Xuezhou back together.

241
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:44,480
That's not what you said earlier.

242
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:46,079
I just said that to placate her.

243
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,920
It's obvious
she still has feelings for him.

244
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:50,559
So we have to help them.

245
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,199
You're right.

246
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:55,240
Love is the chemistry of two people.

247
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,400
We can't just have
one person accelerating.

248
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,999
Maybe I can resonate with Dr. Lu

249
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:02,639
because we're both the type

250
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,079
to take the initiative
and give too much.

251
00:13:07,439 --> 00:13:08,999
I envy the 00s.

252
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,600
Why?

253
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,600
Nothing.

254
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:13,759
I said I came up with an idea

255
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,999
that'll get them back together

256
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,480
and rekindle their love.

257
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:18,559
What is it?

258
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:21,960
Have you ever heard of true love
in times of trouble?

259
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,999
Remember to help me.

260
00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:35,920
All right. It's decided.

261
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,639
Don't forget.

262
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,439
It's settled then. Goodbye.

263
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:45,920
You're home!

264
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,879
You look like you're having a good time.
Who were you talking to?

265
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:52,800
Su Lun.

266
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,240
I asked him for a favor.

267
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,040
You and Xuezhou are friends, all right.

268
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:00,639
How so?

269
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:02,119
Both of you have got this boy

270
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,759
wrapped around your fingers.

271
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:06,480
What are you talking about?

272
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,639
I don't understand what you mean.

273
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,679
You don't?

274
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,079
Speaking of Su Lun,

275
00:14:11,439 --> 00:14:12,840
I remember one other matter.

276
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,679
Bai Qijia,

277
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,559
I never expected you

278
00:14:18,999 --> 00:14:20,639
to have a jealous side.

279
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:24,559
Wait. No. I didn't do anything wrong.

280
00:14:25,439 --> 00:14:26,280
All right.

281
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,439
We'll drop that for now.

282
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:29,559
Tell me.

283
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,240
What were you guys
plotting over the phone?

284
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:34,559
It's about Xuezhou and Lu Tian.

285
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,439
I want to put them

286
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:37,519
in each other's shoes.

287
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,199
Bubaiqi Plan

288
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,400
and Qianye Film & TV

289
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:42,960
came up with a new escape room theme.

290
00:14:43,319 --> 00:14:44,840
I want them to experience the game.

291
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:47,319
It just so happens
that they need beta-testers.

292
00:14:47,439 --> 00:14:48,679
It's the perfect opportunity, isn't it?

293
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,040
Escape room?

294
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,119
What's that?
Why haven't we been to one together?

295
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:55,639
An old man like you

296
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:57,759
wouldn't know
what the young people are playing.

297
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,600
What are you doing, Bai Qijia?

298
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:04,119
Just claiming what's mine.

299
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:05,920
Put me down!

300
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,040
Put me down!

301
00:15:21,319 --> 00:15:22,879
(Welcome to Bubaiqi Plan's)

I haven't forgiven you

315
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,879
for what you did last night.

316
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:02,480
Oh, don't be like that.

317
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,280
Look.

318
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:06,480
They're moving.

319
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:38,319
Xuezhou,

320
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,240
I said too much that day.

321
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,439
I was drunk,
and I was careless with my words.

322
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:46,119
I...

323
00:16:46,119 --> 00:16:48,079
Lu Tian,
you don't have to force yourself.

324
00:16:49,119 --> 00:16:50,040
I didn't know

325
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:51,879
they made you come here too.

326
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:53,600
Since we're here,

327
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,160
let's not make things awkward.

328
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:57,439
We just need to complete our task

329
00:16:57,439 --> 00:16:58,759
and get out of here.

330
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,439
So you didn't come here to see me today?

331
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,040
It was all for your job?

332
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,960
Let's focus on finding the clues.

333
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,079

What the heck?

501
00:26:54,439 --> 00:26:56,600
I feel like
I missed everything overnight!

502
00:26:58,079 --> 00:26:59,559
The three of us are the only ones left

503
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,520
in the single club.

504
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,960
Who says so? I have a boyfriend.

505
00:27:04,199 --> 00:27:06,279
Sorry. I'm taken too.

506
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,039
Fine. Very well.

507
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,120
I guess I'm the only single person left.

508
00:27:17,199 --> 00:27:18,880
Something's up with you two.

509
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:22,159
Now, now. You must be positive.

510
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:23,720
Don't be envious of others.

511
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:26,960
Miss Bai Qi is right.

512
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:27,760
Xue.

513
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:28,760
Let's go.

514
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,199
I'm sorry.

515
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,559
Bye!

516
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,919
Interesting.

517
00:27:40,439 --> 00:27:42,319
You guys are so happily in love.

518
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,319
I thought it would be over

519
00:27:44,439 --> 00:27:46,559
between Xuezhou and Dr. Lu for sure.

520
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,919
I underestimated the power of love.

521
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:49,960
Why are you so pessimistic?

522
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:51,919
You should be more optimistic.

523
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:54,319
Besides, things weren't all that smooth

524
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:55,559
between them.

525
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,520
It was all thanks
to Lu Tian's perseverance.

526
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,960
Had he been any less persistent

527
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:01,000
or given up fighting for them,

528
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,520
Xuezhou would've flown off

529
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:05,799
like a kite with its strings cut.

530
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,640
But I think Dr. Lu is fortunate.

531
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,480
I persisted with Min too.

532
00:28:13,199 --> 00:28:15,439
But it was all one-sided.

533
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:17,840
But it's all right.

534
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:19,399
I will never give up on him.

535
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:21,240
I will make sure I get him.

536
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,760
I'm sorry, Miss Bai Qi.

537
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,120
I didn't mean to bring him up.

538
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,880
It's fine.

539
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,640
It has been a long time
since that incident.

540
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,799
Besides, we've been through
thick and thin together.

541
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,439
Keep it up, Tian Cheng.

542
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,919
It's much easier for a woman
to pursue a man.

543
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:45,480
Just hold on for a bit longer,

544
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,640
and you'll get your man.

545
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,039
No pain, no gain.

546
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,880
No pain, no gain?

547
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,880
Miss Bai Qi,

548
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,000
it's true that three years is a gap.

549
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:55,679
I haven't heard
that saying in a long time.

550
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:56,840
Who are you calling old?

551
00:28:58,559 --> 00:28:59,279
Me.

552
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,199
Besides, you just need to try harder.

553
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,439
It's easy to win Min over.

554
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:06,919
I mean, look at me.
I'm a hard one to get.

555
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,399
But Bai Qijia got me, didn't he?

556
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,600
You can do it too.

557
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,720
Right.

558
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:13,960
I'll be going out this afternoon.

559
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:15,520
I'll leave you to handle the storyboard.

560
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,840
I'll collect it tomorrow.

561
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:21,039
No problem. I promise I'll get it done.

562
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,240
Good luck!

(Comprehensive Department Clinic)

565
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,799
Dr. Yu,

566
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,960
are things not looking good?

567
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,399
Your femoral head problem has worsened.

568
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,319
If this continues,

569
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,439
you will need a surgery.

570
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,520
So direct?

571
00:29:53,199 --> 00:29:54,199
You're not even easing me into it.

572
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:55,199
Ease you into it?

573
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,159
Are you serious?

574
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:58,399
Qin Ge,

575
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,120
I already told you not to underestimate

576
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:01,880
these issues.

577
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:03,199
And what did you do?

578
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,360
You haven't been taking
your medication regularly

579
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,880
since you started your treatment.

580
00:30:07,199 --> 00:30:09,399
You've also overdosed
which caused hormone abuse.

581
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:12,039
Those are what led
to your current predicament.

582
00:30:13,199 --> 00:30:14,679
You got better in past two years.

583
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,960
You listened to your doctors.

584
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,679
But the moment
things started to look up,

585
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:20,919
you missed your appointments
for follow-up examinations.

586
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:24,720
What else do you want me to say, Qin Ge?

587
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,039
Well, I was around 18 or 19 back then.

588
00:30:28,199 --> 00:30:29,319
I was rebellious.

589
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,399
I've just been so busy
the last few months.

590
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,600
I didn't mean to miss them, Dr. Yu.

591
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,439
All right.

592
00:30:37,199 --> 00:30:38,039
Continue taking your medication for now.

593
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,840
We will stick to
conservative treatment for now.

594
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:42,840
But remember this.

595
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,880
Absolutely no strenuous exercise
for the time being.

596
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,360
And take your medicine as prescribed.

597
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,360
Otherwise,

598
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,799
only the operating table awaits you.

599
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,799
But considering your condition,

600
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,679
I really hope

601
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,559
it won't come to that.

602
00:30:58,199 --> 00:30:58,919
You can go now.

603
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,439
I understand.

604
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,640
Thank you, Dr. Yu.

to be more mindful now.)

607
00:31:41,439 --> 00:31:42,840
Yes. Look.

This indicator...

609
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,039
That doesn't look good.

610
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,600
Do your thing.
