(Comprehensive Department)
Systemic lupus erythematosus

21
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,680
is a type of disease caused by

22
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,160
low autoimmunity of one's body.

23
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,800
During the initial stage of it,

24
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,480
the patient will get
full body of skin rash.

25
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,720
Let's take a look,

26

two cases of transverse resistance,

27
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,160
the patients of systemic
lupus erythematosus

28
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,360
are all females.

29
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,800
During the entire treatment,

30
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,960
we are required to take
an effective approach

31
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,440
to maintain the permanence of the
patient's skin and mucous membranes,

00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,000
lower the impact on
life caused by sore joints.

After checking your inspection report,

34
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,720
you're recovering well.

35
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,880
However, you still have to keep it up.

Dr. Bai,

37
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,920
Director Cao would like
to see you in his office.

38
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,880
Alright, got it.

39
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,960
You must rest well,

40
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,320
don't let your guard down.

41
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,600
I'll go first then.

42
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,720
Take good care of her for me.

43
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,760
Alright.

44
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,920
Miss Nurse, what happened to Dr. Bai?

45
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,680
Dr. Bai has been complained
by Urology department.

46
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,640
This patient named Su Zelin,

47
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,040
has his transfer procedure to

48
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,080
our Urology department carried out

49
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,320
through Dr. Bai three days ago.

50
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,560
According to schedule, he should
be having operation tomorrow.

51
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,760
However, during the
preoperative examination today,

52
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,280
we discovered that
he has high proteinuria.

53
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,960
It does not meet the
transfer criteria at all.

54
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,680
Not sure how would
Dr. Bai explain about it.

55
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,080
The procedure has no problem.

56
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,360
The patient has undergone

57
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,880
routine inspection before the transfer.

58
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,760
All indicator indexes are met.

59
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,160
Routine inspection?

60
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,560
How could you fool
us with only performing

61
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,400
normal routine inspection
for such a unique patient?

62
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,320
Dr. Xu,

63
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,000
Please mind your words.

64
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,040
We treat every patient equally.

65
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,800
Also clearly understand the
appropriate decision to make

66
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,360
in the specific situation.

67
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,880
Enough.

68
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,720
What exactly is the reason,

69
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,520
our department will investigate on it.

70
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,640
You can head back for now.

71
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,520
Alright, Director Cao.

72
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,960
I'll wait for your update then.

73
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:41,960
Alright.

74
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,080
Qijia,

75
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,960
do you have anything in mind?

76
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,400
Director,

77
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,600
I firmly believe that our
procedure and formalities

78
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,760
are perfectly fine.

79
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,800
I would like to apply
to speak to the patient.

80
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,200
Are you suspecting that

81
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,200
he had acted against medical
advice within these three days?

82
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,640
No.

83
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,200
I just want to talk to him about

84
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,560
follow-up treatment matter.

85
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,640
It's true.

86
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,520
Figure out relatively

87
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,360
what actually happened.

88
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,200
Patient's follow-up treatment

89
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,840
and psychological
counseling are more important.

90
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,760
Go ahead.

91
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,600
I'll assist you on any trouble.

92
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,800
Thank you Director.

93
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,480
Got complained!?

94
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,520
The patient is terrible.

95
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,000
He kept demanding to get another doctor

96
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,840
and ordered Dr. Bai
not to mind him anymore.

97
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,240
So what he meant was

98
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,640
Bai Qijia delayed his illness?

99
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,360
He actually said that.

100
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,120
Dr. Bai was even called
to the Director's office

101
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,120
regarding this matter.

102
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,800
(No wonder he didn't come to me today.)

103
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,760
Is Dr. Bai still in the ward?

104
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,120
Dr. Lu,

105
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,280
these are all bought for you.

106
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,640
Guru Bai Qi!

107
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,200
Where is Procrastinator Bai?

108
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,200
You both didn't actually

109
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,640
team up to prank me right?

110
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,760
Let me tell you.

111
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,960
I, Lu Tian, am a man with principle.

112
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,120
I would never lay my
hands on my brother's lady.

113
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,920
What are you talking about?

114
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,560
I have something to ask you.

115
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,520
Now I can rest assured.

116
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,120
Enjoy your food.

117
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,200
Have more.

118
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,720
It's delicious right?

119
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,480
Yes.

120
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,120
Dr. Lu,

121
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,520
I want to ask you something.

122
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,640
If a doctor is complained by a patient,

123
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,920
what would happen?

124
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,480
This will depend on what
is the complaint about

125
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,800
and the actual situation.

126
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,040
Actually medical industry also
belongs to the service industry.

127
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,800
Patient will request according to

128
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,960
their own requirements.

129
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,000
If the service is not
up to their standards,

130
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,120
they will find that

131
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,600
they were treated unfairly.

132
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,920
However, it's still subject to

133
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,280
specific circumstance.

134
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,960
What facts will it be
investigated according to?

135
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,480
Will any task force be set
up for the investigation?

136
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,480
How long will it approximately take

137
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,840
for the investigation?

138
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,120
It won't.

139
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,520
Don't tell me you're now

140
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,840
drawing doctors in your manga?

141
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,800
If you're really drawing us,

142
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,520
please draw those lifesaving works.

143
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,120
Boundless great love.

144
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,560
Rather than drawing about complaints.

145
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,840
Why are you talking so much?

146
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,800
I'm asking you, please answer.

147
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,120
The investigation results vary

148
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,840
across every department.

149
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,440
Is there something wrong?

150
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,920
I heard that

151
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,440
Bai Qijia was complained that he delayed

152
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,280
patient's operation.

153
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,640
Procrastinator Bai was complained?

154
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,120
Which department he was complained by?

155
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,320
By...

156
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,480
it seems to be...

157
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,360
Urology department.

158
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,320
Then it should be something wrong

159
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,480
during the patient handover.

160
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,560
However, by Procrastinator Bai's
personality,

161
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,120
he wouldn't voluntarily prove it.

162
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,480
About the complaint,

163
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,240
will it be serious?

164
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,960
He would get penalty.

165
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,640
Most probably, his
title won't be able to get

166
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,040
reviewed in the recent years.

167
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,400
I guess,

168
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,680
I would have to handle it myself.

Miss...Miss Bai Qi,

is exactly you wanted, Su Zelin.

173
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,240
You're watching this too,

174
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,880
Railgun from some science manga?

175
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,480
Yes, the lightning
created by your fingertip,

176
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,920
is my everlasting faith.

177
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,120
Only I, Railgun,

- Will be immortal!
- Will be immortal!

179
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,920
Nice! We are like-minded!

180
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,440
After all these while
being hospitalised,

181
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,720
finally get to meet like-minded peer.

182
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,880
Me staying in hospital for so long

183
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,960
that I think my dimensional
wall has broken.

184
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,160
I know, right?

185
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,000
Oh yeah, which ward are you from?

186
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,320
I'm Qin Ge from immunology.

187
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,080
Glad to meet you, I'm Su Zelin.

188
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,800
Glad meeting you too.

Which episode you're watching now?

191
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,400
I'm watching this.

192
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,400
They talk about this summer festival.

193
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,440
This episode is really interesting.

194
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,320
Let me give you a quick idea.

195
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,800
This episode is about everyone

196
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,040
attending this summer festival, then...

197
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,880
Anyway, this episode
ended just like that.

198
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,080
I am not satisfied.

199
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,920
What a waste.

200
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,600
So you should

201
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,960
tell me about the
remaining plot tonight.

202
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:40,720
I find the way you tell it

203
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,360
is way more interesting
than it is in manga.

204
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,640
Tonight?

205
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,600
is your department not strict at all?

206
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,920
Policies comes from above,
counter-reactions from below.

207
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,520
I really envy you.

208
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,040
I can't be as free as you.

209
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,520
I'm facing an ancient girl

210
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,840
day and night.

211
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,280
Who is your attending doctor?

212
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,920
Who else could it be?

213
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,080
He is Dr. Bai, full name is Miracle Bai.

214
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,160
I think Miracle Bai's
full name is Bai Qijia.

215
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,360
I heard that he was
complained two days ago.

216
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,800
Maybe, I guess, probably,

217
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,320
must be...

218
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,400
Actually that's true.

219
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,640
Don't worry.

220
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,120
Who cares if it's
Bai Qijia, Miracle Bai,

221
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,560
Rice Cake Bai, Chicken Bai,

222
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,480
I will settle him for you.

223
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,840
Is it really okay?

224
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,240
Okay.

225
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,880
What time did you sleep?

226
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,440
This patient here,

227
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,480
not staying in your ward late at night,

228
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,360
who's your attending doctor?

229
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,040
I'm gonna report you.

230
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,480
Say your lines, say your lines.

231
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,800
You had lots of fun,
please let me go.

232
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,280
Alright then, I'll stop playing.

233
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,480
What are you doing here?

234
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,680
I...

235
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,640
I'm here to see you,

236
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,080
and bring you some snacks.

237
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,360
Heck, haven't seen you in two days,

238
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,080
you already start eating junk foods.

239
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,160
Isn't this turning yourself in?

240
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,320
This is called seeking leniency.

241
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,800
You...

242
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,720
Well, look at you.

243
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,800
You must be tired.

244
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,240
Alright ,I'll walk you
to your ward then.

245
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,360
I was on my way for ward rounds.

246
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,240
No, it's been very hard
for you these two days.

247
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,400
Go rest up earlier.

248
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,360
Bye.

(Nephrology)

250
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,240
You finally escaped.

251
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,440
I thought you were held on by Dr. Bai.

252
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,440
How is it possible?

253
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,280
By the way,

254
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,000
you can continue your storytelling.

255
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,160
Alright.

256
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,640
We were finishing

257
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,640
episode 22 right?

258
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,480
The following will be episode 23.

259
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,080
Due to the loss of
control in this experiment,

260
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,240
our four leads became unconscious,

261
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,520
that is,our group of main characters.

262
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,400
Meanwhile, the whole group
of main characters lie down

263
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,200
in the laboratory with
empty surrounding.

264
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,600
- Then four weeks...
- Zelin.

265
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,200
Actually I know Dr. Bai personally.

266
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,200
He was my friend in high school.

267
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,240
During school,

268
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,320
he was very conscientious.

269
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,360
Also,

270
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,040
he really likes his job as a doctor.

271
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,880
And he wouldn't justify for himself.

272
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,960
I'd hate to see his
hard work goes in vain.

273
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,920
So,

274
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,720
could you tell me

275
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,400
what's the truth behind your complaint?

276
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,760
I promise I would not tell anyone.

277
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,400
Actually...

278
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,360
Actually it's me myself
who couldn't stay on diet.

279
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,160
While the transfer doctors

280
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,840
was not being strict,

281
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,840
I...I went on a binge for three days.

282
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,800
Well...

283
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,600
I will surely explain
everything about this

284
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,800
to Dr. Bai.

285
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,600
Didn't Railgun say before,

286
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,880
I am the causation.

287
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:21,960
So,

288
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,680
I wanna solve it myself.

289
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,000
Am I right?

290
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,360
I'm really...

291
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:32,920
By the way!

292
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,680
There is one thing I
must remind you of...

293
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,520
No problem!

294
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,600
I understand, don't you worry.

295
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,000
What you told me today,

296
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,320
I will never them to Dr. Bai.

297
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,520
No!

298
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,640
You must inform him.

299
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,640
Why?

300
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,040
If you don't tell him,

301
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,840
how would he know that he owes me?

302
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,920
If he doesn't know that he owes me,

303
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,160
how could he return me a favour?

304
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,400
This is the modern age now.

305
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,040
Never do good deeds anonymously.

306
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,080
Never do good deeds anonymously.

307
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,480
Lesson learnt.

308
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,920
Never do good deeds anonymously.

309
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,080
Stinky Zelin, why isn't he back yet?

310
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,080
Did he forget it?

311
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,640
Please don't forget to tell.

312
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,160
Why are you so late!?

313
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,440
Xue...

314
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,000
Did I not come in at the right time?

315
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,160
Xuezhou, what are you doing here?

316
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,200
I'm here to help you
with your discharge

317
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,320
and bring you home.

318
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,480
Discharge?

319
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,960
You don't wanna leave?

320
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,400
No, I mean...

321
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:36,800
I mean...

322
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,080
Quit dilly-dallying, let's go now.

323
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,760
I haven't...

324
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,040
- I...
- Big sister,

325
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,160
why is it so messy here?

326
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,720
My favour.

327
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,200
The restaurant is here
, you can go in first.

328
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,760
I'll come after I park my car.

329
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,040
Good evening, Guru Bai Qi.

330
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,560
Good evening, Dr. Bai.

331
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,800
Come with me.

332
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,360
So this is the favour
that you prepared for me?

333
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,800
That's right, come on.

334
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,040
How is it? Do you like it?

335
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,640
It's actually pretty good.

336
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,480
Dr. Bai,

337
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,720
are you from a wealthy family?

338
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,920
No, why do you ask?

339
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,080
Look.

340
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,360
With your wage as a doctor,

341
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,400
how is it possible to reserve

342
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,000
such a big restaurant?

343
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,520
You should be a hidden
rich second generation.

344
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,200
When will your mum take five million

345
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,280
for me to leave you?

346
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,960
You think too much.

347
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,200
I'm absolutely not any of that.

348
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,280
This restaurant right here,
belongs to Su Zelin's family.

349
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,880
He offered to lend it to me.

350
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,760
The five million in
my hand is gone now.

351
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,760
Quit dreaming, let's start our dinner.

352
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:34,880
Is it good?

353
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,120
It's pretty good.

354
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,600
Let me guess.

355
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,040
You're here to pick me up.

356
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,800
Congratulations, you've guessed it.

357
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,640
It's quite late now,

358
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,920
where are we heading?

359
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,280
Where would you like to go?

360
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,480
I've been a puppet for half a day now.

361
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,360
My neck and lumbar hurt.

362
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,640
And I'm starving.

363
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,640
How about we...

364
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,560
Why don't you go to the
hospital for a checkup instead?

365
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,960
And work a shift after.

366
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:15,840
Not bad.

367
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,840
I will now stay inside

368
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,280
your car no matter what.

369
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,680
How can it be?

370
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,280
With your sore legs and lumbar,

371
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,400
what if you die in my car?

372
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,840
They don't hurt anymore,
I'm not starving anymore too.

373
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,360
Okay then.

374
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,600
For the sake of you

375
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,480
being helpful to me today,

376
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,200
I'll treat you a meal.

377
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,360
Can I choose the dishes?

378
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,320
Get off my car.

379
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,400
Comfortable.

380
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,320
How was it? Does it taste good?

381
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,840
This is the best restaurant

382
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,240
I've had in a few years.

383
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,440
Give me a moment.

384
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,040
I've prepared you a surprise.

385
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,320
What is this?

386
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,680
Break it open and you'll know, come on.

387
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,840
Me?

388
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,560
This is you.

389
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,720
Is it us during high school?

390
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,000
That's right.

391
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,800
You told me that

392
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,280
showing appreciation
should be ritualistic.

393
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,840
You said that in manga before.

394
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,680
This is really adorable.

395
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,360
I'm sad to eat it.

396
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,560
That's perfect.

397
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,360
I have something to tell you.

398
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,120
You can eat it afterwards.

399
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,240
You wouldn't be
trying to propose right?

400
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,320
No.

401
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,960
Good, that's good.

402
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,560
You scared me.

403
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,440
You made it so ritualistic

404
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,280
I thought

405
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,800
it was a diamond ring in the cake.

406
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,400
So if I really propose to you,

407
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,640
this would be your reaction?

408
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,120
No, it wouldn't.

409
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,720
I mean...

410
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:55,880
Well...

411
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,880
Anyway, what exactly were you saying?

412
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,800
Qin Ge.

413
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,880
I think, as we reunited not long ago,

414
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,320
we still need some time.

415
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,360
Also previously you have your secret

416
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,600
and your concern.

417
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,440
I could slowly approach you,

418
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,640
until you open your heart.

419
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,280
But now that there's no more

420
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,760
secret between you and me,

421
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,760
I hope that you could give me a chance

422
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,000
to pursue you once again.

423
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,720
Okay?

424
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,040
(How can anyone reject
facing such an expression?)

425
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,120
(But it's only three
months after we met again,)

426
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,720
(I'm already falling so deep.)

427
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,240
(I need to be more reserved.)

428
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,120
I would like to

429
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,880
use the toilet.

430
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:44,880
Watch out!

431
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,560
So this is the closest spot

432
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,080
with medication which you mentioned!?

433
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,040
Yes.

434
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,280
With those words you said to me

435
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,640
in the restaurant

436
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,560
and you're getting handsy with me now,

437
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,440
and your house is just nearby,

438
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,760
I'm now doubtful about your intention.

439
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,640
It was really a coincidence.

440
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,240
Su Zelin really lent me the restaurant.

441
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,280
And it's quieter staying here

442
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,480
in suburb.

443
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,760
It only takes 20 minutes for me to

444
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,480
head to the hospital
for work every time,

445
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,040
through the ring expressway.

446
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,680
You can ask me later
regarding trust issue.

447
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,040
Allow me to apply some medicine for you.

448
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:29,920
Done.

449
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,240
Watch out.

450
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,360
Those words you said to me

451
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,960
in the restaurant,

452
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,200
I'm not sure how am I
supposed to respond.

453
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,040
Do you plan to reject me?

454
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,560
No I don't, I mean,

455
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,760
I'm not sure what to reply.

456
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,120
I can't be sure now.

457
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,040
To be frank,

458
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,400
there's no need to rush
giving me an answer.

459
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,720
So long you don't intend to reject me,

460
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,800
I'm already glad.

461
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,000
Why are you being so
forgiving towards me?

462
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,800
The last time in Western Restaurant,

463
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,960
if I didn't show up,

464
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,800
would you be disappointed?

465
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,840
No I won't.

466
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,000
I'll try again if I failed this time.

467
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,600
And I'll still try again
if I failed the next time.

468
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,680
I will keep waiting for you.

469
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,040
Min.

470
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,200
Boss, are you done yet?

471
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,720
Do you want me to
come over and fetch you?

472
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,440
It's fine, I'm already home.

473
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,080
You should rest earlier, byebye.

474
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,600
Why are you lying to him?

475
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,440
This doesn't count as lying right?

476
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,960
If Min knows that

477
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,440
I'm at your place so late at night,

478
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,240
he will go crazy again.

479
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,720
He is very naive,

480
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,080
it will definitely scare him.

481
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,040
Naive?

482
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,480
Only you would think so.

483
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,200
What?

484
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,440
Nothing.

485
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,800
Why don't you stay here tonight?

486
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,200
Bai Qijia, I knew you
have bad intention!

487
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,920
Take a look outside,
it's almost morning now.

488
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,400
It's hard to order a ride here.

489
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,360
If I send you home and come back here,

490
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,800
it will waste a lot of time.

491
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,120
Why not just stay here for a night,

492
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,200
plus you should let your wound heal up.

493
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,880
I'm terrifying while sleeping, I

494
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,880
grind teeth, snore.

495
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,800
And I sleepwalk too, it's horrible!

496
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,120
It's fine.

497
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,480
Not like it's new to me.

498
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,520
Then I'll use the couch!

499
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,800
No, you can use my bed,

500
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,640

to amend according to
Boss Qian Ye's solution.

then we couldn't protect her anymore.

Right, even Editor Lin's
position to voice out

548

has been confiscated by Manager Xia.

Since Miss Bai Qi already

sold her works,

Xuezhou doesn't want you to worry.
