Don't worry. I'm good at this.

00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:04,959
You are here, brother.

22
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,720
You are here, Min.

23
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,440
Let me introduce myself.

24
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:13,959
I am Bai Qijia's best friend,

25
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,000
Lu Tian.

26
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,520
I'm bored.

27
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:18,800
So, I came here to hang out.
You won't mind, right?

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,199
You can call me Chen Min.

29
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:33,960
You are indeed best friends.

30
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,639
You are both very talented.

31
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,360
Are you cutting the Chinese yam?

32
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:44,600
Don't you know that Qin Ge
dislikes Chinese yam?

33
00:02:44,839 --> 00:02:46,000
It's sticky.

34
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,279
What do you know?

35
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,520
Chinese yam is low in calories
and high in nutrients.

36
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,679
It's good for Qin Ge.

37
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:52,679
Let me see what you bought.

38
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,360
Are you going to make chicken soup?

39
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,600
Qin Ge is on medication.
She needs to control her hormone.

40
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:04,000
She can't eat this.

41
00:03:04,119 --> 00:03:05,160
Since you know her so well,

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,600
where were you in the past eight years?

43
00:03:13,399 --> 00:03:14,080
Chen Min.

44
00:03:14,679 --> 00:03:16,880
Do you think that Bai Qijia had it easy
in the past eight years?

45
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,479
If you have time to lecture him,

46
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:20,119
it's better to give us a hand.

47
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,240
Here.

48
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,720
Take this to the table.

49
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,360
Xuezhou.

50
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,039
Xuezhou, I beg you.

51
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:44,759
When we eat later,

52
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,919
please take one of them

53
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,839
away from me at least.

54
00:03:48,119 --> 00:03:49,000
I can't deal

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,559
with two childish people at once.

56
00:03:51,119 --> 00:03:52,880
But both of them are not my cup of tea.

57
00:03:55,119 --> 00:03:57,279
I'm just joking. I'll take Min away.

58
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,720
What's wrong?

59
00:04:03,119 --> 00:04:04,399
Do you want me to take Bai Qijia away?

60
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,759
Either one is fine.

61
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:09,000
Ya, right.

62
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,600
This is the first time

63
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,679
for the five of us to eat together.

64
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,320
We've been through
thick and thin together.

65
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,119
I hope that we can always be together

66
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,399
and will never be separated.

67
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,679
-Good.
-That's right.

68
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,600
Cheers.

69
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,480
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

70
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:34,399
Let's be together forever.

71
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:36,559
Go away.

72
00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:41,440
You don't eat this?

73
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,679
Here.

74
00:04:54,799 --> 00:04:55,519
Thank you.

75
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:00,440
Xuezhou, eat this.

76
00:05:00,559 --> 00:05:01,600
I made it for you.

77
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:07,399
I'm allergic to dried tofu.

78
00:05:10,359 --> 00:05:11,679
Let's get down to business first.

79
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,119
Bai Qi Studio

80
00:05:13,239 --> 00:05:14,959
is going to recruit new employees soon.

81
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,720
After this, you'll get busier and busier

82
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:18,640
and it'll get harder for you.

83
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,119
Miss Bai Qi. Hurry up
and come up with a new idea.

84
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:25,119
I'm counting on you for my achievements
for the second half of the year.

85
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,279
Keep it up.

86
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,040
I should've known
that this is not a simple dinner.

87
00:05:32,359 --> 00:05:33,279
I also know

88
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,640
that my destiny

89
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:36,519
is tied to yours.

90
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:38,480
It's good that you know it.

91
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,559
Min, we need

92
00:05:42,679 --> 00:05:43,679
to make some amendments

93
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:44,600
on the contract later.

94
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,399
Can you go to the company with me

95
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,239
to take a look at it?
Consider it working overtime.

96
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,600
Now?

97
00:05:55,359 --> 00:05:56,359
Okay, Xuezhou.

98
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,440
Thank you.

99
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,239
Xuezhou.

100
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:06,559
I drank some alcohol just now.

101
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,000
Can I...

102
00:06:08,679 --> 00:06:09,519
It's not convenient for me.

103
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,440
No.

104
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,519
Absolutely no.

105
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,839
Work hard, brother.

106
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,559
Finally, I can rest.

107
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:14,640
Dr. Bai.

108
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,000
I'll leave it to you

109
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:18,160
to clean this up.

110
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:20,279
Aren't you going to help?

111
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,119
Go up then.

112
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,000
Bai Qijia.

113
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,920
Are you still asleep?

114
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:00,480
Continue to sleep then.
I'll be leaving first.

115
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:02,880
Qin Ge.

116
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,359
What's wrong?

117
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,600
Give me a chance.

118
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,279
What is it? Are you disappointed?

119
00:08:29,559 --> 00:08:31,559
No. Why should I be disappointed?

120
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:33,799
Did you

121
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:35,839
expect me to do something just now?

122
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,440
How would I know what you wanted to do?

123
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:51,039
Are you hoping for me

124
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,200
to do something?

125
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:54,440
How will I know

126
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:55,799
what you want to do?

127
00:08:56,479 --> 00:08:57,400
How about

128
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:59,239
we do something for real?

129
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:00,840
What...

130
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,640
What do you want to do?

131
00:09:09,479 --> 00:09:10,599
Surprise!

132
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:17,960
Give me one minute.

133
00:09:20,479 --> 00:09:21,520
I'm in the right place.

134
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,640
Who are you?

135
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:25,840
Who are you?

136
00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:28,000
Father!

137
00:09:30,479 --> 00:09:31,119
Father?

138
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:43,559
Who is he?

139
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,039
He...

140
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,200
Mr. Qin, let me help you

141
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,479
carry your luggage up first.

142
00:10:02,119 --> 00:10:03,640
Dad, why did you come here

143
00:10:03,719 --> 00:10:04,400
without telling me first?

144
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,359
No.

145
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,799
Tell me. Who is he?
What does he work as?

146
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:10,080
And why is he here?

147
00:10:10,719 --> 00:10:12,280
It'll be quite complicated
to explain it.

148
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:13,159
But

149
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,760
it's not like what you think it is.

150
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:16,640
I'm not thinking about anything yet.

151
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,080
Before this, you had a meal

152
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,400
with that Zhang, right?

153
00:10:20,359 --> 00:10:21,119
You have a new man now?

154
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,840
What do you mean? I have only one man.

155
00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:28,760
Why are you looking at me like that?

156
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:31,640
You've met a love expert.

157
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:33,640
There are many love swindlers
on the internet now.

158
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,239
They like to target

159
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,159
older and introverted women like you.

160
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,960
No. I have to warn him off.

161
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,880
-No, dad.
-What are you doing?

162
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:43,280
He's not that kind of person.

163
00:10:43,359 --> 00:10:44,119
Look at you.

164
00:10:44,239 --> 00:10:45,520
You are even defending him now.

165
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:46,359
No. I have to talk to him.

166
00:10:46,359 --> 00:10:48,599
No, dad.

167
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,919
He's my ex-classmate from high school.

168
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,559
He's just staying here for the moment.

169
00:10:51,719 --> 00:10:52,640
Classmate?

170
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:54,719
Is that how classmates interact
with each other?

171
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,640
A man and a woman
are living under the same roof.

172
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,960
I've lived for 50 years.

173
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,520
I had never seen
two classmates acting like that.

174
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:00,640
-I need to warn him off.
-Dad, no.

175
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,159
What are you doing, dad?

176
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,440
Why are you so dramatic?

177
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,239
Why is it so hard

178
00:11:04,239 --> 00:11:05,359
to communicate with you?

179
00:11:05,479 --> 00:11:06,880
Don't you understand what I said?

180
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,119
No. I have to talk to him.

181
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:09,559
Hello, Mr. Qin.

182
00:11:14,479 --> 00:11:15,200
Dad, let me...

183
00:11:15,359 --> 00:11:17,320
Let me introduce him to you.

184
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,000
I am Qin Ge's schoolmate
from high school.

185
00:11:19,239 --> 00:11:21,200
Now, I am her boyfriend too.
My name is Bai Qijia.

186
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,520
Hello, Mr. Qin.

187
00:11:30,239 --> 00:11:30,919
I'm sorry.

188
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,359
I was acting inappropriately just now.
I'm sorry.

189
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,799
Bai Qijia, what nonsense
are you talking about?

190
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,000
Qin Ge, it has already come to this.

191
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,119
We don't have to keep it
a secret from him anymore.

192
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,359
Besides, are you going to deny

193
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,039
what you did to me?

194
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,840
What happened?

195
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,239
You made the first move?

196
00:11:50,479 --> 00:11:51,080
I didn't.

197
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,440
I didn't. I swear.

198
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,119
Although you are a woman,

199
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,359
you need to be responsible too.

200
00:11:55,479 --> 00:11:57,080
You have to take responsibility
for what you did.

201
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:59,880
Hello, I am Qin Ge's father.

202
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,080
I am Qin Hansheng.

203
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:02,239
Hello.

204
00:12:02,359 --> 00:12:03,599
You must be tired from your flight.

205
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:04,840
Come. Take a sit first.

206
00:12:05,479 --> 00:12:06,880
You should take a seat too.

207
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,479
I'll get you a glass of water first.

208
00:12:08,599 --> 00:12:09,479
It's okay.

209
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,200
Qin Ge,

210
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:12,239
go and get us some water.

211
00:12:12,359 --> 00:12:14,599
He's our guest. We are the hosts.

212
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,520
Now, you know that I'm the host?

213
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,159
Get the water.

214
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:26,080
Bai.

215
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:27,840
What do you do for a living?

216
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,520
I'm a doctor.
I work in the Department of Nephrology.

217
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,599
A doctor.

218
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:32,039
That's good. You are smart.

219
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,000
Amazing.

220
00:12:33,359 --> 00:12:34,280
You are too kind.

221
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:36,559
Pour the water yourself.

222
00:12:38,119 --> 00:12:39,640
Wait. Qin Ge.

223
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,119
Is this how our family treats a guest?

224
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:53,200
This is the upbringing of our family.

225
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,880
Here's your water.

226
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,840
It's okay. You can drink it.

227
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:00,799
I can pour it myself.

228
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,200
Here's your water.

229
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,400
Thank you.

230
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:06,119
Enjoy your water.

231
00:13:07,359 --> 00:13:08,919
You can leave us now.

232
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,080
Okay.

233
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:36,679
Do you know?

234
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:39,239
The father who I hadn't met in a year,

235
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:40,400
Qin Hansheng,

236
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:42,000
suddenly came to my house today.

237
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:43,520
What is it?

238
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,919
Did you and Bai Qijia

239
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:47,280
get caught red-handed?

240
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,479
No. What are you talking about?

241
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,960
I can't believe it. I...

242
00:13:51,119 --> 00:13:53,359
Why did he come home
without telling me first?

243
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,719
I think I accidentally
told him about it.

244
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:00,320
A few days ago,

245
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,840
he asked me about you.

246
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:05,080
I think I accidentally mentioned

247
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,359
about you being hospitalised.

248
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,280
You...

249
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:08,479
Congratulations.

250
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:09,760
You'll probably

251
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,799
have to go through a few dramatic days.

252
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,200
I have a movie date.

253
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,599
I have to hang up. Bye.

254
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:15,880
Bye. I'll hang up now.

255
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,159
You are too heartless.

256
00:14:24,719 --> 00:14:25,679
Where did we stop?

257
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:26,520
You are a doctor, right?

258
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,200
Yes.

259
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,520
From the Department of Nephrology.

260
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,559
Young and promising.

261
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:31,599
You are too kind, Mr. Qin.

262
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,080
Actually, I've just graduated.

263
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:34,400
I still have much to learn.

264
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:36,320
You don't have to rush it.

265
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:40,280
How long have you been with Qin Ge?

266
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,440
We've just started.

267
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,400
But don't worry.
I'm dating her with marriage in mind.

268
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,799
With your promise, I can be at ease now.

269
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,000
Let me tell you.

270
00:14:51,719 --> 00:14:54,960
Qin Ge is not very experienced
when it comes to a relationship.

271
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,159
So,

272
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:58,440
don't let her down in the future.

273
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,320
If you let her down,

274
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,840
I won't forgive you.

275
00:15:02,479 --> 00:15:03,880
Mr. Qin, don't worry.

276
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,159
I'll prove to you

277
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,679
that I'm worthy enough for Qin Ge.

278
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:11,679
Good. Your words have put me at ease.

279
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,000
(No.)

280
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:16,440
(Forget it.
I should check on them first.)

281
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:32,840
Bai Qijia is really something.

282
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:40,000
He managed to handle

283
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,719
such a difficult person with ease.

284
00:15:46,599 --> 00:15:48,679
What do you like to eat usually?

285
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,039
We can have a meal together

286
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:51,080
in the near future.

287
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,280
You've travelled a long way.

288
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,400
What do you want to eat?

289
00:15:53,479 --> 00:15:54,400
I can buy it for you for lunch.

290
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:55,840
I'm not picky about food.

291
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,559
Okay.

292
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,440
You've chatted long enough.

293
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,840
Let's go out to eat.

294
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,080
We were just talking about it.

295
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,039
Mr. Qin, what do you want to eat?

296
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,400
We can go out and buy it for you now.

297
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,559
Qin Ge, look.

298
00:16:06,719 --> 00:16:08,159
Look at how considerate

299
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:09,640
Bai is.

300
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,479
What do I want to eat?
What's in season now?

301
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,239
How about we eat some crabs?

302
00:16:13,359 --> 00:16:14,000
Okay.

303
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,400
Let's eat some crabs today.

304
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,080
Okay.

305
00:16:16,479 --> 00:16:17,239
Wait.

306
00:16:17,479 --> 00:16:18,440
You just got your teeth fixed, right?

307
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,840
How can you eat crabs?

308
00:16:20,119 --> 00:16:22,359
How do you know I went to the dentist?

309
00:16:23,119 --> 00:16:24,280
Mrs. Wang told me about it.

310
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,880
Why is Mrs. Wang
still as meddlesome as always?

311
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:29,000
No. You don't understand.

312
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:30,080
It's called eating what you lack.

313
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,359
Look. My teeth are not strong.

314
00:16:31,479 --> 00:16:32,400
So, I have to eat something hard

315
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,000
to train the strength of my teeth to...

316
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,880
Mr. Qin, don't worry.

317
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,200
We'll complete our mission.

318
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,280
Wait for me.

319
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,359
Be safe.

320
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:40,320
But crabs...

321
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:41,280
Let's go.

322
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:45,640
That man is so reliable.

323
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:49,000
I think it'll work between them.

324
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:51,159
Let's go.

325
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:53,200
I can't believe my dad.

326
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:55,200
I think he's here to jinx me.

327
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,479
On the contrary,

328
00:16:56,479 --> 00:16:58,400
I think you and your father
are quite close.

329
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,159
Are you blind?

330
00:17:00,359 --> 00:17:02,440
We fight as soon as we meet.
How is that close?

331
00:17:03,359 --> 00:17:05,520
Look. Both of you always
say one thing and mean another.

332
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,440
The two of you fight
because you are too alike.

333
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,359
It's a love-hate relationship
between you two.

334
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:11,199
You don't understand.

335
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,439
We are not close at all.

336
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:16,000
I don't know how to get along with him.

337
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:18,680
Forget it. I'll tell you
about it when I'm free.

338
00:17:28,239 --> 00:17:29,479
Mr. Qin, we are back.

339
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,239
Dad, what are you...

340
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:35,199
You are back.

341
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,880
What are you doing, dad?

342
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,280
Doesn't this look good?

343
00:17:40,439 --> 00:17:42,680
It's cooling and it's easy to clean.

344
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:44,040
Not bad.

345
00:17:45,199 --> 00:17:47,520
I'm so frustrated
with the aesthetic taste

346
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,280
of old people like you.

347
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,760
Why did you

348
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,920
touch my things without my permission?

349
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,560
What's wrong with it?

350
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,599
Don't you think that the style is...

351
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,359
Let's cook the crabs first.

352
00:17:56,439 --> 00:17:57,680
Mr. Qin, have a seat first.

353
00:17:58,479 --> 00:17:59,199
Let's go.

354
00:18:00,239 --> 00:18:01,000
Well.

355
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,520
Add some ginger
to get rid of the fishy taste.

356
00:18:03,719 --> 00:18:04,400
Okay.

357
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,640
Here.

358
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,040
This crab is not bad at all.

359
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:16,040
Eat more.

360
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,560
Bai.

361
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,280
Are you quite busy as a doctor?

362
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:22,280
Yes. I'm quite busy.

363
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,599
So, you can't spend
too much time at home, right?

364
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,599
Not quite. The hospital
is very humanised now.

365
00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:33,560
We have different shifts
and we can take a rest.

366
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,479
That's good.

367
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:39,160
Qin Ge doesn't like to go out too.

368
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:39,920
She likes to stay at home.

369
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,319
So, when you are free,

370
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,040
you should spend more time with her.

371
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,040
Yes. I come here every day

372
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,520
right after I clock out. Don't worry.

373
00:18:48,439 --> 00:18:49,680
Qin Ge, look.

374
00:18:50,199 --> 00:18:51,680
Bai is so reliable.

375
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,880
Those in finance,

376
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,839
sports, IT,

377
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:57,439
and etcetera,

378
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,319
are not reliable.

379
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,640
Doctor suits you best.

380
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,680
Bai suits you best.

381
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:03,719
With Bai here,

382
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,640
you don't have
to worry about your health.

383
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,560
Qin Ge...

384
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,880
What do you mean, dad?

385
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:10,479
You are just treating me like a patient.

386
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,560
I haven't said anything yet.

387
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,119
I haven't asked you yet.

388
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,199
Why were you

389
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,319
hospitalised again?

390
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,160
It was just a routine check-up.

391
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,000
It's no big deal.

392
00:19:22,439 --> 00:19:23,520
Are you lying to me again?

393
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,160
Qin Ge is so heartless.

394
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,719
Her condition is unique.

395
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:29,839
There are a lot of dos and don'ts.

396
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,520
And she needs

397
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,959
special care and treatment.

398
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:37,640
But she doesn't
take care of herself well.

399
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:39,880
Qin Get, tell me.

400
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,040
If anything happens
to you in the future,

401
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,199
what about me?

402
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:44,599
Mr. Qin, don't worry.

403
00:19:44,959 --> 00:19:46,000
She has me.

404
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,640
Moreover, Qin Ge's condition

405
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,000
has improved a lot
compared to last time.

406
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:51,000
She has good resting
and eating habits now.

407
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:52,040
Don't worry.

408
00:19:52,439 --> 00:19:53,439
What is the meaning of that?

409
00:19:53,719 --> 00:19:54,920
I'm doing fine, aren't I?

410
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:56,359
Don't you have

411
00:19:56,479 --> 00:19:58,119
anything else to say besides that?

412
00:19:58,359 --> 00:20:00,359
No. What do you mean by that?

413
00:20:00,719 --> 00:20:02,280
Isn't this important enough?

414
00:20:02,439 --> 00:20:03,400
Why did I come here?

415
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,760
Because I'm worried about you.

416
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:07,239
Don't you know your own temper?

417
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:08,680
With your condition,

418
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:10,000
what if something happens again?

419
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:12,319
Have you forgotten that back then,
your mum...

420
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,280
You...

421
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,680
Don't mention my mum.

422
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,199
What rights do you have
to talk about her?

423
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:19,599
Qin Ge.

424
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:21,959
Good.

425
00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:23,680
I came here

426
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,239
for nothing.

427
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,680
The old is coddling the young.

428
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,800
Enough. We've eaten together.

429
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,920
And I've gotten my scolding.

430
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:36,119
She's chasing me out.

431
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,239
Fine. I'll leave.

432
00:20:38,439 --> 00:20:39,040
No, Mr. Qin.

433
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:39,760
I'll leave now.

434
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:41,800
Qin Ge didn't mean that.

435
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:42,800
Mr. Qin.

436
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,359
Bai, let me tell you.

437
00:20:44,439 --> 00:20:45,520
You don't have to try to persuade me.

438
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,119
I'm not fortunate enough.

439
00:20:47,719 --> 00:20:50,000
I'm so old already.
But I'm still an annoyance.

440
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:51,599
Mr. Qin, calm down.

441
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:52,800
She wasn't thinking when she said that.

442
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:53,719
After she calms down,

443
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:54,959
I'm sure she'll apologise to you.

444
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:56,079
After she calms down?

445
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,560
With her temper? Forget it.

446
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:16,439
Is he really going to leave?

447
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,680
Leave then.

448
00:21:26,239 --> 00:21:27,400
Don't come back after you leave.

449
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:44,880
That brat.

450
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,119
I've been out for so long.

451
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:47,560
Why hasn't she come out to stop me?

452
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,760
Mr. Qin.

453
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,599
Qin Ge was just being emotional.

454
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,839
Don't take it to heart.

455
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,319
Qin Ge is very temperamental.

456
00:21:55,479 --> 00:21:58,119
Please take care of her after this.

457
00:21:58,439 --> 00:21:59,479
I live far away.

458
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:02,119
Sometimes,
I can't take care of her in time.

459
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,760
To be honest, I've failed her.

460
00:22:06,439 --> 00:22:07,119
Mr. Qin.

461
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:08,520
Actually, I think it's normal

462
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:10,040
for a family to fight with each other.

463
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:11,959
It means that you care about each other.

464
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,000
Besides,

465
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:15,359
Qin Ge remembers what you want to eat.

466
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:17,599
It means that she cares about you too.

467
00:22:18,199 --> 00:22:19,119
Of course.

468
00:22:19,479 --> 00:22:20,319
She's my daughter.

469
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:21,800
Of course she cares about me.

470
00:22:23,199 --> 00:22:24,400
It's my fault.

471
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:26,640
I know that she's very sensitive
about her mum.

472
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,239
But I talk too much.

473
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,560
At first, I just wanted

474
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,719
to visit her

475
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:32,640
and spend some quality time with her.
But,

476
00:22:33,479 --> 00:22:34,800
it has turned out to be like this.

477
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:37,239
Mr. Qin, since that's what you want,

478
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,560
if you leave now,

479
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,839
won't you regret it?

480
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:44,119
I've already left the house.

481
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:45,800
I can't go back.

482
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,400
No one says that you are leaving.

483
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,239
We are just taking a walk
for better digestion

484
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:50,520
after our lunch.

485
00:22:52,719 --> 00:22:53,839
That's right. I...

486
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,760
We are too full.

487
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:56,000
So, we are taking a walk out here.

488
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:57,479
-Right?
-Of course.

489
00:22:57,479 --> 00:22:58,319
That's right.

490
00:22:58,439 --> 00:22:59,000
Let's go.

491
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,560
We are back.

492
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,800
You've left, right?
Why do you come back?

493
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,760
We just went out to take a walk

494
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,359
to digest the food that we had eaten.

495
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,839
Yes. We were just digesting the food.

496
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:23,520
You didn't even eat much
and you had to digest it?

497
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,319
What a waste for those juicy crabs.

498
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,000
Mr. Qin, you must be tired
from your walk.

00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,319
Here. Take a seat.

500
00:23:30,479 --> 00:23:31,199
Okay.

501
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,719
You can have a chat.
I'll clean up the table.

502
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,000
Thank you, Bai.

503
00:23:40,239 --> 00:23:41,319
Qin Ge, look.

504
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,680
I've come to visit you.

505
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,280
But we haven't gotten the chance
to chat with each other.

506
00:23:45,719 --> 00:23:47,520
I don't know how you are doing lately.

507
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,400
Tell me about it.

508
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,199
Since I'm already here, you should...

509
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,959
What are you playing?

510
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:02,880
Are you playing a game right now?

511
00:24:04,239 --> 00:24:05,599
What are you playing? Let me see.

512
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,520
Let me see.

513
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:08,719
Qin Ge, don't...

514
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:10,880
Don't play games all the time, okay?

515
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,199
It's a waste of your time

516
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:13,079
and your life.

517
00:24:13,199 --> 00:24:15,400
We need to use our free time

518
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:17,199
to learn and work.

519
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:18,400
Isn't that better?

520
00:24:19,479 --> 00:24:20,719
Moreover,

521
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:21,959
will you get an annual bonus

522
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:23,760
by playing games?

523
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,199
Will it be useful to you?
Games are useless.

524
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:28,680
Okay.

525
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:30,599
I'll go and work now

526
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:31,680
to earn my annual bonus.

527
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,160
No.

528
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,640
No. What are you doing, Qin Ge?

529
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:37,239
No. What is the meaning of this?

530
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:39,599
No. I can't even lecture you now?

531
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:40,920
Qin Ge!

532
00:24:48,199 --> 00:24:48,959
That's right.

533
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:51,760
Communication between
a father and a daughter is important.

(Fingertip Comics)
Why are you here?

536
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:13,959
My dad is too scary.

537
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,920
I'm here to seek shelter.

538
00:25:16,719 --> 00:25:17,880
Do we have any new feedback?

539
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,839
I want to focus on my work.

540
00:25:23,199 --> 00:25:25,719
Unfortunately,
we don't have any feedback yet.

541
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,079
How about

542
00:25:27,479 --> 00:25:28,599
we go out to have some fun?

543
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,439
Miss Bai Qi! Chen Min!

544
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,400
Finally, I get to see you.

545
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,839
It's you?

546
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,640
This is our company.

547
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,280
If you want to talk
about personal matters,

548
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,040
let's go out to talk.

549
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:41,079
No.

550
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:43,160
I have a more important thing
to do today.

551
00:25:44,439 --> 00:25:45,319
Miss Bai Qi.

552
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,319
I'm sorry, this is...

(Resume)

554
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,000
I'm sorry that came as a shock.

555
00:25:52,239 --> 00:25:53,880
I'm a senior student
from the fine arts academy.

556
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,920
I am Tian Cheng.

557
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:56,319
I've liked you

558
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:57,800
and Chen Min for a long time.

559
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,199
Especially Chen Min.

560
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,439
He used to be the Prince Charming
of our university.

561
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:03,359
Before this, I ran into Chen Min.

562
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,800
And I saw that Bai Qi Studio
is recruiting.

563
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,439
I was so excited that I couldn't sleep.

564
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,160
So, I came here right away

565
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,479
to test my luck.

566
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,839
I'm sorry. I know who you are.

567
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,000
I just want your contact number.

568
00:26:26,479 --> 00:26:29,439
She's so straightforward.
Are you interested in her?

569
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,680
I'm sorry.

we haven't notified the candidates
for an interview yet.

We don't accept an application directly
through the company.

Besides, this is our company.

574
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:46,000
Please respect the rules of our company.

575
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,839
Sorry. I mean no disrespect.

576
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,760
Miss Bai Qi, I really like you.

577
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,359
I like all of your works.

578
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:54,239
I've read

579
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:55,479
each and every one of them.

580
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,000
Thank you for your support.

581
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:58,119
But this is

582
00:26:58,239 --> 00:26:58,880
indeed against

583
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,719
the recruitment policy
of the Fingertip Comics.

584
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,239
Miss Bai Qi.

585
00:27:02,239 --> 00:27:02,959
Let's go.

586
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,439
But

587
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:08,160
personally,
I'm very interested in your resume.

588
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,239
How about

589
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,800
we have a chat?

590
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,040
(Education: Qingchuan Fine Arts Academy,
Work Background: Spades Arts Co., Ltd)

591
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,640
You have the right profession.

592
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,280
And you have
a lot of relevant experiences

593
00:27:24,439 --> 00:27:25,439
when you are still in school.

594
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:27,760
She has won some competitions too.

595
00:27:28,239 --> 00:27:29,560
You say that you like my work.

596
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,839
What is the one thing

597
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,719
that attracts you the most?

598
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,719
The style of your works

599
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,800
looks depressing.

600
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:37,680
But your main aim
is to encourage your readers

601
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:39,160
to not give up when they face hardship.

602
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:41,040
Someone will always be by your side.

603
00:27:41,479 --> 00:27:43,920
I think the mindset behind a creation

604
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,439
reflects a lot about
the creator's personality.

605
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,640
I want to work with you

606
00:27:47,719 --> 00:27:49,880
because I want
to improve my drawing skills.

607
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:50,680
In addition to that,

608
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,280
I want to build a strong foundation

609

for the future of my career.

610
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,680
Just now, you professed
your affection for Bai Qi

611
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,959
and me.

612
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,359
Will this kind of fangirling obsession

613
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:04,520
affect your attitude at work

614
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,800
in the future?

615
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:09,520
I admit that I start to pay attention
to Bai Qi Studio

616
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,719
because of Chen Min for the most part.

617
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:13,319
But what drew me in

618
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,319
is Bai Qi and her comics.

619
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,599
This is just a joke.

620
00:28:17,719 --> 00:28:19,000
But even if you leave,

621
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,640
I'll still stay here.

622
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,839
Don't worry.

623
00:28:22,239 --> 00:28:23,400
That won't happen.

624
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,800
Okay now.
That's it for today's interview.

625
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:28,079
Go back and wait for your result.

626

00:28:34,439 --> 00:28:35,479
I drove here today.

630
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,280
Let's talk about the compensation.

631
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,359
I'm sorry.

632
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:42,719
We still have work to do.

633

As for the compensation,

634
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,719
I'll pay you back slowly but surely.

635

Don't worry.

Wait.

638
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:52,280
Min, you've remembered it wrongly.

He doesn't have any work to do today.

I can.

Miss Bai Qi has said yes.

You can't say no now.

Bye, Miss Bai Qi.
My car is right in front.

654

It's good to be young.

655
00:29:23,439 --> 00:29:24,800
Mr. Qin, here. Drink some tea.

656
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,839
You are very skillful in this.

657
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,280
Does your family like to drink tea too?

658
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,359
My grandmother used to drink tea.

659
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,560
So, I've learnt a little bit
about the art of tea from her.

660
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:41,880
So, you are a left-behind child too.

661
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,040
Something like that.

662
00:29:45,239 --> 00:29:46,839
You didn't have it easy too.

663

Just like Qin Ge.

00:29:49,239 --> 00:29:50,280
Both of you are a great match.

665
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,520
Is your neck feeling stiff, Mr. Qin?

666
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,959
I've learnt
some massage techniques before.

667
00:29:59,079 --> 00:29:59,839
Let me help you with it.

668
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:00,760
You know how to do that too?

669
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,719
Turn your body.

670
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,680
Thank you.

671
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,079
That's the spot.

672
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,239
If only Qin Ge

673
00:30:09,239 --> 00:30:10,800
is as sensible as you.

674
00:30:13,199 --> 00:30:13,959
Mr. Qin,

675
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,760
this afternoon, you told me

676
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,239
that Qin Ge is sensitive about her mum.

677
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,520
She has never told me about it.

678
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,959
May I ask you

679
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,040
what happened?

680
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,520
It's not a secret anyway.

681
00:30:29,479 --> 00:30:30,560
It's my fault.

682
00:30:31,199 --> 00:30:33,680
I remarried half a year
after her mum passes away.

683
00:30:34,719 --> 00:30:36,160
Since then,

684
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:38,079
although she acts

685
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,680
casually about it,

686
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,040
she has

687
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,199
emotionally withdrawn from me.

688
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,239
My second wife and I

689
00:30:46,239 --> 00:30:48,079
met through a friend.

690
00:30:48,439 --> 00:30:50,359
Back then, I thought that I couldn't

691
00:30:50,479 --> 00:30:51,920
take care of her myself.

692
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,199
So, I didn't think it through.

693
00:30:53,719 --> 00:30:56,040
I never thought that Qin Ge
would be so against it.

694
00:30:57,199 --> 00:30:58,920
Luckily, she managed to make
a lot of new friends after that.

695
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,560
And she found her own hobbies.

696
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,280
So, she didn't suffer too much.

697
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,239
You can stop now.

698
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:07,640
I feel much better now. Take a seat.

699
00:31:08,719 --> 00:31:09,439
Thank you.

700
00:31:10,439 --> 00:31:11,199
You are welcome.

701
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,760
Bai Qijia.

702
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:17,119
I remember you.

703
00:31:17,719 --> 00:31:19,520
When Qin Ge was in high school,

704
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,760
she kept talking about you.

705
00:31:20,959 --> 00:31:22,439
I remember that back then, a boy

706
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,880
dragged her out
in the middle of the night to go hiking.

707
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,920
Weren't you afraid
of the possible danger

708
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,239
to hike at night?

709
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,719
Actually,

710
00:31:31,959 --> 00:31:33,400
we were lost back then.

711
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,280
I never thought that you would remember.

712
00:31:36,959 --> 00:31:38,680
No matter how bad my memory is,

713
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,599
you kidnapped

714
00:31:39,719 --> 00:31:41,160
my daughter
when you were in high school.

715
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,479
How can I forget that?

716
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:48,280
I think Qin Ge

717
00:31:48,479 --> 00:31:50,040
will be eating outside tonight.

718
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,160
She'll only come back
when I've fallen asleep.

719
00:31:53,439 --> 00:31:54,439
You don't have to entertain me.

720
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:57,359
Go and find her. I'm worried about her.

721
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,839
I'll go and find her then.

722
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,880
You should stay here and rest.

723
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:40,400
Xuezhou, are you done with your movie?

724
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,760
Do you want to eat some Japanese food?

725
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:44,199
I'm sorry.
We are having a movie marathon.

726
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:45,959
If you are a good girl,

727
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,920
I can consider having supper with you.

728
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,079
You'll easily lose me if you do this.

729
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:51,520
What are you talking about?

730
00:32:52,479 --> 00:32:55,359
A movie marathon. A private cinema.

731
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,959
Are you watching movies

732
00:32:58,079 --> 00:32:59,319
with Lu Tian?

733
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:02,000
You rarely watch any movies

734
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:03,560
in a year.

735
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,839
Now that you have the time
to watch some movies,

736
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:07,479
I'm sure you want to enjoy your time

737
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:08,719
with Lu Tian in private.

738
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:12,880
Bye.

739
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:17,160
Is it true, Xuezhou?

740
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:18,839
Am I that important

741
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,040
to you?

742
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,920
That's not true.

743
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,760
I'm important to you.
