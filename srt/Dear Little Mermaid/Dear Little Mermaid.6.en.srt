You deserve it.

170
00:12:49,938 --> 00:12:50,818
Xuezhou,

171
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:52,657
go in and stay by Qin Ge's side.

172
00:12:53,097 --> 00:12:54,457
Leave this matter to me.

173
00:12:54,777 --> 00:12:55,657
I'll handle it.

174
00:13:08,657 --> 00:13:09,378
Dr. Bai,

175
00:13:10,258 --> 00:13:11,298
let's go out and talk.

176
00:13:11,697 --> 00:13:12,618
Didn't you always want to know

177
00:13:12,697 --> 00:13:13,858
what happened to Qin Ge?

178
00:13:15,017 --> 00:13:16,378
I'll tell you everything then.

179
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:20,938
Three years ago,

180
00:13:21,058 --> 00:13:22,777
when I joined Bai Qi Studio,

181
00:13:22,978 --> 00:13:24,657
Qin Ge solemnly told me

182
00:13:24,978 --> 00:13:27,097
that she was diagnosed with
hereditary systemic lupus erythematosus.

183
00:13:27,258 --> 00:13:29,498
If it's not under control
in severe cases,

184
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,697
she'll lose her life at any moment.

185
00:13:31,858 --> 00:13:33,258
She even joked

186
00:13:33,418 --> 00:13:35,258
that if...

187
00:13:36,378 --> 00:13:38,378
She wanted me to carry on her legacy

188
00:13:38,697 --> 00:13:40,097
and inherit her assets.

189
00:13:41,577 --> 00:13:43,258
I didn't expect that this was why

190
00:13:43,897 --> 00:13:44,938
she didn't bid me farewell back then.

191
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:48,337
But why didn't she

192
00:13:48,337 --> 00:13:50,298
tell me personally?

193
00:13:51,938 --> 00:13:55,097
Whenever she encounters problems,
Qin Ge prefers

194
00:13:55,298 --> 00:13:56,938
to shoulder them alone.

195
00:13:59,217 --> 00:14:00,378
She doesn't want to tell any outsiders

196
00:14:00,457 --> 00:14:01,697
about her personal matters.

197
00:14:02,017 --> 00:14:04,938
Of course, except for Xuezhou and me,

198
00:14:05,457 --> 00:14:06,938
no one else knows about her secret.

199
00:14:14,017 --> 00:14:15,097
I regretted

200
00:14:16,537 --> 00:14:18,097
that I wasn't by her side

201
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:19,577
when she needed me most.

202
00:14:20,258 --> 00:14:22,258
I'll definitely treat her better
in the future.

203
00:14:22,577 --> 00:14:23,818
I'll make it up to her

204
00:14:24,537 --> 00:14:26,058
and won't let her get hurt.

205
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:27,498
Have you ever cared about

206
00:14:27,577 --> 00:14:29,657
why she's unwilling to tell others?

207
00:14:31,818 --> 00:14:32,777
Let me tell you.

208
00:14:33,298 --> 00:14:35,217
Qin Ge just wants to live a peaceful

209
00:14:35,337 --> 00:14:36,418
and happy life.

210
00:14:36,618 --> 00:14:37,858
She doesn't want to carry

211
00:14:37,938 --> 00:14:39,178
the "patient" label forever.

212
00:14:39,938 --> 00:14:40,818
She also doesn't want to become

213
00:14:40,897 --> 00:14:42,498
a bird trapped in the cage.

214
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,058
Are you sure

215
00:14:45,577 --> 00:14:46,777
you understand her well?

216
00:14:46,938 --> 00:14:47,897
I said

217
00:14:49,457 --> 00:14:50,498
Qin Ge needs

218
00:14:50,618 --> 00:14:52,818
a peaceful life so she can
focus on creating.

219
00:14:53,378 --> 00:14:55,378
She doesn't need any outsiders
to appear suddenly

220
00:14:55,498 --> 00:14:56,577
and tell her what to do.

221
00:14:56,738 --> 00:14:57,777
Do you mean

222
00:14:58,457 --> 00:15:00,298
you're the most suitable man for Qin Ge?

223
00:15:03,537 --> 00:15:04,337
Dr. Bai,

224
00:15:05,217 --> 00:15:06,457
when I first met you,

225
00:15:06,537 --> 00:15:07,537
I wanted to tell you

226
00:15:07,938 --> 00:15:09,337
that you shouldn't come back again

227
00:15:09,498 --> 00:15:11,017
after you left eight years ago.

228
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:14,017
Qin Ge is no longer

229
00:15:14,097 --> 00:15:15,618
the single-minded girl she used to be.

230
00:15:16,017 --> 00:15:18,058
She now has a new life of her own.

231
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:21,537
Please stop disturbing her.

232
00:15:24,498 --> 00:15:25,657
Let's take another look later.

233
00:15:25,818 --> 00:15:26,378
Okay.

234
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:32,258
Isn't that Procrastinator Bai?

235
00:15:32,577 --> 00:15:34,017
Didn't he change shifts today
and already leave?

236
00:15:34,457 --> 00:15:34,978
That's right.

237
00:15:36,137 --> 00:15:37,418
I think I saw Dr. Bai

238
00:15:37,738 --> 00:15:39,537
sent a female patient
to the emergency room just now.

239
00:15:39,938 --> 00:15:41,657
A female patient?

240
00:15:57,097 --> 00:15:58,418
It's all my fault.

241
00:16:00,457 --> 00:16:02,097
I shouldn't have let you meet him.

242
00:16:04,858 --> 00:16:07,017
It's my fault for not
taking good care of you.

243
00:16:12,618 --> 00:16:13,818
Min, you go home first.

244
00:16:14,378 --> 00:16:16,097
I'll stay by her side tonight.

245
00:16:17,097 --> 00:16:17,938
Xuezhou?

246
00:16:21,978 --> 00:16:22,818
Why are you crying?

247
00:16:23,097 --> 00:16:24,017
What are you doing here?

248
00:16:25,298 --> 00:16:26,017
Get out.

249
00:16:27,498 --> 00:16:28,697
I came to see Qin Ge.

250
00:16:28,938 --> 00:16:30,978
What happened? Why is she admitted
to the Department of Immunology?

251
00:16:33,938 --> 00:16:34,697
Come out with me.

252
00:16:41,777 --> 00:16:42,858
Lu Tian, let me tell you.

253
00:16:43,137 --> 00:16:45,537
If you're thinking
of colluding with Bai Qijia,

254
00:16:45,858 --> 00:16:48,697
I'll beat you up every time I see you.

255
00:16:50,378 --> 00:16:50,897
Wait.

256
00:16:51,017 --> 00:16:52,697
Don't talk to yourself
and walk away after that.

257
00:16:52,858 --> 00:16:53,858
What is this?

258
00:16:53,978 --> 00:16:55,818
What do you mean
by "colluding with Bai Qijia?"

259
00:16:56,017 --> 00:16:56,978
Stop pretending.

260
00:16:57,457 --> 00:16:58,217
You don't know that Bai Qijia

261
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:00,418
still pesters Qin Ge even after
he reconciled with his ex-girlfriend?

262
00:17:00,738 --> 00:17:02,178
Aren't you planning to speak for him?

263
00:17:02,337 --> 00:17:02,897
I...

264
00:17:04,777 --> 00:17:05,697
Whatever.

265
00:17:06,137 --> 00:17:07,418
Procrastinator Bai doesn't have
an ex-girlfriend.

266
00:17:07,978 --> 00:17:09,657
The girl you saw at the private cinema

267
00:17:09,858 --> 00:17:10,777
was Qin Ge.

268
00:17:11,618 --> 00:17:12,738
And the girl
with a shielded face you saw

269
00:17:12,858 --> 00:17:14,618
on his Moments was also Qin Ge.

270
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:17,697
If I lie to you again this time,

271
00:17:17,858 --> 00:17:18,817
I'll be alone forever.

272
00:17:21,018 --> 00:17:22,658
It was they who didn't want you to know.

273
00:17:22,817 --> 00:17:25,778
So I told a small lie.

274
00:17:38,217 --> 00:17:39,138
Lu Tian,

275
00:17:40,457 --> 00:17:41,417
stop running!

276
00:17:43,417 --> 00:17:45,538
(She was diagnosed with hereditary
systemic lupus erythematosus.)

277
00:17:45,978 --> 00:17:47,937
(If it's not under control
in severe cases,)

278
00:17:48,177 --> 00:17:50,337
(she'll lose her life at any moment.)

279
00:18:05,457 --> 00:18:07,817
I remember you liked the sun
very much before.

280
00:18:07,978 --> 00:18:10,658
When we reach middle age, we need
to protect ourselves against aging.

281
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:15,498
It should start with protecting
ourselves against the ultraviolet rays.

282
00:18:21,778 --> 00:18:22,577
Eat.

283
00:18:23,658 --> 00:18:25,498
Wasn't seafood your favorite?

284
00:18:26,498 --> 00:18:27,618
My taste has changed.

285
00:18:31,858 --> 00:18:34,217
Miss Bai Qi, you've covered
yourself up already.

286
00:18:34,337 --> 00:18:35,378
You're still afraid of the light?

287
00:18:36,498 --> 00:18:39,417
You're clueless. Actually,

288
00:18:40,097 --> 00:18:42,738
I've turned into a vampire.

289
00:18:46,457 --> 00:18:47,538
I can't carry on.

290
00:18:48,658 --> 00:18:50,018
-Slow down.
-I can't carry on.

291
00:18:50,738 --> 00:18:52,937
I can't walk anymore.
My legs are about to break.

292
00:19:02,697 --> 00:19:03,658
Have you ever cared about

293
00:19:03,738 --> 00:19:05,858
why she's unwilling to tell others?

294
00:19:06,177 --> 00:19:08,217
(Qin Ge just wants to live a peaceful)

295
00:19:08,337 --> 00:19:09,417
(and happy life.)

296
00:19:09,658 --> 00:19:10,937
(She doesn't want to carry)

297
00:19:11,018 --> 00:19:12,297
(the "patient" label forever.)

298
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:33,658
You're not entirely wrong.

299
00:19:34,498 --> 00:19:35,937
(Conversation Room)
After I reunited with Qin Ge,

300
00:19:36,297 --> 00:19:37,778
I didn't show her enough care.

301
00:19:38,337 --> 00:19:39,538
So I'm trying my best
to make it up to her.

302
00:19:40,858 --> 00:19:43,057
From tonight onwards,
let me look after her.

303
00:19:43,378 --> 00:19:44,337
I'm a doctor.

304
00:19:44,658 --> 00:19:46,778
I know how to deal
with any problems better.

305
00:19:49,618 --> 00:19:51,697
Lu Tian has explained
about your ex-girlfriend

306
00:19:51,817 --> 00:19:52,978
clearly to me.

307
00:19:53,417 --> 00:19:55,177
I'm sorry for having misunderstood you.

308
00:19:55,457 --> 00:19:56,778
I've gone too far.

309
00:19:56,898 --> 00:19:58,297
Don't take it to heart.

310
00:19:59,538 --> 00:20:01,858
But it's better that I take care
of Qin Ge instead.

311
00:20:02,378 --> 00:20:03,658
After all, I'm more experienced
than you.

312
00:20:04,258 --> 00:20:06,018
I'm not as good as you all
in terms of experience.

313
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:07,417
But please give me

314
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:08,697
another chance

315
00:20:08,937 --> 00:20:10,378
to gradually make up

316
00:20:10,378 --> 00:20:12,378
for my lack of company and care
in the past eight years.

317
00:20:20,457 --> 00:20:21,258
Xuezhou,

318
00:20:23,217 --> 00:20:25,297
why did you agree
to let Bai Qijia take care of Boss?

319
00:20:28,378 --> 00:20:29,858
I had a feeling

320
00:20:30,618 --> 00:20:33,258
that Qin Ge wanted him
to stay by her side.

321
00:21:40,618 --> 00:21:42,337
I knew you'd catch me.

322
00:21:49,498 --> 00:21:50,258
Close your eyes.

323
00:21:51,097 --> 00:21:51,898
Don't look at me.

324
00:21:54,378 --> 00:21:55,978
I... Well...

325
00:21:56,258 --> 00:21:57,618
Close your eyes. I...

326
00:21:58,018 --> 00:21:59,417
It was merely an accident.

327
00:21:59,658 --> 00:22:01,177
I didn't know you were
on this side of the wall.

328
00:22:01,658 --> 00:22:03,817
I didn't mean to jump on you.

329
00:22:04,138 --> 00:22:04,697
Well...

330
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:06,618
We met by chance.

331
00:22:07,018 --> 00:22:08,898
Just treat it as if it never happened.

332
00:22:09,258 --> 00:22:10,417
Let's not remember each other.

333
00:22:11,858 --> 00:22:12,457
Okay.

334
00:22:12,738 --> 00:22:13,738
I'm going to leave now.

335
00:22:14,258 --> 00:22:15,538
Don't open your eyes.

336
00:22:15,978 --> 00:22:17,457
Open your eyes only after I've left.

337
00:22:18,457 --> 00:22:19,937
Wait. I'm still here.

338
00:22:36,817 --> 00:22:38,577
Firstly, let me introduce

339
00:22:39,097 --> 00:22:40,417
the new transfer student in our class,

340
00:22:40,538 --> 00:22:42,378
Bai Qijia. Let's welcome him.

341
00:22:57,097 --> 00:22:57,898
What's the matter?

342
00:23:00,097 --> 00:23:02,778
Sir, I went to perform
my class duty just now.

343
00:23:04,177 --> 00:23:05,258
Let me introduce

344
00:23:05,898 --> 00:23:07,177
the new transfer student in our class,

345
00:23:07,258 --> 00:23:08,297
Bai Qijia.

346
00:23:08,817 --> 00:23:09,898
This is our class monitor.

347
00:23:10,858 --> 00:23:12,297
-You...
-I know her name.

348
00:23:13,778 --> 00:23:15,097
She dropped her student card

349
00:23:15,337 --> 00:23:16,658
(Qingchuan Chengya High School. Qin Ge)
outside the school compound just now.

350
00:23:21,177 --> 00:23:23,498
Didn't you say you went
to perform your class duty?

351
00:23:24,658 --> 00:23:27,817
What kind of class duty do you need
to settle outside the school?

352
00:23:28,138 --> 00:23:29,898
Did you go shopping
for comic books again?

353
00:23:29,898 --> 00:23:31,258
Sir, I'm sorry. I was wrong.

354
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:33,097
All right. All right.
Stop talking about it.

355
00:23:34,297 --> 00:23:35,417
Write your reading notes
five times

356
00:23:35,778 --> 00:23:37,018
and submit to me
early tomorrow morning.

357
00:23:38,258 --> 00:23:38,858
Go.

358
00:23:48,898 --> 00:23:50,337
Come, that's your seat.

359
00:23:54,297 --> 00:23:55,937
Okay, my fellow students.

360
00:23:56,778 --> 00:23:58,057
Before we begin our lesson,

361
00:23:58,417 --> 00:24:00,337
let us confirm the rotating
assistant class monitor

362
00:24:00,457 --> 00:24:01,337
of the month.

363
00:24:02,297 --> 00:24:03,898
Any volunteer?

364
00:24:15,417 --> 00:24:16,378
Speak, Qin Ge.

365
00:24:18,097 --> 00:24:20,898
Sir, I suggest that Bai Qijia

366
00:24:21,018 --> 00:24:22,457
be our assistant class monitor.

367
00:24:23,097 --> 00:24:23,738
Sir, I...

368
00:24:23,858 --> 00:24:25,138
Sir, Bai Qijia

369
00:24:25,217 --> 00:24:26,337
isn't familiar with everyone here.

370
00:24:26,457 --> 00:24:27,577
If he becomes
the assistant class monitor,

371
00:24:27,697 --> 00:24:29,898
he'll get to know everyone very soon.

372
00:24:31,538 --> 00:24:32,417
Please sit down.

373
00:24:34,258 --> 00:24:36,378
If no one else volunteers,

374
00:24:36,898 --> 00:24:38,697
then do anyone has any comments

375
00:24:39,417 --> 00:24:40,738
on Qin Ge's suggestion?

376
00:24:42,978 --> 00:24:45,658
All right then. Bai Qijia will be
the assistant class monitor

377
00:24:45,978 --> 00:24:47,337
of the month.

378
00:24:47,577 --> 00:24:48,417
I believe

379
00:24:48,697 --> 00:24:50,817
our new classmate
will surely give our class

380
00:24:51,018 --> 00:24:51,898
a new look

381
00:24:52,937 --> 00:24:54,217
and bring our grades

382
00:24:54,417 --> 00:24:55,658
to another level.

383
00:24:55,778 --> 00:24:56,898
If there's no comment,

384
00:24:56,898 --> 00:24:58,658
let's applaud to pass the motion.

385
00:25:04,778 --> 00:25:06,337
Qin Ge, you're the class monitor.

386
00:25:06,498 --> 00:25:08,018
He's new and clueless.

387
00:25:08,297 --> 00:25:09,697
Do show him the way.

388
00:25:09,937 --> 00:25:11,018
Okay, Sir.

389
00:25:11,817 --> 00:25:13,258
I'll look after him well.

390
00:25:17,258 --> 00:25:18,658
Help me tell our classmates

391
00:25:18,738 --> 00:25:20,417
that I'm having a terrible stomachache.

392
00:25:21,378 --> 00:25:22,658
Thank you!

393
00:25:23,018 --> 00:25:24,858
Assistant class monitor,
this is the class attendance sheet.

394
00:25:25,618 --> 00:25:26,457
Thank you very much.

395
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:28,538
Please be impartial and fair.

396
00:25:28,937 --> 00:25:30,457
Assistant class monitor!

397
00:25:32,378 --> 00:25:33,217
Please help me prepare

398
00:25:33,297 --> 00:25:34,217
tomorrow's class report.

399
00:25:34,337 --> 00:25:36,057
I have too much homework.
I can't finish it.

400
00:25:36,378 --> 00:25:37,138
Thank you very much.

401
00:25:37,337 --> 00:25:38,778
See you tomorrow!

402
00:25:41,978 --> 00:25:42,738
Qijia,

403
00:25:43,297 --> 00:25:44,417
tell me the truth.

404
00:25:45,138 --> 00:25:47,697
Who prepared yesterday's class report?

405
00:25:48,978 --> 00:25:50,018
It was the class monitor who gave me

406
00:25:50,097 --> 00:25:51,618
her complete trust and support

407
00:25:51,738 --> 00:25:52,898
and motivated me to finish it.

408
00:25:54,217 --> 00:25:56,457
Why did I hear

409
00:25:56,577 --> 00:25:58,217
that she'd passed
all the class duties to you just like that?

410
00:25:59,297 --> 00:26:00,097
Don't be afraid of her.

411
00:26:00,658 --> 00:26:02,778
She must get her own duties
done herself.

412
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,978
You're our class's
pacesetter of learning.

413
00:26:06,297 --> 00:26:08,858
You must not let anything
affect your studies.

414
00:26:09,538 --> 00:26:10,097
Okay.

415
00:26:10,337 --> 00:26:11,417
Got it, Sir.

416
00:26:11,898 --> 00:26:12,498
You may leave.

417
00:26:19,658 --> 00:26:21,057
Qin Ge, come in!

418
00:26:29,177 --> 00:26:29,978
Bai Qijia.

419
00:26:31,898 --> 00:26:32,937
We have a class activity today.

420
00:26:33,177 --> 00:26:34,778
Please fill in for me at the library.

421
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:36,258
We'll fill in for you next time.

422
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:38,738
Thanks.

423
00:26:58,778 --> 00:26:59,697
Bai Qijia!

424
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:03,778
I've finally found you.

425
00:27:04,217 --> 00:27:05,858
What's the matter?
Why are you looking for me?

426
00:27:07,217 --> 00:27:08,378
Why are you alone here?

427
00:27:08,658 --> 00:27:09,937
Where are those
from Class Three and Class One?

428
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,018
They have a class activity.
They can't make it.

429
00:27:13,538 --> 00:27:14,378
This is too much.

430
00:27:14,858 --> 00:27:16,018
They've gone too far.

431
00:27:21,297 --> 00:27:22,618
Didn't you say there is
a class activity going on?

432
00:27:22,778 --> 00:27:24,097
How come it is only a few of you?

433
00:27:24,697 --> 00:27:26,097
It's over much earlier.

434
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:27,018
What's the problem?

435
00:27:27,337 --> 00:27:29,817
Besides, it was Bai Qijia
whom I asked for help.

436
00:27:30,057 --> 00:27:31,057
It's none of your business.

437
00:27:31,297 --> 00:27:32,297
What is the relationship
between you two?

438
00:27:32,898 --> 00:27:33,858
That's right.

439
00:27:34,177 --> 00:27:35,138
Let me tell you.

440
00:27:38,538 --> 00:27:40,057
Bai Qijia is under my care.

441
00:27:40,817 --> 00:27:42,258
He's our classmate.

442
00:27:42,618 --> 00:27:43,858
I'm their class monitor.

443
00:27:44,258 --> 00:27:45,937
So his business is mine.

444
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:49,417
Stop kidding me.

445
00:27:49,898 --> 00:27:51,258
Who in our year doesn't know

446
00:27:51,417 --> 00:27:53,817
that you oppress Bai Qijia the most?

447
00:27:54,018 --> 00:27:55,457
How could you have
the nerve to talk about it?

448
00:27:56,337 --> 00:27:57,858
Let me tell you. Don't you...

449
00:28:01,738 --> 00:28:03,378
Qin Ge is my best friend.

450
00:28:03,858 --> 00:28:05,217
She has never forced me.

451
00:28:05,898 --> 00:28:07,177
Please apologize to her.

452
00:28:08,417 --> 00:28:09,177
Now.

453
00:28:09,457 --> 00:28:10,457
Asking us to apologize to her?

454
00:28:12,018 --> 00:28:12,978
Who do you think you are?

455
00:28:14,337 --> 00:28:15,258
It hurts.

456
00:28:15,498 --> 00:28:15,978
You...

457
00:28:17,498 --> 00:28:18,297
It hurts.

458
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:19,057
Apologize!

459
00:28:19,417 --> 00:28:21,018
-I'm sorry.
-So sorry.

460
00:28:21,297 --> 00:28:22,937
-I'm sorry.
-So sorry.

461
00:28:23,177 --> 00:28:24,778
-I'm sorry.
-So sorry.

462
00:28:31,498 --> 00:28:32,217
Qin Ge!

463
00:28:33,417 --> 00:28:34,057
Qin Ge!

464
00:28:34,538 --> 00:28:35,378
Don't be angry.

465
00:28:35,538 --> 00:28:36,817
I accepted their absence.

466
00:28:36,937 --> 00:28:38,297
You accepted it, but I didn't.

467
00:28:39,177 --> 00:28:40,057
Bai Qijia,

468
00:28:40,457 --> 00:28:42,378
can you please stand up
for yourself just once?

469
00:28:42,658 --> 00:28:44,057
Can you please have a bottom line?

470
00:28:44,538 --> 00:28:46,337
Do you enjoy
being a kind person so much?

471
00:29:06,138 --> 00:29:06,738
How is it?

472
00:29:07,258 --> 00:29:07,937
Let me have a look.

473
00:29:34,057 --> 00:29:35,658
I... I'm sorry.

474
00:29:36,097 --> 00:29:38,018
I'm not angry at you.

475
00:29:38,817 --> 00:29:40,018
Okay. I'm indeed...

476
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:41,697
I'm angry at you.

477
00:29:42,417 --> 00:29:43,378
It's all your fault.

478
00:29:44,457 --> 00:29:45,378
Thanks to you,

479
00:29:45,538 --> 00:29:47,138
I had to write
the reading notes five times.

480
00:29:47,337 --> 00:29:48,538
I wrote till my hands were numb.

481
00:29:52,618 --> 00:29:54,937
You must be furious at me

482
00:29:56,097 --> 00:29:57,457
for taking revenge on you so blatantly.

483
00:29:58,978 --> 00:29:59,697
I'm not furious.

484
00:30:00,457 --> 00:30:01,097
Really?

485
00:30:03,138 --> 00:30:03,978
Bai Qijia,

486
00:30:04,577 --> 00:30:05,898
have you been like this all along?

487
00:30:06,378 --> 00:30:07,817
Treating others neutrally

488
00:30:08,177 --> 00:30:10,978
having no desire,
and acting like a piece of wood?

489
00:30:11,457 --> 00:30:12,457
I'm used to it.

490
00:30:13,417 --> 00:30:15,658
Cut the crap.

491
00:30:16,417 --> 00:30:18,498
Humans should have emotions.

492
00:30:18,778 --> 00:30:19,738
Laugh when you're happy.

493
00:30:19,937 --> 00:30:21,417
Throw a tantrum when you're unhappy.

494
00:30:21,937 --> 00:30:23,378
Say it out when you're dissatisfied.

495
00:30:23,618 --> 00:30:25,817
Don't suppress your emotions.

496

transfer to this school when the college
entrance exam is just around the corner?

My parents are busy getting divorced

So they sent me here.
