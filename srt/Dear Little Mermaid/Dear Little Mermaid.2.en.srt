Why didn't you ask her
the reason directly?

159
00:10:34,721 --> 00:10:36,880
She wouldn't even tell me
her real identity.

00:10:37,481 --> 00:10:39,200
Do you think she'll tell me the truth?

00:11:00,361 --> 00:11:01,760
Please see

170
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,520
whether there is any problem
with the payment method

171
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,841
and the class schedule or not.

172
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:06,120
And about that matter,

173
00:11:06,241 --> 00:11:07,041
Boss has approved it.

174
00:11:07,161 --> 00:11:09,200
You may have more work to handle
in the coming days.

175
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,080
Okay. As long as you've gone through it,

176
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,961
I'll execute it accordingly.

177
00:11:14,801 --> 00:11:16,200
By the way, where did you have fun

178
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,161
after you left me alone last night?

179
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,320
I had something on last night,

180
00:11:21,401 --> 00:11:22,560
so I left earlier.

181
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,801
What about you?

182
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,560
Did Bai Qijia send you home?

183
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,721
Yes.

184
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:30,560
At least he has a bit of conscience.

185
00:11:32,721 --> 00:11:33,520
Xuezhou,

186
00:11:34,241 --> 00:11:36,041
I have something to ask you.

187
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,680
Well,

188
00:11:37,921 --> 00:11:39,161
I have a friend

189
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,440
who might have done
something unspeakable

190
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,440
with someone she doesn't know well.

191
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,921
She has no experience in this area.

192
00:11:51,241 --> 00:11:53,320
She would like to seek your advice

193
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,921
on how to deal with it.

194
00:11:55,161 --> 00:11:58,241
(She's asking such a question.
Has she found out about it?)

195
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,241
Well, they are adults.

196
00:12:01,361 --> 00:12:03,361
Both were willing parties
in such a matter.

197
00:12:03,801 --> 00:12:05,320
Don't take it too seriously.

198
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,520
All right then. I have something on.

199
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,200
Bye.

200
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:09,801
Bye.

201
00:12:12,601 --> 00:12:13,520
(She's right.)

202
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,000
(What if nothing has happened?)

203
00:12:24,281 --> 00:12:25,000
Gosh.

204
00:12:26,481 --> 00:12:30,041
Was it really me
who took the initiative?

205
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,080
(My neck is so painful.)

206
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,320
(I must not doze off
in the bathtub again.)

207
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,161
Hello, my fellow students.

208
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,801
I'm your teacher, Bai Qi.

209
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:46,401
Welcome to my in-person drawing class.

210
00:12:46,721 --> 00:12:47,961
For our first lesson,

211
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,320
let's first have a roll call

212
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,161
and an ice-breaking session.

213
00:12:53,361 --> 00:12:54,860
The first person to sign up is a girl,

214
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,320
(Yue Qiqi. Female.)
The first person to sign up is a girl,

215
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,440
(Yue Qiqi. Female.)
Yue Qiqi.

216
00:12:57,361 --> 00:12:58,080
Yes!

217
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,601
The first person to sign up is a girl.

218
00:13:10,961 --> 00:13:13,601
Sir, are you in the wrong classroom?

219
00:13:13,921 --> 00:13:14,841
Guru Bai Qi,

220
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,921
my patient is a fan of yours.

221
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,241
She'd won a chance to attend your class

222
00:13:18,361 --> 00:13:19,361
but couldn't make it.

223
00:13:19,481 --> 00:13:20,880
So I'm attending the class
on her behalf.

224
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,801
I'll share with her your charm

225
00:13:22,961 --> 00:13:23,801
later on.

226
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,401
But according to the rules,

227
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,520
the absentees

228
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,841
aren't allowed to transfer
their places to anyone.

229
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,281
So sorry, Sir.

230
00:13:30,401 --> 00:13:31,801
Please leave this classroom.

231
00:13:32,241 --> 00:13:34,320
Miss Bai Qi, rules are set by humans.

232
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,200
Kindness wins over reasoning.

233
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,200
What's more, this is also Qiqi's wish.

234
00:13:38,481 --> 00:13:39,921
If she could attend personally,

235
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:41,000
she'd definitely do so.

236
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,361
That's right, Miss Bai Qi.

237
00:13:42,481 --> 00:13:43,680
Please make an exception this time.

238
00:13:43,801 --> 00:13:45,241
Miss Bai Qi, please make an exception.

239
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:48,080
That's right. Please.

240
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,721
-Just this once.
-My fellow classmates.

241
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,281
Don't make things difficult
for Miss Bai Qi.

242
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,161
It's indeed my fault.

243
00:13:53,281 --> 00:13:54,801
I didn't communicate
with you in advance.

244
00:13:54,921 --> 00:13:55,721
I'm sorry.

245
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,281
(Bai Qijia, you're really something.)

246
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,760
(You could act better than I do.)

247
00:14:05,401 --> 00:14:07,801
Since everyone agrees,

248
00:14:07,921 --> 00:14:10,241
let us welcome this student

249
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,440
to our family.

250
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,120
Great!

251
00:14:16,161 --> 00:14:17,041
Thank you, Miss Bai.

252
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,200
Nice drawing. Keep it up.

253
00:14:18,361 --> 00:14:19,241
Thank you, Miss Bai.

254
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,161
Did you come here to provoke me?

255
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,721
I indeed came
to get your autograph for your fan.

256
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:37,200
At the same time, I came to get you
to take up your responsibility.

257
00:14:41,721 --> 00:14:43,080
Make this line softer.

258
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,401
You did well.

259
00:14:45,601 --> 00:14:47,721
Well, can I trouble you

260
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,000
to help me find the feelings?

261
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:56,361
Thank you, Guru Bai Qi.

262
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,080
Hold my hand
and help me find the feelings.

263
00:15:00,361 --> 00:15:01,721
What kind of feelings
are you looking for?

264
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,961
Anything will do.

265
00:15:29,401 --> 00:15:31,481
How was your sleep last night?

266
00:15:33,481 --> 00:15:34,640
I slept quite well.

267
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,161
So well that you have a stiff neck now?

268
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,601
Don't panic. Your hand is shaking.

269
00:15:50,921 --> 00:15:52,801
What kind of illness
has my fan contracted?

270
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,000
Is it grave?

271
00:15:54,401 --> 00:15:56,161
It's membranous lupus nephritis.

272
00:15:56,801 --> 00:15:58,841
It's inconvenient for me
to disclose the specifics.

273
00:16:01,401 --> 00:16:02,721
How did she contract such a disease?

274
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,841
You know about this disease?

275
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,680
A friend of mine

276
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,080
died of this disease.

277
00:16:11,601 --> 00:16:12,481
Don't worry.

278
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,320
We'll do our best to treat her.

279
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,601
Here's the autograph.

280
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:29,200
I've also written a short message.

281
00:16:30,721 --> 00:16:32,080
Don't take a peek.

282
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,481
All right.

283
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,041
Thank you.

284
00:16:35,921 --> 00:16:36,921
Let me treat you to lunch.

285
00:16:38,801 --> 00:16:40,241
Do you indeed want to treat me to lunch?

286
00:16:40,361 --> 00:16:42,481
Or do you actually want
to send me home after that?

287
00:16:43,281 --> 00:16:44,401
You think too much.

288
00:16:44,841 --> 00:16:45,640
Or

289
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,520
do you hope I'll send you home?

290
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,721
You... You think too much.

291
00:16:55,961 --> 00:16:58,401
It's just that I've gotten over it.

292
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,601
Just treat it that I was
impulsive last night.

293
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,921
So were you!

294
00:17:03,281 --> 00:17:04,640
The two of us share the responsibility.

295
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,320
Am I right?

296
00:17:05,961 --> 00:17:07,560
Just pretend nothing had happened.

297
00:17:07,921 --> 00:17:09,200
So you're not going
to take responsibility?

298
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,000
Scumbag.

299
00:17:12,881 --> 00:17:14,440
We... We are adults.

300
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,080
Don't be such a killjoy.

301
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,040
Miss Bai Qi,

302
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,440
would you like to have lunch together?

303
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,481
We have many things to tell you.

304
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,080
Okay.

305
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,800
Dr. Bai, would you like to join us?

306
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,601
Okay.

307
00:17:31,361 --> 00:17:32,361
Be careful. It's hot.

308
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,800
Try this.

309
00:17:40,641 --> 00:17:42,521
Wasn't seafood your favorite?

310
00:17:43,881 --> 00:17:45,080
My taste has changed.

311
00:17:50,641 --> 00:17:51,761
(Gosh. It's spicy.)

312
00:17:53,521 --> 00:17:54,521
Be careful.

313
00:17:55,361 --> 00:17:57,160
Dr. Bai

314
00:17:57,361 --> 00:17:59,080
and Miss Bai Qi have similar names.

315
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,841
And you two look like
you know each other well.

316
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,001
Did you know each other before this?

317
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,761
-We...
-We were classmates in high school.

318
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,241
She was the class monitor.
I was the assistant class monitor.

319
00:18:08,361 --> 00:18:09,800
(You really talk about everything.)

320
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,440
(I'm just speaking the truth.)

321
00:18:12,481 --> 00:18:13,641
It turns out that they were classmates.

322
00:18:13,761 --> 00:18:15,400
Our relationship wasn't an ordinary one.

323
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,481
I was his guiding star.

324
00:18:17,841 --> 00:18:19,800
Under my guidance back then,

325
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,800
he turned from a transfer student

326
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,361
into being the chosen one.

327
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,241
That's right. It was
all thanks to Miss Bai Qi

328
00:18:25,481 --> 00:18:26,641
that I, an assistant class monitor,

329
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,601
had the chance to understand the duties

330
00:18:28,721 --> 00:18:30,961
of a class monitor.

331
00:18:32,241 --> 00:18:34,001
That was because Bai

332
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,001
was an honest boy.

333
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,320
He found my student card

334
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,521
and turned it in
to our homeroom teacher,

335
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:39,721
causing me

336
00:18:39,721 --> 00:18:41,841
to write the reading notes five times all night.

337
00:18:43,521 --> 00:18:45,521
Well, why don't you share
with everyone here

338
00:18:45,641 --> 00:18:46,961
why I found your student card

339
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,440
outside the school compound?

340
00:18:51,641 --> 00:18:53,800
Since Bai and Miss Bai know each other,

341
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,160
we have gossips to listen to
from now on.

342
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,481
Let's create a group chat now.

343
00:18:56,641 --> 00:18:57,680
Sure.

344
00:18:58,521 --> 00:18:59,160
Come on.

345
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,361
Miss Bai Qi,

346
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,881
let's exchange our WeChat.

347
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,200
(You've shared
your location with Chen Min.)

348
00:19:13,961 --> 00:19:15,641
(Come to my rescue immediately.)

349
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,160
(Got it!)

350
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,641
Bai Qijia, it's all your fault.

351
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,121
My neck...

352
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:31,001
It's all my fault

353
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,320
that you slept on my arm
the whole night.

354
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,521
Bai Qijia, there won't be a next time.

355
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,761
Stop moving around.

356
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,320
Let me massage for you. Come back.

357
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,481
Your cervical vertebra

358
00:19:48,601 --> 00:19:49,680
is suffering along with you.

359
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,241
Stop moving around.

360
00:19:54,121 --> 00:19:55,320
Dr... Dr. Bai.

361
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,961
You... You are adept at massage.

362
00:20:00,001 --> 00:20:01,280
Something is going on.

363
00:20:04,361 --> 00:20:05,400
They're so close.

364
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,001
Miss Bai Qi, Dr. Bai,

365
00:20:15,121 --> 00:20:15,841
we'll get going.

366
00:20:15,961 --> 00:20:18,241
Bye. We're leaving. Bye.

367
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,920
What are those odd looks?

368
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,121
All right, Dr. Bai.

369
00:20:25,761 --> 00:20:27,160
Please tell my fan

370
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,280
to take care of her health.

371
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,961
I'll pray for her.

372
00:20:31,361 --> 00:20:32,121
Thank you.

373
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,160
I...

374
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,920
Qingchuan

375
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,761
welcomes you back.

376
00:20:44,121 --> 00:20:44,961
Boss.

377
00:20:47,601 --> 00:20:48,320
Min.

378
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:49,841
I'll get going.

379
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,001
What's

380
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:56,920
the matter?

381
00:20:57,761 --> 00:20:58,961
Take care of your cervical vertebra.

382
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,521
Don't sit for too long.
Move around more.

383
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,721
Got it, Dr. Bai.

384
00:21:24,481 --> 00:21:25,361
Hold me tight.

385
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,680
Thank you, Dr. Bai.

386
00:21:46,961 --> 00:21:47,761
Thanks.

387
00:21:48,761 --> 00:21:50,241
It was so cool today.

388
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,961
I have finally paid off

389
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,160
the years-long farewell debt.

390
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:55,121
From now on, he's a doctor,

391
00:21:55,241 --> 00:21:56,560
and I'm a comic artist.

392
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,040
I'm afraid Dr. Bai doesn't think so.

393
00:22:00,641 --> 00:22:01,841
That's his problem.

394
00:22:01,961 --> 00:22:03,080
It's none of my business.

395
00:22:03,481 --> 00:22:04,961
I'll get going. I want to sleep.

396
00:22:06,001 --> 00:22:06,481
Goodnight.

397
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,320
Bye.

398
00:22:09,841 --> 00:22:10,800
Bye.

399
00:22:29,961 --> 00:22:32,400
Let me take a look
at Bai Qijia's Moments.

400
00:22:43,881 --> 00:22:44,641
Bai Qijia.

401
00:22:44,761 --> 00:22:46,440
We've just reconciled,
and you've started to mess with me.

402
00:22:52,761 --> 00:22:54,680
But his look doesn't change at all

403
00:22:54,761 --> 00:22:56,400
after all these years.

404
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,920
What's wrong with you, Qin Ge?

405
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,280
Stop it.

406
00:23:04,241 --> 00:23:05,320
You must focus on your work.

407
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,040
Stop imagining things.

408
00:23:09,241 --> 00:23:10,080
Stop it.

409
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,761
(Did I see it right?)

410
00:23:23,961 --> 00:23:25,320
(Handsome Bai
has officially announced it.)

411
00:23:25,721 --> 00:23:27,320
(Isn't this Guru Bai Qi?)

412
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,400
(It's over now. The wall
of the dimension world has broken.)

413
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:32,440
(It's over now.
My Bai-Lu couple has collapsed.)

414
00:23:32,721 --> 00:23:34,361
(Dr. Lu is so pitiful.)

415
00:23:39,721 --> 00:23:41,560
Are you really going
to see me off tomorrow?

416
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,560
You'll be away for more than a month.

417
00:23:44,841 --> 00:23:46,961
Before the college entrance
examination is over,

418
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,440
it's probably hard to see you again.

419
00:23:48,601 --> 00:23:50,040
Of course I'll see you off.

420
00:23:50,481 --> 00:23:51,200
All right then.

421
00:23:51,521 --> 00:23:53,641
I'll come back
right after the exam is over.

422
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,481
That's our promise then.

423
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,680
We must get into a school
in the same city.

424
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:05,881
You'll get into a medical school,
and I'll get into a fine arts academy.

425
00:24:06,121 --> 00:24:08,920
Then, we can meet every day.

426
00:24:10,361 --> 00:24:11,280
That's our promise then.

427
00:24:11,521 --> 00:24:12,800
I won't break my promise.

428
00:24:49,841 --> 00:24:50,721
Mr. Bai,

429
00:24:50,881 --> 00:24:52,440
I can't believe you are such a man.

430
00:24:52,721 --> 00:24:53,560
Miss Qin,

431
00:24:53,721 --> 00:24:55,040
you are tougher than I imagine.

432
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,001
I advise you to admit your defeat
sooner rather than later.

433
00:24:59,160 --> 00:24:59,841
Do you think

434
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,961
I didn't come prepared?

435
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,040
In this case,

436
00:25:02,121 --> 00:25:04,200
don't blame me for being ruthless.

437
00:25:13,841 --> 00:25:15,881
(Gosh! I brought the wrong script.)

438
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,320
Miss Bai Qi.

439
00:25:21,961 --> 00:25:22,881
What's wrong?

440
00:25:24,361 --> 00:25:25,121
It's nothing.

441
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,001
Today, let's share about...

442
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:27,920
Miss Bai,

443
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:29,280
I'm late.

444
00:25:29,841 --> 00:25:31,200
Why are you here again?

445
00:25:31,761 --> 00:25:32,721
I'll help someone the best I can.

446
00:25:32,841 --> 00:25:34,481
Your fan wants to know more about you.

447
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,400
I didn't get a deep knowledge
about you last time.

448
00:25:36,521 --> 00:25:37,800
She wasn't particularly satisfied.

449
00:25:37,961 --> 00:25:40,481
So she asked me
to attend the class again.

450
00:25:40,761 --> 00:25:42,521
(Trying to bring us together forcibly?)

451
00:25:42,721 --> 00:25:43,800
Miss Bai, if there's nothing else,

452
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,961
I'll get to my seat.

453
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,320
Wait!

454
00:25:50,001 --> 00:25:52,040
Student, as you're late,

455
00:25:52,241 --> 00:25:53,761
why don't you show your drawing

456
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:54,920
to your classmates?

457
00:25:57,881 --> 00:25:58,721
Sure.

458
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,841
Did Miss Bai Qi give Dr. Bai

459
00:26:09,961 --> 00:26:11,001
a leg-up?

460
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,761
What a vivid drawing.

461
00:26:13,761 --> 00:26:15,001
Isn't this Miss Bai Qi

462
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,080
in her school years?

463
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,080
You're right.

464
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:24,720
♪Enclosed in the vivid past♪

465
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:31,280
♪Those miseries
which I'm the sole audience♪

466
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:38,360
♪In the imagination of our future♪

467
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:45,240

00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:51,960
♪I think I have lost my mind♪

469
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:58,481
Bai Qijia, stay away.

470
00:26:58,601 --> 00:27:00,599
I'm so ugly now.

471
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:06,000
♪The world is blooming for you♪

472
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,920
You're amazing.

473
00:27:11,121 --> 00:27:12,881
You indeed persist
in running for 800 meters.

474
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,440
Well, of course. I

475
00:27:15,881 --> 00:27:17,001
walk the talk!

476
00:27:20,841 --> 00:27:21,721
Bai Qijia,

477
00:27:22,521 --> 00:27:23,920
you have such good grades.

478
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,641
What is your ambition?

479
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,680
I want to study medicine.

480
00:27:32,001 --> 00:27:33,680
Have you heard of this joke?

481
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:34,841
Medical study

482
00:27:34,961 --> 00:27:37,481
is the bridge that strengthens
the friendship between classmates.

483
00:27:37,761 --> 00:27:40,160
Friends you haven't met for a long time
will come to you and ask

484
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,080
whether he has some illnesses or not.

485
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,200
Just forget it.

486
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,001
I don't wish

487
00:27:50,121 --> 00:27:51,761
to see you do so one day.

488
00:27:52,601 --> 00:27:53,761
It won't happen.

489
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,040
I promise

490
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,920
I'll never lose touch with you.

491
00:28:14,641 --> 00:28:16,601
Bai Qijia, it's all your fault

492
00:28:17,481 --> 00:28:18,680
that I'm so unlucky.

493
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,761
Why are you blaming me?

494
00:28:24,761 --> 00:28:26,160
Didn't you leave already?

495
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,160
What about you, Miss Bai Qi?

496
00:28:30,361 --> 00:28:31,481
How come you have time

497
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,001
to stay back and clean up?

00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:34,961
I have so much time on hand.

499
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,961
I knew you brought the wrong script.

500
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,841
Because just now,

501
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,879
you looked like you'd screwed up.

00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,080
(How come he has become like this?)

505
00:29:08,721 --> 00:29:09,601
Okay. Let's go.

506
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:10,601
Wait.

507
00:29:11,361 --> 00:29:12,121
Show me

508
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,160
what you've drawn first.

509
00:29:13,361 --> 00:29:15,040
Stop trying to hide it from me.

510
00:29:15,601 --> 00:29:16,560
It's nothing fancy.

511
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,721
It's too ordinary.

512
00:29:23,601 --> 00:29:24,721
Why can't I open it?

513
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,440
Maybe the password lock is broken.

514
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,400
It's locked from the outside.
You can't open it from here.

515
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,841
No way.

516
00:29:38,241 --> 00:29:39,361
Anybody's there?

517
00:29:39,881 --> 00:29:41,241
Anybody's there?

518
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,001
The classroom door is broken!

519
00:29:56,241 --> 00:29:57,320
Anybody's there?

520
00:29:57,641 --> 00:30:00,521
The classroom door is broken!
Anybody's there?

521
00:30:02,601 --> 00:30:03,280
This...

522
00:30:04,881 --> 00:30:06,800
Such a spirit of the employed.

523
00:30:07,001 --> 00:30:08,601
They act so fast
when it comes to clocking off work.

524
00:30:09,881 --> 00:30:11,721
I already called their security.

525
00:30:11,881 --> 00:30:13,001
They are sending people over now.

526
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,280
Take a rest first.

527
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,721
How come you have their contact?

528
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,881
You have to keep an eye

529
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,361
on things like this.

530
00:30:19,641 --> 00:30:21,280
Or else you'll be in trouble
when you're alone

531
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:22,080
next time.

532
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,400
Touch wood. It won't happen again.

533
00:30:27,361 --> 00:30:28,521
Since we have some time now,

534
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,121
why don't you show me your drawing?

535
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:32,920
Why are you so persistent?

536
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,160
I couldn't get
the right feeling last time.

537
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,080
So I'd drawn a dark tragedy, okay?

538
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,881
It's interesting
to feel dark occasionally.

539
00:30:39,001 --> 00:30:40,160
This is a manga for girls.

540
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,721
It should be a story
about love bubbles!

541
00:30:43,001 --> 00:30:43,641
The evil demon

542
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:45,280
only exists in the world of adults.

543
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,680
But speaking of which,

544
00:30:47,481 --> 00:30:48,841
the love bubbles in my heart

545
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,320
are all dead now.

546
00:30:51,001 --> 00:30:52,080
It's all your fault!

547
00:30:52,481 --> 00:30:54,241
All right. Blame it on me then.

548
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,400
In this case,

549
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,841
I'll redeem my wrongdoing

550
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,440
by helping you find the feeling. Okay?

551
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,920
I can hear the love bubbles machine
in your heart

552
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,440
restarting itself.

553
00:31:24,961 --> 00:31:25,680
How is it?

554
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,040
Do you feel anything?

555
00:31:27,361 --> 00:31:29,200
That's what it's like in idol dramas.

556
00:31:30,241 --> 00:31:31,521
Bai Qijia,

557
00:31:34,641 --> 00:31:36,160
how dare you fool me?

558
00:31:38,841 --> 00:31:40,721
Comics are just pure imagination.

559
00:31:41,241 --> 00:31:43,521
The reality is cruel.

560
00:31:43,841 --> 00:31:45,320
People like you who have
the prince syndrome

561
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,881
and the president syndrome

562
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,800
will succumb in our hands.

563
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,200
Professor.

564
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,641
Okay. I'll be there soon.

565
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,841
What's the matter?

566
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,361
I have a consultation at 2:30 pm.

567
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,680
Looks like I have to find a way
to get out of here.

568
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,961
It's time to take action.

569
00:32:36,641 --> 00:32:37,400
Qin Ge!

570
00:32:38,001 --> 00:32:39,881
Qin Ge!

571
00:32:40,481 --> 00:32:41,241
I'm over here!

572
00:32:41,481 --> 00:32:42,961
I... I'm over here.

573
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,881
Don't do something so dangerous again,

574
00:32:58,241 --> 00:32:59,200
okay?

575
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,361
Okay.

576
00:33:02,641 --> 00:33:03,721
Got it.

577
00:33:11,001 --> 00:33:12,320
Get to your consultation now.

578
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,961
Don't be late.

579
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:17,961
I'll get going then.

580
00:33:44,361 --> 00:33:46,641
The consultation is over.
It's time for dinner.

581
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,721
You've been in the meeting
for four hours?

582
00:33:52,121 --> 00:33:54,121
It's hard on you. Great job!

583
00:33:54,521 --> 00:33:57,040
Miss Bai Qi has sacrificed yourself
to climb over the wall.

584
00:33:57,601 --> 00:33:59,280
I must devote myself
as a polite way to thank you.

585
00:34:03,601 --> 00:34:05,560
