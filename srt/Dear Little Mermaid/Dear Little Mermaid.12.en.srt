I won't give in.

50
00:03:03,341 --> 00:03:05,621
Mr. Su, we know that you're lying.

51
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,981
From where did you hear this rumor?

52
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,101
It's utter nonsense.

53
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,940
We also found out

54
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,381
that you signed an unfair deal
with Qin Ge

55
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,341
because you had been dismissed

56

from the company by your brother.

57
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,461
Mr. Su, you're really something.

58
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,381
It's an intellectual property
that worth tens of millions.

59
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,500
And you are trying to steal it from us.

60
00:03:34,821 --> 00:03:35,580
You...

61
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,220
You don't have to be that mean.

62
00:03:43,901 --> 00:03:44,741
To be honest,

63
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,580
I'm still trying to convince my brother.

64
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,580
But he's still angry with me

65
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,021
and won't listen to anything I say.

66
00:03:50,341 --> 00:03:52,021
I have no idea what to do now.

67
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,541
I really want to be the one
handling your project,

68
00:03:57,021 --> 00:03:58,541
but there's nothing I can do about it.

(It's our chance.)

70
00:04:05,821 --> 00:04:07,621
We have an idea.

71
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,981
Would you like to work with us?

72
00:04:09,101 --> 00:04:09,901
What is it?

73
00:04:10,101 --> 00:04:10,780
It's really simple.

74
00:04:12,341 --> 00:04:13,580
You'll be our assistant,

75
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:16,500
and we'll execute the plan.

76
00:04:16,821 --> 00:04:17,700
What did you say?

77
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,261
You'll be the assistant.

78
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,260
You spent so much time
walking with Lin Xuezhou

79
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,621
and this is the only information
you got. How disappointing.

80
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,941
You're not exactly right.

81
00:04:31,661 --> 00:04:33,580
I know what is the challenge
they're facing now.

82
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:35,661
They've got all the information
they need,

83
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,540
but they just don't have the chance
to meet the person in charge.

84
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:42,300
That's all they told me.

85
00:04:48,781 --> 00:04:49,661
I guess they were talking

86
00:04:49,941 --> 00:04:51,901
about Su Mu from Qianye Film & TV.

87
00:04:52,461 --> 00:04:54,700
Su Mu from Qianye Film & TV?

88
00:04:55,341 --> 00:04:56,501
I recall something.

89
00:04:56,781 --> 00:04:58,260
A few years ago,

90
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,341
Su Mu's father

91
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,501
did a stent surgery

92
00:05:00,741 --> 00:05:02,140
at the hospital my father worked in.

93
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,980
They're quite close.

94
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,341
Even until now,

95
00:05:06,461 --> 00:05:07,860
they still meet for tea quite often.

96
00:05:08,221 --> 00:05:10,621
Lu Tian, do you think Dr. Lu can help me

97
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,580
ask Su Mu out?

98
00:05:13,061 --> 00:05:14,461
Why do you want to ask him out?

99
00:05:15,661 --> 00:05:18,621
Are you really going to quit medicine
to become an artist?

100
00:05:18,741 --> 00:05:19,901
Do you want to make money
with your pretty face?

101
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,380
Of course, it is Qin Ge and Lin Xuezhou
who want to meet him.

102
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:24,700
And

103
00:05:26,021 --> 00:05:27,700
the meeting is going
to be a coincidence.

104
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,661
I got it.

105
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,300
We are truly

106
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,781
the men

107
00:05:34,621 --> 00:05:36,540
behind the successful women.

108
00:05:43,501 --> 00:05:44,380
All done.

109
00:05:44,741 --> 00:05:46,501
I told them they would be doing this
to help his future daughter-in-law.

110
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,901
They immediately got
everything arranged.

111
00:05:49,181 --> 00:05:51,380
I've sent you the time and the venue.

112
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,180
(Time: Noon the day after tomorrow
Venue: I'll send a location pin later)

113
00:05:59,341 --> 00:06:01,100
Su Mu has

114
00:06:01,621 --> 00:06:03,021
really expensive hobbies.

115
00:06:03,221 --> 00:06:04,820
How do I get close to him?

116
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,461
Are you still reading the documents?

117
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,181
By the way,

118
00:06:12,501 --> 00:06:14,221
there's a new tea room at the Old Steet.

119
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:15,580
Do you have time tomorrow afternoon?

120
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,621
Let's try it out tomorrow.

121
00:06:18,221 --> 00:06:19,021
But...

122
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,260
It's been a while since we went out
together last time.

123
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,860
(Fine. It won't take much time.)

124
00:06:24,221 --> 00:06:25,061
(Besides, it's hard to turn him down)

125
00:06:25,061 --> 00:06:26,820
(when he's staring at me like this.)

126
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,461
All right.

127
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,501
Only if you get the bill.

128
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,781
That's great.

129
00:06:34,941 --> 00:06:36,980
There might be a surprise for you
tomorrow afternoon.

130
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,260
(Qingchuan People's Hospital)

131
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,700
Dr. Lu.

132
00:06:43,621 --> 00:06:44,420
Dr. Lu.

133
00:06:45,741 --> 00:06:47,621
Dr. Lu, you look really vibrant today.

134
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,300
Are you going on a date?

135
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:50,901
I guess so.

136
00:06:51,061 --> 00:06:53,140
Procrastinator Bai and I
are going to do something big today.

137
00:06:53,221 --> 00:06:53,980
Something big?

138
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,580
What are you going to do?

139
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,260
Can you share it with us?

140
00:06:57,461 --> 00:06:58,621
Tell us.

141
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,741
I can't.

142
00:06:59,901 --> 00:07:02,221
This is a secret operation.

143
00:07:02,341 --> 00:07:03,181
A secret?

144
00:07:04,461 --> 00:07:05,420
It's about time.

145
00:07:05,901 --> 00:07:07,100
My parents are waiting for us.

146
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,100
The two of them...

147
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:23,941
You're palpitating.

148
00:07:24,061 --> 00:07:25,181
Have you been sleeping well?

149
00:07:25,341 --> 00:07:26,501
I've been sleeping quite well.

150
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,420
I'm just nervous to meet Dr. Bai.

151
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,980
Let's run a blood test tomorrow.

152
00:07:32,461 --> 00:07:33,181
You shouldn't use
the hospital's power socket

153
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,181
for personal use.

154
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,300
Otherwise, it'll cause a lot of troubles

155
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,580
during emergencies.

156
00:07:38,181 --> 00:07:39,100
You shouldn't move around

157
00:07:39,221 --> 00:07:40,461
the public amenities without permission.

158
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:43,221
You're suffering from hyperlipidemia.

159
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,580
You should avoid greasy and fried food,

160
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,461
or you might end up
with cardiovascular diseases.

161
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,260
I know. Coronary heart disease, right?

162
00:07:48,461 --> 00:07:49,540
If I'm really diagnosed
with coronary heart disease,

163
00:07:49,661 --> 00:07:50,700
I'll consult the cardiologist.

164
00:07:50,901 --> 00:07:52,061
You don't have to worry about it.

165
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,221
Cardiovascular disease

166
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,540
will not only
lead to coronary heart disease,

167
00:07:54,781 --> 00:07:57,140
but also arteriosclerosis,
cerebral embolism,

168
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,980
cerebral infarction,
myocardial ischemia,

169
00:07:59,221 --> 00:08:01,021
myocardial infarction, or heart failure.

170
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,501
There is a chance

171
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,221
from 60% to 90%

172
00:08:03,221 --> 00:08:04,061
that these diseases will cause death.

173
00:08:04,181 --> 00:08:04,941
Besides,
I'm the doctor in charge of your case.

174
00:08:05,021 --> 00:08:06,700
Your health is my responsibility.

175
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,501
Are you feeling any discomfort?

176
00:08:12,061 --> 00:08:14,100
Dr. Bai, my shoulders

177
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:18,820
have been hurting really badly
for the past two days. They're swollen.

178
00:08:19,501 --> 00:08:21,140
Can you give me a massage?

179
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,540
It's just a normal symptom.

180
00:08:22,661 --> 00:08:23,580
It can be solved by consuming
more lean meat and protein,

181
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,820
and controlling your salt intake.

182
00:08:26,501 --> 00:08:28,100
Procrastinator Bai,

183
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,300
you're quite two-faced.

184
00:08:29,741 --> 00:08:31,781
You're an expressionless doctor
in front of your patients,

185
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,540
but a friendly and easygoing guy
to Qin Ge.

186
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,341
However,

187
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:36,140
Qin Ge will definitely be moved,

188
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,181
after seeing what you've done for her.

189
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:38,941
Then,

190
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,700
you'll get yourself a girlfriend.

191
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,260
We'll be late

192
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,700
if you keep talking.

193
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,221
That's only because you insisted
on doing your ward rounds.

194
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:48,700
Let's go.

195
00:08:49,781 --> 00:08:50,781
All right. I got it.

196
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,301
Sure. Get here as soon as possible.

197
00:08:54,221 --> 00:08:55,461
Qin Ge said she would be here soon.

198
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,380
It's my fault.

199
00:08:57,901 --> 00:08:59,060
I should have told her earlier.

200
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,740
Hopefully, there won't be
any other issues

201
00:09:01,901 --> 00:09:03,060
with Dr. Lu and Su Mu.

202
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,060
Your worry just came true.

203
00:09:07,101 --> 00:09:08,421
Su Mu is leaving,

204
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:10,700
and my dad has
a last-minute consultation.

205
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,301
We don't have any excuse
to make them stay.

206
00:09:13,781 --> 00:09:14,820
Which room are they in?

207
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,421
The Taishan Room on the second floor.

208
00:09:18,301 --> 00:09:19,661
Qin Ge is not here yet. You can't do
anything even if you go there now.

209
00:09:19,901 --> 00:09:20,861
You'll stay here and wait for them.

210
00:09:21,101 --> 00:09:22,700
I'll figure a way to make them stay.

211
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:34,940
Xuezhou.

212
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,260
Where are you now?

213
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:36,981
I'm on my way.

214
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:38,861
I need to confess something.

215
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:39,861
Go ahead.

216
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,740
In fact, I asked my dad for a favor

217
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,341
and told him to ask Su Mu out today.

218
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,421
I wanted to create a chance
for you to run into him.

219
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,421
You?

220
00:09:47,781 --> 00:09:48,301
Yes.

221
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,981
I asked my dad and Su Mu out.

222
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,221
But they are leaving soon.

223
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,500
Procrastinator Bai is trying
to keep them around.

224
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,820
Sure. Thank you so much.

225
00:09:54,021 --> 00:09:55,421
I'll pick Qin Ge up now.

226
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,221
Hopefully, Bai Qijia can make them stay
a little longer.

227
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,500
I've got to go.

228
00:10:03,101 --> 00:10:04,060
Hi, Mr. Su.

229
00:10:07,461 --> 00:10:09,260
Dr. Lu asked me out today,

230
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,781
but refused to tell what happened
even when he was leaving.

231
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,740
It seems like someone wanted to
take advantage

232
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,500
of their relationship with Dr. Lu,
just so that they could meet me.

233
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,060
I'm quite impressed.

234
00:10:20,301 --> 00:10:22,700
You've found out everything
about my social circle.

235
00:10:23,021 --> 00:10:23,781
Have a seat.

236
00:10:24,981 --> 00:10:25,620
Thanks.

237
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,140
I'm so sorry, Mr. Su.

238
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,301
I only did this

239
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,021
because I had no other option.

240
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,421
What do you want?

241
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,500
Mr. Su,

242
00:10:35,781 --> 00:10:36,981
the author of Bubaiqi Plan

243
00:10:37,101 --> 00:10:38,221
is a good friend of mine.

244
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,421
She signed an option agreement
with Qianye Film & TV

245
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,781
for the adaptation of the comic
into a movie.

246
00:10:43,461 --> 00:10:46,380
However, she was recently informed
about the termination of the agreement.

247
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,421
Not only that, it was Mr. Su's decision
to terminate the agreement.

248
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,500
I simply want Mr. Su

249
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,740
to meet my friend this one time.

250
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,661
We've long informed the author

251
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,341
about the termination
of the option agreement.

252
00:10:56,901 --> 00:10:57,940
The board has discussed this project

253
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,301
during the meeting.

254
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:01,580
Someone else will be taking over
this project.

255
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,221
I won't be able to do anything for you.

256
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:05,861
Mr. Su.

257
00:11:06,341 --> 00:11:07,820
I know this might come off offensive,

258
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,661
but I still hope

259
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,301
that you can allow us some time

260
00:11:11,781 --> 00:11:12,820
to prove to you

261
00:11:13,021 --> 00:11:14,421
that you made the right decision.

262
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,661
My friend

263
00:11:16,981 --> 00:11:18,781
is very passionate about comics.

264
00:11:19,861 --> 00:11:21,620
You get to live a carefree
and unrestrained life

265
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:25,500
in comics.

266
00:11:26,021 --> 00:11:28,221
It's as if I was in a parallel universe.

267
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,341
How I wish I can stay
in the comic forever.

268
00:11:33,221 --> 00:11:35,620
But it's really tough
being a cartoonist.

269
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,940
Life itself is tough.

270
00:11:38,421 --> 00:11:39,781
Growing up

271
00:11:39,781 --> 00:11:40,981
is tough.

272
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,021
If there's something I enjoy doing,

273
00:11:43,301 --> 00:11:45,541
it's as if adding sugar to
a cup of black coffee.

274
00:11:45,901 --> 00:11:48,221
Meeting someone you like

275
00:11:48,461 --> 00:11:50,260
is like adding milk to the coffee.

276
00:11:51,301 --> 00:11:53,700
Family, friends,

277
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,341
the people you love
and the people who love you,

278
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,940
they're like milk froth.

279
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,341
Then, you'll get

280
00:12:00,461 --> 00:12:01,260
a cup of nice latte.

281
00:12:01,461 --> 00:12:03,221
No one thinks drinking
a cup of latte is tough.

282
00:12:04,021 --> 00:12:05,260
Do you mean we should
find joy in sorrows?

283
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:07,940
I guess so.

284
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:09,861
It's not exactly wrong.

285
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,421
Mr. Su,

286
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,580
I've read many interviews of yours.

287
00:12:14,981 --> 00:12:17,101
You appreciate it the most

288
00:12:17,301 --> 00:12:19,341
when the creators are passionate
about their own works.

289
00:12:19,981 --> 00:12:20,740
And my friend

290
00:12:20,901 --> 00:12:22,820
is that passionate creator.

291
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,661
The market has acknowledged

292
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,301
her talent.

293
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,260
He's there. Lu Tian!

294
00:12:44,861 --> 00:12:46,260
Go to the second floor.
The first room after a left turn.

295
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,461
It's up to you now.

296
00:12:47,661 --> 00:12:49,060
-Sure.
-Let's go now.

297
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:53,940
Mr. Su.

298
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,740
I hope you can reconsider this.

299
00:13:03,341 --> 00:13:04,021
Mr. Su.

300
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,021
She's the friend I mentioned just now.

301
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,781
Bai Qi, the author of the Bubaiqi Plan.

302
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:09,180
-Nice to meet you.
-She's Lin Xuezhou, the editor-in-chief.

303
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,101
Nice to meet you.

304
00:13:10,661 --> 00:13:11,740
They'd like to take this opportunity

305
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,580
to show you their perspective,

306
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,221
and find out what caused the failure

307
00:13:14,341 --> 00:13:15,221
of this project.

308
00:13:19,101 --> 00:13:19,901
Hi, Mr. Su.

309
00:13:20,021 --> 00:13:22,060
I'm Bai Qi, the author of Bubaiqi Plan.

310
00:13:22,781 --> 00:13:23,740
I'm not interested

311
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,260
in who you are.

312
00:13:26,981 --> 00:13:28,620
I think

313
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:30,861
there's no need

314
00:13:31,221 --> 00:13:33,101
to continue with the discussion
of this project.

315
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,140
Mr. Su.

316
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:36,260
I wonder

317
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,901
why you dislike our project so much.

318
00:13:38,101 --> 00:13:39,021
Our project obviously has

319
00:13:39,101 --> 00:13:40,661
a high market competency.

320
00:13:40,981 --> 00:13:43,021
We have invested a lot of manpower
and resources,

321
00:13:43,301 --> 00:13:44,180
and you just pulled out of the project
without warning.

322
00:13:44,341 --> 00:13:46,341
That is a fatal blow for us.

323
00:13:47,221 --> 00:13:48,620
What has happened has happened.

324
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,861
But we need closure.

325
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:51,981
She's right, Mr. Su.

326
00:13:52,861 --> 00:13:54,140
Young people.

327
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:57,661
You only saw the tip of the iceberg,
but you thought you knew everything

328
00:13:58,101 --> 00:13:59,060
and were capable of changing
the scenario.

329
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,541
Since you won't give up easily,

330
00:14:02,421 --> 00:14:04,180
I'll tell you what I think.

331
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,861
The main issue about this project

332
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,260
is the fact that the creators
are made up of a bunch of young people.

333
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,060
You're very passionate,

334
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,740
but you lack executive skills
and creativity.

335
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,180
I'm a businessman.

336
00:14:15,901 --> 00:14:17,101
I want all my investment

337
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,981
to be profitable.

338
00:14:19,221 --> 00:14:20,901
Do you still think it's necessary

339
00:14:21,021 --> 00:14:23,221
to show me your project?

340
00:14:27,221 --> 00:14:27,901
Mr. Su.

341
00:14:28,341 --> 00:14:29,620
I don't agree with you.

342
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,861
Experience and skills
are things we can earn over time.

343
00:14:32,221 --> 00:14:33,461
Please give us some time.

344
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,661
I promise you

345
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,620
that we'll come up with an amended plan

346
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,260
that will earn the market
and your confidence.

347
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,341
We won't change ourselves

348
00:14:41,461 --> 00:14:42,341
just to please the investors,

349
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:44,260
as that's not what creators do.

350
00:14:44,981 --> 00:14:46,620
However, we'll take in
everyone's opinions

351
00:14:46,781 --> 00:14:48,341
when we're creating our work
and try our best to strike a balance.

352
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:50,820
We'll never be a narrow-minded bunch.

353
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,620
I've met a lot of young people

354
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,580
like you.

355
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,700
You put your enthusiasm and dreams
before everything else.

356
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,700
We've talked enough.

357
00:15:04,661 --> 00:15:05,661
Let's end this here.

358
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,341
It's fine.

359
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,421
Mr. Su...

360
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:12,700
Let's go.

361
00:15:14,221 --> 00:15:14,901
Mr. Su...

362
00:15:17,421 --> 00:15:18,700
Don't pull a long face.

363
00:15:19,101 --> 00:15:20,901
I saw Su Mu leaving with a sullen face.

364
00:15:21,341 --> 00:15:22,421
Did you just blow the chance?

365
00:15:23,101 --> 00:15:23,940
Yes.

366
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,620
We're all done for.

367
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,301
I don't think so.

368
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,180
If Su Mu hasn't taken

369
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,580
anything you said into consideration,

370
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,421
he wouldn't have stayed until now.

371
00:15:32,781 --> 00:15:33,341
Yes.

372
00:15:33,661 --> 00:15:34,421
Mr. Su

373
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:36,140
has made it very clear just now.

374
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,341
He simply hates it when people
give empty promises.

375
00:15:38,781 --> 00:15:41,140
Our success now depends on the man

376
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:42,981
who affects him the most.

377
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,901
Are you talking

378
00:15:46,101 --> 00:15:46,981
about Su Lun?

379
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,500
Yes.

380
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,740
I've sent a text to Su Lun.

381
00:15:51,861 --> 00:15:52,981
He would show his brother
his determination

382
00:15:53,101 --> 00:15:55,301
the moment his brother
arrives at the office.

383
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,541
I think there's a very high chance

384
00:15:57,101 --> 00:15:59,820
that Mr. Su will change his mind.

385
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,260
Do you have a backup plan?

386
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,541
Of course.

387
00:16:03,901 --> 00:16:05,221
It's a series of stratagems.

388
00:16:05,341 --> 00:16:06,781
Do you think you're the only one
with a plan?

389
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:11,021
Xuezhou, you're amazing.

390
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,981
I was already feeling hopeless.

391
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,620
I've even decided
to take up all the responsibility

392
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,060
in front of Xia Chuyun.

393
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,461
I don't want to drag you into this.

394
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:19,620
Don't worry.

395
00:16:19,901 --> 00:16:22,180
I said this when we signed the contract.

396
00:16:22,301 --> 00:16:24,661
I'll bring you to the peak,

397
00:16:24,781 --> 00:16:26,180
and show you the best landscape.

398
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,740
I gave you my words,

399
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,421
and I'll fulfill my promises.

400
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:30,820
We'll do it together.

401
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:34,461
I won't be able to enjoy any of those
without you by my side.

402
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,380
I need a hug too.

403
00:16:42,221 --> 00:16:43,620
You have to do this, Su Lun.

404
00:16:43,901 --> 00:16:44,940
Don't talk back.

405
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,101
Don't upset him.

406
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,101
Don't upset him.

407
00:16:47,221 --> 00:16:49,541
Never upset him.

408
00:16:51,341 --> 00:16:52,101
Su Mu.

409
00:16:53,101 --> 00:16:54,021
What brought you here?

410
00:16:54,341 --> 00:16:56,060
I was too bored at home,

411
00:16:56,221 --> 00:16:57,661
so I decided to drop by
and pay you a visit.

412
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,620
Quit the act.

413
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,620
You were the one
who sent the two girls

414
00:17:05,781 --> 00:17:06,901
from Fingertip Comics to me, right?

415
00:17:08,981 --> 00:17:11,541
Do you think I'll fall for that?

416
00:17:11,941 --> 00:17:13,181
You told a few young people,

417
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,380
who are of a similar age as you,
to come to me.

418
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:15,901
Do you think they'll be able
to convince me?

419
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,541
That's not true, Su Mu.

420
00:17:18,901 --> 00:17:21,140
The comics market has been on the rise
for the past few years.

421
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,541
People are exploring

422
00:17:22,661 --> 00:17:24,021
different genres and themes.

423
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,380
We can't always solve our problems

424
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,581
with the conventional way.

425
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,421
Besides,

426
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:30,941
you've always approved

427
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,500
of Bai Qi Studio's previous works.

428
00:17:32,901 --> 00:17:34,500
You took back your words

429
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,860
just because someone said
something baseless to you.

430
00:17:36,821 --> 00:17:38,620
That doesn't make much sense, right?

431
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,301
Interesting.

432
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,701
Fine.

433
00:17:43,901 --> 00:17:46,380
Since you look genuinely confident
with their works,

434
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,380
let's make a bet.

435
00:17:48,661 --> 00:17:49,701
If you're able to come up
with a new proposal

436
00:17:49,901 --> 00:17:50,941
within a week,

437
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,620
while they submit an amended work

438
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,460
and allow a professional team
to rate it.

439
00:17:55,781 --> 00:17:57,620
If they can hit a score of 85 and above,

440
00:17:57,821 --> 00:17:58,581
I will believe

441
00:17:58,701 --> 00:18:00,500
that you're capable
of handling this project.

442
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,581
Really?

443
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,701
It's a deal.

444
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,740
You're the best,

445
00:18:06,181 --> 00:18:07,140
Su Mu.

446
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,021
It's a deal, Su Mu.

447
00:18:10,181 --> 00:18:11,421
I'll get going.

448
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,301
Bye!

449
00:18:12,661 --> 00:18:13,581
Bye!

450
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,660
(Su Lun)

451
00:18:29,661 --> 00:18:31,340
Bai Qi, I've spoken to my brother.

452
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,701
I'm in charge of the project again.

453
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,260
I'll get someone
to amend the proposal right away.

454
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,980
I'll send you the new content tonight.

455
00:18:38,941 --> 00:18:40,421
That's great.

456
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,061
We'll be awaiting good news tonight.

457
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:43,661
Bye.

458
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,781
That's great.

459
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,220
Bai Qijia, you're amazing.

460
00:18:55,421 --> 00:18:57,460
You're not only a good doctor,

461
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,860
but also a skillful negotiator.

462
00:19:00,021 --> 00:19:01,140
I'll never call you the simple-minded

463
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,860
but smart student again.

464
00:19:03,061 --> 00:19:04,661
This is just one of the factors.

465
00:19:05,421 --> 00:19:06,740
Most importantly, you moved Su Mu

466
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,781
with your passion for comics.

467
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,301
After all,

468
00:19:09,901 --> 00:19:12,140
Mr. Su is someone who cares a lot
about content.

469
00:19:12,581 --> 00:19:14,620
It was definitely your works
that moved him.

470
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,581
All right. I'll talk to you again.

471
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,140
I need to go back to the office

472
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,301
and report this to the manager.

473
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,021
Xuezhou, let me come with you.

474
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,781
We can have dinner together later.

475
00:19:27,181 --> 00:19:29,421
Fine. I'll give you a chance.

476
00:19:31,421 --> 00:19:32,301
Procrastinator Bai,

477
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,701
this is a good opportunity

478
00:19:33,941 --> 00:19:34,901
for you to fish for some compliments.

479
00:19:35,021 --> 00:19:35,980
Take this opportunity
to improve your relationship.

480
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,301
-I got it.
-I'll get going.

481
00:19:37,901 --> 00:19:38,860
Xuezhou, wait for me.

482
00:19:39,301 --> 00:19:41,781
It feels like I've missed something.

483
00:19:44,581 --> 00:19:45,541
I know what I missed.

484
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,581
I haven't told Min about this.

485
00:19:51,421 --> 00:19:53,701
Min, I've convinced Su Mu.

486
00:19:54,701 --> 00:19:57,220
All thanks to Bai Qijia and Lu Tian
who asked him out.

487
00:19:58,581 --> 00:20:00,421
When I get more information from Su Lun
tonight,

488
00:20:00,421 --> 00:20:01,500
I'll share more with you.

489
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,661
All done.

490
00:20:04,021 --> 00:20:05,140
What should we do next?

491
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:06,661
Go home and get some sleep.

492
00:20:06,821 --> 00:20:08,220

They're too disgusting.

Yes.

506
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,140
That's too disgusting.

507
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,620
-How could they do that?
-How could they?

508
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,380
Exactly.

509
00:21:14,781 --> 00:21:16,100
I would've said it out if I were them.

This is too disgusting.

What was the disgusting thing
you were talking about?

I'm talking about Mad Eye Comics.

517
00:21:25,421 --> 00:21:27,260
The way they handle their jobs
is really disgusting.

518
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,181
They have significantly lowered
the standard of local comics.

519
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,340
Don't you agree?

Yes. I always think

521
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,460
Mad Eye Comics have gone overboard.

don't take it personally.

we can turn a bike into a motorbike.

a bottle of mineral water?

660
00:29:33,941 --> 00:29:34,781
Bai Qijia.

661
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,260
I hereby announce

662
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,260
that from today on,

663
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,581
you'll officially be my boyfriend.

664
00:29:43,901 --> 00:29:45,220
During your tenure,

665
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,701
reflect on yourself twice a day
and stay away from all the scandals.

666
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,740
Make sure to keep your distance
from other girls.

667
00:29:51,301 --> 00:29:52,500
Do you agree with that terms?

668
00:29:52,941 --> 00:29:53,821
I do.

669
00:29:54,421 --> 00:29:55,260
Congratulations.

670
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,661
You can now give

671
00:29:57,781 --> 00:30:00,140
an official hug to your girlfriend.

672
00:30:08,781 --> 00:30:09,460
Qin Ge.

673
00:30:10,821 --> 00:30:11,581
Thanks

674
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,260
for making me your boyfriend.

675
00:30:48,421 --> 00:30:49,140
Professor.

676
00:30:51,781 --> 00:30:52,460
Sure.

677
00:30:53,781 --> 00:30:54,701
I'll be right there.

678
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,541
What happened?

679
00:30:57,421 --> 00:30:58,581
There's an emergency case
in the hospital.

680
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:59,620
They need me there now.

681
00:31:00,541 --> 00:31:02,500
Go ahead. I can go home myself.

682
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,781
Stay at home and wait for me.

683
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,701
I said I would wait for him
to come home.

684
00:32:29,541 --> 00:32:30,740
Why are you here?

685
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,260
Didn't I tell you to go to bed first?

686
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,421
I was waiting for you to come home.

687
00:32:34,581 --> 00:32:35,340
Have a seat.

688
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,380
It's almost dawn.

689
00:32:37,661 --> 00:32:38,860
You need to go to bed early.

690
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:41,821
What happened?

691
00:32:42,181 --> 00:32:43,100
Bai Qijia.

692
00:32:43,821 --> 00:32:45,980
You look bothered.

693
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,500
Nothing can bother me. I'm fine.

694
00:32:49,661 --> 00:32:50,500
You don't look fine.

695
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,701
Tell me what happened.

696
00:32:54,301 --> 00:32:57,100
I was invited to
an inter-provincial meeting tomorrow,

697
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,740
but I turned down the offer.

698
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,661
Why?

699
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,740
Because I have to be away for a month,

700
00:33:06,021 --> 00:33:07,460
and I don't want to leave you alone.

701
00:33:08,061 --> 00:33:10,140
I'm not a girl who'll drag you down.

702
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,701
I'm 26 years old this year.

703
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:12,821
I've been

704
00:33:12,821 --> 00:33:14,740
taking good care of myself
over the years.

705
00:33:15,541 --> 00:33:16,421
Yes, you have.

706
00:33:16,821 --> 00:33:18,980
You just somehow ended up in a hospital.

707
00:33:28,181 --> 00:33:28,941
Fine.

708
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,301
I made a mistake.

709
00:33:30,421 --> 00:33:31,140
I shouldn't have said that.

710
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,061
Don't be sad.

711
00:33:32,181 --> 00:33:33,021
Don't cry.

712
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,500
Don't be mad at me.

713
00:33:38,541 --> 00:33:40,541
I'm not mad at you.

714
00:33:41,581 --> 00:33:44,140
I think I'm dragging you down.

715
00:33:44,541 --> 00:33:46,220
I don't want to be a burden to you.

716
00:33:50,541 --> 00:33:52,181
You'll never be a burden to me.

717
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,460
You're my sunshine

718
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:59,021
that lights up my life,

719
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,260
and gives me strength.

720
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:04,541
Trust me.

721
00:34:04,901 --> 00:34:06,340
I can take care of myself.

722
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,380
You will do

723
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,701
whatever you want to do.

724
00:34:11,301 --> 00:34:12,220
You have my words.
