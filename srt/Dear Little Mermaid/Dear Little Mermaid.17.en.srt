for your continuous support

00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,080
that I've turned from a junior editor
to a senior editor.

00:01:55,279 --> 00:01:56,319
One last question.

23
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:57,800
Do you

24
00:01:57,919 --> 00:01:59,040
have anything to say

25
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,959
to your fans?

I hope you will

never give up on love and hope.

28
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,559
Just like what I'd said in Bubaiqi,

29
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,519
you must persevere in pursuing

Come. Let's have a look.

00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:16,399
Okay.

36
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,919
Miss Bai Qi, you're really amazing.

37
00:02:21,279 --> 00:02:22,919
We've practiced the questions

38
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,479
that the members
of the fan club may ask.

Your emotional management is in place.

40
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:27,839
There's basically no problem.

41
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,600
After all, I've participated

42
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,759
in many online fans meetings.

43
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:35,119
This is only a trivial matter.

44
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,080
But there's a problem.

45
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:43,119
You've not confessed
the truth to Xuezhou, right?

46
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,039
I think you have
to tell her sooner or later.

47
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:47,800
If not, it will explode

48
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,440
like a thunderbolt.

49
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,160
I've been so at ease these few days

50
00:02:56,279 --> 00:02:57,360
that I've forgotten about it.

52
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:19,160
Enough. Calm down.

53
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:21,759
Xuezhou has been
in a good mood these few days.

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,039
She'll understand it.

55

Just tell her amicably.

56
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,679
Don't be nervous.

57
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:26,960
I'm scared.

58
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:28,559
Don't be scared.

59
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,639
I'm so pissed!

I'll beat up those from Mad Eye
whenever I see them.

62
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,160
What's wrong, Xuezhou?
Who pissed you off?

63
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,080
This morning,

64
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:47,080
Mad Eye Comics
issued an attorney's letter

65
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,240
to Qianye Film & TV.

66
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,679
It said as Chen Min

67
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:51,199
already left Fingertip Comics,

68
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:53,119
the copyright fee for Bubaiqi Plan

69
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,600
and the profits from its related games

70
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,639
should be paid to Chen Min accordingly.

71
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:00,679
Min is after the money.

72
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,839
It's not unreasonable.

73
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,960
No way!

74
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,479
Chen Min was an employee
of our company.

75
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,080
Did the company award him
with only few bonus

76
00:04:09,279 --> 00:04:10,880
and project commissions?
He received a reasonable amount!

77
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:12,880
You were the only one involved

78
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,240
from the conception to the completion
of Bubaiqi Plan.

79
00:04:14,559 --> 00:04:15,360
Chen Min didn't even

80
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,639
fulfill the requirements
of a main creator.

81
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,279
Why should I pay him?

82
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
How about

83
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,440
we pay him some service fees?

84
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,000
How should we calculate the ratio then?

85
00:04:27,679 --> 00:04:28,480
If other employees

86
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,799
put forth similar requests,

87
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,239
should I agree to all of them?

88
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,600
Then, Mad Eye Comics

89
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,359
will interfere

90
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:35,200
with our collaboration
with Qianye Film & TV, won't they?

91
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,119
We've invested hundreds of millions

92
00:04:37,119 --> 00:04:38,239
in Bubaiqi Plan's movie
and drama integration.

93
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,040
Do you know how many people

94
00:04:39,119 --> 00:04:40,359
want to share this pie?

95
00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:41,559
If you want to show kindness

96
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:43,160
and help the poor,

97
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:44,600
then please help me first.

98
00:04:46,239 --> 00:04:47,600
I'm sorry. So sorry.

99
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,000
I was brusque.

100
00:04:49,559 --> 00:04:51,600
Business matters
are too complicated for me.

101
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,799
I don't understand it.

102
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:54,119
Fine.

103
00:04:59,119 --> 00:05:00,399
I'm telling you
that it has been a long while

104
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:02,600
since I've reasoned
with others in person.

105
00:05:04,559 --> 00:05:05,480
Qin Ge, this matter

106
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,640
isn't related to your content.

107
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,239
Just focus on your live broadcast
with peace of mind.

108
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:13,000
Trashy Mad Eye Comics,
you all are doomed!

109
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,239
I'm suddenly interested to know

110
00:05:26,239 --> 00:05:28,399
what role Chen Min plays in this.

111
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,480
In fact, it's understandable.

112
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,239
He sees from a different position now.

113
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:36,720
It will appear odd if we continue

114
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:38,119
to be amicable.

115
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:40,279
What I'm most afraid of now

116
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,239
is that Chen Min is being used
by the interested party.

117
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,920
Well, that's his own choice.

118
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,279
When I was with Mad Eye Comics,

119
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:50,880
I'd even brought disgrace
on my own head too.

120
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,160
You're not allowed to go in.

121
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,839
Get off!

(Mad Eye Comics)

123
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,040
Why did you issue

124
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,600
an attorney's letter
to Qianye Film & TV?

125

Isn't this what you've requested?

126
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,239
What's the problem here?

127
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,760
I just wanted to have my name

128
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,200
credited beside Qin Ge's,

129
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,320
as one of the main creators
of Bubaiqi Plan.

130
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:14,600
I wanted to build a milestone

before changing my career.

132
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,640
But what are these terms for?

133
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,720
Let me tell you.

134
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,720
I'm not your money-making machine.

135

Firstly,

136
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,440
these terms reflect

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,359
what will happen

138

after your requests have been fulfilled.

139

Secondly,

140
00:06:29,679 --> 00:06:30,600
stop putting forth

150

such a mad thing.

151
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,640
He must have been used by others.

152
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,200
It's his intention
that caused him to be used.

153
00:07:02,559 --> 00:07:03,920
Take this opportunity to see clearly

154
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,880
what kind of person Chen Min is.

155
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,279
From now on, let's stay away

156
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,359
from him.

My dear sisters, don't worry.

158
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,480
Am I the type of person

159
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,839
who will secretly cry in the corner?

160
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,040
Instead of feeling entangled,

161
00:07:15,359 --> 00:07:17,040
why don't we grab some good food

162
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,320
to relieve our worries?

163
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,880
Fried chicken!

164

Don't move. You're under arrest.

Stop fooling around.

166
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,760
I still have something
to deal with here. Stop fooling around.

I'll take them.

Dr. Lu has a good boyfriend charm.

I've never experienced

It's Dr. Bai who is the true idol.

You're living like the heroine
in idol dramas.

202
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,400
Have you ever seen
any idol dramas' heroines

in idol dramas?

207

It makes sense too.

00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:56,440
Well, the studio encounters
so many issues.

Miss Bai Qi, don't be upset.

I can't help you

333
00:14:41,599 --> 00:14:44,000
and fulfill my promise to you seriously.

334
00:14:44,599 --> 00:14:46,440
By the way, I've written many things

335
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:48,760
in the Wish Notebook you gave me.

336
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,880
When I'm discharged,

337
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:51,520
I'll definitely fulfill
all of my wishes once.

338
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,320
You can do it.

339
00:14:53,479 --> 00:14:54,520
We'll fulfill them together.

340
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,919
Okay. Take a good rest.

341
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:00,960
I won't disturb you.

342
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:02,719
I'm going home to prepare

343
00:15:02,719 --> 00:15:04,520
a little surprise for Bai Qijia.

344
00:15:08,359 --> 00:15:09,039
I'm leaving.

345
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:10,320
Bye.

346
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,440
Bye.

347
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:21,840
(Since you're very busy,
I'll leave first.)

348
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,520
(And)

349
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,400
(I already knew about Yue Qiqi.)

350
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,239
(I'll wait for you
to explain yourself tonight.)

351
00:15:31,719 --> 00:15:32,880
You've got some food there.

352
00:15:33,479 --> 00:15:34,159
Let me see.

353
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,159
Don't touch.

354
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,880
Qin Ge bought them for me.

355
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:39,640
Get it downstairs yourself
if you want to eat.

356
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,919
So stingy.

357
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,640
It's the first time Qin Ge came
to find me at the hospital.

358
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:51,320
But I was all tied up at work.

359
00:15:51,479 --> 00:15:53,039
By the time I was done,
she'd already gone.

360
00:15:53,359 --> 00:15:54,039
And

361
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:55,520
she knew

362
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,159
Qiqi's condition had worsened.

363
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,960
You're done for now.

364
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,880
You'll sleep at the door tonight.

365
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:03,760
I'll do anything to mollify her.

366
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,000
Can't believe that the day has come

367
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,080
for our cool prince charming.

368
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,799
But your happy life

369
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,039
will vanish soon.

370
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,679
How shallow of you.

371
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:16,280
This isn't something shallow.

372
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,960
This is the public truth

373
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,440
in wooing a girl.

374
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,359
But you've lost

375
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:23,200
the chance to practice the truth.

376
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:25,479
Because girls hate being deceived

377
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,640
and neglected

378
00:16:27,359 --> 00:16:28,359
the most.

379
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:42,679
I'm back.

380
00:16:46,599 --> 00:16:47,400
So sorry.

381
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,960
I have so much work
at the hospital today.

382
00:16:49,119 --> 00:16:50,000
I didn't mean to. So...

383
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,359
I don't want to hear your explanation.

384
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,159
Obviously, you don't have me
in your eyes

385
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,440
and heart.

386
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:55,280
It's not that.

387
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,159
Look at

388
00:16:56,479 --> 00:16:57,799
how I am now.

389
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
You don't even want to give me a hug.

390
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,799
I'm sorry. So sorry.

391
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:04,520
Get up. Stop hugging me.

392
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,559
Did I ask you to explain yourself?
Why did you hug me then?

393
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,320
Well...

394
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,560
I didn't mean to keep it from you.

395
00:17:11,719 --> 00:17:12,800
I'm afraid you'd be worried

396
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,119
and it would affect your emotions.

397
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,119
I don't want to listen.

398
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:18,880
I don't want to listen to your
explanation. All these are excuses.

399
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,800
These are not excuses.

400
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,520
I don't want to listen
to your explanation.

401
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:24,599
Listen.

402
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,079
That's because you don't have me
in your eyes and heart.

403
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,599
You don't care about me at all.

404
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,439
You don't think of me at all.

405
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:32,920
It's so hard on me. I feel so aggrieved.

406
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,880
I...

407
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,719
All right. Don't cry.

408
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,959
It's all my fault.

409
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,439
I promise I won't do it again.

410
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,520
Don't cry.

411
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:45,560
You don't look beautiful when you cry.

412
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,239
So be it.

413
00:17:48,199 --> 00:17:49,400
Don't cry.

414
00:17:50,239 --> 00:17:51,400
I'm sorry.

415
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,359
What is this?

416
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,079
I'll stop pretending.

417
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,319
Every word you said matches the template

418
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,640
of an apology from a straight man.

419
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,400
You feigned it!

420
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,599
You're not angry at me at all?

421
00:18:23,199 --> 00:18:24,439
No.

422
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,479
I'm magnanimous,

423
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,000
not petty-minded.

424
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:29,400
You gave me a fright.

425
00:18:29,719 --> 00:18:31,280
Don't do this again, okay?

426
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:34,079
I'm sorry.

427
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,760
It's just

428
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,560
a small prank.

429
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,199
I want you to know

430
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:42,920
that you must not keep
anything from me again.

431
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,040
I'll shoulder

432
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,040
everything with you.

433
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,479
I understand.

434
00:18:49,199 --> 00:18:51,280
I won't do this again.

435
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,640
This matter has turned around.

436
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:57,520
I've prepared

437
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,800
a real surprise for you.

438
00:18:59,079 --> 00:18:59,880
What is it?

439
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:03,119
It can comfort
your wounded little heart.

440
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:04,119
Come on. Follow me.

441
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:04,959
What is it?

442
00:19:05,439 --> 00:19:06,119
Follow me.

443
00:19:10,479 --> 00:19:12,400
Little Orange remotely taught me

444
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:14,000
how to make these.

445
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,199
You cooked all these yourself?

446
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,160
Let me try.

447
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,199
Try it and see if it's good.

448
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,439
How is it?

449
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,760
Delicious.

450
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:30,239
I indeed have extraordinary talent.

451
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,359
Eat more if it's good.

452
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,079
Okay.

453
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:43,520
I think there is

454
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,640
something more important to do now.

455
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:46,680
What is it?

456
00:19:48,199 --> 00:19:49,479
Are you going to work overtime again?

457
00:19:52,479 --> 00:19:54,400
What are you doing? It's dinner time.

458
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,599
Be patient.

459
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,520
My dear Miss Bai Qi,

460
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,800
didn't you promise me

461
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,479
to appear spirited
during the live broadcast?

462
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,040
Why did you stay up so late again?

463
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,719
Well, it's just some household matters.

464
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:17,000
What kind of household matter is it?
Need any help?

465
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:17,959
No need!

466
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,800
Kid, why are you so nosy?

467
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:21,160
Yelling at me?

468
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,359
How's the preparation?

469
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,800
Let me remind you that there will be

470
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,000
a Q&A session later.

471
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:28,000
If you are

472
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,439
unsure of the answers,

473
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,040
send me a signal with your eyes, okay?

474
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:32,800
Don't worry.

475
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,959
All the world's a stage. And all the men
and women are merely players.

476
00:20:35,719 --> 00:20:36,920
Besides, my fans love me so much.

477
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,959
They won't make things difficult for me.

478
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,520
Let's get started then.

479
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,439
Okay.

480
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:43,359
Miss Bai Qi, here we go.

481
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,280
Three, two, one.

482
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:46,199
Action.

483
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,439
Hello, everybody.

484
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,199
I'm Bubaiqi's creator, Bai Qi.

485
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,479
This is my masterpiece.

486
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:56,079
Welcome to my live broadcast

487
00:20:56,239 --> 00:20:57,079
and share it with me.

488
00:20:57,199 --> 00:20:57,839
Here,

489
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,599
firstly, I'd like to thank
my editor-in-chief,

490
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,119
Lin Xuezhou.

491
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,479
Miss Lin Xuezhou,

492
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,520
and my editorial assistant, Tian Cheng.

493
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,640
And my team at the studio.

494
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,760
Because without them,

495
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,880
I wouldn't be able to create

496
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,439
and share with you

497
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,800
such a sweet comic,

498
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,439

00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:22,599
All right. I'll be right there.

663
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:32,599
Little Orange, where's Qin Ge?

664
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:34,599
Dr. Bai, you're finally home.

665
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:36,719
Miss Bai Qi said she wanted to be alone.

666
00:29:36,959 --> 00:29:38,839
She has been locking herself
in her room.

667
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,079
I'll take a look at her.

668
00:29:40,239 --> 00:29:41,719
Xuezhou asked me to return
to the office for work.

669
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:42,479
I'll get going then.

670
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:44,160
Okay. Stay safe.

671
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,160
Qin Ge!

672
00:30:01,959 --> 00:30:03,199
Qin Ge, are you tired?

673
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,880
Are you hungry?

674
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,160
I'll cook something for you.

675
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,680
Qin Ge!

676
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,599
Qin Ge, open the door!

677
00:30:14,239 --> 00:30:14,920
Qin Ge!

678
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,599
Qin Ge.

679
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,599
What's wrong?

680
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:41,160
What's wrong?

681
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,920
Bai Qijia.

682
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,599
Am I useless?

683
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,239
You're not.

684
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:55,640
I can't draw anything now.

685
00:30:58,119 --> 00:30:59,959
When I picked up my paintbrush,

686
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,680
I kept hearing

687
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:05,479
those voices.

688
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,520
I can't draw anything now.

689
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,160
I really can't draw anything now.

690
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,479
All right. Don't cry.

691
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,800
Give me your phone. Let's not read them.

692
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,280
Don't cry.

693
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:29,520
Everything will be fine.

694
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,760
Everything will be fine.

695
00:31:34,439 --> 00:31:36,479
Am I useless?

696
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,880
You're not.

697
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:41,479
My long-time friend,

698
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,959
Min, has left me too.

699
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,119
Everything will be fine.

700
00:31:47,719 --> 00:31:49,119
My fans...

701
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,520
They also think that I've deceived them.

702
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:58,239
I think I've disappointed them.

703
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:03,359
I can't draw anything now.

704
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:04,760
It won't happen.

705
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,640
I'm so useless.

706
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:12,199
I don't know what I should do now.

707
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,599
Don't bother about what they said.

708
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,199
They don't even understand you.

709
00:32:21,199 --> 00:32:23,280
Besides, you still have me, right?

710
00:32:23,439 --> 00:32:24,640
I'll be by your side.
Everything will be fine.

711
00:32:24,959 --> 00:32:25,880
Don't cry.

712
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:27,760
Everything will be fine.

713
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,760
Everything will be fine.

714
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:36,040
Don't cry.

Take care of Qin Ge first.
