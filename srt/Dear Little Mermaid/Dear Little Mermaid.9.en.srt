Min and I worked overnight

58
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:44,947
You turned me down twice yesterday.

59
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:46,906
I thought it was because

60
00:03:46,987 --> 00:03:48,067
I painted you into a corner.

61
00:03:49,026 --> 00:03:49,826
Little did I know,

62
00:03:50,587 --> 00:03:52,026
you were hiding something from me.

63
00:04:01,266 --> 00:04:02,666
I heard that those amendments

64
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,507
contradict your will
of creating the work.

65
00:04:05,147 --> 00:04:06,707
Why do you force yourself to do so?

66
00:04:07,386 --> 00:04:08,826
I have my reasons.

67
00:04:12,707 --> 00:04:14,626
I didn't want you to worry about me
working all night.

68
00:04:14,746 --> 00:04:15,867
That's why I didn't tell you.

69
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:18,227
Please don't tell Xuezhou, okay?

70
00:04:18,507 --> 00:04:20,546
Why did you amend the content
without telling us?

71
00:04:22,906 --> 00:04:24,346
Qiqi told me before

72
00:04:24,786 --> 00:04:27,587
that your comics are well-known

73
00:04:27,826 --> 00:04:28,867
because your readers

74
00:04:28,867 --> 00:04:30,226
are being encouraged

75
00:04:30,307 --> 00:04:31,187
by your passion for comics.

76
00:04:31,707 --> 00:04:32,867
But, if you draw

77
00:04:32,946 --> 00:04:34,386
something you don't like,

78
00:04:34,587 --> 00:04:35,867
what will your readers

79
00:04:36,747 --> 00:04:38,027
think about you?

80
00:04:40,027 --> 00:04:41,826
Bai Qijia, I appreciate your concern.

81
00:04:42,066 --> 00:04:42,666
However, can you please

82
00:04:42,747 --> 00:04:44,427
not comment on my work?

83
00:04:45,187 --> 00:04:46,627
I'm not commenting on your work.

84
00:04:46,627 --> 00:04:47,867
-I'm just reminding you...
-I don't need it.

85
00:04:50,307 --> 00:04:52,066
You have no idea what I want.

86
00:04:52,867 --> 00:04:53,707
Please go back.

87
00:04:54,467 --> 00:04:55,506
Didn't you say

88
00:04:55,747 --> 00:04:57,546
everyone should be brave
to express their ideas?

89
00:04:57,946 --> 00:04:58,627
But why

90
00:04:58,627 --> 00:05:00,187
have you lost your courage?

91
00:05:01,826 --> 00:05:02,666
Past is past.

92
00:05:02,786 --> 00:05:04,506
No one can ever live in the past.

93
00:05:05,826 --> 00:05:07,027
What do you mean?

94
00:05:11,266 --> 00:05:12,147
Bai Qijia.

95
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:14,546
I've finally realised

96
00:05:15,826 --> 00:05:17,907
that it's different between something
you like and you're familiar with.

97
00:05:19,307 --> 00:05:21,346
The one you're familiar with and like

98
00:05:21,427 --> 00:05:22,867
was me in the past,

99
00:05:23,386 --> 00:05:24,627
not the current me.

100
00:05:29,346 --> 00:05:30,307
Please leave now.

101
00:06:02,147 --> 00:06:03,066
Dr. Bai.

102
00:06:03,867 --> 00:06:05,427
Did you quarrel with Qin Ge?

103
00:06:06,106 --> 00:06:07,467
You should've stopped Qin Ge.

104
00:06:08,266 --> 00:06:09,987
So, there's a difference
between you and me.

105
00:06:10,266 --> 00:06:11,187
Does she have to like it

106
00:06:11,307 --> 00:06:12,546
because you think it's suitable for her?

107
00:06:13,307 --> 00:06:14,867
I think the one
who stays by her side till the end

108
00:06:15,106 --> 00:06:15,907
would be me.

109
00:06:30,946 --> 00:06:32,826
I'm so speechless, Dr. Bai.

110
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:36,266
You know very well that Guru Bai Qi
cares for her readers the most

111
00:06:36,587 --> 00:06:38,066
and yet you used it to criticise her.

112

Aren't you stressing her?

113

Well.

115
00:06:46,066 --> 00:06:48,946
How can I help her?

116
00:06:52,106 --> 00:06:54,707
I have an idea.

117
00:06:55,467 --> 00:06:56,386
But,

118
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,187
what's your reason for helping her?

119
00:06:59,027 --> 00:07:01,147
I don't wish her to do things

120
00:07:01,266 --> 00:07:02,666
that upset her.

121

You're her reader.

122

You don't wish your idol

123

to do something she dislikes, right?

124
00:07:11,427 --> 00:07:12,427
Of course.

125
00:07:12,907 --> 00:07:15,467

00:09:19,586 --> 00:09:21,106
Who registered this for Qin Ge?

169
00:09:21,706 --> 00:09:22,387
Her readers.

170
00:09:22,507 --> 00:09:24,106
Guru Bai Qi's luck took a positive turn

171
00:09:24,226 --> 00:09:25,346
and entered the top ten in the ranking.

172
00:09:25,507 --> 00:09:27,187
That's great. Record the data

173
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:28,187
and put it into our presentation.

174
00:09:28,346 --> 00:09:29,627
I'm calling Su Lun right now.

175
00:09:29,747 --> 00:09:30,906
We've turned the table.

176
00:09:32,187 --> 00:09:33,187
Great.

177
00:09:55,867 --> 00:09:56,786
Min.

178
00:09:57,466 --> 00:09:58,226
Boss.

179
00:09:58,867 --> 00:09:59,906
Crisis averted.

180
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:02,427
Take a look at your fan group chat.

181
00:10:12,226 --> 00:10:13,307
Golden Comic Awards?

182
00:10:15,427 --> 00:10:16,827
I can't believe

183
00:10:17,267 --> 00:10:18,706
someone uses a real name.

184
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:22,387
Bai Qijia.

185
00:10:23,427 --> 00:10:24,987
I've finally realised

186
00:10:26,307 --> 00:10:28,427
that it's different between something
you like and you're familiar with.

187
00:10:29,867 --> 00:10:31,906
The one you're familiar with and like

188
00:10:32,026 --> 00:10:33,466
was me in the past,

189
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:35,026
not the current me.

190
00:10:51,346 --> 00:10:52,387
I was

191
00:10:53,226 --> 00:10:54,346
so mean.

192
00:11:12,346 --> 00:11:14,267
Thank you for voting for me.

193
00:11:14,786 --> 00:11:16,666
I'm so sorry about what I said to you.

194
00:11:17,187 --> 00:11:19,786
I was too angry but I didn't mean that.

195
00:11:20,987 --> 00:11:21,906
Come in first.

196
00:11:29,187 --> 00:11:29,827
Have a seat.

197
00:11:40,307 --> 00:11:41,666
Why do you smirk?

198
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:46,706
I'm so sorry.

199
00:11:47,466 --> 00:11:49,387
I was venting my anger on you.

200
00:11:49,947 --> 00:11:51,106
I'm to be blamed instead.

201
00:11:51,906 --> 00:11:54,146
I shouldn't stay up late to work
and keep that from you.

202
00:11:54,586 --> 00:11:55,827
Besides, I shouldn't get you wrong

203
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,947
and be spiky to you.

204
00:11:58,267 --> 00:11:59,067
What else?

205
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:00,466
What else?

206
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:03,226
Do you think it's enough
by just apologising?

207
00:12:03,427 --> 00:12:05,067
It's insincere.

208
00:12:07,867 --> 00:12:10,786
(Man, it turns out
you're seeking affection.)

209
00:12:26,267 --> 00:12:28,346
I'm sorry, it's my fault.

210
00:12:28,546 --> 00:12:30,627
Can you please forgive me?

211
00:12:32,546 --> 00:12:34,106
Kiss me then.

212
00:12:35,146 --> 00:12:36,466
Don't you go too far.

213
00:12:42,867 --> 00:12:44,427
Alright. I'll call it quits.

214
00:12:44,546 --> 00:12:45,867
Sit down.

215
00:12:49,507 --> 00:12:50,267
Qin Ge.

216
00:12:50,987 --> 00:12:52,747
I want you to know

217
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:55,346
that whether you're the high school girl
eight years ago

218
00:12:55,747 --> 00:12:57,427
or Guru Bai Qi,

219
00:12:59,867 --> 00:13:01,146
you're always

220
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,106
my unique Qin Ge.

221
00:13:04,466 --> 00:13:05,146
I understand

222
00:13:05,627 --> 00:13:06,427
that you're working so hard

223
00:13:06,546 --> 00:13:08,507
for the sake of those you cherish.

224
00:13:09,226 --> 00:13:11,507
Xuezhou and your readers

225
00:13:12,067 --> 00:13:13,507
are your driving force.

226
00:13:16,867 --> 00:13:18,666
However, I wish

227
00:13:18,906 --> 00:13:19,747
I'm one of them too.

228
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,346
So, please be honest with me

229
00:13:21,346 --> 00:13:22,507
when something similar

230
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:23,947
happens to you again.

231
00:13:24,546 --> 00:13:27,627
Please let me be the first one
to stay by your side.

232
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:30,106
Okay?

233
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,720
(Warm reminder: Only one patient is permitted.
Please don't enter if it's occupied.)

234
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,026
Are your eyes getting any better?

235
00:13:48,307 --> 00:13:51,627
Of course. I almost lost vision
in one eye.

236
00:13:52,827 --> 00:13:54,106
Let's eat something before you leave.

237
00:14:10,106 --> 00:14:11,346
I've asked Bai Qijia

238
00:14:11,546 --> 00:14:14,226
and he said you like the Cantonese food
in this restaurant.

239
00:14:22,106 --> 00:14:24,026
Well, I'll take a bite then.

240
00:14:24,307 --> 00:14:25,106
But, it's far from what you should do

241
00:14:25,226 --> 00:14:26,906
to make it up to me.

242
00:14:30,307 --> 00:14:31,627
I'm wrong.

243
00:14:32,026 --> 00:14:33,987
However, I didn't mean to hurt you.

244
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:37,987
Tell me, what should I do
to ask for your forgiveness?

245
00:14:39,706 --> 00:14:40,747
How about this?

246
00:14:41,187 --> 00:14:43,706
You put on the traditional wedding dress

247
00:14:43,867 --> 00:14:44,706
for me.

248
00:14:45,146 --> 00:14:46,466
I'm sure

249
00:14:46,827 --> 00:14:48,026
you're pretty in that dress.

250
00:14:50,546 --> 00:14:52,546
How dare you raise this again?

251
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,120
(Bai Qijia)

252
00:15:09,586 --> 00:15:11,586
Min, I can't access this hard disk.

253
00:15:11,747 --> 00:15:13,106
Please help me to retrieve
the information.

254
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:15,346
Sure.

255
00:15:16,507 --> 00:15:17,346
What's wrong with you?

256
00:15:17,627 --> 00:15:19,067
Guru Bai Qi has overcome
the challenges.

257
00:15:19,307 --> 00:15:20,987
But you don't seem to be happy.

258
00:15:22,226 --> 00:15:23,307
I am happy.

259
00:15:24,067 --> 00:15:26,307
I'm just concerned about

260
00:15:26,466 --> 00:15:27,987
what had befallen her recently.

261

(Tian Cheng)

262
00:15:41,827 --> 00:15:43,747
Chen Min, I'm outside.

263
00:15:45,786 --> 00:15:46,867
Outside?

264
00:15:47,106 --> 00:15:48,627
Yes, if you don't come out,

265
00:15:48,627 --> 00:15:49,706
I'll go to your office now.

266
00:15:50,466 --> 00:15:52,706
Don't move. I'm coming.

267
00:15:53,987 --> 00:15:55,307
Impressive, Little Orange.

268
00:15:55,466 --> 00:15:56,987
I can't believe you found him.

269
00:15:57,187 --> 00:15:58,507
You've finally met the man

270
00:15:58,627 --> 00:16:00,026
you've been obsessed with for so long.

271
00:16:00,507 --> 00:16:01,146
Of course.

272
00:16:01,387 --> 00:16:01,906
Well, enough.

273
00:16:01,987 --> 00:16:03,026
Today, I'll show you

274
00:16:03,146 --> 00:16:04,106
the real Chen Min.

275
00:16:04,267 --> 00:16:05,906
However, you better not scare him.

276
00:16:06,106 --> 00:16:06,747
Alright.

277
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,040
(Bubaiqi Plan)

278
00:16:10,026 --> 00:16:10,947
Is that him?

279
00:16:14,546 --> 00:16:15,987
-He's handsome.
-Yeah.

280
00:16:24,507 --> 00:16:25,346
Chen Min.

281
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:26,627
Chen Min.

282
00:16:26,827 --> 00:16:27,827
They're my friends

283
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:28,987
and they want to meet you.

284
00:16:29,586 --> 00:16:30,466
Miss Tian.

285
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,226
I was too silly

286
00:16:32,346 --> 00:16:34,987
to be frightened by
your ridiculous reason last time.

287
00:16:35,346 --> 00:16:37,307
I'm totally clueless about
what you want from me.

288
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:38,546
However,

289
00:16:39,026 --> 00:16:40,867
I'd like to cut myself off

290
00:16:40,987 --> 00:16:42,307
from a capricious lady

291
00:16:42,427 --> 00:16:43,827
who was born with a silver spoon.

292
00:16:43,987 --> 00:16:45,947
Besides, regarding the compensation,

293
00:16:46,067 --> 00:16:48,226
please send me your bank account number.

294
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:50,466
I won't owe you a single cent
in compensation.

295
00:16:55,427 --> 00:16:56,947
I didn't mean to tease him.

296
00:16:58,466 --> 00:16:59,666
Why is he mad at me?

297
00:17:05,187 --> 00:17:06,987
Stop taking photos or
I'll take your phone.

298
00:17:28,306 --> 00:17:29,106
Are you awake?

299
00:17:29,306 --> 00:17:30,507
Do you feel better from the cold?

300
00:17:33,027 --> 00:17:34,946
It's a high tendency to catch a cold
when seasons change.

301
00:17:35,106 --> 00:17:36,346
Besides, you always neglect
the doctor's advice

302
00:17:36,706 --> 00:17:38,346
and mess up your sleep schedule.

303
00:17:39,867 --> 00:17:43,306
Alright, Procrastinator Bai.

304
00:17:43,987 --> 00:17:44,867
Only if you really listen.

305
00:17:45,346 --> 00:17:46,547
I have no shift this afternoon.

306
00:17:46,907 --> 00:17:48,667
I'll go and watch you finish your lunch.

307
00:17:49,306 --> 00:17:51,106
By the way, stop learning from Lu Tian.

308
00:17:52,346 --> 00:17:53,226
Alright,

309
00:17:53,747 --> 00:17:55,747
Dr. Procastinator.

310
00:17:57,586 --> 00:17:58,267
I raise an objection.

311
00:17:58,547 --> 00:17:59,747
You're bullying a single man.

312
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:01,466
Also,

313
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:03,186
why do both you and Qin Ge catch a cold
at the same time?

314
00:18:03,306 --> 00:18:04,186
What have you done?

315
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:09,106
Are you going to a conference?

316
00:18:09,706 --> 00:18:10,507
No.

317
00:18:10,667 --> 00:18:12,027
There's no conference recently.

318
00:18:12,147 --> 00:18:13,586
I'll stay at Qin Ge's place
these two days.

319
00:18:13,706 --> 00:18:15,186
She needs someone to look after her.

320
00:18:15,826 --> 00:18:17,226
But, does Qin Ge know

321
00:18:17,226 --> 00:18:18,426
that you'll stay at her home?

322
00:18:19,147 --> 00:18:20,267
She will know.

323
00:18:20,586 --> 00:18:22,466
You're really something,
Procrastinator Bai.

324
00:18:22,586 --> 00:18:23,507
I think she'll soon

325
00:18:23,627 --> 00:18:25,027
win over her heart.

326
00:18:25,226 --> 00:18:26,547
From your mouth to God's ear.
By the way,

327
00:18:27,066 --> 00:18:28,186
if you dare teach Qin Ge

328
00:18:28,186 --> 00:18:29,106
nonsense,

329
00:18:29,226 --> 00:18:30,466
I'll have a chat with Xuezhou

330
00:18:30,586 --> 00:18:31,946
about your splendid love history.

331
00:18:32,106 --> 00:18:33,987
Please don't. What have I done again?

332
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:47,106
(What's going on now?)

333
00:18:48,267 --> 00:18:49,787
(Someone breaks into the house?)

334
00:18:58,987 --> 00:18:59,787
No way.

335
00:19:01,066 --> 00:19:02,466
King Bai is outside.

336
00:19:10,226 --> 00:19:12,306
Qin Ge, are you inside here?

337
00:19:15,826 --> 00:19:16,987
One second.

338
00:19:20,747 --> 00:19:22,667
You scared me.

339
00:19:23,466 --> 00:19:24,627
Wait, how come you know

340
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:25,867
the passcode?

341
00:19:26,787 --> 00:19:27,907
I was worried
that you might still be sleeping,

342
00:19:28,027 --> 00:19:29,147
so, I didn't ring the doorbell.

343
00:19:29,787 --> 00:19:31,306
Your previous passcode
was your birthday.

344
00:19:31,466 --> 00:19:32,547
I got it right with just one try.

345
00:19:34,787 --> 00:19:37,346
Are you going on a business trip?

346
00:19:38,507 --> 00:19:40,507
From today onwards, I stay here

347
00:19:40,667 --> 00:19:43,627
and take great care of you.

348
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:45,306
This...no, you can't.

349
00:19:45,987 --> 00:19:47,186
You aren't allowed to move in here

350
00:19:47,346 --> 00:19:48,826
without my permission.

351
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:49,907
I, unilaterally, make this decision

352
00:19:49,987 --> 00:19:51,946
and it has come into force.
This is not up for debate.

353
00:19:53,267 --> 00:19:55,346
You work like a horse and
always forget to eat and rest.

354
00:19:55,747 --> 00:19:57,147
It's better to have a doctor

355
00:19:57,306 --> 00:19:58,147
to take care of you.

356
00:19:58,306 --> 00:19:59,147
Do you know

357
00:19:59,267 --> 00:20:00,627
this's every family's dream?

358
00:20:01,027 --> 00:20:02,147
This is outrageous.

359
00:20:02,346 --> 00:20:03,306
I'm a grown-up

360
00:20:03,387 --> 00:20:05,106
and I can take care of myself.

361
00:20:05,826 --> 00:20:06,586
A grown-up?

362
00:20:07,267 --> 00:20:08,507
Grown-ups won't neglect

363
00:20:08,627 --> 00:20:10,346
their body and health

364
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:12,106
and make others worry.

365
00:20:12,387 --> 00:20:13,507
Bai Qijia.

366
00:20:13,826 --> 00:20:15,147
I'm suspecting

367
00:20:15,387 --> 00:20:16,907
that you insist to move in here

368
00:20:17,826 --> 00:20:19,226
with an evil intention.

369
00:20:21,106 --> 00:20:23,387
I do have an intention,
but it's not evil.

370
00:20:24,907 --> 00:20:26,387
I'm really worried about you.

371
00:20:32,027 --> 00:20:32,826
Whatever.

372
00:20:37,147 --> 00:20:38,747
I'll take this room then.

373
00:20:43,507 --> 00:20:44,267
Boss.

374
00:20:45,106 --> 00:20:45,907
Get the door for me.

375
00:20:46,106 --> 00:20:47,426
I've brought you something.

376
00:20:52,147 --> 00:20:52,787
Why are you here?

377
00:20:52,907 --> 00:20:53,586
I'm going to stay here

378
00:20:53,706 --> 00:20:55,306
to take care of Qin Ge.

379
00:21:05,946 --> 00:21:06,667
Thank you.

380
00:21:11,066 --> 00:21:12,867
I'm the one

381
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:14,466
who looks after Boss's daily life.

382
00:21:14,987 --> 00:21:17,226
Don't worry about this, Dr. Bai.

383
00:21:19,426 --> 00:21:20,946
Qin Ge doesn't need

384
00:21:21,226 --> 00:21:23,787
a butler who micromanages her life,

385
00:21:23,946 --> 00:21:25,826
but someone who understands her.

386
00:21:26,267 --> 00:21:27,306
Min.

387
00:21:27,507 --> 00:21:28,066
Qin Ge.

388
00:21:28,226 --> 00:21:29,267
You're finally here.

389
00:21:29,826 --> 00:21:30,867
Give him some help.

390
00:21:31,267 --> 00:21:32,306
-Let me help you.
-Boss.

391
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:33,507
No need.

392
00:21:33,907 --> 00:21:36,667
You're a pampered lady who doesn't cook.

393
00:21:36,946 --> 00:21:38,747
I can handle these groceries.

394
00:21:44,027 --> 00:21:46,346
I'm just wondering
about tonight's dinner.

395
00:21:46,867 --> 00:21:47,907
Speaking of dinner,

396
00:21:48,186 --> 00:21:50,267
I'll prepare pasta
from my special recipe.

397
00:21:50,627 --> 00:21:52,987
Very good. I always approve of
your cooking.

398
00:21:53,147 --> 00:21:56,426
Of course. No one knows you better
than I do.

399
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:58,907
Well, I'm hungry too.

400
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:00,346
Please cook my share too.

401
00:22:01,106 --> 00:22:02,907
Min, prepare more.

402
00:22:03,027 --> 00:22:03,787
We can share it.

403
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:04,627
That's right.

404
00:22:06,186 --> 00:22:06,907
Just leave it to him.

405
00:22:07,066 --> 00:22:08,586
We go rest first. Don't disturb him.

406
00:22:09,547 --> 00:22:10,106
-Come on.
-Perhaps

407
00:22:10,226 --> 00:22:11,147
you need our help?

408
00:22:11,387 --> 00:22:12,306
Boss, go and rest.

409
00:22:12,987 --> 00:22:13,867
I can handle this.

410
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:15,466
Yes. Let's leave.

411
00:22:15,627 --> 00:22:16,267
You can do it.

412
00:22:16,466 --> 00:22:17,066
Can you?

413
00:22:17,186 --> 00:22:18,027
He sure can.

414
00:22:18,306 --> 00:22:20,027
You should give him a hand.

415
00:22:20,106 --> 00:22:20,747
He sure can handle this.

416
00:22:20,826 --> 00:22:21,787
Come on, sit down.

417
00:22:21,867 --> 00:22:23,186
What's wrong with you?

418
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,426
Don't you say anything ridiculous

419
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:29,907
before Min.

420
00:22:30,106 --> 00:22:32,066
You'll affect my glorious image

421
00:22:32,066 --> 00:22:33,186
in front of the employee.

422
00:22:34,946 --> 00:22:37,466
No worries. You know me well.

423
00:22:37,627 --> 00:22:38,787
I'm not the kind

424
00:22:38,946 --> 00:22:40,627
who provokes others.

425
00:22:40,907 --> 00:22:41,706
Are you sure about that?

426
00:22:42,066 --> 00:22:43,066
Of course.

427
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:48,706
I thought you were that kind of person,
aren't you?

428
00:22:48,987 --> 00:22:49,627
No.

429
00:22:49,987 --> 00:22:50,507
I mean it.

430
00:22:50,507 --> 00:22:51,706
Just admit it.

431
00:22:52,426 --> 00:22:53,106
Boss.

432
00:22:53,586 --> 00:22:54,627
It just strikes my mind

433
00:22:54,946 --> 00:22:57,346
that we have to rehearse
for the book signing event

434
00:22:57,507 --> 00:22:58,387
two days later.

435
00:22:59,387 --> 00:23:00,426
Besides,

436
00:23:01,306 --> 00:23:04,027
I saw a recruitment notice

437
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:05,867
on our website.

438
00:23:06,147 --> 00:23:08,346
Boss, why didn't you tell me?

439
00:23:08,907 --> 00:23:09,627
Well,

440
00:23:09,867 --> 00:23:11,226
Xuezhou proposed this.

441
00:23:11,387 --> 00:23:12,306
She said

442
00:23:12,426 --> 00:23:13,507
we're getting busier

443
00:23:13,627 --> 00:23:15,306
and we need manpower.

444
00:23:16,747 --> 00:23:18,186
But, no worries.

445
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:22,066
You're always my best partner.

446
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:23,907
-Certainly.
-No one can replace you.

447
00:23:24,147 --> 00:23:25,066
That's right.

448
00:23:26,186 --> 00:23:26,867
Something's burnt.

449
00:23:26,867 --> 00:23:27,586
Are you alright?

450
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:28,946
Are you alright?

451
00:23:29,547 --> 00:23:30,667
Your pasta. Hurry up.

452
00:23:30,667 --> 00:23:31,826
My pasta.

453
00:23:32,987 --> 00:23:33,586
Check it out.

454
00:23:33,586 --> 00:23:34,306
Don't move.

455
00:23:34,426 --> 00:23:35,306
Don't bother him. Sit down.

456
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:37,387
Let's read what is written on it.

457
00:24:05,426 --> 00:24:06,306
Min.

458
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:11,147
It's late now.

459
00:24:11,306 --> 00:24:13,147
You may go home to rest.

460
00:24:13,586 --> 00:24:14,907
Erm...We still have time

461
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:16,346
before the draft submission.

462
00:24:17,946 --> 00:24:19,787
I'll finish this soon.

463
00:24:20,387 --> 00:24:21,627
Anyway, if I finish this late,

464
00:24:21,747 --> 00:24:22,826
I can sleep here

465
00:24:23,106 --> 00:24:24,186
like before.

466
00:24:35,706 --> 00:24:39,667
But, Dr. Bai stays here too.

467
00:24:40,066 --> 00:24:43,066
I have only one mattress.

468
00:24:43,787 --> 00:24:45,226
Ask Dr. Bai to go back then.

469
00:24:45,507 --> 00:24:47,747
He isn't helpful to us anyway.

470
00:24:48,106 --> 00:24:49,426
I'll order a taxi for him, Boss.

471
00:24:50,147 --> 00:24:51,387
Instead, I think Assistant Chen

472
00:24:51,507 --> 00:24:52,747
should go back.

473
00:24:53,267 --> 00:24:55,186
You've been working long hours.

474
00:24:55,346 --> 00:24:56,346
Qin Ge needs to rest.

475
00:24:56,507 --> 00:24:57,907
Healthy matters the most.

476
00:24:58,106 --> 00:25:00,387
This is advice
from a professional doctor.

477
00:25:03,387 --> 00:25:03,987
Dr. Bai.

478
00:25:04,106 --> 00:25:05,826
We're about to wrap up,

479
00:25:05,987 --> 00:25:07,466
you may go back and rest.

480
00:25:08,147 --> 00:25:09,987
You live nearby, you can go back first.

481
00:25:10,106 --> 00:25:11,106
If you stay here,

482
00:25:11,226 --> 00:25:12,426
you'll disturb Qin Ge to get rest.

483
00:25:12,627 --> 00:25:13,987
Am I right? You better leave now.

484
00:25:14,066 --> 00:25:14,627
Your work

485
00:25:14,627 --> 00:25:15,867
can't be finished tonight,

486
00:25:15,946 --> 00:25:17,106
you can continue it at your home.

487
00:25:17,186 --> 00:25:17,907
Alright? Leave.

488
00:25:17,987 --> 00:25:18,747
Hold on.

489
00:25:22,267 --> 00:25:23,586
Forget it. Continue your discussion.

490
00:25:28,867 --> 00:25:29,667
Dr. Bai.

491
00:25:30,267 --> 00:25:31,267
Enough.

492
00:25:31,586 --> 00:25:32,787
I've warned you

493
00:25:33,027 --> 00:25:34,267
not to mess up Qin Ge's life

494
00:25:34,387 --> 00:25:35,547
and disturb her.

495
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:36,987
Why should I listen to you?

496
00:25:37,186 --> 00:25:38,226
Is that because you're

497
00:25:39,027 --> 00:25:42,147
her younger brother who's not registered
in the household registration permit?

498
00:25:46,826 --> 00:25:48,346
Xuezhou.

499
00:25:48,867 --> 00:25:50,346
I beg of you.

500
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,426
Please take the two of them away.

501
00:25:53,147 --> 00:25:54,946
My shabby house can't accommodate

502
00:25:55,066 --> 00:25:56,946
these two distinguished guests.

503
00:25:58,867 --> 00:26:01,346
You're having your feet in two boats.

504
00:26:01,547 --> 00:26:03,826
A cold prince charming
and a clear-cut young man.

505
00:26:05,507 --> 00:26:07,027
I envy you.

506
00:26:07,586 --> 00:26:09,466
Hey, don't be absurd.

507
00:26:09,826 --> 00:26:10,547
Oh, please.

508
00:26:10,547 --> 00:26:11,946
Please help me.

509
00:26:12,507 --> 00:26:15,226
Cut that out. You're not the only woman
around Min.

510
00:26:15,826 --> 00:26:17,867
So, think about your choice carefully.

511
00:26:18,547 --> 00:26:20,147
Does Min have a lot of admirers?

512
00:26:21,186 --> 00:26:22,066
That's important.

513
00:26:23,267 --> 00:26:25,426
Xuezhou, what's wrong with your face?

514
00:26:28,706 --> 00:26:31,787
I have excess heat in my body and
I'm too busy to take care of my skin.

515
00:26:32,186 --> 00:26:34,106
It's going to turn serious.

516
00:26:34,267 --> 00:26:35,586
Be careful or it'll leave scars
on your face.

517
00:26:36,267 --> 00:26:38,106
By the way, you can seek help
from Lu Tian.

518
00:26:38,507 --> 00:26:40,147
Isn't he a dermatologist?

519
00:26:40,466 --> 00:26:41,466
Mind your own business.

520
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:43,507
I...

521
00:26:44,826 --> 00:26:45,907
I roll my eyes too.

522
00:27:02,186 --> 00:27:03,267
-Leave now.
-I won't leave.

523
00:27:03,466 --> 00:27:04,706
-Leave now.
-No.

524
00:27:04,907 --> 00:27:06,027
-Leave now.
-No.

525
00:27:06,147 --> 00:27:06,946
Stop it.

526
00:27:08,027 --> 00:27:09,627
Both of you are bickering like the kids.

527
00:27:10,027 --> 00:27:11,387
It's okay for you to stay here,

528
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:12,507
but you have to sleep together.

529
00:27:12,706 --> 00:27:14,267
If not, please leave together.

530
00:27:15,306 --> 00:27:16,027
-No.
-No.

531
00:27:16,907 --> 00:27:17,586
The house isn't big.

532
00:27:17,706 --> 00:27:18,946
If you keep on making noise,

533
00:27:19,147 --> 00:27:20,667
I'll chuck you out.

534
00:27:23,586 --> 00:27:24,466
My blanket.

535
00:27:24,586 --> 00:27:25,267
This is mine.

536
00:27:25,267 --> 00:27:26,826
Qin Ge prepared this bed for me.

537
00:27:26,946 --> 00:27:28,147
She bought this for me.

538
00:27:28,267 --> 00:27:29,346
-Get out.
-Get out.

539
00:27:29,466 --> 00:27:30,387
-Get out here.
-Leave.

540
00:27:30,387 --> 00:27:32,586
-Get lost.
-Get lost.

541
00:27:32,586 --> 00:27:33,867
-Leave this room.
-Get out.

542
00:27:33,987 --> 00:27:36,426
What are you up to? Fighting again?

543
00:27:37,706 --> 00:27:38,547
-No, we didn't.
-No, we didn't.

544
00:27:40,987 --> 00:27:42,147
Drink some warm water and sleep.

545
00:27:42,267 --> 00:27:43,267
Stop fighting.

546
00:27:47,987 --> 00:27:50,106
-She gave this.
-Give it to me.

547
00:27:52,267 --> 00:27:53,226
Your skin

548
00:27:53,346 --> 00:27:54,226
will be scalded.

549
00:27:54,346 --> 00:27:55,387
-I'm fine.
-You're not fine.

550
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:56,627
You better rinse away the heat
in the bathroom.

551
00:27:56,787 --> 00:27:58,547
Stop shedding crocodile tears for me.

552
00:27:58,547 --> 00:28:00,106
I'm worried about you.

553
00:28:00,627 --> 00:28:01,826
What are you doing?

554
00:28:03,426 --> 00:28:04,346
Please continue.

555
00:28:15,987 --> 00:28:17,226
Why haven't you slept yet?

556
00:28:18,306 --> 00:28:19,586
Aren't you the same?

557
00:28:23,867 --> 00:28:26,387
I think I have to sleep
in the living room tonight.

558
00:28:28,147 --> 00:28:29,267
It's strange.

559
00:28:29,706 --> 00:28:32,027
Min is a friendly man though.

560
00:28:32,147 --> 00:28:33,507
Perhaps both of you are at loggerheads
with each other.

561
00:28:33,627 --> 00:28:35,426
He loses control once he sees you.

562
00:28:38,387 --> 00:28:39,586
Both of you are too annoying

563
00:28:39,706 --> 00:28:40,787
and have worn me out.

564
00:28:41,147 --> 00:28:43,346
It's going to be a sleepless night.

565
00:28:45,826 --> 00:28:47,106
Do you need me to put you to bed?

566
00:28:47,306 --> 00:28:48,466
I'm the doctor who...

567
00:28:49,826 --> 00:28:50,586
Bai Qijia...

568
00:28:51,066 --> 00:28:52,547
I have a serious problem

569
00:28:52,667 --> 00:28:53,946
to discuss with you.

570
00:28:54,747 --> 00:28:55,346
Go ahead.

571
00:28:55,907 --> 00:28:57,946
After the complaint incident,

572
00:28:58,066 --> 00:28:59,547
I've been thinking about making

573
00:28:59,667 --> 00:29:00,586
a comic about doctors.

574
00:29:00,867 --> 00:29:03,147
But, I'm not sure about
the characters...

575
00:29:03,667 --> 00:29:04,507
I wonder...

576
00:29:05,267 --> 00:29:06,066
Don't wake him up.

577
00:29:07,147 --> 00:29:08,466
Let's discuss this in your room.

578
00:29:09,946 --> 00:29:11,867
What was the question

579
00:29:12,066 --> 00:29:12,946
you wanted to ask me just now?

580
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,586
It's about the complaint incidence.

581
00:29:16,706 --> 00:29:18,507
I'm planning to draw a comic
about doctors.

582
00:29:18,627 --> 00:29:20,106
However, I can't decide

583
00:29:20,226 --> 00:29:22,267
on my main characters.

584
00:30:04,387 --> 00:30:05,706
Bai Qijia, you...

585
00:30:07,027 --> 00:30:08,667
Qin Ge's sleeping. Keep your voice down.

586
00:30:08,826 --> 00:30:09,507
You're horrible.

587
00:30:09,586 --> 00:30:11,387
How come you came out
from Qin Ge's room?

588
00:30:11,586 --> 00:30:13,267
I find that you're strange.

589
00:30:13,586 --> 00:30:15,346
I'm wooing Qin Ge sincerely

590
00:30:15,507 --> 00:30:16,867
and she doesn't dislike me either.

591
00:30:17,027 --> 00:30:18,426
Why are you indignant?

592
00:30:25,987 --> 00:30:27,106
Bai Qijia.

593
00:30:34,547 --> 00:30:35,346
My goodness.

594
00:30:35,706 --> 00:30:37,667
You mean you were supposed to sleep
with Chen Min in the same room?

595
00:30:37,987 --> 00:30:39,667
However, you were actually staying
with Qin Ge the whole night.

596
00:30:39,867 --> 00:30:41,066
You were busy.

597
00:30:41,547 --> 00:30:43,027
You always talk nonsense

598
00:30:43,027 --> 00:30:43,907
and have no logic.

599
00:30:44,027 --> 00:30:45,667
This is the symptom of an airhead.

600
00:30:45,867 --> 00:30:46,987
Yes, that's why I befriend

601
00:30:47,066 --> 00:30:48,267
a sarcastic man like you.

602
00:30:48,627 --> 00:30:49,547
Speaking of which,

603
00:30:49,627 --> 00:30:51,426
you squattered in her house
for one whole night,

604
00:30:51,787 --> 00:30:52,987
how impervious of you.

605
00:30:53,106 --> 00:30:54,027
You too.

609

who got beaten whenever you see her,

610
00:31:03,867 --> 00:31:04,667
I wonder

611
00:31:04,667 --> 00:31:06,547
how long will it take to get Qin Ge.

612
00:31:12,627 --> 00:31:14,147
Got beaten whenever I see her.

613

Got beaten whenever I see her.

614
00:31:20,346 --> 00:31:21,466
Cut down on your drinking for some time.

615
00:31:21,667 --> 00:31:23,106
Alcohol can lead to acne breakouts.

-Thank you, doctor.
-You're done.

617

Why are you here?

There are some infections on my face.

No problem.

629
00:32:17,787 --> 00:32:18,426
Do it gently.

How long will it take?

631
00:32:19,987 --> 00:32:22,186
I have a meeting with Qin Ge later.

Don't move.

Get the medicine from the dispensary.

If possible, don't touch them.

00:33:37,787 --> 00:33:38,907
Let's have lunch together.

667
00:33:39,027 --> 00:33:40,027
It's on me, alright?

668
00:33:40,346 --> 00:33:41,267
Oh my goodness.

669
00:33:41,787 --> 00:33:42,706
Please spare me.

670
00:33:42,826 --> 00:33:45,027
I beg of you. Stop pestering me.

671
00:33:45,267 --> 00:33:47,306
We just met a few times.
Do we know each other well?

672
00:33:49,147 --> 00:33:51,147
I'm occupied with work. I got to go now.

673
00:33:55,586 --> 00:33:57,706
But, I've known you many years ago.

674
00:34:00,667 --> 00:34:02,627
You're a grown-up now.

675
00:34:02,946 --> 00:34:04,667
Why are you still wearing
like a little girl?

676
00:34:04,987 --> 00:34:06,867
Your drawing skill doesn't improve
at all.

677
00:34:07,306 --> 00:34:09,346
How can I possibly

678
00:34:09,426 --> 00:34:10,907
put you in the company?

679
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:12,867
Could you please be mature?

680
00:34:16,507 --> 00:34:17,666
I don't care about your company.

681
00:34:18,067 --> 00:34:19,787
I'm not a natural at drawing.

682
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:22,347
What an ill-fate

683
00:34:22,666 --> 00:34:23,946
to have such an uncle.

684
00:34:56,466 --> 00:34:57,866
Your drawing is good.

685
00:34:58,466 --> 00:34:59,587
Why did you throw it?

686
00:35:10,547 --> 00:35:11,347
Cheer up.

687
00:35:11,866 --> 00:35:14,267
You've been through so much.
Don't give up.

I can finally

691
00:35:46,666 --> 00:35:47,987
be with you this time.
