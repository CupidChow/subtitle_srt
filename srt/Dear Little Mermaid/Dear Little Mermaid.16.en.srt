I've told you this before.

Starting from my first sole comic
until now,

147
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,880
I've been focusing on the romance theme.

I'm very clear about my strength.

However, judging from

the click rate of romance comics

155

is way lower than fantasy comics.

156
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,840
It's because the comics
aren't appealing enough,

157
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,960
not because of
the target audience population.

Bubaiqi Plan has once become
an internet phenomenon

This is a strong proof.

But, Bubaiqi Plan

162

it'd be better to choose

166

a more secure theme.

how could we outshine the others?

170
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:43,119
Besides,

171
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,639
I'm confident to create

172
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:46,800
a more brilliant comic
than Bubaiqi Plan.

173
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,639
And I believe

174
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:50,879
that if all people in the circle

175
00:08:50,999 --> 00:08:52,040
flock for the same theme at once,

176
00:08:52,319 --> 00:08:53,480
the golden period of that theme

177
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,879
would end very soon.

178
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,920
On the contrary, those uncommon themes

179
00:08:57,199 --> 00:08:58,800
are more likely to get into
the public eyes.

180
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,199
-True.
-Sounds reasonable.

181
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,360
Since Chen Min has his own direction,

182
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,679
everyone shall act in concert

183
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,360
towards his proposal.

184
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:15,079
Well, work out the script first.

185
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,720
Alright.

186
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,400
Young lad, how arrogant of you.

187
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:20,519
You just haven't dealt

188
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,759
with my uncle.

189
00:09:24,119 --> 00:09:24,999
Little Orange.

190
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:28,199
What is wrong with you?

191
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,480
Why are you here?

192
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,079
Stand right there.

193
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,160
Why are you hiding there?

194
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:36,240
Come here.

195
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,519
Who's she?

196
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:40,400
I don't know

197
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:43,720
Let me introduce her to you.

198
00:09:44,199 --> 00:09:47,240
She's my niece, Tian Cheng.

199
00:09:47,439 --> 00:09:48,119
Put that down.

200
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,119
Currently, she's a final year student
at the fine arts academy

201
00:09:52,319 --> 00:09:53,360
and she's about to complete her studies.

202
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,720
She'll join the company
after her graduation.

203
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,960
Hopefully, you'll look out for her.

204
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,119
Please.

205
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:01,999
Nonsense.

206
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,160
When did I agree to join the company?

207
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,879
I'm now working for another company.

208
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:06,999
I'll never come to

209
00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:08,400
such a place where one has to give up
their passion and dream.

210
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:10,480
What nonsense are you talking about?

211
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:11,920
I...

212
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:15,840
My apologise, everyone.

213
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:30,600
Min.

214
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,360
I don't mean to keep that from you all.

215
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:34,720
Because I fear
that you'd look down on me.

216
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,319
Do you hear me?

217
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:40,600
So, what's your intention

218
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:41,679
infiltrating Bai Qi Studio

219
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:43,199
while concealing your true identity

220
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,360
from the others?

221
00:10:44,999 --> 00:10:46,600
I've told you this.

222
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,639
I like you and
I want to come closer to you.

223
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,960
I hide my identity from you

224
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,999
because I'm worried
that you might misunderstand me

225
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:55,639
as an industrial spy

226
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:56,879
sent by my uncle.

227
00:10:57,119 --> 00:10:58,679
You lie to all of us.

228
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,679
No one can tell
whether you're telling the truth or not.

229
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,759
How could you say I'm a liar?
That's harsh.

230
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,480
I didn't

231
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:05,679
hurt anyone.

232
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,840
Unlike you.

233
00:11:07,439 --> 00:11:09,040
How could you join Mad Eye Comics?

234
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,119
Do you know how sad Miss Bai Qi is?

235
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:14,040
That's our business
and it doesn't concern you.

236
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,639
Since you're not afraid of
exposing your identity,

237
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,639
I'm going to show you

238
00:11:18,999 --> 00:11:20,999
what her response would be

239
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,639
after knowing who you really are.

240
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,240
You're threatening me.

241
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:26,519
How could I have fallen for you?

242
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:28,360
Quit saying that. It's gross.

243
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,879
How could I be compatible with you,

244
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,240
Miss Tian?

245
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:40,879
I won't bother you.

246
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,439
I'll tell

247
00:11:42,439 --> 00:11:43,720
Miss Bai Qi by myself.

248
00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:45,800
Do you think everyone
is as mean as you are?

249
00:11:47,319 --> 00:11:49,160
I've finally seen your true color
today.

250
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,160
I'll call Miss Bai Qi now.

251
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,119
Because they might've
blocked your contact.

252
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,840
Little Orange, what's the matter?

253
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,079
Miss Bai Qi.

254
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,400
It's not about the work.

255
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,639
Are you home alone?

256
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:31,319
Bai Qijia isn't at home now,

257
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,079
but I am. What's wrong?

258
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,720
Stop crying. Tell me
who has bullied you?

259
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,920
Please open the door. I'm outside now.

260
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,720
I'm coming.

261
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:51,160
What has happened?

262
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,600
What has happened?

263
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,720
There, there. Let's sit down.

264
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,559
Tell me who has bullied you?

265
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,199
Stop crying.

266
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,240
Tell me what has happened?

267
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,439
Who's it?

268
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,960
Who's that rat?

269
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,280
Just tell me.

270
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:24,879
Miss Bai Qi.

271
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,480
Truth be told, there's something

272
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,840
that I've been keeping from you.

273
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,879
Please promise me
that you won't be mad at me.

274
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,639
What's it about? Fire away.

275
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:36,439
Promise me first.

276
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,759
Alright. You have my promise now.

277
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,960
Don't cry, please.

278
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,079
What do you think it's
that will anger me?

279
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,360
Actually,

280
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:48,679
I'm Tian Zhan's niece.

281
00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:52,040
It sounds familiar.
Remind me that again.

282
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:55,800
Tian Zhan.

283
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,199
Tian Zhan?

284
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,800
Tian Zhan.

285
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,639
Tian Zhan from Mad Eye Comics?

286
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,439
It's Tian Zhan from Mad Eye Comics.

287
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:19,360
You may leave.

288
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:20,559
-Sure.
-Sure.

289
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,160
Dr. Bai.

290
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,079
I feel that my body is weak.

291
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,240
Am I dying soon?

292
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,079
Nonsense.

293
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,280
We've adjusted a new treatment plan

294
00:14:35,999 --> 00:14:37,920
and you don't seem to be adapted
to the new medicine.

295
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,079
You'll be alright after some days.

296
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,439
Stop lying.

297
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,360
Are you treating me like a kid

298
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,400
who knows nothing?

299
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:53,920
Qiqi.

300
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,960
I've never thought that you're a kid

301
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,999
nor I had tried to fool you.

302
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,079
Actually,

303
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:03,400
if there's no hope for me,

304
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,999
death

305
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,999
is a good end for me.

306
00:15:08,319 --> 00:15:10,160
Everything is far from over yet.

307
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:12,480
You still have many things to complete.

308
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:13,600
Think about

309
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,360
your comic that hasn't ended,

310
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:16,920
your parents who cherish you so much,

311
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:19,439
your idol who both of you
love each other,

312
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,519
and also

313
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,800
an indifferent doctor
who has been watching you.

314
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,240
Dr. Bai.

315
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:29,199
Thank you so much.

316
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,160
Even though you're as mean as usual,

317
00:15:32,439 --> 00:15:33,759
I can feel

318
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:35,360
that you're comforting me.

319
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,040
Qiqi.

320
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,559
Although records for the last two weeks
didn't show a good sign,

321
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,920
your current situation
turns out well.

322
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,840
So, please be positive and optimistic

323
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,960
about your treatment.

324
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,240
And please trust us as well.

325
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,559
I believe in you, Dr. Bai.

326
00:15:58,519 --> 00:15:59,800
Do take a good rest.

327
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:28,559
Isn't this the ice bag
for freezing fruits.

328
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:30,679
Can I use it on my face?

329
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:33,199
You're even despising it.

330
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:34,400
Look at your eyes.

331
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:35,879
They're puffy.

332
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,960
You're crying like a little tabby cat.

333
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,119
Miss Bai Qi, have you forgiven me?

334
00:16:52,439 --> 00:16:53,319
Sure enough.

335
00:16:53,999 --> 00:16:55,759
What else can I do?

336
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,559
True though. My uncle sent someone

337
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:03,439
to lure Min and I was away.

338
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:04,319
If I were there,

339
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:06,040
I wouldn't have let his wicked plot
succeed.

340
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,360
I'm really curious

341
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,920
what nonsense is going on in your mind.

342
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,520
Regarding this,

343
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:14,199
I must tell Xuezhou.

344
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,240
I'm sure she will take it
very seriously.

345
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,679
But, I have no idea

346
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:18,919
whether she will go easy on you.

347
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,919
Be prepared. It's better to confess
to her by yourself.

348
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,399
Miss Bai Qi, you really love the readers
so much.

349
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:28,319
You're great.

350
00:18:43,439 --> 00:18:44,240
Thank you.

351
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:54,600
Mr. Lu, may we serve the dishes now?

352
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,919
Sure. Thank you.

353
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,000
Xuezhou.

354
00:19:02,199 --> 00:19:04,079
This restaurant is really beautiful.

355
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,880
Last time we didn't get here
for the sake of others.

356
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:07,199
Finally, we have the chance

357
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:08,559
to enjoy this place.

358
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,439
How's it?

359
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,039
Are you satisfied with the arrangement?

360
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:12,840
Pretty good.

361
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,840
What is she doing here?

362
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,679
There's no violinist in this restaurant.

363
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,279
So, I hired her from outside.

364
00:19:19,439 --> 00:19:20,240
Do you like the music?

365
00:19:46,439 --> 00:19:47,439
Xuezhou.

366
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:50,279
Can you please stop being
like a workaholic?

367
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,279
We rarely have time to date.

368
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,439
Can you please be focused?

369
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,520
Thank you.

370
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,079
Thank you.

371
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,240
Please enjoy your meal.

372
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:37,559
Xuezhou.

373
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:41,039
Don't you like it here?

374
00:20:41,439 --> 00:20:43,360
Maybe we can go to the movies?

375
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:07,520
Xuezhou.

376
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,399
What happened to you?

377
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:11,399
Don't you like this movie?

378
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,559
I can change to another movie.

379
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:13,480
No. No need.

380
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,880
Everything is just fine for me.

381
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,360
Xuezhou.

382
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,079
We've been dating

383
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:28,399
for some time.

384
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,159
If there's anything
I'm not doing well enough,

385
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:33,120
please tell me.

386
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:35,640
Unlike now,

387
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,960
I feel that I'm the only one
in our show.

388
00:21:39,439 --> 00:21:40,480
In fact,

389
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,039
I don't find anything bad.

390
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:43,799
It's just because

391
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:47,079
I don't like dating
that's well-planned and designed.

392
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,000
It makes me feel uncomfortable.

393
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:50,360
What do you prefer then?

394
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,439
Tell me. I can prepare for that.

395
00:21:53,199 --> 00:21:55,480
I prefer something simple. Honestly,

396
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,520
when we're together,

397
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,919
even if we do or say nothing,

398
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:02,559
we're close to each other.

399
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:04,679
But...

400
00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:15,360
Something's wrong with the event venue?

401
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,439
What do you mean?

402
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:18,079
Alright, got it.

403
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:19,079
I'll come right now.

404
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,520
Got it.

405
00:22:23,199 --> 00:22:23,919
Lu Tian.

406
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,720
Lu Tian, I...

407
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,720
It's not the first time
you're leaving halfway.

408
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:33,319
Work isn't everything in your life.

409
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:36,960
Lu Tian, I'm so sorry.

410
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,559
I hope you can understand.

411
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,640
I'm really occupied with work recently.

412
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,559
I just can't digress from work.

413
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:43,679
Please try and understand me.

414
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:44,919
I don't understand.

415
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,039
Why is your work never ending?

416
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,679
Sometimes, I'd think

417
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:52,439
that you're avoiding me purposely.

418
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:53,760
Lu Tian, do you know

419
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,079
you're immature in saying that to me?

420
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,240
Do you know

421
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,319
not everyone is like you

422
00:22:59,439 --> 00:23:01,679
who is born with a silver spoon?

423
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,760
You do nothing

424
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,399
to get a life which's free of troubles.

425
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,000
We're not the same kind.

426
00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:08,360
If I don't work hard,

427
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,360
I can't support myself.
Do you know that?

428
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,000
You should know this very well

429
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,000
since the day you've chosen me.

430
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:16,199
You're so mean.

431
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,319
Do you know

432
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:20,919
your words have hurt me?

433
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,439
Am I saying the truth?

434
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,079
Do you know what I want?

435
00:23:24,199 --> 00:23:25,360
What do you want?

436
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:26,880
I'll try my best

437
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,720
to fulfill everything you want.

438
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,360
But you have to tell me.

439
00:23:36,399 --> 00:23:37,319
I think

440
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,600
we started our relationship
with a hurried decision.

441
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,319
We need to give it a second thought.

442
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,039
Xuezhou, please don't go.

443
00:23:49,199 --> 00:23:50,360
Please don't leave me.

444
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,159
I shouldn't have said that to you
just now.

445
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,600
Lu Tian.

446
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:00,480
We should

447
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:03,919
separate for some time

448
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,559
and consider

449
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:10,480
whether we're suitable for each other.

450
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,520
Chen Min, come out.

451
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,480
Chen Min.

452
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:47,159
What are you up to again?

453
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,399
I've owned up to Miss Bai Qi
about everything.

454
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,000
And she forgave me without hesitation.

455
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,960
You must be very disappointed, right?

456
00:24:53,199 --> 00:24:55,120
I'll stay at Bai Qi Studio for good.

457
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,439
Did you purposely make a trip here

458
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,159
to tell me such a petty thing?

459
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,199
True.

460
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:01,559
Because I abhor those

461
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:03,600
who are despicable and petty-minded
like you.

462
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,640
I'll replace you

463
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,640
to be an indispensable assistant
for Miss Bai Qi.

464
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,799
I haven't finished talking yet.

465
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,919
What do you want?

466
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,120
I just want to remind you

467
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:22,720
that my uncle is a hard nut to crack.

468
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,520
You better be careful.

469
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,480
Mind your own business.

470
00:25:27,199 --> 00:25:28,039
Miss Tian.

471
00:25:28,399 --> 00:25:29,079
You...

472
00:25:37,439 --> 00:25:38,399
Procrastinator Bai.

473
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,240
I'm so helpless now.

474
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,480
Please help me.

475
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,399
A love relationship
is something difficult to deal with.

476
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,319
Besides, I don't know Lin Xuezhou well.

477
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,919
I don't think I can be of your help.

478
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,159
But, Qin Ge and you

479
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,039
are a lovey-dovey couple now.

480
00:25:58,279 --> 00:25:59,520
Are you willing

481
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,600
to see me devastated?

482
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:03,199
Alright.

483
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,279
Tell me. What can I do for you?

484
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:08,039
I came out with two ideas
to reconcile with Xuezhou.

485
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,480
Please give me some suggestions on them.

486
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:23,679
Lu Tian, what brings you here?

487
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,799
It's been some time since we last met.
I miss you so much.

488
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,960
I don't want to separate from you.

489
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:40,799
Please give me one more chance.

490
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:49,039
Your idea is pretty wild,

491
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:50,559
but it's risky anyhow.

492
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:52,720
Probably you'd be hurt physically.

493
00:26:53,439 --> 00:26:55,319
Weren't you pathetic enough
being hit back then?

494
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,240
Xuezhou, I love you.

495
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,600
I want to break up with you.

496
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,120
Please come back to me.

497
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,120
Alright. I forgive you.

498
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,000
You've forgiven me?

499
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,760
Seriously?

500
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,120

What do you say then?

515
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:45,279
I'd say

516
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,520
that you have to give up on the tricks
you used to take.

517

Think it from your heart.

You must find out what she really wants,

It seems your relationship
benefits you a lot.

Qin Ge has taught you a lot, hasn't she?

Should I confess to her today?

You should decide after Xuezhou comes.

We'll act accordingly.

Sure. I'll do it to perfection.

I did live stream twice last year.

Nothing.

557

Xuezhou, you look terrible.

558
00:30:02,439 --> 00:30:04,279
Didn't you quarrel with Dr. Lu again?

559
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,600
We've decided to separate temporarily.

It's my fault.

What have you done wrong?

564
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,039
I always thought that

565
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:50,600
giving you the best
is the way of expressing love.

566
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,720
But, I didn't know

567

what you really want.

568
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,520
I was too childish.

569
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,520
Please don't look down on me.

570
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,480
When did I ever look down on you?

571
00:31:09,399 --> 00:31:10,520
Anyway, I'm to be blamed.

572
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,199
So, I've brought something for you

573
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:13,520
to ask for your forgiveness.

574
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:18,919
Can you please

575
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:20,600
give me a chance?

What's it?

577
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,319
Did you simply waste your money again?

578
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:25,120
It cost me nothing.
