Moreover, I caught her red-handed.

166
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,179
I almost became a jerk

167
00:07:28,299 --> 00:07:29,540
who abandoned my own wife and kid.

168
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,579
I won't let it happen.

Pregnant?

172
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,859
It was just an accident.

173
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,940
Guru Bai Qi, do you mind filling up

174
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,500
this form?

175
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,700
I would like to learn more
about Lin Xuezhou.

Dr. Lu.

178
00:08:02,859 --> 00:08:04,780
Is there a misunderstanding
regarding Xuezhou's pregnancy?

179
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:06,299
Even if Xuezhou is really pregnant,

180
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:07,980
it's her personal matter.

181
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,019
Although I'm her friend,

182
00:08:10,179 --> 00:08:11,940
I have no right to interfere
with her decision.

183
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:14,739
Precisely.

184
00:08:15,179 --> 00:08:16,260
Why are you here?

185
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,260
Lu Tian has been my best friend

186
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:20,739
since we were in college.

187
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:21,980
He is a bit thick,

188
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,220
but he's not a bad guy.

189
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:25,540
Don't make me look too bad.

190
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,339
You don't have to fill up this form.

191
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,980
Lu Tian has to get this done himself.

192
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:32,660
As his friends,

193
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:33,739
the only thing we can do for him

194
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:36,060
is plan the reception for him

195
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:37,060
and make sure everything goes smoothly.

196
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:38,619
If they end up together,

197
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,900
it's one of the ways
to give them our blessings.

198
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,299
Please, Guru Bai Qi.

199
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:42,340
I must propose to her.

200
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,460
Otherwise, she might mistake me

201
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,659
for an irresponsible man.

202
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:45,779
She would leave this place alone,

203
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,619
turn against her family,

204
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,979
and give birth to the child on her own.

205
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:48,979
It'll then shock everybody.

206
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:52,859
She will hide it from everyone.

207
00:08:54,619 --> 00:08:55,779
Except for the nonsense,

208
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,340
from what I know about Lin Xuezhou,

209
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,659
what he said does sound plausible.

210

(They really work well as a pair.)

211

and was someone's bridesmaid

I'm way more experienced than you.

There's no need for all that.

This is a major event in Lu Tian's life.

Why is he not here?

233

We can just do it ourselves.

Hello.

237
00:10:30,859 --> 00:10:31,979
Thank you

for picking our company.

00:10:34,219 --> 00:10:35,500
when do you plan
to hold your wedding reception?

241
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,419
We're not in a hurry.
We're due for a proposal.

242
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:39,260
The sooner the better.
The baby will be here anytime.

That's good news.

244
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,900
I suggest you

245
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,299
to pick a Chinese wedding gown

246
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,659
for your wedding.

247
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,659
Look at this.

248
00:10:47,979 --> 00:10:49,900
The Chinese gowns
have a less fitting cut.

249
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,340
The bride will feel
more comfortable in this.

250
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,340
I think we should leave this decision

251
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,299
to the lady.

252
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,859
Qin Ge, what do you think?

253
00:10:58,299 --> 00:11:00,900
The Chinese gown looks more comfortable,

254
00:11:01,099 --> 00:11:02,140
and it's more meaningful.

255
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,500
We would like a Chinese-style wedding.

256

Mr. Bai.

257
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,020
Miss Qin is really lucky

258
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,099
to have a partner like you.

259
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:09,659
It happens that

260
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:10,340
there's a new arrival in our store.

261

Would you like to try it on?

It's fine. We're not...

263
00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:14,900
Sure. Thank you.

268
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,979
Isn't it just a proposal?
Why are we trying the wedding gowns?

269
00:11:25,179 --> 00:11:26,700
You said you were up for anything.

270
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,179
Moreover, it's really important

271
00:11:28,179 --> 00:11:29,859
to try on the wedding gown too.

272
00:11:30,299 --> 00:11:31,299
We should let Xuezhou

273
00:11:31,619 --> 00:11:33,260
try on the wedding gowns herself.

274
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,140
She doesn't need my help with this.

275
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,419
Our sizes are different.

276
00:11:35,739 --> 00:11:37,460
You should do everything you can
to help your friend.

277
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,380
Hi.

278

This way, please.

279
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:46,859
This way.

280
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:53,940
It's just trying on the gowns.

281
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:55,500
It's not a big deal.

282
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,460
Why are you here?

283
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,020
Turn around and show me the gown.

284
00:13:02,619 --> 00:13:03,460
I won't.

285
00:13:04,219 --> 00:13:05,419
I just want to take a look.

286
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:14,380
Are you done yet?

287
00:13:16,299 --> 00:13:18,380
What do you think? Say something.

288
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,940
All right. We'll pick this one.

289
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,020
All right.

290
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,099
Can you leave now?

291
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:23,020
Wait.

292
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,619
You've tried on the gown for Xuezhou.

293
00:13:25,859 --> 00:13:27,380
I should try on the suit
for Lu Tian too.

294
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,060
Let's take a photo together later,

295
00:13:29,219 --> 00:13:30,739
and I'll show the photo to Lu Tian
when I'm back at the hospital.

296
00:13:33,099 --> 00:13:33,859
Fine.

Can you please hold this for me?

Hurry up and call the 120.

He hasn't.

00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,179
Thank you, sir.
I'll leave you a five-star rating later.

333
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,380
King Bai.

334
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,739
I'll feed you

335
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,260
in a while.

336
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,619
Go ahead and play on your own.

337
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,700
Why did you follow me home?

338
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,020
I can't bear to leave you alone

339
00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:19,260
when you're in this state.

340
00:16:19,539 --> 00:16:20,380
What's with that nonsense?

341
00:16:20,539 --> 00:16:21,979
I'm always alone.

342
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,779
What can you do for me here?

343
00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:26,340
I can do everything for you.

344
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,659
Try me.

345
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,260
Up to you.

346
00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:40,940
Min is always here too.

347
00:16:41,099 --> 00:16:42,859
I'll just pretend
to have a younger brother at home.

348
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,820
Bai Qijia.

349
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,979
You're just my younger brother.

350
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,659
No.

351
00:16:55,619 --> 00:16:56,539
No.

352
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,659
We can't stay in this room alone.

353
00:16:58,779 --> 00:16:59,260
Leave now.

354
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,900
Then, why can Min stay here with you?

355
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:02,299
Min and you are different.

356
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,299
What's the difference?

357
00:17:03,419 --> 00:17:04,260
Are you leaving or not?

358
00:17:04,419 --> 00:17:05,419
I'm not leaving.

359
00:17:05,659 --> 00:17:06,219
Are you leaving or not?

360
00:17:06,219 --> 00:17:07,179
Fine. I'll leave,

361
00:17:08,659 --> 00:17:09,739
but only after you've fallen asleep.

362
00:17:10,979 --> 00:17:11,700
Good night.

363
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,700
I'll sleep now.

364
00:17:22,139 --> 00:17:22,899
I'll sleep now.

365
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,820
I'll fall asleep now.

366
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,899
I can't sleep.

367
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,940
(Why is it so quiet out there?)

368
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,980
(Can I trust him?)

369
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,060
(Has he left?)

370
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,659
Stupid cat.
How can you betray your owner?

371
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,460
Go and play on your own.

372
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,060
(Why did he get so close to the camera?)

373
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,440
(Bai Qijia)

374
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,539
What's the matter?

375
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,019
I was just about to fall asleep.

376
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,659
Quit acting. I know you're still awake.

377
00:18:51,139 --> 00:18:52,779
That's not true.

378
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,659
Why is your surveillance camera moving?

379
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,779
What brand is this?

380
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,060
Is it a smart camera?

381
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,980
Bai Qijia.

382
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,139
Do you think I can fall asleep

383
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,860
with a grown man playing with my cat
at my place?

384
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:04,259
(Do you need me to put you to sleep?)

385
00:19:05,139 --> 00:19:05,980
I am very good

386
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,539
at putting the kids in the hospital

387
00:19:07,659 --> 00:19:08,766
to sleep.

388
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:09,980
You'll definitely give it
a five-star rating.

389
00:19:10,419 --> 00:19:11,419
Do you want to try it?

390
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,179
Bai Qijia.

391
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,220
It's only been a few years.

392
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,060
How did you become so shameless?

393
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:20,740
Probably because no one was there
to tell me what to do.

394
00:19:22,139 --> 00:19:24,499
You were always the one bossing
others around when you were at school.

395
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,019
I had never seen anyone telling you
what to do.

396
00:19:26,139 --> 00:19:27,060
You're wrong.

397
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,100
You couldn't see it only because

398
00:19:29,499 --> 00:19:30,940
the person didn't do it directly.

399
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,179
Besides, I knew

400
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,700
what I should and shouldn't do.

401
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,419
I know what makes her happy.

402
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,620
I'll do things that matter to her.

403
00:19:43,139 --> 00:19:44,100
Did you not meet

404
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,060
another person like her

405
00:19:46,659 --> 00:19:48,259
during the past few years?

406
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,379
No.

407
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,499
Stop lying. There was a brief silence.

408
00:19:57,139 --> 00:19:58,740
Tell me what happened.

409
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,419
Why did you break up with her?

410
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,940
There wasn't another girl.
Are you still going to sleep?

411
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:04,060
No.

412
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,659
You made me curious.

413
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:08,539
I won't be able to rest
before I find out the answer.

414
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,019
You need to finish what you started.

415
00:20:11,499 --> 00:20:13,740
I don't think that's a good idea.

416
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,539
Why not?

417
00:20:15,659 --> 00:20:16,700
We're friends.

418
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,980
Tell me now.

419
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,139
Fine.

420
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,860
Why did he hang up on me?

421
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:30,899
Who's there?

422
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:32,340
It's me.

423
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,499
What are you doing?

424
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,419
I'm here to answer your question.

425
00:21:07,379 --> 00:21:08,980
Bai Qijia. I'm warning you.

426
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,499
Don't you dare do anything to me!

427
00:21:10,659 --> 00:21:11,899
That's not what I meant.

428
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,740
I think that's exactly what you meant.

429
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,659
Open the door now.

430
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,499
I'm warning you.

431
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,820
Stop acting like a gangster.

432
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,460
I'll take your last name

433
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:19,539
if I open the door for you.

434
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:20,860
Open the door now.

435
00:21:24,379 --> 00:21:25,779
I don't want you to take my last name,

436
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,179
so I'll open the door for you.

437
00:21:27,779 --> 00:21:28,620
Bai Qijia.

438
00:21:28,899 --> 00:21:29,580
Stop.

439
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,860
Go in now.

440
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:31,779
Hurry up.

441
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,700
Hurry up.

442
00:21:32,899 --> 00:21:33,620
-What are you doing?
-Hurry up.

443
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,499
Your legs.

444
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:35,860
Hurry up.

445
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,419
-What are you doing?
-Lie straight.

446
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:38,779
You...

447
00:21:41,019 --> 00:21:42,179
Lie down and pretend that you're dead.

448
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:43,539
Don't move or talk.

449
00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:46,980
Cover yourself.

450
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:01,659
Hello.

451
00:22:02,019 --> 00:22:05,060
Your personal beautiful delivery lady
is here.

452
00:22:05,179 --> 00:22:06,740
What brought you here, Xuezhou?

453
00:22:08,379 --> 00:22:10,419
Didn't you say
that you had a hard time falling asleep?

454
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,220
I'm here to sleep with you.

455
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,899
I guarantee

456
00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:16,499
you'll get a good night's sleep.

457
00:22:20,179 --> 00:22:21,060
Whose shoes are those?

458
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:22,820
Is there a man in your house?

459
00:22:24,139 --> 00:22:25,139
Show yourself!

460
00:22:25,259 --> 00:22:26,379
No.

461
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,499
There's no man here.

462
00:22:28,899 --> 00:22:29,940
Listen.

463
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,299
According to the internet,

464
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:32,980
it's very dangerous

465
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,940
for a lady to live alone.

466
00:22:35,259 --> 00:22:37,499
It's safer to leave
a pair of men's shoes

467
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,620
at the entrance.

468
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,700
Do I look like someone

469
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,060
who'll hide a man at home?

470
00:22:51,899 --> 00:22:52,659
Of course, I don't.

471
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,820
How I wish that you're keeping a man
here at home.

472
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,980
I'll go upstairs and get changed.

473
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:00,779
It's too warm in here.

474
00:23:00,899 --> 00:23:02,580
-This...
-Why don't you eat first?

475
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:04,980
What's the matter?

476
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,460
It's really cold here.

477
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,019
I don't think so.

478
00:23:08,539 --> 00:23:09,259
Yes. It's cold.

479
00:23:09,899 --> 00:23:10,980
It's not.

480
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,860
When your best friend says you're cold,

481
00:23:13,019 --> 00:23:14,259
you are.

482
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,620
What's the matter?

483
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:23,139
Why are you acting so secretive
if there isn't a man here?

484
00:23:23,299 --> 00:23:24,499
No.

485
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:26,940
My room is a mess.

486
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:27,659
I...

487
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,940
It's neat.

488
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,779
My goodness.

489
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,899
You're an adult,
but you still sleep with a bolster.

490
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,259
How cute.

491
00:23:50,539 --> 00:23:51,740
I'll change into my pajamas first.

492
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,700
The wardrobe.

493
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:55,980
Wait.

494
00:23:56,539 --> 00:23:57,700
What are you doing?

495
00:23:58,299 --> 00:23:59,299
I'll get it for you.

496
00:23:59,419 --> 00:24:00,860
I can do it myself.

497
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,620
I...

498
00:24:02,139 --> 00:24:02,940
This...

499
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,740
Your wardrobe is really organized.

500
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,539
Yes. I'm a big girl now.

501
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:10,740
I know how to manage a household.

502
00:24:11,379 --> 00:24:12,499
Hurry up and pick one.

503
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:13,940
The food is getting cold.

504
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:16,620
Sure.

505
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:19,779
This is too fancy.

506
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,940
This is basically an antique.

507
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,700
No way.

508
00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:28,820
I like this one.

509
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:30,860
The blue one.

510
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:31,860
I like this.

511
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:33,940
This is the one.

512
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,100
Wait.

513
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:43,899
What's wrong?

514
00:24:45,379 --> 00:24:46,340
It's cold.

515
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,620
It's not.

516
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:48,940
I told you when we were downstairs.

517
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:49,980
I'm not cold. What are you doing?

518
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:50,659
It's just...

519
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:53,139
It's cold in this room.

520
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,259
It's not.

521
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,700
It's not cold. Leave me alone.

522
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,419
Let's go somewhere else.

523
00:24:56,419 --> 00:24:57,220
Qin Ge, what are you doing?

524
00:24:57,379 --> 00:24:58,259
It's warm in the washroom.

525
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,419
Do you really have to do this?

526
00:25:00,139 --> 00:25:00,980
Qin Ge!

527
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,620
Where's he?

528
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:07,940
Where did he go?

529
00:25:17,659 --> 00:25:18,620
Qin Ge, what's wrong with you?

530
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,499
My goodness.

531
00:25:20,499 --> 00:25:21,659
I'm all right.

532
00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:25,139
I accidentally stubbed my toes.

533
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:32,620
I didn't know doctors are so flexible.

534
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,460
What are you talking about?

535
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,779
I was suffocating.

536
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,299
Stay in there for a while more.

537
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,499
Get in there.

538
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:28,700
Is it spicy?

539
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:29,820
Don't worry.

540
00:26:30,019 --> 00:26:31,220
Nothing I ordered today is spicy.

541
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,179
You can eat all you want.

542
00:26:37,259 --> 00:26:39,299
Have some milk. It helps you sleep.

543
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:41,659
Beer helps you sleep better, right?

544
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,659
You want me to live a healthy lifestyle,

545
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,100
and similarly, I want you

546
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,419
to live a healthy lifestyle as well.

547
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,980
That's how we can help each other.

548
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,700
Together, we'll get better.

549
00:26:59,419 --> 00:27:01,460
Sure. I'll drink the milk.

550
00:27:04,139 --> 00:27:05,019
Wait.

551
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:05,940
What happened to the guy

552
00:27:06,019 --> 00:27:07,340
who worked in the financial industry
I introduced you to the last time?

553
00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:08,499
What do you think of him?

554
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,499
He sent me a text yesterday,

555
00:27:10,499 --> 00:27:11,860
asking me how you're doing.

556
00:27:12,379 --> 00:27:13,179
But I think

557
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:15,220
he's a very decent guy. Look.

558
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:18,379
He's gentle and caring.

559
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,659
For you, he joined the painting classes.

560
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,659
That's really nice of him.

561
00:27:22,259 --> 00:27:24,580
He's way better than those guys
you met before,

562
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,460
be it the sports teacher,

563
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,139
the Information Technology guy,

564
00:27:28,499 --> 00:27:30,419
or the musician.

565
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:31,659
If you like him,

566
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,659
why don't you date him?

567
00:27:35,539 --> 00:27:37,139
He's not my type.

568
00:27:37,779 --> 00:27:38,460
Why not?

569
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:41,259
Do you like a young and humorous guy?

570
00:27:41,419 --> 00:27:42,539
Someone

571
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,100
like Lu Tian.

572
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,539
You know Lu Tian?

573
00:27:57,299 --> 00:27:58,299
He's Bai Qijia's friend.

574
00:27:58,499 --> 00:27:59,700
I met him once.

575
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,740
It's late at night. Stop talking
about something so terrifying.

576
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:05,019
I'm scared.

577
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,539
Sorry.

578
00:28:07,899 --> 00:28:08,620
My mistake.

579
00:28:08,899 --> 00:28:09,980
I'll get some water.

580
00:28:34,019 --> 00:28:34,899
You're asleep?

581
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:37,620
That's really quick.

582
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:02,659
Oh, no.

583
00:29:04,379 --> 00:29:05,620
What should I do now?

584
00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:07,779
There's another man upstairs.

585
00:29:17,779 --> 00:29:19,139
Financial advisor, sports teacher,

586
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:20,700
I.T. guy, musician.

587
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:21,820
Guru Bai Qi.

588
00:29:21,899 --> 00:29:23,980
You have a wide range of prey.

589
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:26,220
It's all because of my dad.

590
00:29:26,419 --> 00:29:27,539
I'm not that desperate.

591
00:29:28,899 --> 00:29:29,700
Them?

592
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,700
Why don't Guru Bai Qi consider
expanding your business

593
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,940
and include a doctor in your list?

594
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,340
I'm not interested in doing that now.

595
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,899
How long do I need to change your mind?

596
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:52,659
Longer than you expect,

597
00:29:53,299 --> 00:29:54,299
if not long enough.

598
00:30:02,379 --> 00:30:03,820
All right. Take a good rest.

599
00:30:03,899 --> 00:30:04,539
Good night.

600
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:07,419
Don't touch my hair.

601
00:30:08,259 --> 00:30:08,980
I'll get going.

602
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,019
The world is finally at peace.

603
00:30:27,139 --> 00:30:27,980
Qin Ge.

604
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,340
Hang in there, Qin Ge.

605
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:32,700
Boss, don't close your eyes.

606
00:30:34,139 --> 00:30:36,379
(Am I going to end up just like my mom?)

607
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,340
(Well.)

608
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,700
What's the use of struggling?

609
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,820
Wake up, Qin Ge.

610
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,220
Don't close your eyes, Qin Ge.

611
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,499
Qin Ge.

612
00:30:49,539 --> 00:30:50,740
Wake up, Qin Ge.

613
00:30:51,899 --> 00:30:53,419
Qin Ge, Hang in there.

614
00:30:53,779 --> 00:30:54,580
Qin Ge.

615
00:31:21,019 --> 00:31:23,220
(Remember to take your breakfast.
It's in the microwave.)

616
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,419
(Min will come to you later)

617
00:31:24,499 --> 00:31:25,539
(with some missions.)

618
00:31:25,779 --> 00:31:26,980
(Remember to keep the shoes)

619
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,379
(if you're hiding a guy
at home the next time.)

620
00:31:28,499 --> 00:31:30,259
(Don't come up with such a poor excuse.)

621
00:31:43,499 --> 00:31:44,259
I was too careless.

622
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,379
Here.

623
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,940
This is not bad, Procrastinator Bai.

624
00:31:50,419 --> 00:31:51,620
You even got the suit ready.

625
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,940
I'll definitely defend you

626
00:31:53,019 --> 00:31:54,179
if anyone calls you
Procrastinator Bai again.

627
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,700
Why is it a Chinese suit?

628
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,019
Don't you like it?

629
00:31:59,259 --> 00:32:00,700
It looks auspicious.

630
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:01,620
The reception will look really vibrant

631
00:32:01,779 --> 00:32:03,179
if you're doing it the traditional way.

632
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:04,340
Fine.

633
00:32:04,779 --> 00:32:06,340
Do you have any news for me?

634
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,419
Why not?

635
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,620
You have only yourself to rely on.

636
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,060
That's all I can do for you.

637
00:32:32,499 --> 00:32:33,379
I can't draw anything.

638
00:32:37,779 --> 00:32:38,779
Me too.

639
00:32:40,019 --> 00:32:41,499
My mind is blank.

640
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:48,139
It's due the day after tomorrow.

641
00:32:57,299 --> 00:32:58,299
Let's end this.

642
00:32:59,179 --> 00:33:00,060
I'm tired of this.

643
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:02,899
There's no need to resort to this.

644
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,100
There's no need to resort to this, Boss.

645
00:33:04,259 --> 00:33:05,700
We don't have to do this.

646
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:08,980
I'll let my fans down

647
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,499
if I can't produce anything.

648
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,419
I'll also let my boss down.

649
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:17,740
I'll let Xuezhou down.

650
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:23,740
I'll let King Bai down.

651
00:33:25,299 --> 00:33:27,100
Boss, you're rich.

652
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,580
You can still wear nice clothes.

653
00:33:29,139 --> 00:33:31,499
Most importantly,
I'm still here with you, right?

654
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,899
By the way,
you have classes to attend tomorrow.

655
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:43,899
Go away.

656
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:46,860
What's wrong with you?

657
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,379
Why do you take pictures
before every meal now?

658
00:33:51,259 --> 00:33:51,980
Wait.

659
00:33:58,379 --> 00:33:59,060
Let's dig in.

660
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,220
Do you know

661
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,340
how to create a poll in WeChat?

662
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,820
You can share the application

663
00:34:08,019 --> 00:34:09,820
or you can send a direct message
to the group members?

664
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:11,100
Why?

665
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,490
(Creating a poll, Outing)

666
00:34:16,499 --> 00:34:18,180
Outing?

667
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,060
Are you trying to

668
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,459
meet up with your first love in secret?

669
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,100
Qin Ge has been under
a lot of stress recently.

670
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,140
I want to bring her out for a walk.

671
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:33,580
A good strategy is a key to success.

672
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,100
You have Qin Ge

673
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,779
in the palm of your hand.

674
00:34:37,259 --> 00:34:38,459
That's not true.

675
00:34:39,299 --> 00:34:41,100
Qin Ge can only let down her guard

676
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,660
when she's somewhere she's familiar.

677
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,499
I still have no idea

678
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,259
what's on her mind.

679
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:50,219
I hope I can take this opportunity

680
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,979
to talk it over with her.

681
00:34:52,499 --> 00:34:53,459
Don't think too much.

682
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:56,100
Overthinking won't help you
win her heart.

683
00:34:56,299 --> 00:34:57,259
Instead, you should focus

684
00:34:57,459 --> 00:34:58,779
on making her yours.

685
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,939
Then, we can be family.

686
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:03,779
Have some shrimps.

687
00:35:03,979 --> 00:35:05,100
We have a meeting later.

688
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,779
(Today's result is not bad.)

689
00:35:11,939 --> 00:35:12,979
(It's more romantic than ever.)

690
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,100
I would've thought that you were in
a relationship if I weren't your friend.

691
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,340
That's not true.

692
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:18,299
Of course,

693
00:35:18,299 --> 00:35:20,019
I like the new idea.

694
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,100
I'll allow you

695
00:35:21,259 --> 00:35:22,539
to attend the outing tomorrow.

696
00:35:23,459 --> 00:35:24,180
Outing?

697
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,539
With who?

698
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,140
Don't you check your phone?

699
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:29,979
19 out of the 20 members of the group
have agreed to that suggestion.

700
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,219
You are the only one
who hasn't replied to that message.

701
00:35:32,699 --> 00:35:34,820
Whose idea was that?

702
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,820
Bai Qijia?

703
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,219
I'm not going.

704
00:35:41,979 --> 00:35:43,499
Isn't it nice to just stay at home,

705
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,100
eating, sleeping, playing with my cat,
and playing games?

706
00:35:45,459 --> 00:35:46,420
Of course, it's nice,

707
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,900
but you still have to join us.

708
00:35:48,219 --> 00:35:50,299
He is determined to win the war.

709
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,900
How can you retreat now?

710
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:53,219
You should fight him head-on.

711
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:56,420
Do you think I have a chance of winning?

712
00:35:56,539 --> 00:35:57,259
No,

713
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,299
but it's the courage that matters.

714
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,140
Good night.

715
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,779
Good luck!

716
00:36:18,739 --> 00:36:20,599
