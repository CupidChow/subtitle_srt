Get a hold of yourself.

20
00:02:12,839 --> 00:02:14,400
We're outside the studio
of Fingertip Comics.

21
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,719
So it's alright

22
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:16,719
if there's no one else around?

23
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,840
I mean,

24
00:02:19,359 --> 00:02:20,599
you can go in on your own.

25
00:02:20,999 --> 00:02:21,760
This is where I see you off.

26
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:22,639
Why?

27
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:24,960
Do you think Xuezhou might
hold a grudge against you?

28
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:26,519
Don't be afraid, Min.

29
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,999
I can take you to her.

30
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,999
Maybe your performance

31
00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:30,079
might convince her

32
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,920
to let you redeem yourself.
Come on.

33
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,439
That's not it.

34
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,719
I'm only doing this

35
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:39,960
to make up for my own mistakes.

36
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,920
I won't ask for their forgiveness.

37
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,079
Besides,

38
00:02:43,799 --> 00:02:45,480
I don't want to trouble

39
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:47,079
Xuezhou

40
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:49,999
or Qin Ge over this.

41
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,639
I shouldn't go with you.

42
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,920
And don't mention I've been here.

43
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,560
It seems

44
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,320
the recording you got
from Mad Eye Comics

45
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:16,920
becomes the key to turning the tide.

46
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:17,960
Of course.

47
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,799
With my brilliant baiting,

48
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:21,120
the cunning Tian Zhan

49
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:22,719
confessed to smearing and

50
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:23,799
and setting us up.

51
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:24,799
Not bad.

52
00:03:24,999 --> 00:03:27,159
You and Chen Min made
a great team together.

53
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,280
You two put up an
excellent and convincing act.

54
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,439
Certainly.

55
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,079
Min and I

56
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,999
are a match made in heaven!

57
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:36,519
Our show was perfection!

58
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:38,960
Is that so?

59
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:42,840
Wait.

60
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,639
Xuezhou, hear me out.

61
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:45,840
It seems you and Chen Min

62
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,079
have been very close.

63
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:49,719
Listen up.

64
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:51,920
All of this happened
because of Chen Min.

65
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,400
After I'm done with Mad Eye Comics,

66
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,960
I'll deal with him as well.

67
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,120
No.

68
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,239
The cause of everything was my uncle.

69
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,560
We can have our payback on him.

70
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,320
Min wasn't thinking straight back then.

71
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,320
His judgment was clouded.

72
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:06,680
Maybe we could beat him
up and teach him a lesson.

73
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,560
Then, we give him a second chance.

74
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,799
Okay?

75
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,400
Okay? Please?

76
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:13,840
Fine, I get it.

77
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,400
I wasn't serious about it.

78
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,239
But it's not up to us to forgive him

79
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:18,719
for what he's done.

80
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,079
It's up to Qin Ge.

81
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,159
After all,

82
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:24,519
she is the victim of the whole debacle.

83
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:33,479
Bai Qijia,

84
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,799
are you sure

85
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:36,840
this is one of the stops
on Qiqi's wishlist?

86
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,039
Yeah.

87
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,639
I'm not a genius,

88
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,280
so don't lie to me
with your made-up story.

89
00:04:41,799 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm not lying to you.

90
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,319
Everything we did

91
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,960
was what Qiqi wanted.

92
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,519
That included you.

93
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,479
I told Qiqi

94
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,120
the stories of our past.

95
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:57,440
She said she liked sandpainting as well.

96
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,600
She wished you could toss your worries

97
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,000
and frustrations on the board like sand.

98
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,639
Send them all to the parallel universe.

99
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:06,479
Don't let them get to you.

100
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,479
There are many parallel universes

101
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,400
in this dimension.

102
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,639
All of your unpleasant memories,

103
00:05:12,799 --> 00:05:14,199
frustrations, and rage

104
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:15,880
can be unleashed.

105
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:17,600
You don't need to feel
embarrassed about it.

106
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,919
That's because

107
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,359
when we are in a new world,

108
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,359
everything will start over.

109
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,880
Now,

110
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:29,359
think of this drawing board

111
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:31,840
as another parallel universe.

112
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,600
Draw and write anything
you're too scared to express

113
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,799
on this sandpainting.

114
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,400
Indeed.

115
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:40,799
Every emotion

116
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,919
can be let out in the parallel universe.

117
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,000
Then, everything will start over

118
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,639
in a different world.

119
00:05:54,239 --> 00:05:55,199
Bai Qijia,

120
00:05:55,799 --> 00:05:56,880
what are you doing?

121
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,199
Sorry about that.

122
00:06:01,359 --> 00:06:04,000
It's been too long.
I got a bit rusty at this.

123
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,440
Actually,

124
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,919
this is King Bai.

125
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:09,880
King Bai?

126
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,560
King Bai would resent you for this!

127
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,239
Let me do it instead.

128
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,239
I'll hold the bag.

129
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,479
Qiqi is waiting for us at school.

130
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:15,799
Hello, everyone.

131
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,359
This is the first lesson
of the semester.

132
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,639
Allow me to introduce myself.

133
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,880
I am Mr. Bai Qijia.

134
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,720
Hello, Mr. Bai.

135
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:26,560
Hello, students.

136
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,400
I'll be taking attendance.

137
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,319
Raise your hand when I say your name.

138
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:33,239
Qin Ge.

139
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,079
Yes.

140
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,720
Yue Qiqi.

141
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,639
Yes.

142
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,639
Qiqi, could you

143
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,799
introduce yourself to the class?

144
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,039
Hello, everyone.

145
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,560
My name is Yue Qiqi.

146
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,479
I like reading books and comics.

147
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:55,280
I hope we can all be friends.

148
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:56,280
Qiqi.

149
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:57,759
I like reading comics too.

150
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,160
We can binge-read together.

151
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:02,400
Qin Ge.

152
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,280
Don't be a bad influence.

153
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,720
The deputy is here.

154
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,199
I wouldn't dare, sir.

155
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,120
Where is the deputy?

156
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:12,639
Qiqi,

157
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,039
have you seen the deputy?

158
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:15,720
No.

159
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,039
Sir!

160
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:19,400
What is it?

161
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,359
The deputy is late.

162
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,960
The deputy is late?

163
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,359
Well?

164
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,079
He should get punished for that.

165
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,039
Fine.

166
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:36,039
How should he be punished

167
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,120
when he's here?

168
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,960
Run five laps around the field!

169
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:45,600
That is a lot worse than writing

170
00:08:46,119 --> 00:08:46,999
five reading reports.

171
00:08:51,439 --> 00:08:53,280
Stop messing around.
We'll begin the lesson now.

172
00:08:53,439 --> 00:08:54,639
Open your textbooks.

173
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,519
-Over here!
-Come on!

174
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:02,999
- Go for it!
- Go for it!

175
00:09:04,319 --> 00:09:05,879
Hurry up, I found a good spot.

176
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,280
Hurry up!

177
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,319
Pass the ball!

178
00:09:14,439 --> 00:09:17,720
Go! Go! Go!

179
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:19,439
Qiqi.

180
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,280
Everyone has

181
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,800
a Rukawa of their heart.

182
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,119
These different versions

183
00:09:24,119 --> 00:09:26,040
of Rukawa can be found on
every basketball court.

184
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,879
So, do you see any Rukawa

185
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:29,360
that catches your attention?

186
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,439
She is only 14.

187
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:31,879
Are you sure you should
talk about that?

188
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:33,280
What's wrong with her age?

189
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,160
I fell in love with Rukawa
when I was ten!

190
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:42,639
-Awesome.
-Awesome.

191
00:09:44,119 --> 00:09:46,199
Sir, could you help us

192
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:47,800
get their contacts?

193
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,840
No way.

194
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,720
It's my duty to keep my junior safe.

195
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,480
Whatever.

196
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:56,840
Qiqi, let's forget about this guy.

197
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:57,999
Qiqi.

198
00:09:58,119 --> 00:10:00,119
We'll come here every day from now on.

199
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:01,319
Someday,

200
00:10:01,439 --> 00:10:02,720
we will get their attention.

201
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,360
Hello. Can I have the ball back?

202
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,160
Thanks.

203
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,879
Kids nowadays are
really good at flirting.

204
00:10:30,999 --> 00:10:32,119
It seems

205
00:10:32,439 --> 00:10:33,840
you no longer pique their interest.

206
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:36,360
Bai Qijia,

207
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,160
I'm letting her get the attention, okay?

208
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,679
Fine.

209
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,439
Qiqi.

210
00:10:47,119 --> 00:10:48,040
The school's library

211
00:10:48,119 --> 00:10:49,600
is super amazing.

212
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,920
There is a multimedia classroom
where you can draw,

213
00:10:52,199 --> 00:10:54,079
and there is a massive hall!

214
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:55,439
When you feel better,

215
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,920
we'll visit those places together.

216
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,559
Thank you, Miss Bai Qi.

217
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:01,759
Thank you, Dr. Bai.

218
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,800
I had a lot of fun today.

219
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,119
I'm glad you're happy.

220
00:11:07,119 --> 00:11:07,879
Let's go.

221
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:14,590
(Qingchuan Chengya High School)

222
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,040
Let's go.

223
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,840
Go on.

224
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,639
This is a true fan.

225
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,240
He even has the sticker pack

226
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,639
from my first book signing.

227
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,119
Actually, you still have a lot of fans.

228
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,280
They have always

229
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,480
been there for you.

230
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:43,920
You have a new

231
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,759
die-hard fan in front of you.

232
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,319
Some proper observation is still needed.

233
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,720
If you ever ditch me
for another artist,

234
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,600
I'd make you pay.

235
00:11:55,119 --> 00:11:55,960
Qin Ge,

236
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:58,999
it's a relief to see you cheer up.

237
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,160
I should have done this long ago.

238
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,160
Now I realize

239
00:12:04,439 --> 00:12:05,480
the more hate you receive,

240
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:07,040
the more love you get.

241
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,319
I should be grateful

242
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:11,160
to those

243
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:13,519
who are willing to believe in me.

244
00:12:17,119 --> 00:12:18,079
I hereby announce

245
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,639
that Guru Bai Qi

246
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:21,800
is back in business!

247
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,079
Welcome back.

248
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,360
Xuezhou and the others

249
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,720
would be glad to see that

250
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,960
you are back.

251
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,879
I'll tell Xuezhou and Little Orange.

252
00:12:37,999 --> 00:12:38,960
They need not worry.

253
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,280
Then,

254
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,800
I do what I always do

255
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,920
to retaliate against
the people that sent me hate.

256
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,559
It's a secret for now.
I'll let you know later.

257
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,559
It was Tian Zhan from Mad Eye Comics

258
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:58,720
that gave us the order.

259
00:12:58,999 --> 00:13:00,800
He even ordered us to send trolls

260
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,160
to smear Bai Qi's name,

261
00:13:02,439 --> 00:13:04,160
as a way to stall all your projects.

262
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:06,920
Then, you'll have nothing to work on.

263
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,360
I got this from a reporter.

264
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:13,960
Along with the recording

265
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,720
Chen Min and Little Orange
got from Tian Zhan,

266
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,920
we can sue Mad Eyes Comics.

267
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,639
Then, with every charge,

268
00:13:20,999 --> 00:13:22,600
they will pay dearly.

269
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:24,439
We'll make them apologize
and pay the damages.

270
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,999
Let's save the apology

271
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,840
for later.

272
00:13:29,119 --> 00:13:29,960
Miss Bai Qi,

273
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,679
are you going to let this slide?

274
00:13:32,319 --> 00:13:34,559
Are you worried about Min

275
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,879
so you want to spare him?

276
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:40,679
Are you really getting soft now?

277
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,600
Even if he was used,

278
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,319
he still did it out of his selfishness.

279
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,439
Do you get it?

280
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,040
And after the whole thing escalated,

281
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,639
has he addressed it?

282
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,119
It's not because of him.

283
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,040
And it's not for me either.

284
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,040
I'm doing this
for the fans that love me.

285
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,519
Before they release an apology,

286
00:13:57,759 --> 00:13:59,519
I want to add an independent chapter

287
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,240
about my stance

288
00:14:01,319 --> 00:14:01,999
in my Bubaiqi plan.

289
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,040
I want everyone to know

290
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,840
what kind of person I truly am.

291
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:05,960
But what if this plan

292
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,079
ends up giving

293
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:08,480
Mad Eye Comics

294
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,519
an opening?

295
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:12,319
They could spread even more rumors
to whitewash their actions.

296
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:13,519
I'm not afraid of them.

297
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,360
I must speak up.

298
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,319
I owe

299
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,199
the fans that support me an explanation.

300
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,319
I'll do whatever I can
to support your plan.

301
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,639
Very well.

302
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,720
We each have a job to do.

303
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,319
As soon as your comic is published,

304
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:27,639
we must get the PR plans ready.

305

Little Orange.

306
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,519
Our upcoming plans

307
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,840
might run into conflicts
with Mad Eye Comics.

308
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,519
If you're uncomfortable about this,

309
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:41,240
I can assign other jobs to you.

310
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,879
That won't be necessary.

311
00:14:43,439 --> 00:14:45,439
It's everyone's duty to punish evil.

312
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,559
I won't side with Tian Zhan just because

313
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:48,840
he is my uncle.

see the cracks on this.

the courage we lost,

322
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,160
we can always pick ourselves up

323

and move on with our scars.

324

You are right.

325
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,040
These scars

326

won't fade with the passage of time.

327

stop us from reaching greater heights

This is Bai Qi's first chapter

of her self-narrative.

362

I think

363
00:17:09,639 --> 00:17:11,799
it's the best initial retaliation
against our rival.

364

Could we save a headline thread

for this morning's update?

367

The content itself is fine.

368
00:17:18,399 --> 00:17:19,760
But you must understand

369

that public opinions are uncontrollable.

In a struggle for morality,

371

it comes down to

372
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:27,880
what the people want to see.

373
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:29,559
If we choose to

take Bai Qi's side,

375

we can get in trouble.

376

Have you considered the consequences?

377
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,840
I have faith in Bai Qi.

I have faith in myself too.

If any problem arises,

380

I'll take full responsibility

Very well.

Really?

Is Miss Bai Qi posting
a new chapter today?

393

Does it hurt a lot?
You must be careful.

Miss Bai Qi is finally speaking up.

No,

I'm crying my heart out.
What's so funny?

Are you giving up on comics for good?

But I chose to become a comic artist

because of you.

476

If you quit,

477

I don't know how long I'll last.

478
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,480
Alright.

479
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:36,559
Don't get so upset.

480
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:39,240
I never said I was giving up for good.

481
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:41,840
Someday,

482
00:22:43,199 --> 00:22:44,319
I might make a comeback.

483
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,600
Do you mean it?

484
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,559
Stay with Qin Ge.

I want some time for myself.

487

Qin Ge, if you want Min

489

I won't say no to that.

Never mind.

491

I know him too well.

492

He's not coming back.

493
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:31,279
I need to go out.

494

You just came back.
Where are you going now?

I'll make it brief.

509
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,919
I want to have a word

510
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:15,480
about Chen Min's resignation.

511
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,199
Chen Min?

512
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,640
He betrayed you and me.

513
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,679
What is there to talk about?

514
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,159
Chen Min is an outstanding

515
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:26,760
and talented comic artist.

516
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:28,960
With proper training,

517
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,480
he will deliver comics
that the fans will love

518
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,000
and are profitable for the company.

519
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,799
However,

520
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,199
you used him and led him astray.

521
00:24:38,439 --> 00:24:39,840
That wasn't Chen Min's fault.

522
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,279
It's Mad Eye Comics' fault

523
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,279
for not seeing the bigger picture.

524
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,840
Are you here seeking justice for him?

525
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:49,159
Indeed.

526
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:51,000
Heed my warning.

527
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,640
Chen Min apologized and quit

528
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,600
to save your face.

529
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,760
If you continue to
put the blame on him,

530
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,799
I won't hesitate to intervene.

531
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,679
Please,

532
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,000
my methods may be cruel,

533
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:08,799
but I'm not as despicable as you think.

534
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,480
I will admit my defeat in business.

535
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,880
I do admire Chen Min.

536
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,000
However,

537
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:16,600
he chose to betray me.

538
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,399
I find that to be such a shame.

539
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,919
I hope you're not lying.

540
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,640
Here.

541
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:45,439
Thanks.

542
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,760
Don't mention it.

543
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,279
I'm surprised you had the courage

544
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:49,439
to quit and apologize.

545
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,640
I'm even more surprised

546
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,319
that you'd come to me.

547
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,360
I am only

548
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,199
making up for my stupid mistakes.

549
00:25:58,079 --> 00:25:58,960
I'm here

550
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:00,799
because I need your help.

551
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:01,760
What is it?

552
00:26:02,199 --> 00:26:03,760
Do you have a message for Qin Ge?

553
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,079
I'm too ashamed

554
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:08,480
to talk to her.

555
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:10,039
So I need you

556
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,000
to send her a message for me.

557
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:15,399
Here's my message.

558
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:17,039
"Qin Ge,

559
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:19,640
you've been a qualified idol,

560
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,399
but I've failed as a friend."

561
00:26:23,199 --> 00:26:25,159
"I tried to run after the light,

562
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:27,039
but I've lost my directions."

563
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:28,480
"I hope that

564
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,439
you never give up on the light."

565
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,720
I have a message for you too, Bai Qijia.

566
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:38,480
I owe you an apology.

567
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,480
I used to think of you

568
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,520
as the man who would hurt her,

569
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,720
that only I

570
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,880
could keep her safe.

571
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,319
But now I realized

572
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:50,240
that I'd been the one holding the knife.

573
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,240
Thankfully,

574
00:26:53,199 --> 00:26:54,840
you've been there for her.

575
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,640
As I said,

576
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,039
I'll always be with her

577
00:26:59,399 --> 00:27:00,840
and give her my support.

578
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:05,520
That's all I need to hear.

579
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,120
It's time for me to start over.

580
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:10,760
See you later.

to discuss our wedding.

593
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,600
Okay.

594
00:27:58,559 --> 00:27:59,439
What did you say?

595
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,240
I'm not a kid anymore.

596
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:03,600
It's time I had my family.

597
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:05,399
They will be here to settle everything.

598
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,000
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

599
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,360
We've been living together for so long.

600

It's only natural that we get married.

Lu Tian,

602
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,279
you can't decide on everything
without asking for my opinion.

603
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,319
What's wrong?

604
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,640
I am discussing it with you now, right?

605
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,880
Your parents are coming tomorrow,

606
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,079
and we're only discussing it now?

607
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:30,520
Where are you going?

608
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,720
I'm sleeping in the living room tonight.

609
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,279
I don't want to argue with you.

610

Hey...

611
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,760
Why did you get so upset?

612
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,799
Isn't it normal

613
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,240
to meet the parents
before getting married?

614
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,199
Why are you so upset?

615
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:45,240
It's too soon.

616
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,360
It's not the right time.

617
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,799
So when is the right time?

618
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,399
Or maybe

619
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,199
you never want to marry me.

620
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,399
Say whatever you want.

621
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,240
I am not meeting your parents tomorrow.

622
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:58,640
Tell them I say sorry.

623
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,640
I get it.

624
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:05,199
You can stay.

625
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,679
I'll go.

626
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,799
Come on. Drink up!

627
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,279
Don't be such a wimp.

628
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,159
Can't you handle some drink?

629
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:01,840
Drink up!

630
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,159
We're getting wasted tonight!

631
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,760
Drink up!

632
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,399
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

633
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:23,760
Xuezhou?

634
00:30:25,399 --> 00:30:27,039
What took you so long?

635
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:30,000
Allow me to introduce her.

636
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:32,799
This is my girlfriend, Lin Xuezhou.

637
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,600
Madam, do you need a drink?

638
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:36,760
Nice to meet you.

639
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,679
Sorry, but Lu Tian is drunk.

640
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,159
I should take him home.

641
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:42,360
Come on.

642
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:43,880
I'm not going home.

643
00:30:44,439 --> 00:30:46,760
If I went home,
we'd get into another quarrel.

644
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:49,960
Lu Tian, you're drunk.

645
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:51,559
Let's talk when we go home, okay?

646
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:52,319
Come on.

647
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,840
I'm not going anywhere!

648
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I want to make it clear right here!

649
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,199
This relationship is exhausting.

650
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,199
What do you mean?

651
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,279
Ever since we started dating,

652
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:05,640
I've always listened to you.

653
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,600
I was worried the slightest mistake

654
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,559
would upset you.

655
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,559
I trod carefully every day

656
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,279
and tried my best to
guess what you want and like.

657
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:16,000
I wished I could just

658
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:17,720
make a note of everything on my hand.

659
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:19,399
What about you?

660
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:23,640
You only care about yourself

661
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,520
and your career.

662
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,360
You never care about me!

663
00:31:31,159 --> 00:31:31,760
What's wrong?

664
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,640
- I don't have a place in your heart.
- I don't know either.

665
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:39,679
You never care.

666
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,240
You never care about me at all.

667
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:46,600
Sorry, Lu Tian is really drunk now.

668
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,360
Please look after him

669
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,760
and send him home later.

670
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,279
Sure.

671
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:53,960
Stop drinking.
You should go home with her.

672
00:31:54,199 --> 00:31:54,960
Yeah.

673
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:56,679
Take it easy.

674
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,159
Keep yourself warm.

675
00:31:58,159 --> 00:31:59,360
I got it.
