Dr. Xing,
don't just look at the X-ray image.

11
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:21,879
Look at us too.

12
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:29,520
The X-ray image is more interesting.
I'll look at it first.

13
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,520
He's shy.

14
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:37,560
Hello, Wei.

15
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:38,560

Okay. I'll be there at once.

18
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:50,749
Dr. Xing, thank you for today.

19
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,971
Although there's nothing wrong

20
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,199
with your physical examination today,
if you feel unwell,

21
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,439
visit me at the hospital at once.

22
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,560
Mr. Wei, see you tomorrow.

23
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,630
Have a rest tomorrow.
Take it as a replacement leave.

24
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:01,639
Thank you, Mr. Wei.

25
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,240
Mr. Wei.

26
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,280
Mr. Wei.

27
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:21,520
Mr. Wei.

28
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,319
Mr. Wei.

29
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,840
Are you okay?

30
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:33,479
I'm fine. Are you okay?

31
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,360
I'm fine too.

32
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,439
What were the two of you doing?

33
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:45,680
Fast and Furious?

34
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,919
Yuan Xia's car was tampered with.

35
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,719
I suspect that she was targeted
by Zhou Wei

36
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:52,470
due to what happened
in the bar last night.

37
00:03:52,571 --> 00:03:53,590
He wouldn't go that far.

38
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:55,159
We are under the rule of law now.

39
00:03:55,171 --> 00:03:56,840
You can't just kill someone
as you please.

40
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,680
Moreover, you were in the car too.

41
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,520
With your dad's will as a safety amulet,

42
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,879
Zhou Wei has no reason to kill you

43
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:03,319
before the next Board Meeting.

44
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,800
If you die...

45
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,599
No. I'm just saying
that if anything happens to you,

46
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:10,719
all 54% shares of the MU Group

47
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:12,520
will be donated to charity.

48
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,879
Zhou Wei is not a fool.

49
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,040
I got into her car by chance.

50
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,240
Zhou Wei wouldn't have known

51
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,600
that I would be in Yuan Xia's car.

52
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,600
Based on the condition of the car,

53
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:23,000
the person who tampered with the car
wanted to kill Yuan Xia.

54
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,057
Even if she didn't die,
she would be severely hurt.

55
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,720
Does Yuan Xia know about it?

56
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:35,199
The less she knows, the safer she is.

57
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:36,920
I'm just worried

58
00:04:38,714 --> 00:04:40,430
that if she continues staying
by my side,

59
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,639
she'll eventually...

60
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:52,560
It's time to make a decision.

(The Gears of Fate Has Begun to Turn)

- Your car is totaled.

63
00:05:30,514 --> 00:05:32,114
- Compensate me.
- I'll compensate you.

64
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:36,120
I'll compensate you.

65
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,920
My phone too.

66
00:05:43,485 --> 00:05:45,114
I'm sure there's
a silver lining to this.

67
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,199

still works.)

Are you looking for me? Come in.

71
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:20,279
It's okay.

72
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:21,920
Some urgent came up and

73
00:06:22,057 --> 00:06:23,240
I have to go out for a while.

74
00:06:25,228 --> 00:06:26,310
I have a present for you.

75
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,800
You have to take good care of it.

76
00:06:33,057 --> 00:06:34,870
(I wonder what happened
to that young boy)

77
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:36,600
(and Mr. Heng who gave me the phone.)

78
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:56,680
I...

79
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:59,279
I have been fired?

How dare he fire me?

84
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,750
How could he fire me just like that?

85
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,279
How could he?

86
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,480
Even if he wants to fire me,
he has to give me a reason.

87
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,839
Yuan, are you here
to eat dumplings?

88
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:24,399
No.

89
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:25,810
I'm rushing to the company. Thank you.

93
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,319
Why did you fire me?

94
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,000
Do I need a reason to fire you?

95
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:45,079
I've had enough of you.

96
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:46,749
You are so controlling of me.

97
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,485
And that's very annoying.
Do you know that?

98
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:50,759
Also, have you forgotten

99
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:53,279
that I almost died because of you?

100
00:08:00,142 --> 00:08:01,950
I've specifically asked
our Finance Department

101
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:04,759
to give you the 2N+1 compensation.

102
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,279
For the sake
of our two years of friendship,

103
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,839
let's settle this amicably.

(Lancheng Bank)

105
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,639
Should I thank you

106
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,399
for being so generous?

107
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,040
Yuan Xia,
there's no need to reject the money.

108
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,360
You agreed to become my assistant

109
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,800
because of the money too, right?

110
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:27,519
Take the money and leave.

111
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,639
I'm paying this money to buy my freedom.

112
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:39,440
Of course I won't reject the money.

113
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,159
If it wasn't for money,

114
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,750
how do you think I endured you
for the past two years?

115
00:08:43,971 --> 00:08:45,670
At first, I thought
that you were just lazy

116
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:46,840
but still a decent person.

117
00:08:46,942 --> 00:08:48,840
I even worried
about the situation you were in.

118
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,559
But now, I think you deserve everything
that's happening to you.

119
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,789
Miss Yuan, don't be

120
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,740
so foolhardy just because
Mr. Wei is being nice.

121
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:56,440
Did I allow you to speak?

122
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:01,679
I want to hear

123
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,080
how much resentment you've accumulated
against me over the years.

124
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,759
I have nothing to say
to a person like you.

125
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,080
What is it?

126
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,639
You have nothing to say, right?

127
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,240
Why aren't you leaving?

128
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,320
What are you doing?

129
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:30,080
Are you trying to scam me?

130
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,080
Yuan Xia.

131
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,120
Yuan Xia.

132
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,200
Yuan Xia!

133
00:09:39,542 --> 00:09:41,360
Don't just stand there!
Call the ambulance!

134
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,080
Yuan Xia.

135
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:51,399
Yuan Xia, don't scare me, okay?

136
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:52,960

(Fu Ming Hospital)

138
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,200
Ms. Wang.

139
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,480
Let her do

140
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,440
a brain CT scan later.

141
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,600
There's no need to refer her
to another doctor.

142
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,860
I'll look at the scan myself.

143
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:13,559
Okay.

144
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:14,279
Thank you.

145
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:19,559
Dr. Xing.

146
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,720
What is it?

147
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:26,159
Actually, today is my...

148
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:27,080
Your birthday, right?

149
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,279
I know. I've prepared a gift for you.

150
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,120
So, you remember.

151
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,080
Then tonight, I...

152
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,360
I remember the birthday
of everyone in our department.

153
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:39,200
Did you not buy this eye cream

154
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,720
just for me?

155
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,720
I bought a gift for the matron
for her birthday.

156
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,942
I bought two pieces for 20% off.

157
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,399
She loves the eye cream.
I'm sure you'll like it too.

158
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:47,840
You'll love it.

159
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:57,799
Wei.

160
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,320
How's Yuan Xia?

161
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,171
She's fine.

162
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,320
She fainted because
of emotional stress and hypoglycemia.

163
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,030
I've arranged a full body check-up
for her. I'll get the result tomorrow.

164
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:05,840
That's good.

165
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:07,440
By the way,

166
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:09,000
why did she suddenly pass out?

167
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,639
Was Zhou Wei behind it again?

168
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:16,360
It was me this time.

169
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,240
I fired her.

170
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:22,679
Wei Ziqi, you make me speechless.

171
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:24,200
The Board Meeting will commence soon.

172
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,485
You have to be more cautious
for the next two days, right?

173
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,000
Why do you have to hurt
both her and you?

174
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,360
Moreover, I really don't think

175
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,279
that Zhou Wei would do something
against the law.

176
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,840
You don't know
Zhou Wei well enough.

177
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,639
Zhou Wei is willing
to do anything for money.

178
00:11:35,685 --> 00:11:38,639
Death awaits me at the Board Meeting
that will happen in a few more days.

179
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,799
Before that, he won't do anything to me.

180
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:41,840
But for Yuan Xia,

181
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,720
he won't show her any mercy.

182
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:45,320
And I can't guarantee

183
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:47,159
that she'll be as lucky next time.

184
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:49,879
By doing this

185
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,159
at this critical time,

186
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,120
you'll rouse Zhou Wei's suspicion.

187
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,039
So, before I can take down Zhou Wei
once and for all,

188
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:58,879
I hope that Yuan Xia can continue
staying at the hospital.

189
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:00,240
Take good care of her for me.

190
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,639
That's easy.
She can stay in the VIP ward.

191
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,720
I'll reserve the ward
if you are willing to pay for it.

192
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:07,000
But I'm afraid that she won't agree
to stay in the hospital.

193
00:12:10,485 --> 00:12:11,360
What are you thinking?

194
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,120
You have to keep her in the hospital.

195
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,559
I'll leave it to you.

196
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:16,240
Okay?

197
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,120
No.

198
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,580
(Indoor Parking Lot,
Physical Examination Center)

199
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,120
You are awake.

200
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,639
Do you feel better now?

201
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,919
I'm fine.

202
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:56,000
I feel dizzy

203
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,399
because I just woke up.

204
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:01,320
Dr. Xing, what's wrong with me?

205
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:07,000
Yuan Xia.

206
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,279
Actually, you have...

207
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:14,679
You have...

208
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:34,360
Actually,
there's nothing wrong with you.

209
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,559
If there's nothing wrong with me,

210
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,080
why did I pass out?

211
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,200
Because...

212
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,679
Because...

213
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:49,879
There's nothing wrong with you.

214
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:51,759
You just need to take a good rest.

215
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,960
Is that it?

216
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,840
How can I contact your family?

217
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:00,759
I'm all alone.

218
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,200
If there's anything,
you can just be frank with me.

219
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,639
Is there something wrong with my body?

220
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,440
No.

221
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:12,149
Your body is healthy.

222
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,428
There's nothing wrong with you.

223
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,279
Why do you want
to contact my family, then?

224
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:23,457
(Possibly pancreatic cancer
with multiple enlarged lymph nodes.)

225
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,480
Dr. Xing.

226
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,550
This is not your medical report,
Yuan Xia. You...

227
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:28,919
You don't have to comfort me.

228
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,039
I want to be alone for a while.

229
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,399
I'm an evil person.

230
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,679
I'm an evil person.

231
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,140
(Possibly pancreatic cancer
with multiple enlarged lymph nodes.)

232
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:12,399
Hello.

233
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:14,279
Yuan Xia, is that you?

234
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,440
Who are you?

235
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:17,399
Is your current time

236
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:19,200
twelve o'clock on March 3, 2024?

237
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:21,480
I have something important to tell you.

238
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,799
Remember.

239
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,960
On December 31, 2024,

240
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,080
do not go to the Lakeside Hotel
to look for Wei Ziqi.

241
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,639
I know that I'm not making sense.

242
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:29,960
But you have to believe me.

243
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,360
Otherwise, your life will be in danger.

244
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,440
My life is already in danger now.

245
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,390
If you are trying to scam me,
save it.

246
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:36,679
Stop calling me.

247
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:39,200
I don't even have the money
to save my life!

248
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,799
(Change of Personnel Announcement)
A personnel change?

249
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:49,480
Why did he fire

250
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,679
Yuan Xia at this critical moment?

251
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,670
Isn't that too much of a coincidence?

252
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,679
Mr. Zhou.

253
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,480
Ziqi. Why are you here so late at night?

254
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,480
I want to buy
a new limited edition sports car.

255
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:09,039
But those obstinate financiers of yours

256
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:10,440
are not willing to give me the funds.

257
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,360
Who did something so foolish?
Fire them tomorrow.

258
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:15,080
It's just a car.

259
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,039
I'll ask someone

260
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:18,600
to deliver it personally to you
tomorrow in the afternoon.

261
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,919
That's more like it.

262
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,840
I've inherited this company from my dad.

263
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,600
So, the company's money is my money.

264
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,480
Is it wrong of me to spend my own money?

265
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,279
Not at all.

266
00:16:30,485 --> 00:16:31,790
Don't care about what others say.

267
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:33,080
After the Board Meeting

268
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,159
next Tuesday,

269
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,480
no one will tell you what to do anymore

270
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,000
after you take over the company.

271
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:41,840
I need to be alive

272
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:45,200
to take over the company, right?

273
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,260
What nonsense are you talking about?

274
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:50,000
You know my assistant, right?

275
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,840
I asked her to take me home.

276
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,879
But she was rushing
to meet her blind date.

277
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,679
She took a detour
and got us into an accident.

278
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:57,799
I almost died.

279
00:16:58,279 --> 00:16:59,080
Really?

280
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,639
Are you hurt?

281
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:01,320
I'm fine.

282
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,440
Why didn't you tell me

283
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:04,799
about something so serious?

284
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:05,799
I did.

285
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,759
When I came back,
I asked HR to fire her

286
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:08,839
right away.

287
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,559
Forget it.

288
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:13,839
That's not important.

289
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,279
I just need you to tell me

290
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:19,480
when I can get
my limited-edition sports car.

291
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:21,839
I want to hold a racing party
with my friends.

292
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:23,039
Don't worry.

293
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,680
When have I ever disappointed you?

294
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:30,640
You are the best.

295
00:17:30,942 --> 00:17:32,000
I'll get going now.

296
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,119
Bye.

297
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,720
Is he really dumb

298
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:48,599
or is it just an act?

299
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:50,039
If he's just acting,

300
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,039
then he's really hard on himself.

301
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,640
It has been 11 years

302
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,880
since Mr. Wei Senior passed away.

303
00:17:57,942 --> 00:18:00,200
Besides, Lin Yu has stayed
by his side the entire time.

304
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,000
He has never made a slip.

305
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:03,440
So, I still think

306
00:18:03,571 --> 00:18:05,680
that it's just a coincidence
that he fired Yuan Xia.

307
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,759
He compensated his assistant too well.

308
00:18:10,085 --> 00:18:12,510
We'll find out soon enough
about his relationship with her.

309
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,079
Mr. Wei, you are so cool.

310
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:33,000
Mr. Li, here.

311
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,119
Why is Mr. Li here?

312
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:37,079
He made such a ruckus
at the bar last time.

313
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:38,680
How dare he show up here?

314
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:40,680
But I hear

315
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,279
that Mr. Li's dad is close to Mr. Zhou.

316
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:45,079
Did he complain against you
with Mr. Zhou?

317
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:47,349
MU will belong to me
in a few more days anyway.

318
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,285
I have nothing to fear.

319
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,240
He's just here to ruin the party.

320
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:50,960
Forget about him.

321
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,960
If we beat him up together,

322
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,680
I wonder how Mr. Zhou
will feel about it.

323
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,880
Mr. Wei, I need to talk to you.

324
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,400
(Why is she here?)

325
00:18:58,485 --> 00:19:00,228
(Shouldn't she be at the hospital?)

326
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:08,920
Why are you here? Trying to scam me?

327
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:10,920
No. I'm here to get my bank card.

328
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,119
You said that it was
compensation for firing me.

329
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,039
So, you are here for money.

330
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:18,680
You almost killed me.

331
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,839
And you want money from me?

332
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:24,119
Lin Yu!

333
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,079
I fired her, right?

334
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,319
Why is she still here?

335
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:28,359
Take her away at once!

336
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:31,880
Mr. Wei, just give me the money

337
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,200
and I promise
that I'll disappear from your sight.

338
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:35,799
You are so annoying.

339
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,160
You only think about money.

340
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:38,880
Leave at once.

341
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,942
She's here for money.

342
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,000
Mr. Wei.

343
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,480
Mr. Wei.

344
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:45,680
Mr. Wei, come out from the pool

345
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,400
and give me the money.
Then I'll leave at once.

346
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:48,599
Mr. Wei.

347
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,160
Give me...

348
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,880
Have you been fired?

349
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:58,759
It's okay.
It's not the end of the world.

350
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,400
I happen to need an assistant.

351
00:20:00,485 --> 00:20:01,550
How about you work for me?

352
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,759
Don't worry.

353
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,680
Compared to Mr. Wei,

354
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:07,640
I'm a gentle and generous man.

355
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,559
Don't touch me.

356
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:09,759
I don't have time for you.

357
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:11,160
Mr. Wei.

358
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,200
You just need to give me the money.

359
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:14,799
That money is very important to me.

360
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,200
I need the money to save myself.

361
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,279
To save yourself.

362
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,400
Wei Ziqi, that's wrong of you.

363
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,771
Why do you refuse to give her
the money to save herself?

364
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,750
Why do you need money?

365
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:25,759
I can give it to you.

366
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:27,279
Here. Drink this glass of wine.

367
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:28,079
Wait.

368
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,750
What is the meaning of this?

369
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,200
Are you going to protect
your subordinate again

370
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,742
like what you did in the bar last time?

371
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:36,839
She has been fired by you.

372
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,440
Do you want to get hit again?

373
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,519
You want the money?

374
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:44,440
Come here.

375
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,599
I'll tell you how you can get the money.

376
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,799
You really know how to have fun.

377
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,759
How is it? Is it fun?

378
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:02,319
Money to save yourself?

379
00:21:02,942 --> 00:21:04,480
What do you need to save yourself from?

380
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I need it to save my life.

381
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,799
I have terminal pancreatic cancer.

382
00:21:10,028 --> 00:21:11,828
I need to get treated
as soon as possible.

383
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:14,160
Mr. Wei, I beg you.

384
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,640
Can you give me the money?

385
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,079
Do you hear that?

386
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:19,319
She has terminal pancreatic cancer.

387
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,900
Aren't you going to give her the money?

388
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,640
So, you are going to die soon.

389
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,160
Are you dumb?

390
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:27,319
Do you actually believe her?

391
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,000
That's right. Who would believe her?

392
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,960
I don't believe you.

393
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,960
Mr. Wei.

394
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,759
Mr. Wei.

395
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,240
Mr. Wei.

396
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:47,839
Mr. Wei.

397
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,079
What can I do to make you
give me the money?

398
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:08,039
Finish this.

399
00:22:08,114 --> 00:22:09,630
Drink it and I'll give you the money.

400
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,440
Finish it?

401
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,799
He's setting her up to fail.

402
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:16,799
She can't possibly finish it.

403
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,142
Are you not going to drink it?

404
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,640
Then you can't get the money.

405
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,359
I'll drink it.

406
00:22:23,657 --> 00:22:24,790
She's really going to drink it.

407
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,000
She's desperate.

408
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:38,519
She's good at drinking.

409
00:22:47,714 --> 00:22:49,400
Did you ask me to come
to the company

410
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,759
just to choose an assistant?

411
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,599

470
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,759
is applying to MU

471
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,279
and becoming your assistant.

472
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,079
I didn't work so hard to learn

I needed money.

479
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:41,920

00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,920

484
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,920

485

that she had pancreatic cancer

00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,200

Misunderstood you?

550
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,279
Are you saying

551
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:19,599
that I've misunderstood you
for being loyal?

552
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:21,400
Lin Yu.

553
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,920
What's going on?

554
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:23,880
Lin Yu.

555
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,571
(Mr. Zhou Wei)

556
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:30,400
Mr. Zhou.

557
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,960
I'm Ziqi.

558
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,160
Ziqi.

559
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,799
Did you go on a ride to lure me out?

560
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,119
I never thought that you would
be so interested

561
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:41,430
in my relationship with Yuan Xia.

562
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,200
You took the bait so easily.

563
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,200
That's quite disappointing.

564
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,240
Wei Ziqi.

565
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:46,839
You have only two more days

566
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:48,359
to be so arrogant.

567
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:49,680
After the Board Meeting,

568
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,400
without your father's will
to protect you,

569
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,960
how long can you survive?

570
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:55,640
By the way,

571
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:57,960
there's something that you may not know.

572
00:30:58,359 --> 00:30:59,720
Your father's death

573
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:01,920
was not an accident.
