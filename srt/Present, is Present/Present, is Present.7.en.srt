1
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:07,599
(Are you Wei Ziqi?)

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,250
(I'm from the Criminal Investigation
Department of the Lancheng Division.)

3
00:00:10,257 --> 00:00:11,670
(I suspect that you're probably involved)

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:12,679
(in Yuan Xia's death.)

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,960
(Please cooperate with our investigation.)

6
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,280
(Dual space-time phone
interfered with Yuan Xia's choices)

7
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,560
(as well as making the future
unpredictable and variable.)

8
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,714
There are traces of blood.

9
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,719
(And I'm involved now.)

10
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:50,920
(While I'm cooperating
with the police investigation,)

11
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,679
(I hope Wei Ziqi in 2024)

12
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,880
(can protect Yuan Xia well.)

13
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:47,740
=Present, is Present=

14
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:58,799
Mr. Wei, you're so early.

15
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,480
Where are you going?

16
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,110
I'm going out to attend
to some business.

17
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,480
That's good. Get in my car.

18
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,040
From now on,

19
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,760
I'll be your driver.

20
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,280
No boss drives for his subordinates.

21
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,479
We're no longer in a simple

22
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:14,360
boss-subordinate relationship.

23
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,960
Have you forgotten? We're already...

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,280
It's all an act.

25
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,680
Aren't we acting for Xi Lin?

26
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:23,960
I'm talking about
the relationship of housemates.

27
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,520
Why are you so nervous?

28
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,039
Who's nervous?

29
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:28,400
If you're not, get in the car.

30
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,400
Fine.

31
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:07,759
Wait a minute.

32
00:03:08,885 --> 00:03:10,028
What are you trying to do?

33
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,680
I know you've been very concerned
about my emotions

34
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,479
since I fell in the water last time,

35
00:03:14,714 --> 00:03:17,750
fearing that I'd have some sort of fear
of the water, of the Lakeside Hotel,

36
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,599
of remembering that day's danger.

37
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:21,039
But I'm not that fragile.

38
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,439
I'm not afraid,

39
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,360
so you don't have to be either.

40
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,360
They say you have to
get up from where you fell.

41
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,639
When I learn to swim,

42
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,560
not to mention this pool,

43
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,599
I can conquer

44
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:34,840
the sea over there.

45
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:39,319
Hence,

46
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,680
you came here today to learn to swim

47
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:43,360
so I wouldn't have to worry about you.

48
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,759
Yes.

49
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,639
The crisis is not over

50
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:48,080
until Zhou Wei is arrested.

51
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:49,039
Until then,

52
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:51,039
I need to learn more
self-defense skills.

53
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,800
Why don't I just start with swimming?

54
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:56,000
I've hired a swimming instructor today,

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,828
so I should be able
to pick it up in no time.

56
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,360
You hired a swimming instructor?

57
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:00,840
A man or a woman?

58
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,879
A man.

59
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:06,360
From now on, please
call me Instructor Wei.

60
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,479
I'll go change first.

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,839
Give me your hands.

62
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:21,879
Relax.

63
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,720
Come on.

64
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,160
Very good.

The picture of you two together
is so beautiful.

I'm sorry, we're not cou...

Yes, we'd like to.

Why do you want to do this?

86
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:29,360
This is a hotel of Xi Lin's family.

87
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,000
We need to put on a full show.

88
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,360
Can we use the thing

00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,000

91
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:37,639
Yes.

92
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,759
Ziqi,

93
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,759
why didn't you tell me you were coming?

94
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,839
We're here on a date.

95
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,959
We'd like to spend some time alone.

96
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,079
You just swam, didn't you?
That's pretty exhausting.

97
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,839
Why don't we have afternoon tea?

98
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,920
No need for afternoon tea.

99
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,000
We've got a couple's
photo shoot coming up.

100
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:03,600
Ziqi wanted to do it,

101
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,040
so he booked a photographer.

102
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,839
That's how it is

103
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:09,399
at the beginning of a relationship.

104
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,959
You can have as much fun as you want,

105
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,199
I don't mind at all.

106
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:15,399
As long as I have

107
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,399
the final rights to him.

108
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,879
If you'd like afternoon tea,

109
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:23,240
I'll have someone arrange it

110
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,480
and book you a room.

111
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,600
Okay, I won't bother you anymore.

112
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,639

Why should I?

116
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,600
I just want to remind you

117
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:48,200
that a man without self-respect
is like a rotten cabbage.

How about this?
I'll leave you my contact details.

132
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:24,542
I'll send you the photos by courier
when I'm done with the editing.

133
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,390
I'll add you on WeChat
and send you the address.

134
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:26,914
Okay.

135
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:30,680
I got it.

136
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,630
I'll get going now.

137
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:32,800
Okay, thank you.

138
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,560
You're welcome.

139
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,079
Yuan Xia.

140
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,160
Pei Shen.

141
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:45,639
What a coincidence.

142
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:46,800
Why are you here?

143
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:49,800
I...

144
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,439
We're here on a date.

145
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,079
Hi, Mr. Wei.

146
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,170
I'm Pei Shen from the R&D Department
of the MU branch.

147
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,990
I have never seen you in the company,
but I didn't expect to see you here.

148
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,190
We have some date arrangements later.

149
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,371
What else can we do for you?

150
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,360
No.

151
00:08:03,828 --> 00:08:05,190
We'll be going if there's nothing.

152
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:25,240
Well... What should we do now?

153
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,759
Are we really going
to sleep here tonight?

154
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:28,519
Of course.

155
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:30,519
I've paid for it.

156
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,240
You don't think

157
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,639
I'm going to do anything to you, do you?

158
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,039
I...

159
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,279
One night

160
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,360
won't take long.

161
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,879
If not,

162
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,799
we'll continue after Xi Lin leaves.

163
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:50,080
Wei Ziqi.

164
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,670
All right, I won't tease you anymore.

165
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,879
Okay, it's getting late.

166
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,480
Wash up early.

167
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:02,480
I'm sleeping on the couch tonight.

168
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm not sleepy yet. You go ahead.

169
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,720
Okay.

170
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:21,600
I've specially asked the head chef

171
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:23,240
to make a couple's set menu for you two.

172
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:24,639
I hope you like it.

173
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,279
Thank you.

174
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,440
Is that a blanket on your couch?

175
00:09:31,314 --> 00:09:33,510
I don't think it's appropriate
for you two to sleep apart

176
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,730
right after you've been together.

177
00:09:34,742 --> 00:09:35,390
Who's there?

178
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,039
Well...

179
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:37,559
She was watching a film there

180
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,028
and I was afraid she'd catch a cold.

181
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,759
Thanks. We've eaten already.

182
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:44,039
You've eaten already?

183
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,080
Well, consider it a supper.

184
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:47,120
Or

185
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,480
you can invite me to join you.

186
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,240
Didn't we talk about this downstairs?

187
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,000
It's a wonderful night to cherish.

188
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,159
We're not eating.

189
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:57,799
It's so wasteful.

190
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:59,360
Thank you.

191
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:17,960
Wei Ziqi,

192
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:19,320
are you...

193
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,799
Are you a very easy man?

194
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,080
You just opened the door

195
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,159
dressed like this?

196
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:29,639
Are you jealous?

197
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm not.

198
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,240
You... What are you doing?

199
00:10:48,257 --> 00:10:49,390
To avoid blowing things up.

200
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:51,639
Xi Lin won't give up.

201
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:56,279
Is she that free?

202
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:04,240
Would you like some dessert?

203
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,639
Something sweet makes you feel better.

204
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:06,200
Thank you.

205
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,879
Hi.

206
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:37,159
Here you go.

207
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,279
No, it can't go on like this.

208
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,159
What do you want to do?

209
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:43,799
I...

210
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:56,159
Yuan Xia.

211
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,080
No, Yuan Xia.

212
00:11:58,314 --> 00:11:59,750
We're going to take it step by step.

213
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:01,039
Isn't it too soon

214
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:04,039
for you to go straight to this step?

215
00:12:05,628 --> 00:12:07,314
There's nothing wrong with that.

216
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,750
If we don't get to that step,

217
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:11,399
we really won't be able to sleep.

218
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,399
Really?

219
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,200
Hello, front desk?

220
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:18,759
Hi.

221
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:22,039
I need a lot of condoms.

222
00:12:22,171 --> 00:12:23,771
Please send them to my room. Thank you.

223
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:27,480
I...

224
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,360
I'd like to see who's better than who.

225
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,320
Hi, here are your condoms.

226
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:51,960
Why did you call them
to send condoms over?

227
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,240
That's so embarrassing.

228
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:04,399
See, you need me to do it.

229
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,159
You're awesome, Ms. Yuan.

230
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,120
All right, let's sleep.

231
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:44,720
I'll go up first.

232
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:46,200
You come up in a few minutes.

233
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:47,240
Wait.

234
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:49,120
Why?

235
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,200
It's better if we split up

236
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,070
so that colleagues
don't get the wrong idea.

237
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,960
Wrong idea about what?

238
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,879
Didn't you say we're just in a

239
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:56,240
boss-subordinate relationship?

240
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:57,200
I...

241
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:59,039
I understand.

242
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,240
You make a clear distinction
between work and personal matters.

243
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:05,440
You don't want colleagues
to put their minds on such gossip.

244
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,519
I willingly cooperate and respect you.

245
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:10,000
Thank you for your cooperation.

246
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,480
Now, our partnership with
Hill Capital has been secured.

247
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,519
PR, get ready to find

248
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:26,519
a right opportunity
to announce that we're going

249
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:29,159
to restart the research
on quantum communication technology.

250
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:29,799
Okay.

251
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,279
R&D,

252
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,399
your staff should be in place
as soon as possible.

253
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,600
Whether it's internal recruitment
or open recruitment,

254
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,919
just speed it up.

255
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:37,399
Okay.

256
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:39,840
Now that the theory of
quantum entanglement has been verified,

257
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,159
it means that our project

258
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:42,720
has the potential to be fully realized.

259
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:45,039
If we can apply quantum tunneling

260
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:46,360
to communication technology,

261
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,000
we will achieve a leap forward
not only in speed

262
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,000
but also in security.

263
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,480
Excuse me, Mr. Wei.

264
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,799
I have to attend to something.

265
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,559
Go.

266
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,759
Do you have any questions?

267
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:58,519
No.

268
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:07,080
(Has something happened to him?)

269
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:09,720
(Why hasn't he called me
in so many days?)

270
00:15:15,257 --> 00:15:16,630
(Do you have time on the weekend?)

271
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,657
(I'd like to ask you a favor about what
I mentioned on our previous blind date.)

272
00:15:19,714 --> 00:15:21,142
(Let's meet at Madam Sun's Wonton.)

273
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,519
(It's okay if you're busy.)

274
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:25,559
(It's all right.)

275
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,360
(I'm going to Madam Sun's at noon)

276
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,457
(to give a full moon gift
to her little granddaughter.)

277
00:15:52,971 --> 00:15:54,885
The CCTV footage of
the hotel is recovered.

278
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,720
It's Zhou Wei.

279
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,440
That explains the whole thing.

280
00:15:59,914 --> 00:16:02,030
(First, he pushed me
into the water at the hotel)

281
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:03,919
(and got the scent of
the hotel's campanula.)

282
00:16:04,228 --> 00:16:06,150
(Then, he went to my house
and rummaged around.)

283
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:09,759
(I sneezed as soon as I walked in)

284
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,200
because I smelled the campanula.

285
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,000
But the smell was very faint,

286
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,799
so I didn't react too much

287
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,240
and didn't think about it.

288
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,440
Sometimes, I can't figure out

289
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,360
why he tried to attack you

290
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,720
over and over again.

291
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:27,030
And he seemed to be
looking for something

292
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:29,240
when he was inside your house.

293
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:34,960
Yeah, I can't figure it out either.

294
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:38,240
Has Zhou Wei been looking for
the dual space-time phone?

295
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,639
Yuan Xia,

296
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,039
are you asleep?

297
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:43,960
I'm still up. I'm coming.

298
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,360
Yuan Xia, what's wrong?

299
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:56,960
Nothing.

300
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,399
Let me see.

301
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:05,920
It's nothing. It's just a scratch.

302
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,200
But your carpet gets dirty.

303
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:09,750
The carpet doesn't matter.

304
00:17:09,885 --> 00:17:11,960
Let's go downstairs
and I'll take care of your wound.

305
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:24,359
Madam Sun.

306
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:25,799
Yuan.

307
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:26,920
Where is the baby?

308
00:17:27,257 --> 00:17:29,457
She's been playing all morning.
She just fell asleep.

309
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,720
Have you eaten?

310
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,519
I haven't eaten.
I've asked Pei Shen to eat with me.

311
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:35,160
Good.

312
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,960
I'll prepare whatever you want.

313
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:41,400
Why is she crying again?

314
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,920
Madam Sun, take it.

315
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:44,270
A full moon gift for the baby.

316
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:45,519
No, don't spend money on this.

317
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:46,559
Just take it.

318
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:47,319
Go inside.

319
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:48,359
Thank you.

320
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,759
Coming, my girl.

321
00:17:52,228 --> 00:17:53,828
It's almost twelve o'clock at noon.

322
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:01,599
Hello.

323
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,240
You haven't called me for days.

324
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,640
Has something happened to you?

325
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:06,359
Something came up.

326
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,319
But it's been resolved.

327
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:09,160
That's good.

328
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:12,200
In fact, I've always wanted to ask you

329
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,519
why you told me

330
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:14,759
that I couldn't leave my job,

331
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,839
especially not leaving Wei Ziqi.

332
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:18,839
Besides,

333
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,200
you've repeatedly told me
to avoid danger

334
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,599
as if you know exactly
what happened to me.

335
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:26,119
Is it because

336
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,359
you've always been by my side?

337
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:31,160
Who are you?

338
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:40,240
Loft 307.

339
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:03,200
It's you?

340
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,720
Is this Uncle Heng's son?

341
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:20,920
Yuan has run away.

342
00:19:21,057 --> 00:19:21,920
Where is his daughter?

343
00:19:22,171 --> 00:19:23,500
We can take her for the debt.

344
00:19:23,514 --> 00:19:24,085
Okay.

345
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,200
Boss, is that his daughter?

346
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,400
I think so.

347
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:37,079
Dad, Mom, I'm back.

348
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:39,279
Brother, I forgot my key again.
Please open the door for me.

349
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:40,200
You're acting like it.

350
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,519
I've been here for so many days.

351
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:42,790
Since when do people live here?

352
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,600
What do you want?

353
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,720
I'm warning you.

354
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:47,119
My dad, my mom, and
my elder brother are at home.

355
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:48,400
My brother is amazing.

356
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,039
Go ahead.

357
00:19:49,542 --> 00:19:50,550
Keep making up the story.

358
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,559
Show me where your brother is.

359
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,720
Brother, open the door!

360
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,720
Next time you forget your keys,

361
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,885
you don't have to come home.

362
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:00,359
I got it.

363
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:05,240
It's you, isn't it?

364
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,799
In my time and space.

365
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:11,400
Where are you?

366
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,359
Have you always been around me,

367
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:15,319
by my side?

368
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:16,799
No.

369
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,359
I didn't see you again

370
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,359
after I left

371
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:22,920
until you had your accident.

372
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,980
(Year 2024, Year 2025)

373
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:37,279
(Yuan Xia,)

374
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:39,119
(I'm sorry.)

375
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:42,119
(It's the only way)

376
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,160
(I can make up for the time
I missed with you.)

377
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,559
Are you Uncle Heng's son?

378
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:08,400
Brother, I know you.

379
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,720
Uncle Heng has told me
about you many times.

380
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:12,559
Brother,

381
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:14,880
Uncle Heng

382
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:16,799
didn't come back with you?

383
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,740
(Eszopiclone tablets)

384
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:39,359
Sleeping pills?

385
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:43,319
Brother.

386
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:44,480
Brother, are you asleep?

387
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,799
Get some sleep.

388
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,319
Can you call the teacher for me

389
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:53,640
and ask for a leave of absence?

390
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:55,359
Those debt collectors

391
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:56,960
must still be at my door.

392
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,319
I'm afraid to stay home alone at night.

393
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,359
Can I stay with you for one more night?

394
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,599
Okay.

395
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:25,960
Brother, I'm a little hungry.

396
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,039
I've got an exam tonight,

397
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,599
so if I'm late,

398
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:55,720
just leave the key

399
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,799
behind the letterbox at the door.

400
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,839
You must remember to put it there.

401
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,519
I still don't dare to stay home alone.

402
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:04,319
Brother!

403
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,000
Brother knows what's going on around me

404
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,240
so well,

405
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:20,160
he must be around me.

406
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,359
Who could he be?

407
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:28,160
Madam Sun.

408
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,039
You're so early.

409
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,200
Good. You look good.

410
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,400
Come in.

411
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,160
Yuan Xia, please sit down.

412
00:23:51,971 --> 00:23:53,371
I'm sorry
for the trouble this time.

413
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,920
My family is pushing me too hard,

414
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:56,759
so I had to use you as a shield.

415
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,519
It's okay. I promised
to help you last time.

416
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,359
Well, will Mr. Wei be upset?

417
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:07,359
If he knows about it,

418
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,200
I think he will.

419
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,599
Here you go.

420
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,542
Madam Sun.

421
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,039
Be careful.

422
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:12,759
Thank you.

423
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,039
Enjoy your meal.

424
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,519
Have a nice chat.

425
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:20,960
Let's eat first.

426
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:34,359
Don't worry, no next time.

427
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,440
I'm ready to tell my family

428
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,960
that I have a crush on a girl.

429
00:24:39,167 --> 00:24:40,687
So I won't bother you again

430
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,119
with this kind of thing.

431
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,440
Congratulations.

432
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,400
Congratulations to you and Mr. Wei, too.

433
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:53,799
Do you frequent this place?

434
00:24:53,857 --> 00:24:56,000
The wontons here are
different from the ones outside.

435
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,839
It's in a red soup with chili.

436
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:00,599
I don't frequent it,

437
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,319
but I had it a long time ago.

438
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:05,119
When I went to the branch,

439
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,171
I couldn't stop thinking
about this flavor.

440
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:10,720
Are you not used to it?

441
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:12,960
How could I not be used to it?

442
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,309
I love Madam Sun's wontons.

443
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,914
I've been eating it since I was a kid.

444
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,000
That's good.

445
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:20,359
By the way,

446
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,400
I have another thing to share with you.

447
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,670
My application for transfer
to the R&D Department

448
00:25:24,685 --> 00:25:26,110
at the head office has been approved.

449
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:27,720
We'll be colleagues from now on.

450
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,759
Colleagues?

451
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:29,480
Yes.

452
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:31,559
Please give me some guidance.

453
00:25:34,228 --> 00:25:36,720
Why did you suddenly want to
transfer to the R&D Department?

454
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,559
I've never heard you mention it before.

455
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:41,799
Because I wasn't sure.

456
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,110
I wanted to wait until
everything was finalized

457
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,485
before I shared it with you.

458
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,960
As for why,

459
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:48,440
it's because

460
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,519
I want to be acknowledged
by the girl I like.

461
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:55,519
I'll definitely confess

462
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,640
my love to her when I'm better.

463
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,960
I wish you success in advance.

464
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:00,960
Thank you.

465
00:26:07,142 --> 00:26:08,920
