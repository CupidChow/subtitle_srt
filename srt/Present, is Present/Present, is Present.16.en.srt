1
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:17,910
Yuan, come and eat!

2
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,160
Yuan, come and eat!

3
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,020
(Lancheng No. 1 High School)
(Name: Yuan Xia)

4
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,920
(I'll get it mailed)

5
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:22,150
(Time-Travel Phone Booth)
and postmarked later

6
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,310
so that he will receive it.

7
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,190
No, don't send it.

8
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,920
I won't let him be the first to hear

9
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,280
your confession to me.

10
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,450
(Sender: Yuan Xia; Recipient: Wei Ziqi)

11
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:38,440
(Pausing time for your loved ones)

12
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,590
(All of a sudden, I don't know
what to call you.)

13
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,030
(Hello, Wei Ziqi.)

14
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,280
(I am your girlfriend,)

15
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,390
(Yuan Xia.)

16
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,470
(The Wei Ziqi who I am addressing)

17
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:53,110
(is you, the one listening to
this recording right now.)

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,670
(The one)

19
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,440
(who brings me an umbrella
on rainy days,)

20
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,910
(who cooks for me,)

21
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,160
(who accompanies me to
the farmer's market,)

22
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,840
(and who spends time with me)

23
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,680
(to live every day to its fullest.)

24
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,160
(I thought long about making this call,)

25
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,030
(for there are things)

26
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,120
(I worry that I might not
get to tell you.)

27
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,280
Because I don't know

28
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,030
when you listen to this recording,

29
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:38,350
would I still be by your side?

30
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,120
(If I still am,)

31
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:44,240
(I think as you hear this recording,)

32
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,560
(you will be moved to tears)

33
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,240
(and rush over immediately)

34
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,680
(to kiss me, hug me, and lift me.)

35
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:53,880
(Would we have)

36
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,720
(gotten married by then?)

37
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,000
Since you like me so much,

38
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,470
I think you must have proposed already.

39
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:05,280
(If you haven't,)

40
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:08,070
(I can give you a heads-up in advance.)

41
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,350
Wei Ziqi,

42
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,310
I do.

43
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,030
(If I'm no longer around,)

44
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,350
(please find the courage to move on.)

45
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,350
(Don't stay in the past for me.)

46
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,560
The past was wonderful,

47
00:03:31,575 --> 00:03:32,790
but we should leave it as that.

48
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,160
(I always believe)

49
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,590
(what you remember)

50
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,750
(will surely return.)

51
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,350
We might meet again

52
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,000
in another spacetime.

53
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:52,220
=Present, is Present=

54
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,270
Get some more sleep.

55
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,600
I'll watch over Wei.

56
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,360
Don't worry.

57
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,880
Do you still remember

58
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,070
the engraving on Yuan Xia's headstone?

59
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:20,070
Present, is present.

60
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,710
I am fortunate to have found you.

61
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,000
Ziqi,

62
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,000
it's late and you're going out?

63
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,070
Don't worry about me.

64
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,680
Should both of you work out,

65
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,880
Yuan Xia would be

66
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,950
happy to know that.

67
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,600
After tomorrow,

68
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:33,070
your memories created with Yuan Xia
over this year

69
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,950
will no longer exist.

70
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,950
Is this your decision?

71
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,360
Once you make this call tomorrow,

72
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,120
we will forget everything

73
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,920
about Yuan Xia.

74
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,630
In our memories,

75
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,310
she is just

76
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,680
Wei Ziqi's former assistant.

77
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,270
But what about you?

78
00:06:53,525 --> 00:06:54,710
What would that do to you?

79
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,440
Remembering her

80
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,070
or forgetting her,

81
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,120
both makes you suffer.

82
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:10,710
It's late.

83
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:11,710
You should head home.

84
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,150
I'll step out for some air.

85
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:30,860
=Episode 16=
(The Other Future)

86
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,260
(Tomb of Yuan Xia)

87
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:02,940
(Year 2024)

88
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,150
Hello, who is this?

89
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:14,880
Yuan.

90
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,000
I am your upstairs neighbor,

91
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,680
Mr. Heng's son.

92
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,670
Do you remember me?

93
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,910
Brother?

94
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,550
Of course I remember.

95
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,030
Are you back now?

96
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,120
Where have you been all these years?

97
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,480
When you left suddenly,

98
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,150
I worried about you for a long time.

99
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,270
I am so sorry, Yuan.

100
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,880
I promised to watch
a meteor shower with you,

101
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,880
yet we never did go.

102
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,600
Don't worry about it.

103
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,080
I am all grown up now,

104
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,725
I won't hold you against
anything like this.

105
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:48,960
Brother,

106
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,390
where are you now?

107
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,510
Are you with Mr. Heng?

108
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:55,270
No.

109
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,080
Actually, my dad

110
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,750
passed away.

111
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,480
I'm sorry to hear that. I...

112
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,720
It's alright.

113
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,240
That is already in the past.

114
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,510
The reason I'm calling you

115
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,480
is to ask for your help

116
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,630
with a few things.

117
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,030
Do you still remember

118
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,670
the phone that my dad gave you?

119
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,600
That was his last research project
before he passed.

120
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,670
It means a lot to me.

121
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,960
If so, brother,

122
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,150
give me your address.

123
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,360
I'll send you the phone.

124
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,720
I have long wanted to give it to you,

125
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,750
but all of you have moved away.

126
00:09:43,425 --> 00:09:45,080
It's okay. You don't have
to send it to me.

127
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,030
Do you remember the attic?

128
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,510
Just place it there.

129
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,225
The key is still in the same place.

130
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,080
After placing the phone,

131
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,150
just put the key back where it belongs.

132
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,880
Sure, no problem.

133
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,430
By the way, Yuan,

134
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,270
have you been

135
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,510
in any danger lately?

136
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,360
How do you know?

137
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,080
My dad used to work with
MU Communications Group,

138
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,120
so he heard some news.

139
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,910
What happened to you

140
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,670
was not an accident.

141
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,720
Someone is targeting you on purpose.

142
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,750
I suspected as much.

143
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,910
I discovered significant problems

144
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,270
in the accounts of a senior executive.

145
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,430
Yuan,

146
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,080
you should resign as soon as possible.

147
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,750
Resign?

148
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,000
Yes.

149
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,510
Bring the evidence that you found

150
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,150
and negotiate with Wei Ziqi.

151
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,480
Trust me,

152
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,550
no matter the conditions put forward,

153
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,430
he will agree to it.

154
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,550
Wei Ziqi can't even protect himself,
let alone others.

155
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,910
What can he promise me?

156
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,880
He is protected by his father's will.

157
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,670
Zhou Wei won't do anything to him.

158
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,150
But for you,

159
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,360
it's dangerous for you to stay.

160
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,430
The best way out right now is

161
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,120
to take his money

162
00:11:06,525 --> 00:11:08,175
and leave the country
till things die down.

163
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,390
Come back in two years.

164
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,200
Of course.

165
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,120
If you think

166
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,720
your boss is treating you well,

167
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,550
stick around during
these hard times then.

168
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,430
Never!

169
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,670
I'm so worn out from this job.

170
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,225
I can't wait
to take the money and leave.

171
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,790
Then do as I say.

172
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,630
I won't do you harm.

173
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,200
I hope that the next time I see you,

174
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,080
you'll be in good health,

175
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,200
sunning yourself in the backyard,

176
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:37,480
drinking coffee
with friends and chatting.

177
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,875
You're with someone you love...

178
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,000
The call dropped?

179
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:47,390
(Hello.)

180
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,880
(The number you have dialed
is unavailable.)

181
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,550
(Please check the number and try again.)

182
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,510
You're with someone you love,

183
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,630
doing every little thing
to leave no regrets.

184
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,720
He will ask you to eat,

185
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:10,480
watch the sunrise with you,

186
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,480
and the sunset.

187
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,200
He will complain about
going out on a rainy day

188
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,390

Regarding Yuan Xia's termination,

216
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,340
has the HR department notified her?

217
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:17,740
Yes, they have.

218
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,150
What did she say?

219
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,860
It's just like resigning, she said.

220
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,460
She wanted to leave the job anyway,

221
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,700
and now there is extra compensation.

222
00:14:24,775 --> 00:14:26,310
She was satisfied with the amount

223
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:27,925
and had me thank you
for your generosity.

224
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,150
She also said the weather was too hot

225
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,260
and didn't want to make a trip.

226
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,570
She requested for the money
to be transferred to her account.

227
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,030
Why are you here still?

228
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,430
Go transfer the money to her.

229
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,100
What if she regrets it
and asks for more?

230
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,340
Are you the one paying by then?

231
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,270
(Payment received. Thank you, boss.)

embezzlement of company funds.

00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,020
Alright, thanks.

Everyone,

254
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,740
Zhou Wei took advantage of his position

255
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,825
to embezzle company funds and
misappropriate assets.

256
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:09,870
The evidence is solid.

257
00:17:10,325 --> 00:17:12,120
All evidence has been handed over
to the police.

258
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,950
I should have killed you
since the start.

259
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:17,220
You think you
can take me down, and relax?

260
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,110
No one can protect you.

261
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,300
You are just the first in line.

00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,260

263

324
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,625
We can come up with a few samples first.

325
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,350

335
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:25,780
get in the car.

What's with all this?

337
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,740

about Yuan Xia.

Look at this super handsome guy.

343
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,950

standing in the crowd,

344
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,680
There's this air around him.
Look at his gaze.

345
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:55,780

00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,060

350
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:02,300
This is all information
from the past year about Yuan Xia.

351
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,700
Though you have never

352
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,190
talked to us about it in this past year,

353
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,350
Xing Nan and I both know

354
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,670
how much you care about her.

355
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,020
I happened to see a photographer friend

356
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:13,500
posting photos of her
and Yuan Xia on social media.

357
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:15,910
I contacted her in confidence,

358
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:18,390
in your name of
the brother in the attic

359
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:19,870
to help take care of her.

360
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,260
Take a look.

361
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,830
These are updates of her
in the past year.

362
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,150
Is she well?

363
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,390
Is she happy?

364
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,390
She's happy and healthy.

365
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,390
Is that all?

366
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,910
You don't want to know
about anything else?

367
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,980
It's enough for me that she is well,

368
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:45,870
I don't need to look.

369
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,110
You don't need to look?

370
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,700

00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:05,820
(File holder)

374
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:07,910
Ni Ning, you are right.

375
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,150
I don't dare to look.

376
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:13,110
Last time, I was afraid to know
where she was,

377
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,190
for I would want to look for her.

378
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,430
Now, I'm afraid that

379
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,460
she already has someone to love,

380
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,540
and I would disturb their lives.

381
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,780
I don't dare to go out these days even.

382
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:28,780
I only traveled between
my home and my company,

383
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:31,150
for I fear I will see her on the streets

384
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:33,630
passing by and holding
another man's hand.

385
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,590
I knew very well

386
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:36,980
that as I fired her,

387
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,390
she would probably hate me.

388
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:42,260
She might not even

389
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,780
remember who I am anymore.

390
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,110
But I still remember

391
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,110
every little bit of my time with her.

392
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,060
It was all too wonderful.

393
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,700
It was so great

394
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:00,150
that it made me feel as though
it was just a dream.

395
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,670
Rather than doubting everything,

396
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:04,350
might as well go see for yourself.

397
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:05,630
As far as I know,

398
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,950
Yuan Xia is single now.

399
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:09,540
More importantly,

400
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,700
she has decided to settle in China.

401
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,060
Regarding Xi Lin and Xi Kun,

402
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,350
that all has been solved.

403
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,110
Since you still love her so much,

404
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,540
you should go and find her.

405
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,540
Don't waste more time.

406
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,390
I'll get going.

407
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:11,670
Yuan.

408
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:14,670
Morning.

409
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:15,700
Morning.

410
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,500
I'm quite curious.

411
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,500
What dreams are you having every night?

412
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,590
You cried so hard every time.

413
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,430
I wonder too.

414
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,590
If my physical examination report
didn't come back normal,

415
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,350
I would suspect that

416
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:35,110
I might have been voodooed.

417
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:38,540
As someone who has
never been in love,

418
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,740
why would I have dreams

419
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,300
of a man with a blurry face,

420
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,390
where we fight through life and
death for a bitter end?

421
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,350
Besides, I am so unlucky

422
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:48,540
that death always comes
knocking in my dreams.

423
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,910
It is a very strange feeling, however,

424
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,590
for my dreams

425
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,590
felt more

426
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,980
like the real life that I am living.

427
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:00,630
My life right now

428
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,950
feels more like a dream instead.

429
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,590
Something feels missing all the time.

430
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:07,220
What nonsense.

431
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:10,190
Isn't this the life
that any wage slave wants?

432
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,780
You have all the money and time.

433
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:12,740
You just need a man.

434
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,830
I can find one easily.

435
00:30:16,075 --> 00:30:18,590
I just need to close my eyes
and I can have everything in my dream.

436
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:19,910
Stop gloating.

437
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:24,950
The observatory says
there's a meteor shower tonight.

438
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,980
But look at the skies, it's so grey,

439
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:29,700
I guess I won't get photos out of it.

440
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,390
Not necessarily.

441
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:35,630
It might get sunny in a while.

442
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,860
(B&B booking confirmation notice
Wei Ziqi, 1 adult, Afternoon arrival)

443
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:48,220
(Wei Ziqi?)

444
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,350
What's wrong? You look dead.

445
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,540
More like looking at death.

446
00:30:54,625 --> 00:30:56,150
A new guest is coming in the afternoon.

447
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,220
Who is that?

448
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:00,060
I told you about him before,

449
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,500
my former boss.

450
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,220
He?

451
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:08,260
The one who laid low and
pretended to be a loser

452
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:10,150
only to rise one day
and defeat all his enemies,

453
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:10,950
Mr. Wei Ziqi?

454
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:16,590
Nice.

455
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,590
(Should I never)

456
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:31,430
(applied for a job at MU,)

457
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:33,910
(Haiqu)
(or resigned and left,)

458
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,060
(I will go to the beach,)

459
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:38,390
(rent a white-colored house,)

460
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:39,740
(and open a B&B.)

461
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,260
In the morning, I can get up
and watch the sunrise.

462
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:46,780
In the evening, I can listen to
the waves and watch the sunset.

463
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,910
If the weather is nice,

464
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,190
I can watch the stars too.

465
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:52,110
Just think about that kind of life.

466
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,220
It is so wonderful even

467
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,740
to just think about it.

468
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,700
Hi sir, you can check in here.

469
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,350
Do you have a reservation?

470
00:32:08,925 --> 00:32:10,150
I placed my reservation online.

471
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:12,150
I am Wei Ziqi.

472
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:15,020
Alright.

473
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:21,260
I would like to ask, is Yuan Xia here?

474
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:22,220
Our boss...

475
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,590
She went out for something.

476
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:28,910
How is my difficult,

477
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:30,150
former boss doing right now?

478
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:32,870
What does he want from my little shop?

479
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,350
Since my former boss is here,

480
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:37,020
I am not in a rush to go and serve him.

481
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,300
However, if he straight up offers

482
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,300
5 million to buy my shop,

483
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,590
I might consider it and

484
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,590
pack my bags immediately
to go back and welcome him.

485
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:48,020
Alright, I'll hang up now.

486
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:00,500
Yuan Xia.

487
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,020
Yuan,

488
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:22,980

Are you alright?

554
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:38,500
I just had a nightmare.
