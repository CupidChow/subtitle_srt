00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:06,500
(Year 2025)

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,620
(Lancheng No.1 High School
Name: Yuan Xia)

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,590
Yuan Xia.

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:14,910
The doctor said

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,710
I should spend time talking to you.

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,760
There may still be hope
for you to wake up.

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,510
As long as you're still alive

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,070
and still holding on,

9
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:33,280
I will have a purpose in life.

10
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,710
I will never let go of your hand again.

11
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,070
Hello?

12
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:53,430
Wei,

13
00:00:53,542 --> 00:00:55,890
I have the result of the matter
you asked me to investigate.

14
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,110
Pei Shen is the murderer.

15
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,000
Yuan Xia.

16
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:07,920
Yuan Xia!

17
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,280
Yuan Xia.

18
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,400
Yuan Xia.

19
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,760
Yuan Xia.

20
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,070
Got it.

21
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,350
I've been trying
to alter Yuan Xia's timeline

22
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,510
to prevent her death.

23
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,350
But it seems like

24
00:01:24,714 --> 00:01:26,250
we may have changed the point of origin.

25
00:01:26,428 --> 00:01:28,828
But we don't know
if it was a turning point or a crisis.

26
00:01:29,971 --> 00:01:31,628
I'm planning to take
a different approach.

27
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,000
I want Yuan Xia
to give the phone to Wei Ziqi.

28
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:28,660

(Special Gift)

30
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,030
Pei Shen.

31
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,360
Ms. Ni,

32
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,190
where's Yuan Xia?

33
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,680
She went out with Wei last night.

34
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,190
Two people alone in the wilderness.

35
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,000
Could they have spent the night out?

36
00:02:47,685 --> 00:02:49,130
Looks like you remembered to come back.

37
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,080
What were you up to?

38
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,240
Just come clean.

39
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,710
I was settling old scores
with my boyfriend.

40
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,680
Settling scores, huh?

41
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,360
How did you do it?

42
00:02:58,542 --> 00:03:00,380
Was it the straightforward kind
of settlement,

43
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,790
or did you go over it repeatedly,
doubling the score each time?

44
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,840
Come on. Tell me.

45
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,470
If we keep talking about this,

46
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,360
you can forget
about your year-end bonus.

47
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,750
You should spend less time with him.

48
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,930
You're picking up the bad habits.

49
00:03:10,942 --> 00:03:12,120
I think it's quite nice.

50
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,520
All right.

51
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,080
I get it.

52
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,710
You're completely on the same side now.

53
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,190
Sorry to interrupt.

54
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,870
It's getting late. We should head out

55
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,240
and not delay the opening ceremony.

56
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,080
Okay, we'll go and pack up our things.

57
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:40,190
(It looks like Yuan Xia already knows
that I'm not Brother.)

58
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,240
Does it still hurt?

59
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,840
It doesn't hurt anymore.

60
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,800
Wei Ziqi,

61
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,520
whatever happens in the future,

62
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,680
you mustn't get yourself hurt
like this again.

63
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,520
Mr. Heng would want that as well.

64
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,380
(Madam Sun's Wonton, Year 2011)

65
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,840
Yuan, have some noodles.

66
00:04:14,771 --> 00:04:15,910
So it's your son's birthday?

67
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:17,830
Then where is he?

68
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,870
(Wei Heng, Wei Ziqi's father)
He's not with me.

69
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,830
I haven't seen him
for almost a year now.

70
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,040
He must miss you a lot then.

71
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,190
Mr. Heng, how old is your son?

72
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,870
He's several years older than you.

73
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,190
He's graduating soon.

74
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,310
He's an older brother.

75
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,920
When he was young,

76
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,485
(Madam Sun's Wonton)
he had good grades

77
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,800
and was very sensible.

78
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:44,310
But I haven't been a responsible father.

79
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,480
I always said I was busy

80
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,630
and had no time for him.

81
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,630
I didn't even make it back

82
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,390
when his mother passed away.

83
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,070
So if he resents me,

84
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,240
he has every right to.

85
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,680
Now, even though I have time,

86
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,714
I don't have the chance to be with him.

87
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,800
How could that be?

88
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,920
You're a family.

89
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,240
Even if you made mistakes before,

90
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,870
it's not too late
to make up for them now.

91
00:05:18,057 --> 00:05:20,457
It's better to make amends
than to live with regret, right?

92
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,630
Besides,

93
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,270
a father's blessing means
more than anyone else's.

94
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,600
So Mr. Heng,

95
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,630
why don't you give your son a call?

96
00:05:30,428 --> 00:05:31,800
Do you really think it's not too late?

97
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,830
Of course!

98
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,950
You're right.
It's definitely not too late.

99
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,950
After we finish eating,

100
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,430
I'll go home and call him.

101
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:43,510
I want to wish him
a happy birthday in person.

102
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,430
He really loved you.

103
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,630
You've always been his pride.

104
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,070
Actually,

105
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,800
he called me that day.

106
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,070
But I didn't answer.

107
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,040
During that time, I really hated him.

108
00:06:03,742 --> 00:06:05,600
I hated him for not seeing
my mom one last time

109
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,310
because of his work.

110
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,040
When I found out he had passed away,

111
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,270
I regretted it and hated myself.

112
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,390
That's why I locked myself
in that house.

113
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,120
It was until you showed up

114
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,430
and pulled me out

115
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,270
of that dark abyss.

116
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,190
It was Mr. Heng.

117
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,800
Without him,

118
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,560
we might never even meet.

119
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,040
Besides,

120
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,920
you didn't truly hate him, right?

121
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,630
Otherwise,

122
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:42,430
you wouldn't have felt so guilty
and hurt yourself back then.

123
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,390
I won't anymore.

124
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,630
Yuan,

125
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,510
I've always owed you an apology.

126
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,510
I broke my promise

127
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,680
to watch the meteor shower

128
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,771
and kept you waiting for so long.

129
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,070
I always wonder

130
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,040
if I didn't break my promise,

131
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,680
we wouldn't have missed out
so much time.

132
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,390
We don't need "what ifs."

133
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,240
Now is good enough.

134
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,270
You're right. Now is great.

135
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,430
But I never got your special gift.

136
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:52,680
Oh, that?

137
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,830
I need to get someone else's permission

138
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,240
to give it to you.

139
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:12,750
All right, ladies and gentlemen.

140
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,360
Today's event has come to an end.

141
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,510
Thank you all for coming.

142
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:19,140
(Basement 1)

143
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,270
I have good news to tell you.

144
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,800
We managed to change the outcome.

145
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,600
You're not dead, just in a coma.

146
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,720
That's great.

147
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,720
Then let's put in more effort.

148
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,510
Perhaps I'll be able to wake up.

149
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,720
But the future I changed,

150
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,910
then you live well?

151
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,270
Don't worry. I'm okay.

152
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,320
Actually, there's something
more important.

153
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,080
We found out who the murderer is.

154
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,030
It was Pei Shen.

155
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,080
Pass the phone to Wei Ziqi.

156
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,030
Yuan Xia!

157
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,510
Is that the dual space-time phone
my dad researched on?

158
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:20,057
Is my dad on the other side of the line?

159
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,510
No.

160
00:09:23,685 --> 00:09:25,200
It's you from a year in the future.

161
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,240
He just told me

162
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,240
to give you the phone.

163
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:32,720
He also said

164
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,440
the murderer

165
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,910
was Pei Shen.

166
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:53,720
Pei Shen?

167
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,120
Why are you in my office?

168
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:57,028
Do you need anything from me?

169
00:09:58,114 --> 00:10:00,600
I was afraid you'd forget to
eat lunch because of work.

170
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,240
So I brought you some wonton.

171
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:04,480
Pei Shen.

172
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,840
I know what you want to say.

173
00:10:06,085 --> 00:10:08,120
But I have something important
to tell you first.

174
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,030
Can I go first this time?

175
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,600
But I have something up later.

176
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,870
It won't take long.

177
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,200
Okay, go ahead.

178
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,390
I noticed

179
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,480
you've been avoiding me

180
00:10:19,171 --> 00:10:20,270
since the opening ceremony.

181
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,440
Did you find out something?

182
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,600
I'm sure you did.

183
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,790
I admit

184
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,440
I'm not the person you were looking for.

185
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,600
I'm sorry.

186
00:10:33,942 --> 00:10:36,371
When I realized you were searching
for someone from your past,

187
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,270
I let you think it was me.

188
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,030
I did it to get closer to you

189
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:44,790
because I like you.

190
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,200
You like me?

191
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,870
But you said

192
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,840
you had someone you liked
for many years

193
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,390
and were planning to confess to her.

194
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,670
That person is you.

195
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,080
When we first met,

196
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,200
you said you didn't plan
on getting married.

197
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:05,870
Later, I found out

198
00:11:06,057 --> 00:11:07,600
you're in a relationship with Mr. Wei.

199
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,030
I was afraid you wouldn't accept me.

200
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,390
So I continued my act

201
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,600
to get closer to you.

202
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,270
I admit it was a sneaky thing to do.

203
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,030
But I don't regret it.

204
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:21,080
Now, you're slowly distancing
yourself from me.

205
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,600
It hurts.

206
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,510
I'm sorry

207
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,080
for causing you such trouble.

208
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,270
If it bothers you,

209
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,080
I won't disturb you again.

210
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,240
That's not what I meant.

211
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,000
But Pei Shen,

212
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,600
please don't do this anymore.

213
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,390
I only have Wei Ziqi in my heart.

214
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:40,790
I understand.

215
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,914
I'm not looking for an answer from you.

216
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,600
I just wanted to tell you how I feel.

217
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,240
I'll get going now.

218
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,320
Mr. Wei.

219
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,980
(Weak Signal Detected)

220
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,630
Ms. Ni, this is...

221
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,240
Quantum communication signal.

222
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,857
Are you sure about it?

223
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,057
The system I reconstructed one-to-one
is based on your dad's experimental log.

224
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,000
It's designed
to capture quantum entangled states.

225
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,360
But I don't know what kind

226
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,600
of communication device
is used to transmit this signal.

227
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,360
(Weak Signal Detected)
If you look at this location,

228
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,440
it appears to be inside
our company building.

229
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,320
Let's go find the source
of the signal together.

230
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,960
The rest of you can continue tracking
the dynamics of the signal source.

231
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,630
Okay.

232
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,790
Mr. Wei, I'll come along too.

233
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:34,960
Okay.

234
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,320
(Ni Ning, go to the monitoring room.
I'll go to the office area.)

235
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,320
(Pei Shen,)

236
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,510
(search the emergency exit
floor by floor.)

237
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,750
By the way,

238
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,240
do you know

239
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,510
when he will take action against me?

240
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,440
I've finally found you.

241
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,870
Pei Shen, is there anything you need
from me again?

242
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,870
Mr. Wei asked the R&D
to trace a communication signal.

243
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,750
So I followed the signal to this place.

244
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,240
Yuan Xia,

245
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,440
the signal

246
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,320
should be transmitted from your phone.

247
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,780
I don't know what you're talking about.

248
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,600
It's okay.

249
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,630
I won't tell anyone.

250
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,030
But Mr. Wei seems really anxious
to find this signal.

251
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,270
He already knows the signal

252
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,910
is inside the MU building.

253
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,320
Yuan Xia?

254
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,790
What are you doing here?

255
00:13:58,457 --> 00:14:00,080
Many people
were waiting for the elevator.

256
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,320
So I took the emergency exit.

257
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,510
Then I bumped into Pei Shen.

258
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,910
I have a meeting this afternoon.

259
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,430
No need to wait for me
to get off work.

260
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,480
Okay, go on.

261
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:12,030
Mr. Wei, I'll continue searching
for the signal then.

262
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,080
He's hiding himself really well.

263
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,720
At first, I thought he pretended
to be someone else

264
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,910
because he liked you,
which I found despicable.

265
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,390
I didn't expect his goal
to be the phone.

266
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,270
What does he want with the phone?

267
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,240
Judging by his reaction,

268
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,840
he seemed to know

269
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,670
that the dual space-time phone
was with me.

270
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,440
It shouldn't be Pei Shen.

271
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,840
The one who knows

272
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,670
about the dual space-time phone
before us

273
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,630
and is eager to obtain it

274
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,600
could only be him.

275
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,380
(Moonlight Seaview)

276
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:09,240
Xi Kun.

277
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,270
Mr. Xi,

278
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,240
I have the phone.

279
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,000
(November 11, 2011)

280
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,790
You mean

281
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,510
this phone can make calls

282
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,120
across time?

283
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:30,960
That's right.

284
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:34,910
Kun, have you heard
of quantum entanglement?

285
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,000
In theory, quantum communication

286
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,750
can achieve time travel.

287
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,200
My current research

288
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,480
has shown some progress.

289
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,840
It may not be stable yet.

290
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,790
But it's definitely
a groundbreaking discovery.

291
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:47,600
That's great.

292
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,510
This is great.

293
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,360
With it,

294
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,480
we can generate massive information gaps

295
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:56,670
that will bring us endless wealth.

296
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,390
We can change our lives

297
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:01,440
and change the world.

298
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,200
Both of us

299
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:07,350
will have everything.

300
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,640
Kun, calm down first.

301
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,790
You may have misunderstood my meaning.

302
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:15,550
We can't simply change the past.

303
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,640
Every change in the past

304
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,750
will cause huge butterfly effects.

305
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,680
We can't risk destroying
the entire world.

306
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,480
Listen to me.

307
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,000
Don't worry.

308
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,400
I'll invest in your research.

309
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:27,880
A mass production.

310
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:31,240
We must establish a world of our own.

311
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,590
I can't agree with that.

312
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,550
Heng, listen to me.

313
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,510
Mr. Wei, I have a few urgent documents.

314
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,830
Could you sign them for me?

315
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,440
Hello?

316
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,590
Mr. Heng, how are you?

317
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,440
I've kept my promise.

318
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:10,920
Who are you?

319
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,030
I'm Yuan.

320
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,400
Never reveal the secret
of this phone to anyone.

321
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:20,590
Mr. Heng, where have you been
this past year?

322
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,880
Have you called Brother?

323
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,240
Has he forgiven you?

324
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:42,400
If there's nothing else,

325
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,960
I need to get back to work.

326
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,030
I can tell you clearly.

327
00:19:04,142 --> 00:19:05,600
I will not hand over the phone to you

328
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,750
under any circumstances.

329
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,030
I won't allow anyone

330
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,550
to disrupt the order of this world.

331
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,640
Heng,

332
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,000
you're truly noble.

333
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:21,270
Do you think I can't find you

334
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,200
if you go into hiding?

335
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,920
Your beloved son

336
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,750
is doing well in school lately.

337
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,550
The teacher says he's quite diligent.

338
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,200
You're too heartless.

339
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,240
How could you not show up

340
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,790
for your son's birthday?

341
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,160
I'm warning you.

342
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,000
If you dare to harm my son in any way,

343
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,400
the person holding the phone

344
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,440
will make it disappear
from this world completely.

345
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,160
Completely.

346
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,790
Are you prepared to be stubborn
to the end?

347
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,550
Don't move!

348
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,720
Stop!

349
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,400
Wei Heng thought

350
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:03,550
that by leaving the phone to Yuan Xia

351
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,790
and instructing her to call in a year

352
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,830
to warn him about me,

353
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:11,400
he could change everything.

354
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:16,270
But after all that effort,

355
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,270
the phone still ended up in my hands.

356
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:25,720
Now,

357
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,400
with this dual space-time phone,

358
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,590
I have endless possibilities.

359
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,440
I'm going to continue developing it.

360
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,550
I can change

361
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,960
everything I want to change.

362
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,160
I not only want

363
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,400
to call my past self from a year ago.

364
00:20:48,085 --> 00:20:50,085
But I also want to reach out
to my earlier self.

365
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,480
I want to be a better father.

366
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:57,750
If I were given another chance in life,

367
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,400
I...

368
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,000
I would definitely choose
to spend more time with her.

369
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,200
Maybe then,

370
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,680
she would be a bit happier.

371
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:17,030
There are so many things
I've wanted to do.

372
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,790
Now, I can achieve them with this phone.

373
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,000
Now,

374
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,030
it's just the final step.

375
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:31,960
I just need to know
how to use this phone.

376
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,400
Then I'll be the one
who can change everything.

377
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,200
But Wei Ziqi wouldn't tell us

378
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,550
how to use the phone.

379
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,000
He doesn't have a choice.

380
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,550
Did you already know

381
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,960
that Xi Kun was the one behind this?

382
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,400
I only had suspicions back then.

383
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,440
When I recall

384
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,790
the things he told me
at Xi Lin's welcome party...

385
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:06,590
I heard you're restarting
the quantum communication experiment

386
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:08,200
to fulfill your father's wish.

387
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,590
As his best friend,

388
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:17,000
I may not be of much help.

389
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:19,640
If you lack funding, let me know.

390
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,550
I'll cover it for you.

391
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,480
(When MU was in crisis,)

392
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,270
he never reached out to help me.

393
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,400
When he heard
I was restarting my dad's experiment,

394
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,960
he became unusually enthusiastic.

395
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:38,960
This reminds me of something.

396
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,350
(November 11, 2011)

397
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,160
Mr. Heng?

398
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,480
Do you need anything from me?
Please come in.

399
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,310
No, it's okay.

400
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,310
Something came up.

401
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,680
So I need to go out.

402
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:50,790
Here's a gift for you.

403
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,750
Also,

404
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,720
I need a favor from you.

405
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,960
Next year, at noon on this same day,

406
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:01,200
use this phone to call me.

407
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,510
I've already set up

408
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,790
this phone for you.

409
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,830
Just press this redial button here.

410
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,270
When the call connects,

411
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,830
relay this message
to the person on the other end.

412
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,160
"Never reveal the secret
of this phone to anyone."

413
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,400
Got it?

414
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,790
Got it.

415
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,000
Good.

416
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,030
I have to go now.

417
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:27,590
Goodbye, Mr. Heng.

418
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,310
Bye.

419
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,440
Mr. Heng,

420
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,400
let me know when you come back.

421
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,780
(November 11, 2012)

422
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,240
Hello?

423
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,750
Mr. Heng, how are you?

424
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,550
I've kept my promise.

425
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,830
Who are you?

426
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,790
I'm Yuan.

427
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:55,200
Never reveal the secret
of this phone to anyone.

428
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,110
Mr. Heng, where have you been
this past year?

429
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:01,270
Have you called Brother?

430
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,030
Has he forgiven you?

431
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:06,790
Hello?

432
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,830
Why did the call end?

433
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,100
(November 11, 2012, 12:01 PM)

434
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,510
Why can't I get through?

435
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,830
Does this mean my dad's experiment

436
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,030
was successful back in 2011?

437
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,960
Perhaps he sensed
that Xi Kun was after the phone.

438
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,880
So he intentionally left it with you

439
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,160
to warn him to be careful
of Xi Kun a year later.

440
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:35,200
The person you called a year later

441
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,200
wasn't my dad.

442
00:24:38,571 --> 00:24:39,960
That was the day my dad passed away.

443
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,350
His death wasn't a coincidence.

444
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:45,480
My dad's death
is definitely linked to Xi Kun.

445
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,640
After my dad's death,

446
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:50,880
Xi Kun suspected the phone
might be with me.

447
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:54,000
So he had Zhou Wei
secretly monitor my life.

448
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,750
When he realized

449
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,400
the dual space-time phone
wasn't with me,

450
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:01,030
he deliberately had Zhou Wei
send me abroad.

451
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,590
At Xi Lin's welcome party,

452
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,640
I spoke to Xi Kun
when I was looking for you.

453
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,750
That was probably

454
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,440
when he already noticed me.

455
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,880
So Xi Kun had Zhou Wei attend
the welcome party

456
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:17,640
and make a move on you.

457
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:25,400
Then he stole your handbag,

458
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,200
searched your house, and attacked you.

459
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,960
Everything they did

460
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,070
was for the phone.

461
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,550
But when Wei took you to his house,

462
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:40,030
Zhou Wei lost his chance to act.

463
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,240
That's why Xi Kun sent Pei Shen

464
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:43,750
to get close to you.

465
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,200
They've gone to great lengths

466
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,960
for this phone.

467
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,790
Xi Kun's actions

468
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,160
have become more desperate recently.

469
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,680
I think it's likely due to
his health condition.

470
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:01,070
