2
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,760
Still no phone calls today?

3
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,870
It's been a few days.

4
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,840
What went wrong?

5
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:44,710
Hello?

6
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,640
Wei, you better come to the hospital.

7
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,509
Xi Lin committed suicide
by taking drugs.

8
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,480
She's still being rescued.

9
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,430
Xi Lin committed suicide?

10
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,620
(Fu Ming Hospital. Emergency
Inpatient Department)

11
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,560
You're up.

12
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,070
Do you feel any discomfort?

13
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,430
Are you okay?

14
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:20,680
I'm fine.

15
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,680
Can you step outside for a second?

16
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,240
I have something to say to Ziqi alone.

17
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,630
You can talk first.

18
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,960
I'll wait for you outside.

19
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,280
Are you okay?

20
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,750
What do you want to tell me?

21
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,560
I'm sorry, Ziqi.

22
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,280
Sorry.

23
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,360
My dad

24
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,080
particularly doted on me growing up.

25
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,800
I always thought

26
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,240
he was the best,

27
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,750
but he killed your dad

28
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,150
and almost killed you.

29
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,240
I don't understand

30
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,430
why it happened.

31
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,470
How did it happen?

32
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,470
Xi Lin.

33
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,840
Don't overthink it.

34
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,630
This is Xi Kun's fault.

35
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,710
It has nothing to do with you.

36
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,560
How could it have nothing to do with me?

37
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,750
I'm closest to him.

38
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,560
If I had found out sooner,

39
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,190
things wouldn't have come to this.

40
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,590
And... And Mr. Heng.

41
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,590
It's my fault.

42
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,190
It's all my fault.

43
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,840
It's all my fault. Sorry, Ziqi.

44
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm so sorry.

45
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,340
(Pei Shen)

46
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,310
Why didn't you answer?

47
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,750
I don't want to take his calls.

48
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,400
Did something happen?

49
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,360
Xi Lin.

50
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,000
You need to tell me what happened

51
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,160
so I can help you.

52
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,660
(Pei Shen)

53
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,000
My dad

54
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,750
seems to have left me some money.

55
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,800
Just before he turned himself in,

56
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,480
he gave the key to Pei Shen.

57
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,800
But Pei Shen's unexpectedly

58
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,000
an ingrate
who bites the hand that feeds him.

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,300
Not only did he not give me the key,

60
00:04:37,314 --> 00:04:39,190
he kept calling and threatening me.

61
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,500
(Pei Shen)

62
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,630
I've lost count

63
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,160
of the number of calls he made me.

64
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,950
Here. Answer the phone first.

65
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,680
At least we'll know what he's up to.

66
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,120
Right?

67
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:21,340
(Pei Shen)

68
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,390
Are you that scared of me?

69
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,390
You won't even take my calls.

70
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,600
Pei Shen, what do you want?

71
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,040
I told you

72
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,390
I only want money.

73
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,480
Your dad's been good to me
these past few years.

74
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,040
I'm where I am today
because of his funding.

75
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
But it's also true
that I've worked for your dad

76
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,750
for years.

77
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,800
Your dad's in trouble,

78
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,630
implicating me

79
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,040
from going on with life.

80
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,160
Is it too much to ask for

81
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,485
half of what your father left you?

82
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,000
How dare you say that?

83
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,680
My dad was kind to you

84
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,390
and trusted you.

85
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,000
How can you do such a thing?

86
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,390
I'll make myself clear to you today.

87
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,750
I'd rather die

88
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,630
than give you a penny.

89
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,390
Sure.

90
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,040
Forget about it then.

91
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,560
No one will get the money.

92
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,800
The bank needs your presence.

93
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,750
I have the key.

94
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,160
Ms. Xi.

95
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,430
Times have changed.

96
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,390
Don't be headstrong.

97
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:17,870
What do I do?

98
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,160
How do I know your key is genuine?

99
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,040
You'll find out when we meet.

100
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,390
I'll send you the time and place later.

101
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,430
What are we supposed to do?

102
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,480
(Pei Shen has always worked for Xi Kun.)

103
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,000
(He suddenly blackmailed Xi Lin.)

104
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,870
Is it really

105
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,160
just the money he's after?

106
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,360
Wei Ziqi from 2025 told me

107
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,870
that Pei Shen's the killer.

108
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,070
And no one from 2025

109
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,190
has contacted us these days.

110
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,560
Anyone trying to get their hands
on the dual space-time phone

111
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,390
has been caught.

112
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,950
Except for Pei Shen.

113
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,750
Is the phone what he's really after?

114
00:07:25,857 --> 00:07:27,300
There are a lot of things about Pei Shen

115
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,630
that we can't figure out.

116
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,160
We must find him.

117
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,800
Ni Ning, check where Pei Shen is from.

118
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,950
(Personal Profile.
Lin County, Yu Village.)

119
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:41,750

121
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,040
(Surveillance Footage,
Monday, 21-10-2024)

122
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,160
This should be

123
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,070
Pei Shen's hometown.

124
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,600
It doesn't look like

125
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,600
anyone's been in or out lately.

126
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,560
Who are you?

127
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,830
Sir, is this Pei Shen's house?

128
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,390
Who's Pei Shen? I don't know him.

129
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,480
They seem very resistant to outsiders.

130
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,160
This village is too secluded.

131
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,070
They probably don't have
many outsiders visiting.

132
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,160
They'll inevitably

133
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,870
be a little wary of us.

134
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,800
Here. Let's split up

135
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,270
and ask around about Pei Shen.

136
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,860
(Surveillance Footage,
Monday, 21-10-2024)

137
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,480
Hello, Madam.

138
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,150
Madam.

139
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,480
Do you know Pei Shen?

140
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,630
Who's that? I don't know him.

141
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,790
Ask someone else.

142
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,220
Hello, Miss. I'd like to ask

143
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,030
if you know Pei Shen.

144
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,790
No.

145
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,200
Hello, we're Pei Shen's colleagues.

146
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,840
We'd like to know more about him.

147
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,030
Pei Shen? Who's Pei Shen?

148
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,120
Is there a Pei Shen in your village?

149
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,390
I've never heard of him.

150
00:08:57,457 --> 00:08:59,257
There's no one with that surname
in the village.

151
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,320
How's it going?

152
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,790
He said there's no one
surnamed Pei in the village.

153
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,960
No one surnamed Pei?

154
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,750
Pei Shen?

155
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,000
This is Fish Ball.

156
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,080
Fish Ball!

157
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,910
When did you come back?

158
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,250
No, you've got the wrong person, Sir.

159
00:09:13,257 --> 00:09:14,120
I'm not Fish Ball.

160
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,600
How could I be wrong?

161
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,960
Look at your eyes.

162
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,720
You look just like when you were little.

163
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,960
You almost starved to death

164
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,240
when your parents abandoned you.

165
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,390
If my wife hadn't fed you some food,

166
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,840
you would have starved to death

167
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,150
and have no chance

168
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,440
of being taken back to the city
by that lady.

169
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,000
Sir, you really got the wrong person.

170
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,790
I'm not Fish...

171
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,960
You're right.

172
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,030
I just got married to Fish Ball.

173
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,600
We miss the villagers,

174
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,600
so I accompanied him back
to visit you all.

175
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,440
You're the lady

176
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,600
who fell for Fish Ball.

177
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:46,870
You've grown up

178
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,790
and gotten a lot more sensible.

179
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,960
You didn't even look at us back then.

180
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,080
You complained about our village
being dirty and smelly.

181
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:55,270
You held an instrument

182
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,840
and refused to get out of the car.

183
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,480
There was some development project
in the village.

184
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,870
You said our village stunk,

185
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,750
and your dad

186
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,000
eliminated my village without a word.

187
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,270
But you were lucky, Fish Ball.

188
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,960
I didn't expect

189
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,240
this to happen

190
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,960
between Pei Shen and Xi Lin.

191
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,360
Ms. Xi's good.

192
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,480
Let's not talk about it.

193
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,514
What now? We searched all day
but couldn't find him.

194
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,270
Shall we go back now or...

195
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,600
We'll go to Pei Shen's house.

196
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,480
You can look for Pei Shen's traces again

197
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,390
and go back to the city.

198
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,150
Let's go.

199
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,820
(Concert Ticket)

200
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,750
He told me a long time ago

201
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,910
that he had a girl he had liked
for a long time.

202
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,550
I came on the blind date

203
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,870
to ask you to pretend for me.

204
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,360
Because I have a girl
I've liked for years.

205
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,030
I want to get
the approval of the girl I like.

206
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,240
When I'm better,

207
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,390
I'll tell her how I feel.

208
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,200
I didn't get a chance to say it

209
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:40,600
because she already likes someone else.

210
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,600
The only thing I can do

211
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,030
is to silently stay by her side.

212
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,150
Could this girl be

213
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,440
Xi Lin?

214
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,790
If it's really Xi Lin,

215
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,550
why would Pei Shen blackmail Xi Lin?

216
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,750
What is Xi Lin's role

217
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,750
in all this?

218
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,480
There are two possibilities here.

219
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,150
One,

220
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,150
Xi Lin's really an innocent victim.

221
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,550
Pei Shen is obsessed with Xi Lin.

222
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,960
And Xi Lin has no idea about it.

223
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,750
Two,

224
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,080
Xi Lin is involved in this.

225
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,390
She's lying.

226
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,080
She's using Pei Shen

227
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,840
to act pity in front of us.

228
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,000
It could go either way.

229
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,030
But I don't understand.

230
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,240
If Xi Lin is involved,

231
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,630
why did she do it?

232
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,440
What's her goal?

233
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:49,300
(Funding Certificate)

234
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,200
Returning to the city

235
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,390
is to put on a show for Pei Shen?

236
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,390
Yes.

237
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:05,390
Although he has left
the village for years,

238
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,171
he must have many people
he's familiar with

239
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,670
and many informers.

240
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:09,670
Also,

241
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,550
when we first got here,

242
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,270
I saw a surveillance camera

243
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,670
pointed right at his door.

244
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,790
He probably knew we were coming

245
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,960
from the start.

246
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,120
What's wrong?

247
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,200
Is it your allergy again?

248
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,320
Bellflowers.

249
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,219
The soil is wet.

250
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,840
He must have been back
in the past two days.

251
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,390
Take it away.

252
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,600
Okay.

253
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,342
Everything's fine now.

254
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,171
Someone's here.

255
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,080
Don't run!

256
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,870
Stop!

257
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,030
I'm old. You caught up with me anyway.

258
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:33,720
Sir,

259
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,080
how come it's you?

260
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,440
Who are you? Where's Pei Shen?

261
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,360
So you were at Fish Ball's house, huh?

262
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,630
Where's Fish Ball?

263
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,600
I don't know either.

264
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,750
Fish Ball gave me a cap

265
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,390
and asked me to go to his house.

266
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,790
He asked me not to go in

267
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,600
and run back out.

268
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,750
If I succeed,

269
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,550
he'll take me to the city
to make a fortune.

270
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:54,080
I'm old and useless.

271
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,360
I'm useless.

272
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,790
I'm useless.

273
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,240
(Yuan Xia.)

274
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,000
Yuan Xia!

275
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,200
Yuan Xia!

276
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,030
Yuan Xia!

277
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,600
Since we arrived in Lin County,

278
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,000
we haven't seen Pei Shen

279
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,750
at all.

280
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:37,840
I was careless.

281
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,670
He's been around since the beginning.

282
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,390
He never left.

283
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,630
Calm down.

284
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,670
No one can threaten you,

285
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,790
including myself.

286
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,240
I did everything of my own free will.

287
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,790
I'll do anything for you.

288
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,960
I don't need you
to reciprocate anything.

289
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,000
You know it.

290
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,750
When you
first reached out your hand to me

291
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,680
and put the bellflowers in my hand,

292
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,160
I could already do anything for you.

293
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,880
I'll remove all obstacles for you.

294
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,200
You just have to go on
living your wonderful life

295
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,960
and enjoy the praise and applause that

296
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,771
only belongs to you.

297
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,200
Yuan Xia!

298
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,350
Yuan Xia!

299
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,680
Here. Let's split up.

300
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,110
Okay.

301
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:53,270
Let's go.

302
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,160
Yuan Xia!

303
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,440
Yuan Xia!

304
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,720
Yuan Xia!

305
00:18:18,428 --> 00:18:19,640
Pei Shen, don't be impulsive.

306
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,857
You're not supposed to find this place.

307
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,240
This is what happens

308
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:24,960
after getting here.

309
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,400
You should know it.

310
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,880
Murder

311
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,030
is more serious than extortion.

312
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,110
You don't know, do you?

313
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,000
I've been wanting to kill you
for a long time.

314
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,000
I was the one

315
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,240
who broke into your house.

316
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,480
(And I gave Zhou Wei)

317
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,880
(your room number)

318
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:52,200
(when he attacked you at the homestay.)

319
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:00,310
(By the way,)

320
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:03,285
(and the underground parking.)

321
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,550
Yuan Xia.

322
00:19:07,257 --> 00:19:09,270
(If Wei Ziqi hadn't shown up,)

323
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,200
(you would already be dead.)

324
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,440
Why would you do all this?

325
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,030
Pei Shen.

326
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,590
Is it to help Xi Kun get the phone?

327
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,000
Of course.

328
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:22,880
You're smart

329
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,960
to find this place.

330
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,160
How could you not figure it out?

331
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,240
I was born here.

332
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,200
After Xi Kun took me away,

333
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,070
I'm going to be on top and rich.

334
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:37,030
I did all this for the money.

335
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,160
But I now have nothing

336
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,550
because of you.

337
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:44,960
But I still think

338
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,680
that's not who you are.

339
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,070
The Pei Shen I know

340
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,680
is serious and responsible at work

341
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,550
and considerate in life.

342
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:58,830
Have some hot water.

343
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,000
Don't catch a cold.

344
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,830
Pei Shen, stop all this.

345
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:04,160
Xi Kun has already been captured.

346
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,350
But you can still stop this.

347
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,000
Besides,

348
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,790
don't you have a girl you like

349
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,590
that you want to protect?

350
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,350
(Too bad she'll never see it.)

351
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,240
That was a lie I made up

352
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,440
to get you to trust me.

353
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,350
How could you be so naive?

354
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,790
You believe everything I say.

355
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,590
No.

356
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,200
When talking about the person you like,

357
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,960
you can never
fake your expression and tone.

358
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,030
I can tell you like her very much.

359
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,790
You like her so much that you're
desperate and miserable, huh?

360
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,790
Miserable?

361
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,070
You're the first one to say that.

362
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:08,960
But you're wrong.

363
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,960
I don't like anyone.

364
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,790
All I've ever loved

365
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,550
is money!

366
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:16,550
Yuan Xia!

367
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,790
Wei Ziqi!

368
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:18,920
Yuan Xia!

369
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,310
Pei Shen, calm down!

370
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:23,550
Don't move.

371
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,480
Okay, I won't move.

372
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,790
I can give you

373
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,590
whatever you want

374
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,857
as long as you let Yuan Xia go.

375
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,880
How can I expect you to let me go

376
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,240
when you've found this place?

377
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:35,270
You've cut off my last resort.

378
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,030
What's there to talk about?

379
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,160
Wei Ziqi.

380
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,000
I know what kind of person you are.

381
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,270
I'm no match for you.

382
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,240
Pei Shen, don't be impulsive!

383
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,720
Shut up.

384
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,350
Okay, I'll shut up.

385
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,270
Let's talk it out, okay?

386
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,000
Pei Shen.

387
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,440
Don't be impulsive.

388
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,680
Think about your crush.

389
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,960
Yes, think about Xi Lin.

390
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,070
If you're doing all this for her

391
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:00,880
or if she

392
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,270
instructed you to do this,

393
00:22:02,828 --> 00:22:04,657
do you think
she won't have blood on her hands

394
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,200
if you take the blame for her?

395
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,480
Pei Shen.

396
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,200
You're not helping her.

397
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,030
You're doing her a disservice.

398
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,440
Are you trying to put her in jail?

399
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,830
Extortion doesn't take away lives.

400
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,400
But you'll lose everything
if you're really dead.

401
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,640
As long as you're alive,

402
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,590
you'll still have a chance, won't you?

403
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,030
Will I still have a chance?

404
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,160
No.

405
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,240
I'm so tired.

406
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,680
I'm tired of living.

407
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,680
I really want that phone too.

408
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,070
With that phone,

409
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,030
can she and I

410
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,590
have a different ending

411
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:54,000
like you and Wei Ziqi?

412
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,480
But...

413
00:22:59,714 --> 00:23:01,190
There's no use crying over spilled milk.

414
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:01,960
Yuan Xia!

415
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,720
Yuan Xia.

416
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,790
Yuan Xia, are you okay?

417
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:17,550
You're okay now.

418
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,960
You're okay now.

419
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,400
When I was on the edge of the cliff,

420
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:58,200
the last 20 years of my life

421
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,200
replayed in my head.

422
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,550
I realized I had one more regret.

423
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:14,960
Didn't you say

424
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,640
we have to live in the moment

425
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,270
and leave no regrets?

426
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,480
Listen well.

427
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,680
Wei Ziqi,

428
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,350
I love you.

429
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:37,640
I want to be with you forever.

430
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,590
When I almost fell off the cliff,

431
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,270
my biggest regret

432
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,400
was that I never told you

433
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,550

We'll always

447
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,480
be together.

448
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,590
If only everything
could stay this peaceful.

449
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,680
That will happen one day.

450

When this is all over,

451
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,680
we'll find a beach

452
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,960
and live there for a while.

453
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,400
Wei Ziqi.

454
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,030
If I hadn't

455
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,750
applied to MU

456
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:12,400
or I quit and left,

457
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,960
maybe

458
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:16,110
I'd be renting a white house

459
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:18,200
on the beach

460
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,030
and opening a homestay.

461
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:23,400
I can watch the sunrise
after getting up in the morning

462
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,480
and listen to the waves
and watch the sunset in the evening.

463
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,400
Think about a life like that.

464
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:32,790
Isn't it nice just thinking about it?

465
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,400
Sounds great.

466
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,550
There's just one flaw.

467
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,790
What is it?

468
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,240
I don't seem included

470
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,200
You were a surprise.

I'll wait for you.

I'll wait for you,
