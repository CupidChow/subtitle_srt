1
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:28,960
(I must convince her of the existence
of dual space-time.)

2
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:30,960
(This time,)

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,920
(she won't be able to resign from MU.)

4
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:40,600
(It's already 12 o'clock.)

5
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:36,520
=Present, is Present=

6
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,640
You already know how much I'm worth
at this point.

7
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:44,120
There's really no money in my account.

8
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:45,799
After the board meeting ends,

9
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:47,560
we'll discuss the compensation.

10
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:48,560
Is that okay?

11
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,920
What can I do?

12
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,239
It was my fault for being nosy.

13
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,200
I can only accept my luck.

14
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,239
Yuan Xia,

15
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,640
we're going to do
something big tomorrow.

16
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,880
=Episode 4=
(Shine Your Own Light)

17
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,439
Ms. Yuan,

18
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,240
are you ready?

19
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:19,039
Everyone, be patient.

20
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,840
I'm sure everyone here is aware

21
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,000
of Ziqi's attitude.

22
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,439
He has never been interested

23
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:24,840
in the company's affairs.

24
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,759
I figured

25
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:27,759
he partied all night.

26
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:29,120
That's why he's absent today.

27
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:31,240
On this important day...

28
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:45,560
Please circulate this document
around for everyone to review.

29
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:48,919
Gentlemen, this is
the share transfer agreement

30
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,960
that Ziqi signed early this morning,

31
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,199
which bears his personal signature.

32
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,120
We have a video

33
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:59,719
that proves he voluntarily
gave up his shares.

34
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:03,000
Let's take a look.

35
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,840
(This is the amount we took
from the company this quarter.)

36
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,599
(Well,)

37
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:10,240
(it's all thanks
to that squanderer, Wei Ziqi)

38
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,199
(who visits the bar every day.)

39
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,039
(Or else)

40
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,800
(it wouldn't be easy
to funnel the money.)

41
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,599
(I don't think using the pub alone)

42
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,639
(to embezzle the money is enough.)

43
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,439
(How is the set-up)

44
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:19,120
(of the auction house going?)

45
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,920
(Don't worry about it.)

46
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,560
Where did this video come from?

47
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,399
Who gave it to you?

48
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,600
It was me,

49
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:30,839
Mr. Zhou.

50
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:34,639
What's the matter?

51
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:37,199
You look at me
as if you've seen a ghost.

52
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,319
Your expression really makes me suspect

53
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:42,560
that you were the one behind forcing me
to sign the share transfer agreement

54
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,360
and trying to chop off my fingers

55
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,920
last night.

56
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:49,639
You...

57
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,560
You too!

58
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,360
All of you are on Wei Ziqi's side.

59
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,439
All of you set me up!

60
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,920
You made it sound so bad.

61
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,160
Our respected seniors

62
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,120
are doing this
for the company's interest

63
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,720
and acting according to my father's will

64
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:06,519
to support me
in taking over the company.

65
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,759
Then work with me

66
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,319
to clean up the company.

67
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,920
Gentlemen.

68
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,439
The evidence of Zhou Wei's
misappropriating company funds

69
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:23,959
and assets using his position
without authorization

70
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,800
has been sent to everyone's email.

71
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,360
You can take a look at them anytime.

72
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:29,240
As for the decision
on Zhou Wei's position,

73
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,800
does anyone here

74
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,319
have any objection?

75
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,399
No.

76
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:35,480
No.

77
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,800
Then I'll announce a couple
of new personnel changes.

78
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,720
Ni Ning,

79
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,800
our Head of the R&D Department.

80
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:44,839
Yuan Xia,

81
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,240
MU's new Director of Public Relations.

82
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,839
I'm confident you can excel
in this position.

83
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:57,639
Ni Ning,

84
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,920
please take the shareholders with you
to check out the relevant information.

85
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,199
Gentlemen, please come with me.

86
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:09,959
Wei Ziqi, you...

87
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:14,519
I should have killed you back then!

88
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,839
Since my father passed away,

89
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:17,800
I've put up with you long enough,
Zhou Wei.

90
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,759
You were the last person
to call my father

91
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,839
before he passed away.

92
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,519
(Mr. Zhou?)

93
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,040
What did you talk about over the phone?

94
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:43,879
Get your hands off me!

95
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,959
Wei Ziqi, listen here.

96
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,839
It was just a phone call.

97
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:52,000
It can't even prove anything.

98
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,040
What do you mean?

99
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,639
Wei Ziqi,

100
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,079
do you think you can live
without worries

101
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:03,959
after bringing me down?

102
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,920
Someday,

103
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:09,519
I'll make you lose
everything you have now.

104
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:14,759
Security!

105
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,279
Wei,

106
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,600
we can finally live in peace,

107
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,279
right?

108
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:41,360
Don't tell me he's the best friend

109
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,000
who you have a strong bond with.

110
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,160
When did I ever say something so cheesy?

111
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,600
Why are you here?

112
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,360
I was worried about you.

113
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,360
I specially switched shifts
to come here.

114
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,480
You're a great friend indeed.

115
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:56,319
Of course.

116
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:01,959
Please leave if you two
have no other business here.

117
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,360
Don't waste my time.

118
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:05,199
Didn't we already solve the issue?

119
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,959
So shouldn't we celebrate?

120
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:10,839
Why the long face?

121
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,360
I'm just thinking

122
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,720
that even though Zhou Wei was caught,

123
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,399
he's definitely hiding something.

124
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,920
It's not completely over.

125
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,959
I think you're being overly anxious.

126
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:32,120
Shouldn't you first care
about the people around you?

127
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:32,759
Like Yuan Xia.

128
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,279
First, you fired her

129
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:35,279
and kept her in the hospital.

130
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,919
Then you ruined her lottery ticket,
which prevented her from redeeming it.

131
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,120
But that's okay.

132
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,360
I'll give you a great pointer.

133
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,519
A pointer from you?

134
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:47,360
Don't you trust me?

135
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,720
Listen.

136
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,320
Everyone says
that alcohol brings out the truth.

137
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,840
Find a moment to be alone with her

138
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,039
and have a drink together.

139
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,440
When the evening breeze blows,

140
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,360
appear slightly drunk and tell her

141
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,279
about the difficult times you've had

142
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,360
under Zhou Wei's control.

143
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,600
Then use this to gain her sympathy.

144
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:07,440
After she listens to the whole thing,

145
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,639
she'll surely sympathize
and feel sorry for you.

146
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,360
But the most crucial part

147
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,120
is not to avoid her gaze.

148
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:19,039
You should

149
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:21,399
make eye contact with her.

150
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:22,919
Focus solely on her.

151
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:34,159
You're pretty experienced, Dr. Xing.

152
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:38,039
I understand that you're trying
to flirt with me.

153
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:51,519
Okay, make eye contact. What's next?

154
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,200
Learn these few tricks first.

155
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,320
What do you think?

156
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,919
Would you dare take advice from a guy
with average experience?

157
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,440
(Both of you are right.)

158
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,679
(I can't keep lying to her anymore.)

159
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,879
(I was afraid she might get implicated
if she knew too much.)

160
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:26,039
(So I took it upon myself
to hide everything from her,)

161
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,799
(including our past.)

162
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:31,960
(Later, I realized)

163
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,600
(that this self-imposed protection)

164
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,159
(never considered her wishes.)

165
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:40,120
(It even almost ruined her dream)

166
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,039
(because of my selfishness.)

167
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:43,840
(I always remember)

168
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,840
(what she said during the interview.)

169
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:47,600
She said she loves

170
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,360
the sense of achievement she gets

171
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:51,159
after each crisis is resolved.

172
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:52,759
So I want to help her fulfill her dream

173
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:54,159
as much as possible.

174
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,159
After all, the crisis is over now.

175
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:57,600
There's plenty of time ahead.

176
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,519
I can slowly make her remember me

177
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:03,440
bit by bit.

178
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:05,960
But I'm worried Yuan Xia
won't give you this chance.

179
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:13,399
Hello?

180
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:19,919
Okay, I got it.

181
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:22,960
What is it again this time?

182
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,960
Zhou Wei escaped.

183
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,440
Someone took him midway.

184
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,159
Someday,

185
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,960
I'll make you lose
everything you have now.

186
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:37,639
There must be other forces

187
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:40,159
behind Zhou Wei.

188
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:42,519
I'll find Zhou Wei as soon as I can.

189
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,960
But what do you plan to do
about Yuan Xia?

190
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,000
Do you want to warn Yuan Xia about this?

191
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,159
I acted on my accord before.

192
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,240
This time,

193
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,000
I'll let her decide.

194
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,240
I'll respect whatever choice

195
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:00,000
she makes.

196
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:11,600
Don't you enjoy working
in public relations?

197
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,399
I do like it.

198
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,960
Then why are you still resigning?

199
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:16,480
Because of you.

200
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:17,759
Me?

201
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,919
Wei Ziqi,

202
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,960
you're a good person.

203
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,159
But you're not a good employer.

204
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,240
Whether you let me take over
the PR Department

205
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,840
out of kindness

206
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,960
or as compensation
for firing me earlier,

207
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:33,320
you never asked if I was willing

208
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,519
before making your decision.

209
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:39,200
It was the same when you acted
on your will

210
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,960
by firing me
in the name of protecting me.

211
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:44,159
Your actions even made

212
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,799
my resentment toward you

213
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,759
seem dramatic.

214
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,519
I do not like

215
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:52,360
nor need such kindness.

216
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,960
All right, I understand.

217
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:00,960
Yuan Xia,

218
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,279
I want

219
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,240
to formally apologize for the harm

220
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,240
I've caused you caused in the past.

221
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,080
I'm sorry.

222
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,320
I accept your apology.

223
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,159
Wei Ziqi,

224
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:17,720
from today on,

225
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:19,759
let's put our past behind us
and call it even.

226
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,120
That's settled then.

227
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,240
Then I'll get going.

228
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:30,399
Yuan Xia.

229
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:42,919
Zhou Wei was taken away on his way

230
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,440
to the Public Security Bureau.

231
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,000
You should be careful.

232
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,240
If there's a need, I'll...

233
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,759
I can ask Ni Ning to take you home.

234
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,559
It's okay. Thanks for offering.

235
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:16,759
Dong, are you grilling meat?

236
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,559
Oh, you're home.

237
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,600
Madam Sun.

238
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:24,960
Oh, Yuan.

239
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,519
"Joyful occasion."
What's the joyful occasion?

240
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,440
Your sister-in-law is giving birth soon.

241
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:30,879
I need to rush to the hospital.

242
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:31,639
Okay.

243
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:32,480
I have to go now.

244
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,360
Be careful.

245
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:40,639
Hello? Who on earth are you?

246
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,240
How did you know
the lottery winning numbers?

247
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,440
Yuan Xia, Madam Sun wants
to speak with you.

248
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:47,960
Madam Sun.

249
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:49,799
I'm coming.

250
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:52,120
Look.

251
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,720
Yuan Xia,

252
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:56,919
where have you been?

253
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:58,240
What haven't you come home for so long?

254
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,919
Your niece is turning one today.

255
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:01,799
Isn't that right?

256
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:02,919
Come home soon.

257
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,360
Now you should be able to guess

258
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,840
how I knew the winning numbers, right?

259
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:10,360
You can predict the details

260
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,279
because

261
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,360
we're not in the same timeline.

262
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,720
Precisely.

263
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,440
I'm currently in the year 2025

264
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,480
The phone in your hand

265
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,080
allows calls
between two different space-time.

266
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,759
However, it can only connect once a day.

267
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,120
The signal of dual space-time

268
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,960
can only connect from twelve

269
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,039
to two past twelve.

270
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,720
So who are you exactly?

271
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,919
I've told you I won't harm you.

272
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,679
If you believe me,

273
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,080
please remember this.

274
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,639
Do not leave MU.

275
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:41,799
No matter what,

276
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,799
stay by Wei Ziqi's side.

277
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,840
Why?

278
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,879
I've just resigned.

279
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:48,720
Hello?

280
00:15:57,159 --> 00:16:00,240
(Hello, the number you dialed
is not in service.)

281
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,960
(Please verify and dial again.)

282
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:26,600
(Mr. Wei,)

283
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,840
(these are the clothes prepared
for the interview.)

284
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,639
Please take your pick.

285
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:37,120
Mr. Wei, what you're wearing now

286
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,440
is actually quite suitable.

287
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,559
These clothes are too flashy

288
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,360
and don't match the theme
of the interview.

289
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,919
Don't you agree, Mr. Wei?

290
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:46,240
Yes, yes.

291
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,919
This interview

292
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,720
is Mr. Wei's first formal appearance

293
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,960
as the head of MU.

294
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,919
We must seize this opportunity

295
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,120
to change Mr. Wei's

296
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,159
negative public image

297
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,440
like a playboy juggling relationships,

298
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,000
an uneducated spendthrift,

299
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,679
or a rich kid who only fools around
and has fun.

300
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:04,759
Do you understand?

301
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,839
Notify the PR team to get ready.

302
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,359
The interview will start in ten minutes.

303
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,480
Yes, Miss...

304
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,200
Director Yuan.

305
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,680
All right, Director Yuan.

306
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,759
Luckily, you came back.

307
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:33,440
About your proposition for me

308
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,640
to be the PR Director,

309
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,079
I've given it a thought.

310
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:38,599
I'll take it.

311
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,920
You really don't have to force yourself.

312
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:42,640
Never mind then.

313
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:45,759
I mean,

314
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,440
you can tell me

315
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,680
if you're not happy with certain terms.

316
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,440
I can make the changes
to accommodate you.

317
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,880
Is there anything else?

318
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:55,359
How about telling me all at once?

319
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:57,039
Then I'll make all the changes.

320
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,480
Actually, I've always thought

321
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:02,680
you can have another image.

322
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,960
At MU, we're aiming

323
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,119
for a friendly yet elite image,

324
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,680
not something unconventional.

325
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,839
If we want to change
the public's perception of us,

326
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:12,440
especially of you,

327
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,039
we should start with your wardrobe.

328
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:18,400
Okay.

329
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,559
Our dedication
to quantum communication technology

330
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,480
isn't just for business reasons.

331
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,319
It's to fulfill my father's dying wish.

332
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,240
He dedicated his entire life

333
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:28,880
to this technology.

334
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,720
Although his experiments didn't succeed,

335
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:33,200
he left a lot of experimental data,

336
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,039
which has saved us
from taking many detours.

337
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,039
With our current research outcomes,

338
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:39,960
we'll see significant results

339
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:41,880
in less than two years.

340
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:50,160
Shall we move on to the next question?

341
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,799
Sure.

342
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,039
How do you see MU's future development?

343
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,359
We will soon announce our funding plans

344
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:57,680
to increase our technology capacity.
Please look forward to it.

345
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,279

(We will continue to monitor

371

Mr. Wei,

372
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,160
when you say down-to-earth,

373
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,640
do you mean visiting
the exotic pet market?

374
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,680
Don't you think this is more relatable

375
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,880
than eating at a food stall?

376
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:25,960
Also, the office is too dull.

377
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,880
It lacks liveliness.

378
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,599
So I thought about adding
some green plants

379
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,799
or pets.

380
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:31,559
That'd be nice.

381
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,400
Goldfish is pretty good
as it carries good meaning,

382
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,440
symbolizing surplus every year.

383
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:41,680
I don't like eating fish.

384
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:43,599
Their bones get stuck in my throat.

385
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,240
I'm asking you to raise them,
not eat them.

386
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:50,039
Then what about this turtle?

387
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:51,680
It symbolizes longevity
and is easy to take care of.

388
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:54,880
These turtles are called terrapins.

389
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,279
Do you really think I'm that clueless?

390
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,720
Then what is it that you want to buy?

391
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:06,599
Getting myself a bird.
[*euphemism for male genitalia.]

392
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,359
Wei Ziqi,

393
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,799
there's no need to swear
at me like that.

394
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:13,039
You were the one who asked me

395
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,119
to accompany you here today.

396
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:15,440
I didn't swear at you.

397
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,240
I simply want to get a bird.

398
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:19,920
Yuan Xia.

399
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,400
(Sorry, I'm still working.)

400
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:23,759
(I might be half an hour late.)

401
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:25,440
It feels familiar.

402
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,200
Don't you find it familiar?

403
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:37,200
Now that you mention it,
it does remind me of something.

404
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,119
The personality of this bird
matches your interesting soul

405
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:40,160
perfectly.

406
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,200
It's perfect for you.

407
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,000
This one it is.

408
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,039
Hold up this bird.

409
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,960
Okay, look at the camera.

410
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:50,039
Three, two, one, smile!

411
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:54,480
Now that you've picked your bird

412
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,920
and I've gathered
all the materials I need,

413
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,920
I can get off work now.

414
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,160
Thank you.

415
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,400
That can't be right.

416
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,039
This parrot looks like the one we had
when we were kids.

417
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:29,799
How could she not recognize it?

418
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,839
Indeed, she has forgotten everything
from the past.

419
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:35,359
Your way of testing her

420
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:36,599
doesn't make sense at all.

421
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:37,960
It's been over ten years.

422
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,759
Besides, all birds look the same.

423
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:41,440
Who can tell one from another?

424
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:43,400
And she's meeting her blind date now.

425
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,519
Do you think she's trying
to tell me something

426
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,519
by making me buy a turtle?

427
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,440
Telling that you're a cheater?

428
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,240
I'm fine with that.

429
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:54,640
I thought she was telling me
that I was being cheated on.

430
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:57,440
Wait a minute.

431
00:22:57,759 --> 00:22:59,880
Then why did she leave me
by the roadside

432
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,640
to meet this pretty guy?

433
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:12,119
Mr. Pei.

434
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:15,799
Actually, I came here to tell you

435
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:17,799
that I don't have any plans
to get married now.

436
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,039
You don't need to be courteous with me.

437
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,319
Just call me Pei Shen.

438
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,799
I also work at MU.

439
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,200
But I'm with the R&D Department
of the branch office.

440
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,240
I'm here for the blind date

441
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,039
only to ask you for a favor.

442
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:31,079
A favor?

443
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,599
Can you help me, Yuan Xia?

444
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:35,640
Tell me about it first.

445
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,000
I came here to ask you

446
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,319
to put up an act with me

447
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,440
because there's a girl

448
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,039
that I liked for so many years.

449
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,799
But my parents don't approve of her

450
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,039
and made me come here.

451
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,440
What's wrong with that guy?

452
00:23:58,319 --> 00:23:59,119
Can't he look at the time?

453
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:00,599
Shouldn't he at least order
something to eat?

454
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,000
What a stingy guy.

455
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,799
It's already late.

456
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:05,720
Why did he order a cup of coffee
for Yuan Xia?

457
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:07,440
It's still bright.

458
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,000
Why can't she drink coffee?

459
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,079
Just listen to me.

460
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:11,920
Stop drowning yourself in jealousy.

461
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:13,400
If you really can't stand it,

462
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,000
go up to her with the parrot

463
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,319
and tell her who you are.

464
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,119
Don't just sit there
looking all sad like a bitter husband.

465
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:18,920
A bitter husband?

466
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:19,839
Bitter husband.

467
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,039
Quiet.

468
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,759
Quiet, bitter husband.
Quiet, bitter husband.

469
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:23,400
Stop it.

470
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,160
Quiet, bitter husband.

471
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:24,720
Shut up.

472
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,680
I'm sorry, sir.

473
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,200
Pets are not allowed at our restaurant.

474
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,039
Sorry for the inconvenience.

475
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:29,160
All right.

476
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,720
Wait, I'll talk to you in a bit.

477
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:32,880
Okay.

478
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,720
If you need any help,

479
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,640
feel free to let me know.

480
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,359
I'll help you.

481
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:37,039
Thank you.

482
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,720
(Put on your sunglasses.)

483
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,880
(In case, you make a headline)

484
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,720
(and make the PR Department
work overtime.)

485
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,880
She texted me.

486
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,640
Then what did Yuan Xia say?

487
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,720
She told me to put on my sunglasses.

488
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,079
In case I make a headline

489
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,319
and make the PR Department
work overtime.

490
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:01,640
That means she's ashamed of you.

491
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,519
No, she's not.

492
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:05,200
It's because I just had an interview
this afternoon.

493
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:08,319
She's afraid my image will suffer
and affect the company.

494
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,319
Wei, I was just about to tell you.

495
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,880
I just saw some news.

496
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:14,440
The person who slings mud
at you has appeared.

497
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,880
Well, it's a good chance

498
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:18,000
to get rid

499
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,200
of Yuan Xia's negative perception
of my past reputation.

500
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,160
When the time is right,

501
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,799
I'll reveal my identity.

502
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,920
(Brother! Brother!)

503
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,720
(Open the door now!
Someone's picking on me!)

504
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,519
If you forget your keys again,

505
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:53,480
you can stay out.

506
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:56,440
Okay.

507
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:07,880
Thank you for getting me out of trouble.

508
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,839
I live downstairs.

509
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:11,039
My name is Yuan Xia.

510
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:12,200
You can call me Yuan.

511
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,920
Yuan. Yuan.

512
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,519
Yuan. Yuan.

513
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,039
You scared me.

514
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,039
Brother,

515
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,200
I know you're Mr. Heng's son.

516
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:25,880
He talked about you multiple times.

517
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:27,160
What's your name?

518
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:33,559
Hello?

519
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,279
I'll call you Brother then.

520
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,920
It's nice meeting you.

521
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,039
(Yuan,)

522
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,680
