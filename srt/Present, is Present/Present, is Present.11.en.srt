(Your wife could not be saved
due to organ failure.)

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,280
(My condolences.)

4
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,400
Do I really have to make the call?

5
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,670
I can't contact Wei Ziqi on the phone,

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,080
because the signal is interfered
with by magnetic fields.

7
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,520
Hello?

8
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:37,200
This is Xing Nan.

9
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:38,640
Xing Nan?

10
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,320
There's not much time, I'll be brief.

11
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:42,280
Back then,

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,790
you got engaged to Xi Lin to obtain

13
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:44,950
evidence of Xi Kun's crimes.

14
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,150
However, unexpectedly,

15
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,150
Yuan Xia showed up
and died at the engagement party.

16
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,520
Using the dual space-time phone,

17
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,600
we've tried again and again
to change the past,

18
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:00,470
but ultimately, we couldn't change
Yuan Xia's fate.

19
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,280
Everything returned
to the original point

20
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,150
and Yuan Xia still met her end.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,680
Besides,

22
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,150
(Year 2025, Year 2024)
the person who killed your father is Xi Kun.

23
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,070
He will certainly
use Yuan Xia to threaten you

24
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,480
to get the dual space-time phone.

25
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,070
You must try your best to...

26
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,560
What should I do

27
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,310
to stop all of this?

28
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:38,070
This might be the only way.

00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,080
I have something
very important to tell you.

34
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,400
I spoke with Xing Nan a year from now.

35
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,470
He told me

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,430
that they tried many times

37
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,190
to prevent your death,

38
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,220
but it always returned
to the starting point.

39
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:13,080
Your death hasn't changed.

40
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:20,080
What do you want to do?

41
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,630
I want to discuss it with you.

42
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,800
I want to send you abroad.

43
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,030
Go abroad?

44
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,520
I want you to completely avoid this time

45
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,080

46
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,150
Aren't you interested
in crisis management?

47
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,240
I happen to have a friend in Paris

48
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,750
who does crisis management
for major brands.

49
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,630
You can go there to study for a year.

50
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,400
It will also benefit your future plans.

51
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,310
Of course,

52
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,520
if you don't want to...

53
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,400
I'm okay.

You're doing this for my sake,

why wouldn't I want to?

57
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,870
I know what you're worried about

58
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,680
and that you're afraid I'll get upset,

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,630
but I won't be that unreasonable.

60
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,840
Thank you for telling me everything.

61
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,400
If you trick me onto a plane

62
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,840
and send me abroad,

63
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,590
that would be really presumptuous.

64
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,190
Also, now I have the chance

65
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,070
to systematically study management.

66
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,390
I'm very happy about it.

67
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,560
Once I've finished

68
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,510
all my business here,

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,070

71
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:36,680
Wei Ziqi,

72
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,040
I'm not a delicate flower.

73
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,240
I can adapt.

74
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,680
Moreover, when our industry gets busy,

75
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,430
it should be even busier than yours.

76
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,920
When you come to find me,

77
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,680
I might not have time to spend with you.

78
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,040
So for the remaining time,

79
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,310

99
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,270
I really didn't expect Yuan Xia
to agree to go abroad.

100
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,040
She did this to set my mind at ease.

101
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,430
We can't delay any longer with Xi Kun.

102
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,920
When do you plan to act?

103
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,040
As soon as Yuan Xia leaves,
we'll take action.

104
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:05,000
I can't give him any chance
to target Yuan Xia.

105
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,720
If Yuan Xia finds out,

106
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,000
she'll definitely be mad at you.

107
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,480
She thinks
you've finally learned to open up,

108
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,920
but here you are,
telling half-truths and hiding the rest.

109
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,680
I just hope that this time,

110
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,240
I can completely change her fate.

111
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,310
By the way...

112
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,480
Once Yuan Xia signs this will,

113
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,920
we'll need photocopies of your IDs

114
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,750
and signatures as witnesses.

115
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,830
There's no way Yuan Xia
will sign this will.

116
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,920
She won't know it's a will.

117
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,040
I know her current study progress

118
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,870
and the new words she's learned.

119
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,390
She doesn't recognize
any of the important words on it.

After you sign,

123
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,200
quickly take it
to the lawyer for notarization.

124
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,240
When is she leaving?

125
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,450
The day after tomorrow.

126
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,310
All right, I'll be off.

127
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,600

133
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,600

138
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,600
You need to sign them.

139
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,870
It's all in French.

140
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:11,390
I only recognize two words on this page.

141
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,310
It's even worse on the back.

142
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,800
I hadn't seen any of these words

143
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,390
when I studied.

144
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:23,570
Take it slow.

145
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,070
When you get abroad and are immersed

146
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,950
in the language, you'll learn faster.

147
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,510
I've reviewed all of this for you.

148
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,510
Just sign it.

149
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,790
Okay.

00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,880

152
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,390
Why is it still raining?

153
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,000
Luckily, you came.

154
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,320
Remember to check the weather forecast

155
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,270
and bring an umbrella.

156
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,630
Otherwise, when you're abroad,

157
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,320
I can't come to pick you up.

158
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,030
Got it.

159
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,600
I forget when I'm busy.

160
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,000
Let me use the computer for a bit.

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000

Here's the weather forecast
for tomorrow.

167
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,200
The highest temperature

168
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,790
will be 28 to 30 degrees Celsius,

169
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,750
locally 29 to 32 degrees Celsius,

170
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,540
with thunderstorms in the afternoon.

171
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,280
Remember to bring an umbrella
when you go out.

172
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,820
This way, you won't forget
to bring an umbrella

173
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,390
even when you're busy.

174
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,030
Ni Ning.

175
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,600
I'm serious.

176
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:16,240
I need you to talk to me
about this matter

177
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,720
with a serious attitude.

178
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:18,870
You can drive,

179
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,960
but when you need to accelerate,
you accelerate,

180
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,510
and when you need to brake, you brake.

181
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,440
You can't just change lanes randomly.

182
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,720
You need to follow traffic rules,

183
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,440
understand?

184
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:28,840
Okay.

185
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:31,840
When did you arrive?

186
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I heard everything.

187
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,320
I just wanted to have
a formal conversation with you.

188
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,080
Sure, we can talk.

189
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,600
I'll decide the place to talk.

190
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:49,300
(Shady Book House: Because of you,
this city holds memories.)

191
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,440
I didn't expect

192
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,240
that our date before I went abroad

193
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,670
would be at a bookstore.

194
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,510
I'm here to help you study,

195
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,790
so you'll adapt better
when you get there.

196
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,440
Look at that, what's that?

197
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,390
Hello,

198
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,240
I want to ask, what is that?

199
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,270
This is a time-travel postcard.

200
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:20,960
If you have

201
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,000
something you want to say

202
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,200
to each other or to yourself,

203
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,480
you can go into our phone booth,

204
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,240
make a call,

205
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,080
and you'll get a postcard.

206
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,390
The postcard has a QR code.

207
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,870
We'll send it out in a year.

208
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:36,600
When the recipient scans the QR code,

209
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,390
they can hear what you said today.

210
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:40,840
Thanks.

211
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,080
Sending a message to a year later,

212
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,480
that’s quite meaningful.

213
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,600
Do you want to try it?

214
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,440
Sure. Then I'll give you a love letter.

215
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:55,670
(Time-travel phone booth)

216
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,480
Rock, paper, scissors.

217
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,440
You go first.

218
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:09,700
(Time-travel phone booth)

219
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,630
I've already guessed

220
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,240
that when you receive this postcard

221
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,360
and hear this recording,

222
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,870
you'll scold me.

223
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:35,770
You'll scold me for not keeping my word,

224
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,790
for being selfish,

225
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,870
for leaving you alone again.

226
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,510
You might even add,

227
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,120
"Men's promises are lies."

228
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,870
Am I right?

229
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:50,670
Suddenly,
I don't know how to address you.

230
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,670
Hello, Wei Ziqi.

231
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,080
I am your girlfriend, Yuan Xia.

232
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,000
The Wei Ziqi I'm calling

233
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:03,630
is the one listening to
this recording now;

234
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,790
the one who brings me
an umbrella on rainy days,

235
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,720
(Time-travel phone booth)
cooks for me,

236
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:12,200
goes to the farmers' market with me,

237
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:16,600
and spends each day with me.

238
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,600
Actually, I never told you

239
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,670
how grateful I am
that we are still together

240
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,720
after learning about my fate
in another timeline.

241
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,790
I'm grateful for
all the beautiful memories we have.

242
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,630
However, slowly,

243
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,030
this gratitude turned into fear

244
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,120
because we've had such beautiful pasts,

245
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,480
and I'm afraid of the pain of losing it.

246
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,600
I can't imagine

247
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,120
how another timeline's Wei Ziqi

248
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,630
endured the time after losing you.

249
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,030
I don't know if,

250
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,670
when you hear this recording,

251
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,320
I am still by your side.

252
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,510
If I am,

253
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,550
I think you'll be moved to tears

254
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,790
when listening to this recording.

255
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,670
You'll rush over to me,

256
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,200
hug me, and kiss me.

257
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,030
Yuan Xia.

258
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,910
In my life,

259
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,440
there have been two turning points.

260
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,360
(Time-travel phone booth)

261
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,080
The first was the death of my parents.

262
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,080
It destroyed all the beauty in my life.

263
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,120
The other is you.

264
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,440
You broke into that attic,

265
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,240
bringing your unique vitality.

266
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,910
At that moment, I suddenly felt

267
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,480
that blooming flowers
aren't the most beautiful season;

268
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,390
this moment is.

269
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,440
I unconsciously became a thief,

270
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,240
hiding you in this chaotic time

271
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,000
which I should have been cleaning up

272
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,960
all by myself.

273
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,440
I don't know
if we've gotten married by then,

274
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,200
but I think you love me so much

275
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,030
that you must have proposed
to me by now.

276
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,000
If not,

277
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,080
let me tell you in advance.

278
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,240
Wei Ziqi,

279
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,030
I do.

280
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,550
Yuan Xia.

281
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,600
I'm sorry.

282
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,080
If I'm not there anymore,

283
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:33,840
you must be brave and move forward.

284
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,320
I always believe

285
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,400
that if you keep someone in your heart,

286
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,080
you'll eventually meet again.

287
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:45,000
Maybe we'll see each other again

288
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,600
in another timeline.

289
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:56,870
Yuan Xia.

290
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,200
I love you.

291
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:30,510
(Time-travel phone booth)

292
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,840
Why are you taking so long?

293
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,510
I have so much to say to you.

294
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,480
It seems you wrote me
a long love letter.

295
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,670
How do you know it's for you?

296
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,270
Who else would it be for?

297
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,600
Of course, it's for Wei Ziqi
a year from now.

298
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:48,240
Later, I'll stamp and send it,

299
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,630
he'll receive it.

300
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,440
No, it can't be sent.

301
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,790
I can't let him hear
your confession to me first.

302
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,510
However, you are both Wei Ziqi.

303
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,240
No.

304
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,720
I am luckier than him.

305
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,790
All right, let's go.

306
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:14,750
Let's go.

307
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:22,340
(Time-travel phone booth)

308
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,070
Let's talk here tonight.

309
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,350
I guarantee no one will disturb us.

310
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,000
Talk as much as you want,

311
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,920
all night if you like.

312
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,200
If you don't want to talk, then leave.

313
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:58,400
It's your first time
getting a hotel room with a girl, right?

314
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,240
No.

315
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,880
Don't misunderstand.

316
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,790
I got this room just to talk,

317
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:05,830
nothing else.

318
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,030
Since we're already in a hotel room,

319
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,110
I didn’t plan on just talking.

320
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,310
Of course,

321
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,720
I wouldn't mind
chatting a bit before bed

322
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,240
to provide each other
with some emotional value.

323
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,160
Ni Ning, can you be serious?

324
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,070
When I say talk,

325
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,110
I mean discussing
the future of our relationship.

326
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,240
Sleeping together is fine too,

327
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,090
but I don't want it
to be done without clarity.

328
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:46,830
Okay.

329
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,310
Let me take a shower first,

330
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,030
then we can talk seriously
about sleeping.

331
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,110
Why did you buy a cake?

332
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,110
I wanted to celebrate
my birthday early with you.

333
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,790
Two months early?

334
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,270
It's not like I'm not coming back.

335
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,590
You know, I almost thought
you were going to propose to me.

336
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,790
If I really did propose,

337
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,640
would you accept?

338
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,240
If we really get married,

339
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,070
we should sign
a prenuptial agreement, right?

340
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,590
A prenuptial agreement?

341
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,000
Yes.

342
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,270
Mr. Wei, you have a big family business,

343
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,440
and I'm about to go abroad.

344
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,590
With all the temptations out there,

345
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,590
if I get tempted away by someone

346
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:41,000
and take half your assets,

347
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,070
you might end up crying in the bathroom.

348
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,440
Yuan Xia.

349
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,830
I won't constrain you in any way,

350
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,050
including through marriage.

351
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,590
You are free to pursue

352
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,030
your dreams and career.

353
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:57,830
Of course,

354
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,480
if someone more suitable than me

355
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,590
comes along in the future...

356
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,790
What are you talking about?

357
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:07,680
Would you let me pursue someone else?

358
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,440
It'd be him chasing you.

359
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,030
Yuan Xia.

360
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,110
I won't bind you in the name of love.

361
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,640
My love for you
is understanding and respect,

362
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,200
not binding.

363
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,160
Yuan Xia.

364
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,480

Woke up?

386
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:28,450
Last night, weren't you the one
who threw yourself at me,

387
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,880
wanting to sleep with me?

388
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,510
Are you drunk?

389
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:01,640
No.

390
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:02,960
Then why are you blushing?

391
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:05,270
You know already that I like you.

392
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,350
Why do you keep teasing me?

393
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,960
Then let's have a serious talk.

394
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,270
There's nothing to talk about.

395
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,880
It's just sleeping together, right?

396
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,110
Come on.

397
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,480
Are you really drunk?

398
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,270
You have a nice body,

399
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,640
but you're bad

400
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,550
at drinking.

401
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:52,280
Not only do you have
bad character after drinking,

402
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,770
but also poor alcohol tolerance.

403
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:55,510
Last night,

404
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,550
you held my hand and slept all night.

405
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,270
Anyway, we slept together.

406
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,070
Hurry up.

407
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,830
I still have to work for your buddy.

408
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,540
(Entrance)

409
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,550
All right.

410
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,830
Just send me off here.

411
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,110
Take care of yourself out there.

412
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,160
I will.

413
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,440
I have the app you personally installed.

414
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,200
It will remind me all the time,

415
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,640
just like you're by my side.

416
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,750
Once I finish my work, I'll come to you.

417
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,440
You take care of yourself too.

418
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,070
I'm leaving.

419
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:29,960
