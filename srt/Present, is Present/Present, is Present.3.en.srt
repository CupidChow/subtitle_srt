1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,360
Is that you, Yuan Xia?

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,400
Who are you?

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,720
Is your current time

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,000
12 o'clock on March 3rd, 2024?

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,828
There's something important
I need to tell you.

6
00:00:15,828 --> 00:00:16,710
You must remember it.

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,879
On December 31st, 2024,

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,359
you must not go to Lakeside Hotel
to look for Wei Ziqi.

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,399
I know I must sound ridiculous,

10
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:29,000
but you have to believe me.

11
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:31,640
Or else your life will be in danger.

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,719
Like how I'm in danger right now?

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,600
You've got the wrong person to scam!

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,920
Stop calling me!

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,439
I don't even have money to save myself.

16
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,520
Hello?

17
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,520
Hello?

18
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,079
(How can I make Yuan Xia believe me?)

19
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:02,150
=Present, is Present=

20
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,840
=Episode 3=
(Space-Time Rescue Trip)

21
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,439
Mr. Zhou.

22
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,942
Wei Ziqi seems to be
driving around aimlessly.

23
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,310
It doesn't look like he's going
to the hospital to see Yuan Xia.

24
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,520
Just keep your eye on him.

25
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,800
Okay.

26
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,919
I told you to watch Yuan Xia, didn't I?

27
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:41,919
How did she manage to leave
the hospital?

28
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:43,560
I can't be staying in the hospital 24/7.

29
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,759
I have to get off work too.

30
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,840
Besides,

31
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:47,680
Yuan Xia asked to have some time alone.

32
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,571
I didn't know she wanted time alone
in your house.

33
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,199
Yuan Xia is probably on her way back
to the hospital.

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,280
She fell into the water just now.

35
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:57,000
Make her some ginger tea.

36
00:02:57,142 --> 00:02:58,630
Just make sure you look after her well

37
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,719
before the board meeting.

38
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:01,039
No more mishaps.

39
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,680
Okay. What about you, then?

40
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,479
Yuan Xia suddenly turned up tonight.

41
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,714
Even if Lin Yu
didn't think anything was amiss,

42
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,560
he surely would've noticed her.

43
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,400
I'm going to come clean with them.

44
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,240
Mr. Wei...

45
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,719
I followed you because I was worried.

46
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:43,360
You misunderstood.

47
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,120
Misunderstood?

48
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,439
Then according to you,

49
00:03:46,514 --> 00:03:48,630
did I misunderstand
what a loyal subordinate you are?

50
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:50,919
Lin Yu.

51
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,240
What's going on?

52
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,159
Lin Yu?

53
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,199
Mr. Zhou.

54
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:01,000
This is Ziqi.

55
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,280
Ziqi?

56
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:06,879
You went on a joy ride to bait me, huh?

57
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,039
I didn't think you'd be that interested

58
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,240
in me and Yuan Xia.

59
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:12,240
You fell for the bait too easily.

60
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,240
How boring.

61
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,280
Wei Ziqi.

62
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,879
Gloat all you want

63
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:17,439
while you still can.

64
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:18,839
After the board meeting,

65
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:21,509
how long do you think
you can keep this up

66
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,371
without your father's will
to protect you?

67
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:24,720
By the way,

68
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:27,240
there's something you might not know.

69
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,959
Your father's death

70
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:31,160
was not an accident at all.

71
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,279
So you were involved

72
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,399
with my father's death.

73
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:42,240
Want to know more?

74
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:44,839
I'll be waiting for you tomorrow
at the Delin Club.

75
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,439
Chen Bo.

76
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,240
Yes.

77
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,439
Proceed as planned.

78
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,240
Tomorrow at the Delin Club,

79
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,240
make sure Wei Ziqi

80
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,439
signs the equity transfer agreement
as told.

81
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:17,079
Got it.

82
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,620
(Fu Ming Hospital)

83
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,720
Thanks.

84
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:05,800
Hello, who is it?

85
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:07,199
Hello, Yuan Xia.

86
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,240
Are you in Fu Ming Hospital right now?

87
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,199
You again.

88
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:11,920
How did you know?

89
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,720
No need to panic.

90
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,720
I just want to tell you

91
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,000
that you're not actually sick.

92
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,199
Your real medical report
is with Xing Nan.

93
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,600
How do you know these things?

94
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:22,839
There's something else I can tell you.

95
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:24,959
You can verify it and decide
whether or not to believe me.

96
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:27,399
Tonight, the winning number
for the Union Lotto is

97
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:30,839
01031821232605.

98
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:31,560
Did you get that?

99
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,839
It's getting more ridiculous.

100
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:34,240
I know I'm sick.

101
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,639
But my brain is working fine.

102
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:37,240
Yuan Xia, you have to believe me.

103
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,160
The winning number
of tonight's Union Lotto is 01...

104
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,319
01031821232605. I remember.

105
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,720
Anything else?

106
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,800
Also, tonight at Delin...

107
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:53,160
What the heck?

108
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,439
Yuan Xia.

109
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:58,279
I've got your test results.

110
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:01,069
Everything looks good,
except for the two wisdom teeth.

111
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,990
I'll make an appointment
to get them extracted tomorrow.

112
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,959
Dr. Xing.

113
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,600
I'm a cancer patient.

114
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:08,399
Shouldn't you be focusing treatment

115
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:10,399
on the more serious cancer diagnosis?

116
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,160
Why extract my wisdom teeth?

117
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,839
Wisdom teeth

118
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:18,240
are extracted sooner or later.

119
00:07:19,085 --> 00:07:20,830
Just do as I say
and extract them tomorrow.

120
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,199
Why are you here?

121
00:07:42,371 --> 00:07:43,600
What is actually wrong with me?

122
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,000
(Fu Ming Hospital Case Examination
Report, Physical Examination Report)

123
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,959
Nothing is wrong.

124
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:49,079
Nothing?

125
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,439
Then which of these two reports

126
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,639
is real?

127
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,079
A certain doctor lost his principles,

128
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:02,040
breaking the Physicians Oath by
fabricating false medical records.

129
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,199
Should I

130
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,399
report this matter to the authorities?

131
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,279
What was the report hotline?

132
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:08,360
123.

133
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,040
No, don't.

134
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,439
Yuan Xia, to be frank,

135
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,480
I can explain this whole thing.

136
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,240
Okay.

137
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:16,639
Then explain it to me.

138
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,680
Why did you lie to me
with a fake report?

139
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,920
Yuan Xia.

140
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:24,639
I swear on my name,

141
00:08:24,685 --> 00:08:25,950
I made you stay in the hospital

142
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,240
for your own sake.

143
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,519
Moreover,

144
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,959
it's not like you're totally healthy.

145
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,279
Look here.

146
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,510
You have lumbar muscle strain,

147
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,440
and your spinal curve is a little off.

148
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,320
And the wisdom teeth.

149
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,279
So you can extract them.

150
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,240
Get to the point.

151
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,480
Did Wei Ziqi make you do it?

152
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:45,799
Did he do this

153
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:48,080
to deliberately prank me, scare me?

154
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,240
Of course not.

155
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:49,919
With you, he is...

156
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,879
He is what?

157
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:00,840
(Wei: Watch Yuan Xia.)

158
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,919
(She must not leave the hospital tonight.)

159
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:04,159
He is a good boss.

160
00:09:09,142 --> 00:09:11,030
I don't care if Wei Ziqi kept me
in the hospital

161
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:13,200
as a prank or for my sake,
it doesn't change the fact

162
00:09:13,257 --> 00:09:14,960
that it's selfish behavior.

163
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,360
And I find it very disturbing.

164
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,000
You let him know that.

165
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:19,440
Right now,

166
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:20,879
I want to be discharged.

167
00:09:21,114 --> 00:09:23,030
I'm sure you'll permit it,
right, Dr. Xing?

168
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,639
(Wei, Yuan Xia found out
about the fake report.)

169
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:43,480
(I did my best.)

170
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,480
(She has been discharged.)

171
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,840
(Okay, got it.)

172
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:56,940
(Welfare Lottery, Photocopy)

173
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,919
Madam Sun.

174
00:10:16,142 --> 00:10:17,200
Are you making wontons?

175
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,840
Can I have a bowl?

176
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,120
Where were you the last few days?

177
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,080
Business trip again?

178
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,360
I set up a blind date for you
the other day,

179
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,039
that Chen.

180
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,840
Why didn't you go? Wasn't interested?

181
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,159
No.

182
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,039
Something came up that night
so I couldn't go.

183
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:32,639
I'd have to trouble you

184
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:34,440
to apologize to him on my behalf.

185
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:36,159
Don't worry about it.

186
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:37,320
I have a thick pile

187
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,759
of potential suitors.

188
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:40,960
I'll single out who's suitable for you.

189
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,320
I'm sure you'd be pleased.

190
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:43,720
Let me go prepare the wontons.

191
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,399
Okay.

192
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,799
Sit down and wait.

193
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:53,480
(Tonight, the winning number
for Union Lotto is)

194
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,759
(01031821232605.)

195
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:57,840
(Did you get that?)

196
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,600
The lotto.

197
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,159
The lotto.

198
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:03,799
Madam Sun, I'll be right back.

199
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,240
I'll be back.

200
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,960
Boss, give me a lotto.

201
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,679
Follow me.

202
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,039
(Your assistant is quite a character.)

203
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,039
(The first thing she did
was buying a lotto.)

204
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:32,960
(Continue following her.
Make sure she's safe.)

205
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,440
Mr. Zhou went through so much trouble
to get me here.

206
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:41,559
So where is he?

207
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:43,440
Mr. Zhou has an emergency.

208
00:11:43,571 --> 00:11:45,000
So I'll be sitting in for him tonight.

209
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,480
He wanted me to tell you,

210
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:49,100
it's not important whether or not
Mr. Wei Sr.'s death was an accident.

211
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,080
What matters is

212
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:51,440
if you don't sign,

213
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:53,399
you might be caught
in an accident tonight.

214
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:55,639
I won't beat around the bush.

215
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:57,399
He'd like you to sign

216
00:11:57,514 --> 00:11:59,440
this equity transfer agreement
soonest possible.

217
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,540
(Equity Transfer Agreement)

218
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,960
And if I won't?

219
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:22,840
Mr. Wei.

220
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,759
At the end of the day,
I watched you grow up.

221
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,759
It's my honest wish to see you flourish.

222
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,200
But if you remain ignorant,

223
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,960
then your hand

224
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:35,759
won't be able to touch any more women

225
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,879
or play any more games.

226
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,440
You're not kidding, huh?

227
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,279
Mr. Wei, have you made up your mind?

228
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,159
I won't sign it.

229
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,799
My brain must have short-circuited

230
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:13,360
to actually buy the lotto.

231
00:13:14,171 --> 00:13:15,240
But what's done is done.

232
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:17,440
Who knows I might win a few bucks.

233
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,679
Let me see.

234
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,380
(Winning Numbers)

235
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,340
(Lancheng Welfare Lottery)

236
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:59,960
031821232605!

237
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,960
Jackpot!

238
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:09,919
Hang on.

239
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,080
How did he know the winning number?

240
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,279
Who is he?

241
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,440
(And the thing he said...)

242
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,120
(You're not actually sick.)

243
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,279
(Your real medical report
is with Xing Nan.)

244
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,360
(Yuan Xia, you have to believe me.)

245
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,240
(Also, tonight at Delin...)

246
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:38,080
(Delin Club?)

247
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:50,879
(Why did he mention Delin Club?)

248
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,159
(What's happening here?)

249
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:02,840
(Wei Ziqi?)

250
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:10,942
Get in.

251
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:11,600
Don't touch me.

252
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,519
Get in, right now.

253
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:13,039
What?

254
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,629
Don't touch me!

255
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,571
Don't make us use force.

256
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:18,600
Get in right now.

257
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,840
Wei Ziqi!

258
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:22,120
Scram!

259
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:23,840
Run!

260
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,039
After them!

261
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:25,919
Go!

262
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,360
Stop right there!

263
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:29,159
Stop!

264
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,879
It's okay. I have a self-defense kit.

265
00:15:49,085 --> 00:15:50,080
What are you doing here?

266
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,200
I...

267
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,039
You two go ahead. I'll handle this.

268
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,480
Who is she?

269
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,279
Never mind that.

270
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,240
Come on!

271
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,759

Don't worry.

293
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:50,079
Chen Bo is a subordinate my dad
had personally trained.

294
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,285
He learned that Zhou Wei
was going to deal with me tonight,

295
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,440
so he came to check on me.

296
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:00,480
Mr. Wei.

297
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:05,559
Make sure you keep a close eye
on Zhou Wei

298
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:07,839
until the board meeting tomorrow.

299
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:09,400
Rest assured.

300
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,599
Wei Ziqi, you twerp!

301
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,240
How dare you steal my bike
to impress the lady?

302
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:16,599
Alright.

303
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,559
Just you wait.

304
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,480
Ni Ning, right?

305
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,240
Wei asked me to pick you up.

306
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,839
You don't remember me?

307
00:18:36,914 --> 00:18:38,310
Last time at the hospital parking,

308
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:39,559
you took up my spot.

309
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:45,200
Wei Ziqi.

310
00:18:45,428 --> 00:18:47,240
I've worked as your assistant
for two years.

311
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,039
I thought I knew you well.

312
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,559
But I realized just tonight

313
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,160
that there were two sides to you.

314
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:53,559
Was I too dumb?

315
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:55,359
Or was it because
of your incredible acting?

316
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,759
Yuan Xia.

317
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:10,559
I didn't intend to keep it from you.

318
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,599
You know how it is at the company.

319
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,039
My every move
is being watched by Zhou Wei.

320
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,279
Before I officially acquire the equity,

321
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,559
I have no means
to go face-to-face with him.

322
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:24,480
So every day, I had to play

323
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,799
the idiotic, rich playboy

324
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,799
to make him put his guard down.

325
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,279
But I didn't think

326
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:33,039
he'd drag you into the mix.

327
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,240
Zhou Wei?

328
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,279
Wait, let me think.

329
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:42,640
I remember you said the bottle
of red wine was expensive

330
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,039
because it was the last bottle

331
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:46,440
from Chateau Cheval Blanc's
1953 limited production.

332
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,200
So this bottle is a fake...

333
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,160
(Since that night at the bar,)

334
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,371
(a series of mishaps and accidents)

335
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,150
(Brake failure)
(have been happening around me.)

336
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,114
(I got into an accident
when my car lost control.)

337
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,200
It wasn't because the car parts
were worn out.

338
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,000
It was Zhou Wei's attempt to kill me.

339
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,519
Yes.

340
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,559
Because I found out
about the bar's fake accounts.

341
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,828
He worried that I would find out

342
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,319
he was using such high-spending venues

343
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,640
to transfer company funds.

344
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,799
I had thought

345
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:15,640
he wanted to get rid of you
because of me.

346
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:17,680
So you deliberately fired me

347
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,880
to cut any ties with me.

348
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,920
And you kept me in the hospital
with a fake report

349
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,839
to prevent Zhou Wei from harming me.

350
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,279
Yuan Xia, about that,

351
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,400
I apologize.

352
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:31,119
I'm sorry.

353
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:35,400
Not so fast.

354
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,680
What's the matter?

355
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,440
Sit.

356
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,359
I get it.

357
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,960
You don't want the innocent
to be implicated.

358
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,160
You don't want to endanger me.

359
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:49,720
But that doesn't mean

360
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,599
you should risk your own life.

361
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,160
The car accident.

362
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,680
A driver's instinctive reaction

363
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,640
should be to turn the steering wheel
and avoid the oncoming danger.

364
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,640
But you did the opposite

365
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,079
and hit the barrier directly.

366
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:06,039
That doesn't make sense.

367
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:18,559
Why do you think

368
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,680
I did that, then?

369
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,799
You were trying to protect
someone you cared about.

370
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,480
It's just like the palace feud dramas.

371
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,480
You're using me to confuse Zhou Wei,

372
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:37,240
a shield for Xixi.

373
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,440
No, that's not it.

374
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,359
You got it wrong.

375
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:41,240
There's nothing between Xixi and I.

376
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,359
We're innocent.

377
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,599
We were just role-playing.

378
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:44,640
Don't get the wrong idea.

379
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,039
Oh? It doesn't matter.

380
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:47,079
It doesn't...

381
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:48,880
It doesn't matter?

382
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,640
Yeah.

383
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:51,640
What I'm more curious about is

384
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,839
that you knew Zhou Wei
was out to get you.

385
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:55,759
So why did you still show up tonight?

386
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:57,359
You were putting yourself in danger.

387
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:01,799
If I didn't meet him as agreed,

388
00:22:02,085 --> 00:22:03,830
Zhou Wei would surely
have done something.

389
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:05,200
And very likely,

390
00:22:06,257 --> 00:22:08,240
people who are important to me
might be harmed.

391
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,240
I didn't want to take that risk.

392
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:14,240
I never knew

393
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:17,240
Dr. Xing was that important to you.

394
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,599
Not Xing Nan.

395
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:40,640
Yuan Xia.

396
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,599
I did all this because of you.

397
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:54,240
I like you.

398
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,960
Do you have time tonight?

399
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,839
Let's eat together.

400
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,440
I'd like to hear

401
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,759
your thoughts on the company.

402
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,039
Wei Ziqi.

403
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:13,839
Are you too engrossed in your acting?

404
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:14,880
Listen up.

405
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,640
You better not simply say such things.

406
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,400
You know what?

407
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,759
You can play such jokes
with others.

408
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:20,039
But me? Don't even try.

409
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:21,240
I won't fall for it.

410
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,440
At first,

411
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,880
I was in a terrific mood today
because I won the lottery.

412
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,720
Now...

413
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,880
No, Yuan Xia. I'm not lying to you.

414
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,599
From the start...

415
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:29,599
My lotto.

416
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,260
(Lancheng Welfare Lottery)

417
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,640
Look!

418
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,839
It's stained with your blood!

419
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,440
Because of your appearance,

420
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,200
you destroyed the other possibility
my life could've taken.

421
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,000
You soiled the lottery ticket!
