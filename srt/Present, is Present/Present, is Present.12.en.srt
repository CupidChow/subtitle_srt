(Year 2025)

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:10,780
(Receiving address: Yuan Xia,
No. 28, Jiangjing, Lancheng City)

3
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,342
(Sender: Wei Ziqi)

4
00:00:17,457 --> 00:00:20,260
(Time Telephone Booth.
Let time stop for each other)

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,120
(I've guessed it.)

6
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,920
(When you receive this postcard)

7
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,920
(and hear the voice recording,)

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,550
(you'd give me an earful.)

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,390
(Scolding me for not keeping my word,)

10
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:35,520
(for being selfish.)

11
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,560
(Once again, I left you alone.)

12
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:40,520
(You'd probably add something else.)

13
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,030
(Men and their words cannot be trusted.)

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,880
(Did I guess it right?)

15
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,070
(I never told you.)

16
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,110
(After I found out what happened
to me in the other world,)

17
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,390
(I was so glad
we're still together now.)

18
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,390
Thankful that you're still by my side.

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,000
Thankful we made
so many good memories together.

20
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,120
But slowly,

21
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,760
the joy turned into fear.

22
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,310
Because we had a wonderful past.

23
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,710
That's why I'm scared to lose it.

24
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,760
I can't even imagine

25
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,310
how the other Wei Ziqi

26
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,950
is able to endure the days without you.

27
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,840
(Time Telephone Booth.
Let time stop for each other)

28
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,640
Yuan Xian.

29
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,590
In my life,

30
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,920
there are two turning points.

31
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:47,000
The first one was when my parents died.

32
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,710
Everything good in my life

33
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:54,680
was destroyed then.

34
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,710
The other one is you.

35
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,000
You burst into the building.

36
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,000
You came with your unique
verve for life.

37
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,910
At that moment, I thought

38
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,360
that the blooming season
wasn't the greatest.

39
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,310
This moment was.

40
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,520
(I became a little thief
without realizing it.)

41
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,150
(When we reunited,)

42
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,080
(I secretly
stashed you away in this life)

43
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,120
(where I was supposed
to have cleaned up the mess alone.)

44
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,840
Yuan Xia.

45
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,030
I'm sorry.

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,800
And...

47
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,000
I love you.

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,800
Ziqi.

49
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,960
I love you too.

50
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:21,540
(Tomb of Wei Ziqi)

51
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:26,950
(Wei Ziqi protected me with his life.)

52
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,870
(My ending has changed.)

53
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,040
(Tomb of Wei Ziqi)

54
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,190
(But Wei Ziqi,)

55
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,720
(this shouldn't have been
how our story ended.)

(Loving You with My Life)

58
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,390
Mr. Xi.

59
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,680
I'm on the way to the factory.

60
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,310
You invested so much money.

61
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:00,040
It's only right for you
to see where the money went.

62
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,190
Of course, I'm sure when you see it,

63
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,830
you won't be disappointed.

64
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,360
Is that so?

65
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,720
Definitely.

66
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:11,390
I really hope
you won't let me down again.

67
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,750
He's come knocking by himself.

68
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,630
That saved me the trouble.

69
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,600
Is everything ready?

70
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,830
Our men are already in position.

71
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:31,870
This time,

72
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,190
no matter what,

73
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,390
we will make him

74
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,360
tell us how to operate the phone.

75
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,360
What about Wei Ziqi?

76
00:06:38,885 --> 00:06:41,171
Should we get rid of him
after we get what we want?

77
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,750
It's Xi Lin.

78
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,830
Ziqi.

79
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,220
(Xi Lin)

80
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,460
(Xi Lin)

81
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,120
Ziqi.

82
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,600
Dad, I won't let you touch Ziqi.

83
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,600
If you do anything to him,
I'll kill myself.

84
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,085
For the next few days,

85
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,600
you will be staying home.

86
00:07:59,260 --> 00:07:59,920
(Outpatient)

87
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,430
Okay, got it. I'll be right there.

88
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,190
Hold up.

89
00:08:04,971 --> 00:08:07,360
What about you stay here
to receive the call from the future?

90
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,390
I'll go to Wei.

91
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,000
Worried about me?

92
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:18,870
I worry that you might ruin Wei's plan.

93
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:19,680
Besides,

94
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,430
I'm a grown man.

95
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,870
I can't let a woman
go to the frontline in this case.

96
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,070
You are worried about me.

97
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,750
No, I'm not.

98
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,240
Yes, you are.

99
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,040
Yes.

100
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm worried about you.

101
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,750
I worry you'll be in danger.

102
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:43,960
Xing Nan.

103
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,150
I suddenly have an urge

104
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,480
to develop something more than
a bed relationship with you.

105
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,440
Like what?

106
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,440
Or perhaps,

107
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,240
you only want to sleep with me?

108
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:55,960
No.

109
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,870
You don't want to sleep?

110
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,270
No, I want to sleep.

111
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:58,910
You do?

112
00:08:58,910 --> 00:08:59,960
Yes, I want to sleep.

113
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,240
But I think you and I,

114
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,000
we should...

Mr. Xi.

128
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,120
The entourage for the tour
is a little overwhelming.

129
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,480
Oh, Ziqi.

130
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,030
You've put on the show long enough.

131
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,390
It's about time to end it.

132
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,390
After pretending for so long,

133
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,870
now that death is near,

134
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,270
you can't go on?

135
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,750
Mr. Xi.

136
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,750
If you had just held it together,

137
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,600
I wouldn't have realized so early on

138
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,030
that you were the real culprit.

139
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,000
You still can't get off
your high horse even now.

140
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:50,790
Cut the crap.

141
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:54,240
What's the code to switch this phone on?

142
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,630
You don't know what the code is?

143
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:00,840
So the phone

144
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,240
is just a brick in your hands.

145
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,200
You should've told me.

146
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,200
Then I wouldn't have had
to come for nothing.

147
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,550
I'll be off.

148
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:08,750
Let him go.

149
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,390
If you leave now,

150
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,790
I'll just have to look for Yuan Xia.

151
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,914
Beneficiary.

152
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,460
(Property, will,
and inheritance documents)

153
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,750
These are the intermediary materials
you'll need when you go abroad.

154
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,600
I've checked everything for you.

155
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,840
You just have to sign it.

156
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,580
(Yuan Xia)

157
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,320
(Calling Mr. Wei)

158
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,080
(Sorry.)

159
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:59,080
(The number you have dialed
is currently unavailable.)

160
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:05,460
(15,000 French words to memorize)

161
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,200
I know.

162
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,150
You've sent Yuan Xia away.

163
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,000
But do believe me when I say this.

164
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,270
No matter where she goes,

165
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:17,000
even if it's to the ends of the earth,

166
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,790
I'll be able to find her.

167
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,150
Don't you dare.

168
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,600
I'm about to die.

169
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,200
What's there to worry about?

170
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:42,320
As for how Yuan Xia may end up...

171
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,550
That will depend on your performance.

172
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,840
Fine, I'll tell you.

173
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,200
The code is the time my mom died

174
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,960
and converted it to binary.

175
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,870
111...

176
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:16,550
Hang on.

177
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,390
Write it here.

178
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,750
I'm warning you. No tricks.

179
00:13:38,714 --> 00:13:40,914
(Find a way to get your hands
on Xi Kun's phone.)

180
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,990
(Target signal found. Connecting)
(Enter a code for the virus.)

181
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,200
(Only then can I find proof
of his money laundering.)

182
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,000
Wei Ziqi.

183
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,120
If you dare lie to me today,

184
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,200
I promise you,

185
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,960
you won't be able to leave.

187
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,550
Why so impatient?

188
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,790
The phone will only work at 12 noon.

189
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,630
That's why it cannot
be connected right now.

190
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,790
Okay.

191
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,390
I'll give you two more minutes.

195
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,440
Wei Ziqi.

196
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,790
You really pushed your luck.

197
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,080
Hello?

198
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,600
Is that Wei?

199
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,000
Xing Nan, this is Yuan Xia.

200
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,030
Hello?

201
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,940
(Yuan Xia)

202
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,790
What is it?

203
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,510
Mr. Xi.

204
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,270
Did your password get leaked?

205
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,440
Our business accounts
have been made public.

206
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,480
The police just showed up.

207
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:41,000
They said they received a tip
for illegal money laundering.

208
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,960
You're worse than your dad!

209
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:57,960
Alright.

210
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,390
Since you mentioned my dad,

211
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,200
allow me to settle the score

212
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,080
of you murdering my dad with you.

213
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,120
Also,

214
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,342
you should count yourself lucky, Xi Kun.

215
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,360
If it weren't for Yuan Xia,

216
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,750
you'd end up in a more sorry state.

217
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,200
(Wei Ziqi.)

218
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,550
(You won't spare me?)

219
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,750
(Then I'd just
drag you to hell with me.)

220
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,110
Pei Shen.

221
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,640
Go to my study

222
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,350
and open the safe.

223
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,680
I left something inside for Xi Lin.

224
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:15,960
It's enough for her
to live a carefree life abroad.

225
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:20,440
You know why I trust you.

226
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,880
Help me look after her.

227
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,942
Go and turn ourselves in.

228
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:49,980
(Car park)

229
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,890
I couldn't get through to Wei
on the phone.

230
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,057
Split up and look for him.

231
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,790
Okay, this way.

232
00:18:59,030 --> 00:18:59,680
Wei!

233
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:02,830
Wei!

234
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,350
Pick up the phone.

235
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,000
Wei Ziqi!

236
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,680
Wei Ziqi!

237
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,400
Wei!

238
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,240
Wei Ziqi!

239
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,550
Nothing.

240
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,160
Pick up the phone.

241
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,400
Ziqi, pick up the phone.

242
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,000
Pick up the phone!

243
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,590
Wei Ziqi, where are you?

244
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,790
I'm in the refrigeration room.

245
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,550
Quick, to the refrigeration room!

246
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,440
Wei Ziqi, wait for me.

247
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,440
Hang in there.

248
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,480
You hear me?

249
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,070
(Yuan Xia.)

250
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,110
(Take your time.)

251
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,310
(Yuan Xia.)

252
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,200
(I promised you.)

253
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:35,790
(That I'll deliver an umbrella
to you when it rains.)

254
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,510
(I also said I'd spend time
with you in France.)

255
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,480
(And the love letter you wrote to me)

256
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,000
(at the Time Space Telephone Booth.)

257
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,350
(I haven't had the chance to hear it.)

258
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,680
(What to do?)

259
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:56,400
(I realized there are still
so many things)

260
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,550
(we haven't done.)

261
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,400
(Forgive me for always
saying sorry to you.)

262
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,350
(But this time,)

263
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:11,510
(if I'm still able to see you again,)

264
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,830
(we'll make sure
not to have any regrets.)

265
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,510
(Yuan Xia.)

266
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:58,780
(Refrigeration Room)

267
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:43,880
You're awake.

268
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,000
Do you feel unwell?

269
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:48,920
It's okay.

270
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,680
The doctor said
you'll recover in a few days.

271
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,720
I'm sorry.

272
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,590
Did you just say you're sorry?

273
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,000
You're apologizing?

274
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,960
Mr. Wei did it to save me.

275
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,000
I should be flattered.

276
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,400
No need to apologize.

277
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,000
Men and their words cannot be trusted.

278
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,400
No way I'd believe you again.

279
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,480
Rest and recuperate.

280
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,400
Good that he's awake.

281
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,270
Make sure he rests.

282
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,240
We'll head back now.

283
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,400
Feeling better now?

284
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:53,750
You said you wanted to develop something
more than a bed relationship with me.

285
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,790
Did you mean it?

286
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,750
You heard it wrong.

287
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:02,550
I said I felt an urge.

288
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,790
An urge is fine.
Really, it's fine with me.

289
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:05,680
Keep your voice down.

290
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,270
Let's go. Go.

291
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,070
Okay. Let's go back, then.

292
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,510
I was wrong.

293
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,880
What I did was wrong.

294
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,200
Does the benefactor

295
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,640
need the beneficiary

296
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,030
to do anything for him?

297
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,790
Are you... feeling bored?

298
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,070
Should I help you
with French vocabulary?

299
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:38,790
Okay.

300
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,480
Perfect.

301
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,590
I just translated this page.

302
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,400
Have a listen and tell me if it's right.

303
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,830
Although Yuan Xia and I
have yet to be married

304
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,440
nor are we related by blood,

305
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,440
she is the last being
I care about in this world.

306
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,160
Yuan.

307
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,510
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

308
00:25:57,828 --> 00:25:59,110
Whatever happens to me, Wei Ziqi,

309
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:01,310
whether my death
is due to an accident or illness,

310
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:03,200
all the properties under my name,

311
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:05,590
including but not limited
to 54% of the equity

312
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,680
in MU Communications Group,

313
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:10,200
a house located at No. 28 Jiangjing

314
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,270
with a built-up area
of ​​280 square meters,

315
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,590
property certificate number S00308342,

316
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,510
are unconditionally gifted
to Ms. Yuan Xia.

317
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,310
I guarantee...

318
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,200
I guarantee.

319
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,070
I guarantee that I will not
be this way again.

320
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,030
I know it's my fault.

321
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:24,830
It's not your fault.

322
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,830
The fault is mine.

323
00:26:27,371 --> 00:26:29,942
It's my fault for not knowing French
and simply signing my name.

324
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,640
I got what I deserved.

325
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:37,200
You didn't translate the last bit.

326
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,500
(She is not yet my wife,
but she is my everything.)

327
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:52,310

328

I still haven't forgiven you.

331
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,510
I just don't want to be like you

332
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,830
and waste what little time we have.

333
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,070
If we waste the present moment

334
00:27:21,542 --> 00:27:23,440
because of what hasn't happened
in the future,

335
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:26,590

00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:29,440
