I am Ziqi's girlfriend.

00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,670
My dad's going to organize
a small-scale welcoming party for me

4
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:12,519
at my family's hotel in a few more days.

5
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:14,080
Ziqi, bring her along.

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,320
Today, let me officially introduce
this lady to all of you.

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,719
This lady here is my girlfriend,
Yuan Xia.

8
00:00:21,857 --> 00:00:24,030
These are the gifts
that Ms. Xi has prepared for everyone.

9
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:25,679
Are you going to take them together

10
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:26,800
or should I give them to Ms. Yuan

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,879
when she leaves?

12
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:39,840
Where are you going?

13
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,039
I have to go to Yuan Xia.

14
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:42,960
You just finished paying respect
to her, right?

15
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:45,000
What do you mean?
Yuan Xia is alive, right?

16
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:45,920
Don't mind me.

17
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,000
- Wei.
- Wei.

18
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:48,880
What are you doing?

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,960
Yuan Xia has been gone for a year.

20
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,119
It's time for you to let her go
and start living your life, okay?

21
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:57,159
A year?

22
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:01,719
On March 22, 2024, Yuan Xia

23
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,239
was killed at home at 12:04 noon.

24
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,200
Impossible.

25
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,439
Impossible.

26
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,840
Her time of death has changed

27
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,359
but she still ends up dying.

28
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:32,519
Impossible. Why?

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Think carefully.

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,799
Think.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,519
Think, Wei Ziqi.

32
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,840
(March 22, 2025, 10:00)

33
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,920

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:08,879
Yuan Xia.

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,800
How do you feel?

39
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:19,039
Do you feel unwell?

40
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,840
You are okay now. Don't be afraid.

41
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,240
Babe, you are finally awake.

42
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,199
I was worried.

43
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,319
How do you feel?

44
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:41,800
Do you feel better now?

45
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm fine.

46
00:03:43,171 --> 00:03:44,310
It's good that you are fine.

47
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,360
Otherwise,
Mr. Wei will be worried to death.

48
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,120

Do you understand what I mean?

53
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,319
Nonsense.

54
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:57,240
If it's nonsense,

55
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,959
why are you feeling shy?

56
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,360
What nonsense

57
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,639
did you show her?

58
00:05:07,771 --> 00:05:09,430
I asked you to bring
some clothes for her,

59
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,319
not to harass her.

60
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,720
You are so ungrateful.

61
00:05:13,228 --> 00:05:14,971
What did you find from the CCTV footage?

62
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,560
Did you see who pushed her?

63
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:17,720
No.

64
00:05:18,228 --> 00:05:20,690
The CCTV footage of the time
Yuan Xia was pushed into the water

65
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,120
has been tampered with.

66
00:05:22,171 --> 00:05:23,720
We are trying to recover the data now.

67
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,000
No need to investigate anymore.

68
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,480
It was probably Zhou Wei.

69
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,399
Zhou Wei?

70
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,759
When I was at the hotel parking lot
as I was leaving,

71
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:33,879
I saw him sneaking inside

72
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,720
from the back door of the hotel.

73
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,759
Then?

74
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,360
I called you but you didn't pick up.
I was afraid that...

75
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,279
I didn't want him to get away.

76
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:48,120
So, I went back to find you.

77
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,360
What about you?

78
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,519
How did you find me?

79
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,360
You sent me a message saying

80
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,360
that you were leaving.

81
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,160
So, I wanted to leave too.

82
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:03,240
But...

83
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,240
Ten minutes ago,

84
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,759
I saw her when I went
to the parking lot to get a car.

85
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:08,519
She was about to leave.

86
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:10,319
But she suddenly returned to the hotel.

87
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,120
Luckily, you didn't throw away the tag.

88
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:22,040
Otherwise, I wouldn't have found you.

89
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,160
(My phone is still in the car.)

90
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,360
Mr. Wei.

91
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,079
When are you going back
to Lakeside Hotel to get the car?

92
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:32,639
I'll go with you.

93
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,399
No.

94
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,920
Why not?

95
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,839
I even brought you the car key.

96
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,828
She almost got killed
at that place just now.

97
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,199
Actually...

98
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:40,839
Ni Ning.

99
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,480
I'll leave it to you.

100
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:43,240
Okay.

101
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,319
I can go there

102
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:47,240
to check on the progress
of the data recovery.

103
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,457
Then I'll get the car.

104
00:06:53,171 --> 00:06:54,057
I'll get going now.

105
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:06,519
When can I be discharged?

106
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,639
Wait for a while.

107
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:14,839
I'll ask the doctor.

108
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,360

What is the meaning of this?

111
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,839
You occupied my parking space again.

112
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,240
Is this your parking space?

113
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:03,879
Dr. Xing.

114
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,360
You are my boss's best friend.

115
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,639
And I am Mr. Wei's assistant.

116
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:07,839
Since we are related in that way,

117
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:09,639
aren't we considered close friends?

118
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,519
Since it's time for your lunch break,

119
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:15,879
how about we go to a cafe

120
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,742
to discuss something important?

121
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,485
What do you want to discuss?

122
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:24,959
Your friend asked you

123
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,279
to get his car for him

00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,040

125
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,759
What are you doing?

126
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:40,080
Get out. This is my car.

127
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm going to occupy your parking space.

128
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,960
And I'm driving your car.

129
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,399
As for you,

130
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:48,840
go and get the car.

This is my car!

132
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,840
I can't ride.

00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:53,600
This is me.

135
00:09:58,559 --> 00:09:59,840
I'll go in now.

136
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,039

- Yuan Xia.
- Wei Ziqi.

140
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,519
Why did you

141
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:45,399
return to the hotel that day?

142
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,200
Weren't you afraid?

143
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,120
I was.

144
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,759
Why did you go back?

145
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,028
I went back because I was afraid
that you would be in danger.

146
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:18,440
Hello.

147
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,879
Hey, Yuan Xia's friend called her

148
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:21,960
asking her not to go home.

149
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:23,320
He's crazy.

150
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:24,200
He even threatened me.

151
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:24,919
Be careful!

152
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:25,960
Hello?

153
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:27,399
Wait for me here.

154
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:28,039
Hello?

155
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,840
Did you see who it was?

156
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,639
Is Zhou Wei

157
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,759
behind this again?

158
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,840
No matter who's behind this,

159
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,159
you can't stay here anymore for now.

160
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:57,840
Until Zhou Wei is arrested,

161
00:11:58,628 --> 00:11:59,840
you have to move out from here.

162
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:09,919
Let's go.

163
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:11,080
Wait.

164
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,399
Are you asking me

165
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,600
to move into your house?

166
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,200
Everything happened too suddenly.

167
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,740
I didn't have time to get another place.

168
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:22,639
Besides, if you are in danger again,

169
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,200
I can't guarantee that I can be there
to save you every time.

170
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,639
So, for safety purposes,

171
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,960
it's better for you
to stay here for now.

172
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,279
Let's go. I'll help you.

173
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,240
Didn't I ask Ni Ning
to get the car for me?

174
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,159
Ask her yourself.

175
00:12:49,542 --> 00:12:50,390
Here's your car key.

176
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,200
Let me retrieve my thing.

177
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,909
Dr. Xing, thank you for your warning.

178
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,828
Otherwise, I don't know
what would've happened.

179
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,519
You should thank your friend.

180
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:13,039
What did he say?

181
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,840
Yuan Xia.

182
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:25,549
Do go home right now.

183
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,000
Otherwise, your life will be in danger.

184
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,240
Yuan Xia, are you listening?

185
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,639
Are you crazy?

186
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,120
Xing Nan.

187
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:32,720
Who are you?

188
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:33,960
I am Yuan Xia's friend.

189
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,279
Call her right now

190
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,320
and ask her not to go home.

191
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,789
Or everyone will find out tomorrow

192
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:40,685
that you've never been in a relationship
and that you are still a virgin.

193
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:42,759
Hello?

194
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,679
He didn't say anything.

195
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,240
Who's your friend?

196
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,320
How does he know me?

197
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:52,080
He's my neighbor.

198
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,360
When you sent me home together
with Mr. Wei that day,

199
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,519
he heard your voice.

200
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,070
And I praised you a lot in front of him.

201
00:13:57,085 --> 00:13:59,371
So, he knew that it was you
when you picked up the call.

202
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,120
He must have called me
to warn me because

203
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,519
he saw someone breaking into my house.

204
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,840
Luckily, you picked up his call.

205
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,240
Thank you, my savior.

206
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:06,919
It's okay.

207
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:07,440
Yuan Xia.

208
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:10,679
Take your bags in first.

209
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,759
Okay. I'll get going now.

210
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:13,399
Okay.

211
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:18,360
Wait.

212
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,000
What is it?

213
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,039
Who's her friend?

214
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:26,240
How would I know?

215
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,428
Let's go in and talk.

216
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,480
You should go back and rest.

217
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,240
Wei Ziqi.

218
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,519
I went through a lot
to retrieve your car.

219
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:33,430
Are you chasing me away?

220
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,571
Ask someone to take me home.

221
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:36,039
You can drive this car home.

222
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,440
Are you crazy?

223
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,039
Your driver is here.
She'll take you home. Go.

224
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,840
I can drive my own car.

225
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,519
Give me the key.

226
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,360
That's great. You can take me home.

227
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,320
Is your GPS wrong?

228
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,440
I think it's the wrong way.

229
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,720
We are not. When a man
and a woman are alone in a car,

230
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:04,399
we have to go somewhere deserted.

231
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:05,519
Don't you like it?

232
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:10,879
You are a lady.

233
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:13,080
Why do you keep talking
about inappropriate things?

234
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,879
Dr. Xing.

235
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:27,159
Do you like me?

236
00:15:31,685 --> 00:15:32,657
What a coincidence.

237
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:35,879
Your face and body

238
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,919
are my cup of tea too.

239
00:15:41,228 --> 00:15:42,742
Let's not beat around the bush, then.

240
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,039
We are both adults.

241
00:15:45,257 --> 00:15:46,857
Let's get straight to the point, okay?

242
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,360
What are you talking about?

243
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,514
You don't want to do it?

244
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:54,879
Then forget it.

245
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:00,120
I'm not afraid.

246
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:01,840
According to Mr. Wei,

247
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,639
you are a walking love encyclopedia.

248
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:06,759
You gave him lots of advice
when you helped him pretend

249
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:08,440
to be a romantic gentleman.

250
00:16:09,314 --> 00:16:11,000
I was just speaking from experience.

251
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,039
But why do I think

252
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,657
that you are a naive man
who has never been in a relationship?

253
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,360
You learned those moves

254
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:21,840
from idol dramas, right?

255
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:26,840
How cute.

256
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:32,799
So,

257
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,600
if you want something
to happen between us,

258
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:39,240
I'll gladly help you with it.

259
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:55,120
You don't want it?

260
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,159
Forget it, then.

261
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,119
It's a waste for such a great place.

262
00:17:06,314 --> 00:17:07,657
Let's go back to our own home.

263
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:15,799
I'm not afraid.

264
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,759
Dr. Xing,

265
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,359
I really like you.

266
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:26,880
It's true.

267
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,119
I just want to have a car ride
with you today.

268
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:33,599
No other ulterior motive.

269
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,720
See?

270
00:17:38,114 --> 00:17:39,350
We are not far away from home.

271
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,039
Yes. I'm talking about a car ride too.

272
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,420
(Xing Nan)

273
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,240
Wei Ziqi.

274
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,485
I'm coming. What do you need?

275
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:13,079
Do you have make-up remover at home?

276
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:14,000
I forgot to bring it.

277
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,720
No.

278
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:16,480
I don't have feminine things
like that at home.

279
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,029
What about Coco and Cici?

280
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,857
They are just hired actresses
with professional ethics.

281
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,790
They get off work after
dealing with Zhou Wei for me.

282
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,450
I promise that she's never lingered
in my house for more than one minute

283
00:18:25,485 --> 00:18:27,000
and she has never spent the night here.

284
00:18:27,971 --> 00:18:30,571
It's okay if you don't have it.
I'll ask someone to deliver it.

285
00:18:35,542 --> 00:18:36,790
Finally, I've made myself clear.

286
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,000
Finally, I've made myself clear.

287
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,839
Hello, Wei Ziqi.

288
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:04,880
Finally, you've called me back.

289
00:19:05,342 --> 00:19:07,440
It's nothing.
I just need to ask you some questions.

290
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,160
Yuan Xia and I

291
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,599
are living together right now.

292
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:12,240
Based on the knowledge from the books,

293
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:13,759
do you have any good advice for me?

294
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:17,000
Are you calling me
right now to ask that?

295
00:19:17,057 --> 00:19:18,070
Why else would I call you?

296
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:19,789
Is there anything
more important than that?

297
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:22,628
Me, your best friend, is stranded
in the wilderness at midnight.

298
00:19:22,657 --> 00:19:23,790
My car has run out of petrol.

299
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:25,720
Shouldn't you worry
about my personal safety?

300
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:28,260
But you only think about those
dirty things between men and women.

301
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:29,920
You ungrateful friend. Get lost!

302
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:43,680
Let me tell you.

303
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,720
I'm really mad now.

304
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,759
I can't be appeased.

305
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,440
I won't accept anything
that you want to...

306
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,480
That's fine.

307
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:50,359
By the way, you told me

308
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,160
some tricks last time
that can make a girl fall for you.

309
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,240
Can you repeat them?

310
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,440
Tell me and
I'll ask someone to pick you up.

311
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,519
I don't need your help.

312
00:19:58,799 --> 00:19:59,799
Forget it then.

313
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:02,171
I'll log into your account later
and search for them online.

314
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:05,359
Wait.

315
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:10,000
Actually, we can talk it through.

316
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:12,240
After all, we are friends, right?

317
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,759
I happen to have a friend

318
00:20:14,942 --> 00:20:17,070
who has gone through
what you are about to go through.

319
00:20:17,457 --> 00:20:19,030
I think I can give you some good advice.

320
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:19,920
Okay.

321
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:22,119
It's like this.

322
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,680
When you are in a confined place,

323
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:28,799
approach her slowly

324
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:33,359
and blow some air gently

325
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:38,480
into her ear.

326
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,799
Then, ask her tenderly.

327
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:44,200
Do you like it?

328
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:47,359
Blow some air?

329
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:07,799
Why were you so quiet?

330
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:08,759
You scared me.

331
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,480
Do you...

332
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,839
Are you crazy?

333
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:27,599
Why did you blow air into my ear?

334
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:29,599
No.

335
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,428
I like...

336
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,500
What are you going to wash?

337
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:33,519
The floor?

338
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,400
This is your fault.
Wash the floor yourself.

339
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:37,920
You are so weird.

340
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:47,640
Did I do it wrong?

341
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:58,160
(What should I do? Is she mad?)

342
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,519
(Why is he staring at me?)

343
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:02,880
(This is awkward.)

344
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:05,839
I haven't cooked in a while.

345
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:07,240
So, I'm rusty at it.

346
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:08,920
I'll practice more after this.

347
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,799
We can take turns to cook.

348
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:14,160
I've troubled you enough
by staying here.

349
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:15,880
I can't eat for free.

350
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,800
That'll be difficult.

351
00:22:19,828 --> 00:22:22,270
In my family, there's no such thing
as the men waiting to be fed

352
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:23,880
while the women cook.

353
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:26,680
I still remember that my dad used
to cook a lot when I was young.

354
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,839
But...

355
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:38,240
This is my first time having the chance

356
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,680
to cook for someone at home.

357
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,640
Ms. Yuan, be kind to me.

358
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,680
Mr. Wei.

359
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:46,359
This is your second time tonight
emphasizing

360
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:49,759
that I'm the first person
who stayed over at your home.

361
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:51,599
Wei.

362
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,960
Can I stay over at your home today?

363
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:57,079
I'm sure those debt collectors

364
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:58,480
are still outside of my house.

365
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:00,119
Sure.

366
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,359
Thank you, Wei.

367
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:05,180
♪I'm not just a passerby♪

368
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,060
♪I'm trying my hardest♪

369
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:12,279
You are not the first.

370
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:14,200
