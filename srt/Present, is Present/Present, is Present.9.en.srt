1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,270
Brother,

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:05,400
you're obviously Wei Ziqi.

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:07,320
You also knew who I was.

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:09,880
Why have you been lying to me
and misleading me?

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,350
Yuan Xia, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:14,640
It was my fault

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,640
that led to your death.

8
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,120
When you left after resigning,

9
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:21,920
we lost contact completely

10
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,600
until I found out
you were leaving the country.

11
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,350
(I couldn't resist my selfishness)

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,520
(and called you)

13
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,520
And that was why you died at the scene.

14
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,710
(We still haven't found
the murderer to this day.)

15
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:46,350
(It was my fault.)

16
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:13,590
(The hospital?)

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,590
Yuan Xia.

18
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:17,840
Yuan Xia.

19
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:18,840
Yuan Xia!

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,350
Mr. Wei, be mentally prepared.

21
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:47,640
Your wife

22
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,510
may not wake forever.

23
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,000
Yuan Xia.

24
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,800
The outcome has changed.

25
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,710
At least,

26
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,030
you're still alive this time.

27
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:40,540
=Present, is Present=

28
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,870
=Episode 9=
(You're My Ray of Light.)

29
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:44,750
Hello, Ni Ning.

30
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,150
I want to take Pei Shen
to the branch office's

31
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,280
press conference.

32
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,590
You're kidding, right?

33
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,590
Are you going to play the role
of the Little Mermaid

34
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,680
who sacrifices for love?

35
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,000
He openly tries to steal her from you.

36
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,430
Instead of getting rid of him,

37
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,030
you even keep him close and nurture him.

38
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,870
Don't say I never warn you.

39
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,150
He's your love rival.

40
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,590
Don't let things get out of hand.

41
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,520
Or he'll gain an advantage
over you in the end.

42
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,800
It is the reason he's my rival

43
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,710
that I have to keep him close
just to be safe.

44
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,800
Or else I wouldn't know
what he does behind my back.

45
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,190
Oh, one more thing.

46
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,240
Keep a close eye on Zhou Wei.

47
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,510
We absolutely must not
let him harm Yuan Xia.

48
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:21,800
Mr. Wei, hello.

49
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,480
Hi.

50
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,070
Mr. Wei, you'll have
to drive yourself this time.

51
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,480
It's a long journey ahead.

52
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:39,790
So I've packed some snacks for you.

53
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,170
So you can pick whatever you like.

54
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,160
Thank you.

55
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,310
You prepared just for Yuan Xia,

56
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,800
but not for your direct supervisor?

57
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,480
You need to learn more
about social skills.

58
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:47,750
When we get to the branch office,

59
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,750
I'll have a word with your former boss
about this.

60
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,190
Ms. Ni, please spare me.

61
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,850
Of course,
I prepared some snacks for you.

62
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,750
(Could she still be upset
about what happened with Xi Lin?)

63
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,920
(She seemed better
at the night market yesterday.)

64
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,750
(Why didn't she take a ride
with me today?)

65
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,070
(I even prepared so many snacks.)

66
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Wei asked how you're feeling.

67
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,070
Did you have a fight?

68
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,720
No.

69
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,240
Let's take a good rest

70
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,950
after today's press conference.

71
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:46,560
Okay.

72
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,000
Where have you been these few days?

73
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,020
It's irresponsible
to run off after flirting.

74
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,220
I want to talk to you.

75
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,480
(How do you want me
to take responsibility?)

76
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,390
I want to have...

77
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,830
a serious relationship with you

78
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,360
that isn't just about fooling around.

79
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,600
What's so funny?

80
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,040
I'm just curious

81
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,580
how an experienced person like you

82
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,830
managed to push
the usually honest Dr. Xing

83
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,070
to this point.

84
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,040
Why are we stopping?

85
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,270
I think the road is blocked.

86
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:44,360
I'll go and take a look.

87
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,800
Come on. Let's go and take a look.

88
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,430
Mister,

89
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,270
when will they clear the road?

90
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,740
It's hard to say.
They're controlling the traffic ahead.

91
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,070
It might take half an hour

92
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,560
or several hours.

93
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,720
I see.

94
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,310
They can't clear the road for now.

95
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:00,800
We'll take another route.

96
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,370
There are only two hours left
until the press conference.

97
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,420
If we take a detour,
we still won't make it in time.

98
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,070
Why didn't you plan
the route in advance?

99
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,720
Now we're facing this unexpected
situation with no backup plan.

100
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,560
It seems you're quite negligent
as the PR director.

101
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,630
This is the only road to the conference.

102
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,070
No one expected it to be blocked.

103
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,830
As for the conference time,

104
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,270
it was set by your father and me.

105
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,920
Where is he?

106
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,000
My dad

107
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,360
suddenly felt unwell
just before leaving.

108
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,480
So he sent me in his place.

109
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,920
Wait. Is it unreasonable
for your partner's daughter

110
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,630
to complain a little?

111
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,950
I apologize.

112
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,000
It was my negligence.

113
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,310
I'll contact our colleagues
at the venue right now.

114
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,270
Yuan Xia,

115
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:51,310
tell them that the press conference
is canceled.

116
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,950
The related processes
will be done together

117
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,480
with tomorrow morning's
opening ceremony.

118
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,870
Please make sure to take good care

119
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,070
of people from the media there.

120
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,370
Also, invite them

121
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,070
to attend tomorrow morning's
opening ceremony,

122
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:02,480
as well as the onsite interview event
for the new factory.

123
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,070
The rain doesn't look like
it'll stop any minute.

124
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,450
Let's find a place to take shelter
from the rain.

125
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,160
Okay.

126
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:10,870
Let's go.

127
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,910
(What should I do to calm her anger?)

128
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,340
(Still pretending, huh?)

129
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,680
(Let's see how long
you can keep this up.)

130
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,720
This homestay is quite nice.

131
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,750
We'll spend the night here then.

132
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:17,170
There happens to be rooms available.
So there are enough for our stay.

133
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,360
Ms. Yuan.

134
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,440
Ms. Ni.

135
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:23,870
Mr. Wei.

136
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,200
Drink something warm
or you'll catch a cold.

137
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,120
Thank you, but I'm not thirsty.

138
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,990
That's right.
One must drink water less at night.

139
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,320
Or you might catch a cold easily

140
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,270
and look puffy.

141
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,630
As the PR Director,

142
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,000
you'll be on camera tomorrow.

143
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,770
So pay attention
to maintaining your image.

144
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,360
He's right.

145
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:44,630
You should offer this water
to Mr. Wei instead.

146
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,320
After all, he's born charming.

147
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,790
Plus, he's used to partying
and drinking until late at night.

148
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,120
He never has to worry about swelling

149
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,870
affecting his appearance
on camera tomorrow.

150
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,120
Let's go back to our room.

151
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,720
Mr. Wei, have some water.

152
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,720
You seemed to be well-packed.

153
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,630
Those who don't know

154
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,590
would think you're out surviving
in the wilderness.

155
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,200
I...

156
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,030
I don't mind other men
pursuing Yuan Xia.

157
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,270
That's her privilege.

158
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,790
I'm open to fair competition.

159
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,910
But on the condition

160
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,630
that you're sincere

161
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,870
and not have ulterior motives.

162
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,870
Mr. Wei, you've misunderstood.

163
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,030
I know you and Yuan Xia are dating.

164
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,910
I only see her as a younger sister.

165
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,150
I know very well
if it's a misunderstanding.

166
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,080
You better behave yourself.

167
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,080
Ziqi, what kind of place is this?

168
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,000
To be honest, with this awful weather
and this godforsaken place,

169
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,870
I wouldn't want to stay a second longer.

170
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,750
But because you're here,

171
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,440
I feel like this situation

172
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,960
isn't so bad after all.

173
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,150
If it weren't

174
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,870
for today's unexpected situation,

175
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,080
we probably wouldn't have had the chance

176
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,910
to talk in person like this.

177
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:20,870
After all,

178
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:23,000
we grew up together since childhood.

179
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:25,160
What's with your attitude?

180
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,440
My dad

181
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,790
has been against me pursuing you

182
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,650
ever since he found out
you have a girlfriend.

183
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,170
He knows you're not interested in me.

184
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,240
So he's even more unwilling

185
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,510
to let me get involved
in your relationship with Yuan Xia.

186
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:40,720
Today,

187
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,510
the reason he agreed to let me come here

188
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:46,000
is because he has planned
to send me abroad again.

189
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,270
At least until you get married,

190
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,790
I won't come back.

191
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,600
So this is my last chance.

192
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,870
I want to end my feelings
for you amicably.

193
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:25,550
Yuan Xia.

194
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,870
Are you okay?

195
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,870
I'm fine.

196
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,150
Aren't you jealous?

197
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,630
I don't need to.

198
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,480
You're pretty confident.

199
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,850
That's Xi Lin we're talking about.

200
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,120
But it's Wei Ziqi who she's meeting.

201
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,390
That's the sense of security
Wei Ziqi brings me.

202
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,120
He makes me believe

203
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,080
that no matter when or who I meet,

204
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,400
I will always have the confidence
of being favored.

205
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:55,960
That's great.

206
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,200
What about you?

207
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,320
You mentioned

208
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,400
that there's a girl you've liked
for many years.

209
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,120
Is that true?

210
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,440
Yes, it is.

211
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,620
You said you were planning
to confess to her.

212
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,080
How did it go?

213
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,080
I lost the chance to confess my feelings

214
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,870
because she already likes another guy.

215
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,600
The only thing I can do

216
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,080
is silently protect her.

217
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,080
(Do you eat here often?)

218
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,510
The wonton here is different
from elsewhere.

219
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,750
It has red broth

220
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,870
with a bit of spiciness to it.

221
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,270
Not that often.

222
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,790
I did come here a long time ago.

223
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,850
After that, I went to the branch office.

224
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,720
I've been craving this taste ever since.

225
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,200
I'm raising a parrot too.

226
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,390
Yuan. Yuan.

227
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,600
Did you teach it to call me that?

228
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,720
I did lecture it a bit earlier.

229
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,970
Maybe it learned to mimic me.

230
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,200
Pei Shen, are you...

231
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,240
What?

232
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:03,870
Nothing.

233
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,440
(Why did Pei Shen pretend
to be Brother?)

234
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,480
Okay, you can tell me now.

235
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,390
Do you hate me that much?

236
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,080
To others,

237
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,910
I'm pretty, talented,
and come from a good family.

238
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,440
Almost everyone likes me.

239
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,630
Why is it that only you don't like me?

240
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,790
Xi Lin,

241
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,630
I don't hate you.

242
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,790
But I'm not attracted to you either.

243
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,480
To me,

244
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,310
you're just the daughter
of my dad's friend.

245
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,270
Do you understand?

246
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,080
Do you know

247
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,200
that the more you act like this,
the more I like you?

248
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,550
From the first time I saw you,

249
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,670
I knew

250
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,510
I couldn't do without you.

251
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,870
Xi Lin,

252
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,150
you don't like me at all.

253
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,870
You're just being possessive.

254
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,440
Like you said,

255
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:08,960
you have everything.

256
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,240
Everyone revolves around you,

257
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,360
except me.

258
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,720
That's why you're so eager
to conquer me.

259
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:17,270
To you, I'm just a piece of clothing

260
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,000
that someone else has paid for and worn

261
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,790
before you've even looked
at it properly.

262
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,750
You're not content with that.

263
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,720
Nonsense.

264
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:27,000
You're not me. Who are you to judge me?

265
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,360
Whether I like you or not,
don't I know that myself?

266
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,000
Let's talk
about your birthday every year.

267
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,960
I always carefully pick out gifts

268
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,870
for you in advance.

269
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,670
Have you ever bothered
to open and look at them?

270
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,200
I'm sorry.

271
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,000
There are more important things
in my life.

272
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,630
I like Yuan Xia.

273
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,320
She's the only one

274
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,270
who makes me want
to climb out of the abyss

275
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,360
and return to the warmth of the sun.

276
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,870
So, are you two really together now?

277
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,870
Not yet.

278
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,320
We're not officially
in a relationship yet.

279
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,150
But my love for Yuan Xia
has always been genuine.

280
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,150
Xi Lin,

281
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,630
thank you for liking me all these years.

282
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,910
But let's stop here.

283
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,720
It's getting late. Let's go back first.

284
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,270
Wei Ziqi.

285
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:52,200
From this moment on,

286
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,360
I won't be chasing after you anymore.

287
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:57,630
Even though the number
of my pursuers isn't huge,

288
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,850
there are enough of them
to fill the Wiener Musikverein.

289
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,080
Go back and rest early.

290
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,540
We have the opening ceremony
to attend tomorrow.

291
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,070
(Room 301.)

292
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,750
(You must win Yuan Xia's trust
as soon as possible.)

293
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,310
Yuan Xia, watch out!

294
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,160
Ms. Ni?

295
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,680
Zhou Wei,

296
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,350
I've been waiting for you.

297
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:37,160
(Since the one upstairs
is the killer Zhou Wei sent,)

298
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,720
(then he must be close by.)

299
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,680
(As long as he sees me alone,)

300
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,590
(only then we have the chance
to lure him out.)

301
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,850
(Yuan Xia, you must be careful.)

302
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,480
(I'll be right behind you.)

303
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,000
Yuan Xia!

304
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:18,880
Wei.

305
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,720
Are you guys all right?

306
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,880
Wei Ziqi!

307
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:25,960
Mr. Zhou,

308
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,400
you've gotten clever.

309
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,070
You're even using diversions now.

310
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,750
You tricked me.

311
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,720
Did you lead me here on purpose

312
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,550
and cancel the press conference

313
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,310
just to lure me in?

314
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,590
What were you thinking?

315
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,880
From the moment we announced
the press conference,

316
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:44,400
we were already setting up
the trap for you.

317
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,270
(I planned to hold it)

318
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,160
at the branch
where my dad did his research.

319
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,350
That place is remote.

320
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,270
I don't believe

321
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:54,350
Zhou Wei would pass up
such a good opportunity.

322
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,550
We need to heavily promote

323
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,200
this press conference.

324
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,640
I want you to reach out
to more media platforms for coverage.

325
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,510
We need to publicize it
as much as possible.

326
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,480
(Construction Ahead. Take a Detour.)
Considering Ms. Yuan's thoroughness,

327
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,480
how could we

328
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,400
overlook issues
like weather and road conditions?

329
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,160
You've tried to kill me multiple times.

330
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,030
I surely can't just sit and wait.

331
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,270
So I could only plan and retaliate.

332
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:23,960
Wei Ziqi,

333
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,880
it's too early to celebrate.

334
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,590
The real show is just beginning.

335
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,200
How are you? Did you get hurt earlier?

336
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,510
I'm fine. How about you?

337
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,070
Get some rest.

338
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,200
Do you know

339
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,350
there's a Perseid meteor shower tonight?

340
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,440
I missed the big one last time.

341
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,590
I don't want to miss it again.

342
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,750
I was going to wait

343
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,880
at least until
after the press conference.

344
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,160
What?

345
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,680
I want to take you somewhere.

346
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,200
Is this the place you mentioned?

347
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:46,880
Fireflies.

348
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,200
Don't you have anything to say to me?

349
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,070
I'm sorry.

350
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,050
This is the only kind of meteor shower
I could make it up to you.

351
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,640
Yuan Xia,

352
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,830
I've always wanted to tell you

353
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,640
that I've been able

354
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:18,200
to have a different life because of you.

355
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,590
(When I was eighteen,)

356
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,480
(I lost all my family.)

357
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,830
(It was the darkest time in my life.)

358
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:35,110
(The loneliness and helplessness)

359
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,830
(made me lose all hope.)

360
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,720
(It felt like the whole world)

361
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,070
(was leaving me.)

362
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:46,750
(I locked myself)

363
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,400
(in that dark house,)

364
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,440
(letting myself drown in darkness
and losing control.)

365
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,070
Brother! It's me, Yuan.

366
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,830
(When I was repeatedly
on the brink of suicide,)

367
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,000
(she would knock on the door
with the sunlight behind it.)

368
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,000
Brother! Brother!

369
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,160
(She would accompany me in her own way.)

370
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,880
Brother, are you asleep?

371
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,880
Get some sleep.

372
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,070
You have school tomorrow.

373
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,430
(She wouldn't feel at ease
until she heard my response.)

374
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,880
If you need anything, call me.

375
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,440
(She would prepare
hot wonton noodles for me.)

376
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,880
(She even folded encouraging words)

377
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,680
(into paper stars and
filled the medicine bottles with them.)

378
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,350
(Brother, don't give up
on yourself easily.)

379
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,510
(You have to hold on for a better you.)

380
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,270
(Believe that time
will bring you new beginnings.)

381
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,680
(Even when you're
at your lowest point in life,)

382
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,000
(you should still look up at the stars.)

383
00:23:57,550 --> 00:24:00,590
(To be honest,
you're not as weak as you think.)

384
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,830
(So don't hide alone in the shadows.)

385
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,000
(Try and step out)

386
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,750
(toward the light and grow.)

387
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,880
(She was like a ray of light
in the darkness)

388
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,590
(who guided me to regain hope for life.)

389
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:24,080
(One time, we made a promise
to watch the meteor shower together.)

390
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,200
(But no matter what excuses I had,)

391
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:31,830
(I still didn't keep my promise
in the end.)

392
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:39,140
(Lancheng No.1 High School.
Name: Yuan Xia)

393
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:41,440
Yuan Xia,

394
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,270
you've always been in my life.

395
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,920
You never left.

396
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,790
In the past years,
I was consumed by revenge.

397
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,800
I put up an act with Zhou Wei
every single day.

398
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,720
I almost lost myself.

399
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,000
When I couldn't hold on anymore,

400
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,030
I would pick up your school badge
and remind myself

401
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,920
that I must not allow
the darkness of revenge

402
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,000
to overshadow that ray of light.

403
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,030
Later on,

404
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,480
I used various excuses,

405
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,350
like protecting you

406
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,550
to avoid acknowledging you.

407
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,160
I'm sorry.

408
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,960
Can you still accept
this version of Wei Ziqi?

409
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,550
Don't you like it?

410
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,720
I do.

411
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,400
I like you a lot.

412
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:56,110
I really, really like you.

413
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,310
Can you remember that?

414
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,310
Wei Ziqi,

415
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,160
do you know

416
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,400
that the quiet boy

417
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,160
was also my ray of light?

418
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,200
(That dark house)

419
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:14,030
(provided me with warmth.)

420
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,440
(That silent boy of that house)

421
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,510

Mr. Wei, hello.

431
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,880
I'm your new assistant.

432
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,880
My name is Yuan Xia.

433
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,480
(Later, I met someone.)

434
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:54,880
I know.

435
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,440
Yuan Xia.

436
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,420
I've been waiting for you
for a long time.

437
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,400
(He was born with a silver spoon.)

438
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,270
(Someone who is a world apart from me.)

439
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,750
Have any of you
earned a single cent yourself?

440
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:15,270
Who has rushed to grab
the eight o'clock bus?

441
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,070
Has anyone ever stayed up late
working overtime to survive?

442
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,680
Only Yuan Xia does that.

443
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,110
She made every cent

444
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,550
through her own hard work.

445
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:27,310
So who are we to judge her?

446
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:31,270
(I never expected him)

447
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,790
(to speak up for me,)

448
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,920
(to get me out of trouble.)

449
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,680
(When I was in danger,)

450
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,480
(he even risked his life
and jumped into the water.)

451
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,440
(Shielding me from danger,)

452
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,160
Watch out!

453
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,270
(protecting me.)

454
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,750
Stay here.

455
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:53,880
Wei Ziqi!

456
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,400
What are you doing here?

457
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,270
(He would hold my hand tightly.)

458
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,030
(The driver's instinct)

459
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,030
(should have been)

460
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,550
(to steer away from danger.)

461
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:11,270
(But you,)

462
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,430
(you took the risk and crashed
into the barriers directly.)

463
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,790
(That doesn't make sense.)

464
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,350
(Everything he did)

465
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,880
(was just like Brother.)

466
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,790
(He provided a safe haven for me.)

467
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,790
(I never realized
he was always by my side.)

468
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,960
(In that house,)

469
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,480
(fate had already)

470
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,070
(bound us tightly together.)

471
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,000
(That quiet boy is you.)

472
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,640
His name is Wei Ziqi.

473
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,310
Wei Ziqi,

474
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,480
