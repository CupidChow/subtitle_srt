(Tomb of Yuan Xia)

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,719
Yuan Xia.

5
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:53,280
I will surely change your fate.

00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:50,500
=Present, is Present=

00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,300
(MU President, Wei Ziqi)

00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:40,260
(Phone call from Mr. Wei)

9
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:44,759
Hello?

10
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:45,879
Yuan Xia.

11
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,639
Come to Clinic Bar immediately.

12
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,680
Okay.

13
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,280
I'll come now.

14
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:53,319
Hurry up.

15
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:58,260
(MU President's Assistant, Yuan Xia)

16
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,380
(It's late at night.) (Partly cloudy)

17
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,080
(I'm so fed up with this job.
I just work for the sake of working.)

18
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,400
(It's seven by
twenty-four hours of hard work.)

19
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,080
Last time I lost.

20
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,960
This time I'm going to up the stakes.

21
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,900
=Episode 1=
(Crisis)

22
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,080
Then I'll raise the stakes too.

23
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,719
I heard you have a personal assistant

24
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:33,159
who is available 24/7,

25
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,000
just like the ancient maids.

26
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,080
If I win,

27
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,719
you have to give her to me

28
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:39,599
so I can have a taste as well.

29
00:03:41,657 --> 00:03:42,310
What's wrong?

30
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,000
Play or not?
Stop talking nonsense!

31
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,840
All right!

32
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,280
I've never lost

33
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,719
at beer pong.

34
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,599
Today, I'm going to make you crawl out

35
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,479
from under my crotch after losing.

36
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,240
What a bad luck.

37
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,279
If there's an alternative to prison,

38
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,519
it's definitely
being Wei Ziqi's assistant.

39
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:24,600
Watch this!

40
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,560
Nice!

41
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,319
All the best, Mr. Wei!

42
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:38,800
Petty tricks.

43
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:42,519
Miss Yuan,

44
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:43,079
you're here.

45
00:04:44,314 --> 00:04:46,240
Here's the bill
for Mr. Wei's drinks tonight.

46
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,079
Please take a look.

47
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,439
You told me last time
that the red wine was expensive

48
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,680
because it was
the last limited edition bottle

49
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,828
from Chateau Cheval Blanc.

50
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:57,920
Yes.

51
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,319
So, are you lying to me now,

52
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:01,279
or is there a problem
with your store's computer?

53
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,079
This...

54
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,279
There must be a problem
with our store's computer.

55
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:06,600
I'm very sorry, Miss Yuan.

56
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,199
I'll have someone check it right away.

57
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,040
Sorry.

58
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,720
Hurry up!

59
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:38,560
Mr. Wei.

60
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,199
I've settled the bill you asked me to.

61
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:45,399
Is there anything else?

62
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,428
If there's none,
we shall go back and rest early.

63
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,319
Of course, there's something.

64
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,519
I wanted you to be my mascot.

65
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,079
As soon as you came, I lost the game.

66
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:55,360
What happens if you lose?

67
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:59,959
If I lose, I have to drink all these.

68
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,240
Mr. Li,

69
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,720
I'll drink for Mr. Wei.

70
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:10,560
Stop!

71
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,079
She's such a beautiful assistant,

72
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:17,600
and you ask her to drink for you?

73
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,079
Do you have any conscience?

74
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:21,279
Do you have any manliness?

75
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,319
I'll drink for you.

76
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,439
Good one, Mr. Li!

77
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:36,380
As for the rest,

78
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:37,600
either you drink them yourself

79
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:42,000
or feed them to me sip by sip.

80
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,920
You like being fed, don't you?

81
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:49,720
Of course.

82
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,920
Well, you lost the game, didn't you?

83
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:57,759
You must drink!

84
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:59,360
Like to drink, huh?

85
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:00,519
It's painful!

86
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:01,120
Let go! Let go!

87
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,600
I'll make you drink enough today.

88
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,079
Let go of me!

89
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,319
Let go!

90
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:07,920
Excuse me.

91
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:09,920
Mr. Wei.

92
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,199
You must drink it all today.

93
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,319
Mr. Wei.

94
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,000
You seem to be
hyped up with alcohol today.

95
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,399
You should talk it out, Mr. Wei.

96
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,319
Mr. Wei!

97
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:24,959
Mr. Wei, please open the door.

98
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,480
You like drinking, right?

99
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,160
Mr. Wei!

100
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,720
I'll let you drink enough today!

101
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:31,240
Mr. Wei!

102
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,360
Drink it!

103
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:37,879
That's enough for today.

104
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,959
You may leave now, thank you.

105
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:54,079
Lin Yu, get the keys from the manager.

106
00:07:57,028 --> 00:07:58,342
(Check the surveillance.)

107
00:07:59,685 --> 00:08:01,150
Something's wrong in the private room.

108
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,199
Why did everyone leave?

109
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:02,759
Let's check.

110
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:03,399
Let's go.

111
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,040
Mr. Wei, don't act impulsively.

112
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:24,839
The board meeting is next Tuesday.

113
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:26,360
You must not cause trouble,

114
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:28,199
or you won't be able
to attend the meeting.

115
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,480
Please open the door!

116
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,360
Mr. Wei!

117
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,080
Do you think you're somebody

118
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,039
just because they call you Mr. Li?

119
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,279
Do you submit to me?

120
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,000
Keep drinking if you don't!

121
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:06,000
Why did you come to the men's washroom?

122
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,440
Is Mr. Li okay?

123
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,879
Did you really…

124
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:17,720
Why are your thoughts so violent?

125
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,639
Don't worry,

126
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,799
he'll be fine soon.

127
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:23,679
Good to hear.

128
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,639
Hey! What are you doing?

129
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,519
My clothes are expensive!

130
00:09:37,914 --> 00:09:38,750
Pretend to be drunk.

131
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:39,960
What?

132
00:09:42,057 --> 00:09:43,028
Pretend to be drunk.

133
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:50,720
Mr. Li is drunk in the washroom.

134
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,639
Okay.

135
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,320
Mr. Wei.

136
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,559
Slow down.

137
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:26,600
Mr. Wei.

138
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,240
Come to the office
at 10:30 AM tomorrow.

139
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,879
There are some documents
to sign,

140
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,840
and the finance department needs

141
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,542
a video meeting about two huge expenses.

142
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,559
I'll be going now.

143
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,399
I'll see you out.

144
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,360
Make sure

145
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,799
Mr. Wei wakes up tomorrow morning.

146
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:44,440
Okay.

147
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,759
No.

148
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,840
You can't handle him.

149
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:49,360
I'll wake him up.

150
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,440
You go rest.

151
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,519
Thank you, Miss Yuan.

152
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,639
Mr. Zhou,

153
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
the plan failed.

154
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,657
You couldn't even handle
this simple task.

155
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:24,559
Didn't I tell you?

156
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,669
Find a way to get Wei Ziqi into trouble

157
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:29,228
and make him stay at the police station
before the board meeting.

158
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,679
Everything was going smoothly.

159
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:32,039
I even had the drugs ready.

160
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:35,559
Mr. Wei.

161
00:11:36,285 --> 00:11:38,630
However, Yuan Xia showed up suddenly
and messed up my plan.

162
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,720
Yuan Xia?

163
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,639
She is good at her job,

164
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:45,149
but she'll affect our plans.

165
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:45,942
One more thing.

166
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,320
She seemed to notice something wrong

167
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,840
with the bar's accounts while paying.

168
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,080
Should I

169
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,840
handle this problem immediately?

170
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,919
As for Wei Ziqi, keep an eye on him.

171
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:55,720
If anything happens, act immediately.

172
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,120
Just keep him alive

173
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,159
until the board meeting.

174
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,120
Understood.

175
00:12:46,771 --> 00:12:48,790
I've sent you
the surveillance video from the bar.

176
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:50,120
Please check it.

177
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:10,840
There's a bonus video too.

178
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,919
You're welcome.

179
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,799
Why did you come to the men's washroom?

180
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:30,759

(just wake the boss up.)

207
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:10,790
Continue to keep an eye on Zhou Wei.

208
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,759
Mr. Wei, it's time to get up
and go to the office.

209
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,799
Shut up. Let me sleep a bit more.

210
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:18,720
You go by yourself.

211
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,759
You have to get up and go to the office.

212
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,000
If you don't open the door,

213
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,759
I'll keep knocking.

214
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,120
(Why is it so quiet now?)

215
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:01,360
Since you're awake,

216
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:02,799
we shall go to the office now.

217
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:15,759
Mr. Wei, we need to hurry.

218
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,320
You drive.

219
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,840
I dare not drive your car.

220
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,879
If I damage it,

221
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,159
I can't afford to pay for it.

222
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,240
Fine, I'm not going today.

223
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,559
I'll go back to sleep.

224
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:26,240
Wait.

225
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,279
If you don't mind,

226
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:29,360
let's go by my car.

227
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,360
Can we fit in this small car?

228
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,879
Yes, we can.

229
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:55,039
Mr. Wei, please wear your seatbelt.

230
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,119
Mr. Wei.

231
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:20,240
Mr. Wei.

232
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,920
We're at the office.

233
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:26,799
Are we?

234
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:36,559
Mr. Wei.

235
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:37,640
Mr. Wei.

236
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,799
The door is here.

237
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:44,279
Hello, please park the car.

238
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:44,960
Okay.

239
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:53,960
Good morning, Mr. Wei.

240
00:17:58,759 --> 00:17:59,799
When did you join?

241
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,960
Yesterday.

242
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:02,240
Yesterday?

243
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,680
Are you free tonight?

244
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,039
Shall we go for dinner together?

245
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,119
I would like to hear your views

246
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:08,440
on the company.

247
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:08,960
Okay.

248
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,680
Mr. Wei.

249
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,599
Mr. Zhou's car is already at the door.

250
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,559
Since I joined two years ago,

251
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,359
he's used the same opening line

252
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:22,759
on every new young female employee,
word for word.

253
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:38,359
Mr. Wei.

254
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,960
You urged me
to come to the office early.

255
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:44,960
Is the company going bankrupt?

256
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,057
Can't we even afford
to turn on the air conditioner?

257
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:55,880
Mr. Wei,

258
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,400
the air conditioner in your office
has already been turned on.

259
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,799
You can start working.

260
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,599
I'll bring the documents in later.

261
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,680
Miss Yuan.

262
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,440
Why not call for repairs
if it is broken?

263
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,720
I did it this morning, but
maintenance is dragging their feet.

264
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,160
They said they'd come in the afternoon.

265
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,069
Clearly,

266
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,371
they don't respect Mr. Wei.

267
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,310
If it were Zhou Wei...

268
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,314
Your lipstick is smudged.

269
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,119
By the way, remind
the finance department to send over

270
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:34,519
the documents that need signing.

271
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:35,240
Okay.

272
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,759
Hello, MU President's Office.

273
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,920
As usual,

274
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,799
please send
a bouquet of roses to Miss Chen,

275
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:49,400
signed, "That's a Wrap!"

276
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,400
Hello.

277
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,519
I'd like to book
a table or two at 7:30 PM.

278
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,359
Hello, is this the yacht club?

279
00:19:54,428 --> 00:19:55,590
MU President's Office.

280
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:57,359
Follow the usual arrangements.

281
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,680
Xia.

282
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:05,640
Xia.

283
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,799
You're wearing
the same clothes as yesterday,

284
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:08,960
and your makeup is smudged.

285
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,519
Did Mr. Wei
have you stay up signing bills

286
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:11,799
in the middle of the night?

287
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:12,599
It was dawn.

288
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:13,359
By the way,

289
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:16,359
the details of Mr. Wei's previous bills,
have you submitted them

290
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:17,359
to the finance department?

291
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:19,559
Not yet, wasn't it agreed to settle
at the end of the month?

292
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:20,960
Bring them to me.

293
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,640
Okay.

294
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,480
Here.

295
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,500
(Expenses)

296
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:00,160
Mr. Wei.

297
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,119
Here's the project proposal for next

298
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:03,480
Monday's company anniversary event.

299
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,000
Please review and sign it.

300
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:06,279
Also,

301
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:07,559
please take a look

302
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:08,720
at these two documents.

303
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,160
Hold on.

304
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,039
Who let you leave?

305
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,599
Do you have any other orders?

306
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,559
Can't you see I'm busy?

307
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,039
Read it to me.

308
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:25,160
Okay.

309
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:32,960
By the way, Mr. Wei,

310
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,480
who recommended you

311
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,519
that bar last night?

312
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,680
It's Mr. Li's family's bar.

313
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,440
I found their drinks

314
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:45,839
quite expensive,

315
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:47,920
and the prices at the restaurants

316
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,160
and yacht clubs you frequent

317
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:51,160
are several times higher than outside.

318
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,920
Although it's on the company's tab,

319
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,319
you should still know about it.

320
00:21:57,599 --> 00:21:59,000
Just read your document.

321
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,759
Once you finish, I can go back to sleep.

322
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,371
(President's Office)
Mr. Wei, your coffee.

323
00:22:04,685 --> 00:22:07,270
Quantum communication's advantage
over traditional communication

324
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:08,599
is its absolute security

325
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,160
and strong anti-interference capability.

326
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:13,540
The security coefficient of quantum
cryptography is high.

327
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:15,839
Therefore, quantum communication
is mainly used for

328
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:17,920
military, aviation,
and deep-sea communication.

329
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,680
Sit down and read.

330
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:20,790
You're blocking the light.

331
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:22,960
Okay.

332
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,039
In terms of
the most effective way to achieve

333
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:31,559
long-distance quantum communication,

334
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:33,039
since the loss of photons

335
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,200
in optical fiber is fixed,

336
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,559
(President's Office)
it can be done

337
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:37,799
through quantum repeaters

338
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,920
or free-space quantum communication.

339
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,240
There is

340
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,440
almost no photon loss
outside the atmosphere.

341
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:55,680
Enough.

342
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,920
Stop. I don't understand it.

343
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,839
Just let me sign.

344
00:22:58,079 --> 00:22:58,880
Okay.

345
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,720
Mr. Wei.

346
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,839
If there's nothing else,

347
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:06,240
I'd like to apply for early leave,
two hours earlier.

348
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,359
Sure.

349
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:08,960
Once you're gone,

350
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,200
I can sleep soundly.

351
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:13,110
Thank you
for the air conditioner, Mr. Wei.

352
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:14,200
By the way,

353
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,240
setting a low temperature
might cause a cold.

354
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:29,359
Xia,

355
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,839
did Mr. Wei give you a hard time?

356
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,559
He wanted me to stay
and enjoy the cool air.

357
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:36,200
Actually, he's quite nice sometimes.

358
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,519
He's also generous.

359
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,680
Except for private life,

360
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,160
not being diligent at work,

361
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,720
and having a bad temper occasionally,

362
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,000
he has no flaws.

363
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:48,440
He has signed all these documents.

364
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,759
Inform them to collect them.

365
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:51,839
I'm taking early leave today.
I'll leave in a while.

366
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:53,519
You should rest early.

367
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:55,920
You do look a bit tired.

368
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,319
Is it so obvious?

369
00:23:58,079 --> 00:23:59,519
Am I rude if I go on a blind date

370
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:01,039
when I'm like this?

371
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:02,119
Blind date?

372
00:24:04,371 --> 00:24:05,720
It was introduced by a neighbor.

373
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,880
I need to go.

374
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,342
I need to touch up my makeup.

375
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:17,359
Yuan Xia!

376
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:21,759
Yuan Xia!

377
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:24,880
Yuan...

378
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,960
Mr. Wei, she said
she's taking early leave today

379
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,920
to go on a blind date.

380
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,039
Blind date?

381
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:49,920
Mr. Wei, what are you doing?

382
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,759
Nothing.

383
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,519
You sent me to the office this morning.

384
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:54,039
I should send you home at night.

385
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,119
I've applied for an early leave.

386
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,230
I have something to do later.

387
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,519
We're not going the same way.

388
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,000
It's okay,

389
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:03,640
even if we're not, I can go your way.

390
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,371
I'll wait until you're done
and then you can send me back.

391
00:25:08,628 --> 00:25:10,640
What are you waiting for?
Don't you have things to do?

392
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,440
Get in the car.

393
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,960
Mr. Wei.

394
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,319
You took the wrong turn again.

395
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:46,920
You should turn right
at the last crossing, not go straight.

396
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:48,319
No, I didn't.

397
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,519
Let me tell you,

398
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:53,960
if the guy on your blind date

399
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:56,039
can't wait for you for a bit,

400
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:57,359
it means he's not sincere.

401
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,039
How do you know I have a blind date?

402
00:25:59,657 --> 00:26:02,030
Mr. Wei, were you eavesdropping
on my conversation with Chen?

403
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:02,759
No.

404
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:06,079
You two were practically
broadcasting it in the office.

405
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:08,160
I didn't eavesdrop, I swear.

406
00:26:09,771 --> 00:26:12,110
Turn right at the next crossing,
not go straight.

407
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:13,920
Don't get it wrong this time.

408
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,300
(Brake failure)

409
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:34,160
What's wrong?

410
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:36,440
The brakes failed.

411
00:26:37,314 --> 00:26:38,830
I just had them serviced last month.

412
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:40,240
How could they fail now?

413
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:43,200
What do we do?

414
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,599
Yuan Xia, we'll be fine.

415
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,820
Have you ever watched a rally race?

416
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:52,485
Yes, on TV.

417
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:53,650
Before reaching the finish line,

418
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,330
the most important thing
is not the driver

419
00:26:55,342 --> 00:26:56,790
but the navigator who acts as his eyes.

420
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,559
You be my eyes and find

421
00:26:58,559 --> 00:26:59,720
a route with less traffic

422
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,759
and fewer red lights.

423
00:27:01,914 --> 00:27:02,920
Once we coast to a stop,

424
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,920
we'll be fine.

425
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,500
(Brake failure)

426
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,400
Yuan Xia.

427
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:10,960
Start now.

428
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:13,240
Okay.

429
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,540
(Turn right at the traffic light)
Turn right at the next intersection.

430
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,440
Keep going straight.

431
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:33,828
There's a red light.

432
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,279
All lanes are blocked.

433
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,057
(Go straight
at the traffic light in 100 meters)

434
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:51,039
I've always been lucky.

435
00:27:53,028 --> 00:27:54,714
There's a car on the left, be careful!

436
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,880
Keep going straight.

437
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,079
Turn left after 800 meters.

438
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:06,720
Okay.

439
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,971
The road on the left is blocked,
what should we do?

440
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,340
(Parking lot 200 meters)

441
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,420
