1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,840
You're finally cleared of suspicion.

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,040
Better get rid of the bad luck.

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:05,960
Now, listen.

4
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,342
You should've told me you were out.

5
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:09,000
Why did you come here alone?

6
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:12,800
You made me worry for nothing.

7
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:14,960
I'm worried about Yuan Xia.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,920
From what we know,

9
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,719
if the time of death can remain
on December 31st,

10
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:21,920
that'd be the best outcome.

11
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:27,679
Someone's finally here.

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,000
No one is downstairs.

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,679
Could you help accept this?

14
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:38,880
Okay, thanks.

15
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,600
You're welcome.

16
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,719
A wedding photo?

17
00:00:53,371 --> 00:00:54,920
When did you guys take wedding photos?

18
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,679
(The Wei Ziqi and Yuan Xia
in 2024 took them.)

19
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:02,000
Year 2024?

20
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,359
I'm so jealous of them.

21
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:23,120
Xing Nan.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,519
Do you know why I keep wanting

23
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:26,719
to intervene with the past?

24
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,319
Because these are things
I missed out on.

25
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,920
I didn't experience them.

26
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:37,280
(Now, looking at how happy)

27
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,400
(Yuan Xia was with the past Wei Ziqi,)

28
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,879
(retracing my memory,)

29
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,200
do you know how envious I am?

30
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,719
(To find out the truth
of my dad's death,)

31
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,519
(I forcefully pushed her away.)

32
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:58,760
(Until...)

33
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,680
(the last time I saw her.)

34
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,479
(She was being carted out
from the morgue.)

35
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,680
(I couldn't figure it out.)

36
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:14,360
(Why did she turn up
at the engagement party?)

37
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,560
(Why did she die for no reason?)

38
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,680
It was my fault.

39
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,479
Wei.

40
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,719
Don't say that.

41
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:45,960
I won't let the past repeat itself.

42
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:40,420
=Present, Is Present=

43
00:03:50,514 --> 00:03:52,960
I selected several potential candidates
from the other branch.

44
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,000
Do you want to take a look?

45
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:58,560
Pei Shen?

46
00:03:58,742 --> 00:03:59,750
How come he's everywhere?

47
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:02,599
This Pei Shen

48
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:04,800
has been having more contact
with Yuan Xia lately.

49
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,800
I saw him eating wontons with Yuan Xia
the other day.

50
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,639
Never mind him.

51
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,360
Right now, Zhou Wei is the priority.

52
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,000
The contract with Hill Capital
is ready to go.

53
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,429
Next week, we'll be announcing

54
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,771
the official start of
the quantum communication experiment.

55
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,600
Should we use this chance

56
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,800
to lure Zhou Wei out?

57
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,240
What do you think?

58
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:34,879
Take a seat.

59
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,360
I plan

60
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,399
to carry it out at the branch
where my dad did the experiments.

61
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,560
The branch is in a remote location.

62
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,680
I'm pretty sure

63
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,800
Zhou Wei wouldn't want to waste
this good chance.

64
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,639
Who knows we might make a windfall,

65
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,160
like finding out who's behind him.

66
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,600
Regarding the plan to lure Zhou Wei out,

67
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,199
we're all pretty confident.

68
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,480
It's just that
I'm still a little concerned.

69
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,079
Concerned about?

70
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,079
I worry

71
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,839
about you doing something so big
under the purview of the PR Department.

72
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,920
If Yuan Xia finds out,

73
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,360
she'll likely bite your head off.

74
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,439
That's why

75
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,000
we'll let her know
and then announce it publicly

76
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,560
to lead Zhou Wei into the trap.

77
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,199
Anyway, it's time we told her

78
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,079
who I am.

79
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,100
=Episode 8=
(Who is the Real Brother?)

80
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,360
Who could Brother be?

81
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,079
In my time and space,

82
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,639
where are you?

83
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,600
Have you always been near me?

84
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,480
By my side?

85
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:40,079
No.

86
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,800
Wei Ziqi?

87
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:47,959
Definitely not him.

88
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,639
(Xing)
What about... Dr. Xing?

89
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,399
But he answered Brother's call.

90
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:01,399
It's probably not him either.

91
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,000
Someone new appeared around me.

92
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,399
Pei Shen?

93
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,800
Do you eat here often?

94
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,950
The wontons here are a little different
from the norm.

95
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,199
The soup is a red base.

96
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,800
And it contains bird's eye chilies.

97
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,639
Not that often.

98
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,360
I've eaten here in the past.

99
00:06:31,628 --> 00:06:33,428
After being assigned
to the branch office,

100
00:06:33,542 --> 00:06:35,250
I couldn't stop thinking
about this taste.

101
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,460
(Pei Shen)

102
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,759
What are you doing?

103
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,040
Secretly writing my name?

104
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:05,800
No need to be shy about that.

105
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,800
Don't worry.
I won't charge you any copyright fee.

106
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:09,600
Who wrote your name secretly?

107
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,759
I wrote...

108
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:15,199
not just your name.

109
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,560
Who else?

110
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,420
(Wei Ziqi)

111
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,879
Why is there a cross behind my name?

112
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,519
Am I that bad?

113
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,519
Can you not be so critical of me?

114
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:30,920
What did I not do well lately?

115
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,560
You can tell me. I will change.

116
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,240
You... You've been doing well.

117
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,560
I am not criticizing you.

118
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,800
Look, if we change the angle,

119
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:42,279
it's no longer a cross.

120
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,399
I see.

121
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,260
(Wei Ziqi X Yuan Xia)

122
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:13,000
I see.

123
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,600
I see.

124
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,879
Are you coming back for dinner?

125
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,360
Okay. Let's have a hotpot.

126
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,240
We can clear out the fridge.

127
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:57,679
Okay.

128
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,480
I'll be off, then.

129
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,540
(Madam Sun's Wonton, Meat Wontons,
Go to checkout)

130
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,080
(Madam Sun's wonton?)

131
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:37,440
Pei Shen.

132
00:09:37,771 --> 00:09:39,228
You're done with onboarding?

133
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:41,720
Yes, I just finished
the onboarding process

134
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,159
and came right here to greet Ms. Yuan.

135
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:43,919
Am I welcome?

136
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,759
We're happy to have you in MU.

137
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,759
Did you need something from me?

138
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:52,840
It's my first time here.

139
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,960
I'm not very familiar
with the surroundings.

140
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,360
You're the only person I know.

141
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,799
I was thinking maybe I could treat you
to dinner.

142
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:00,559
Of course.

143
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:02,559
But I should be the one treating you.

144
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:03,590
Let's do it tonight, then.

145
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,759
I saw that a new hotpot place

146
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:06,200
opened near the office.

147
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:07,080
Let's go together.

148
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:09,039
If I tell you

149
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:10,320
that I already have plans tonight,

150
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,200
would you believe me?

151
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,120
Sure.

152
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:14,639
Next time, then.

153
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:16,200
I'll leave...

154
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,200
You go ahead.

155
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,759
(Wontons.)

156
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:33,200
(Could Pei Shen be Brother?)

157
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,519
Next Monday,

158
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,279
I want every process and detail

159
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,600
for the contract signing
with Hill Capital to be ready.

160
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:42,200
Confirm the time
with all department personnel

161
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,360
and update if anything.

162
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,679
I'll do the presentation slides
and speech.

163
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,360
I'll leave the rest to you all.

164
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,428
Let's have a nice meal
after everything concludes.

165
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:51,960
I'll be off.

166
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,399
You've worked hard, Ms. Yuan.

167
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,600
Not as hard as the chef.

168
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,279
Come, quickly. Sit.

169
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:05,600
Sit down.

170
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,200
Did you clean and cut these yourself?

171
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,679
It's fine. There's no poison.

172
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:16,240
I made sure I washed them properly.

173
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:18,080
I mean...

174
00:11:20,171 --> 00:11:22,080
Which ingredient don't you like?
I can change it.

175
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,039
Tell me which one.

176
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,360
I mean, we can start eating.

177
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,600
Yes, let's eat.

178
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,080
Quickly.

179
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,120
I'm really hungry.

180
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,879
Are you?

181
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:34,840
Let's cook some meat.

182
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,759
Have the meat.

183
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:38,600
Thanks.

184
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:42,120
More.

185
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,080
It's good.

186
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,399
Looks like you're in
a good mood today, Ms. Yuan.

187
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,039
Not too bad.

188
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,159
How come?

189
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:55,360
Did something happen at work?

190
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:57,399
Something did happen today

191
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:58,960
which made me very happy.

192
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:01,600
I met an old friend

193
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,730
whom I had lost contact with.

194
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,960
(Did Madam Sun's wonton
make her remember?)

195
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,240
An old friend?

196
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,600
Why didn't you two talk more?

197
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,960
I'm not 100 percent sure
that it's him yet.

198
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,960
But he ordered some food for me
this afternoon.

199
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,320
(Yes!)

200
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:21,159
(All hail Madam Sun's wonton.)

201
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:22,960
The particular food
has a special meaning

202
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,559
for me and him.

203
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,399
(So you remembered.)

204
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,600
Was the food delivery as good
as our hotpot?

205
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:36,679
Oh, right.

206
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,440
I was upstairs working most of the day.

207
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,759
The silly bird didn't make one squeak.

208
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:44,639
Do you think it's sick
because you kept it caged upstairs?

209
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:46,879
(She's actually concerned
about the parrot.)

210
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,759
It's...

211
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,399
It's probably itching
and needs a flea treatment.

212
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:54,240
Don't worry about it.

213
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:00,480
(Bird, oh bird.
It's your time to shine.)

214
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,759
Are you free tomorrow?

215
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:04,759
Yes.

216
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,200
I have a teleconference later.

217
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,200
I should be free tomorrow morning.
What's up?

218
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,080
I have a meeting tomorrow.

219
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,399
If you're free,

220
00:13:12,428 --> 00:13:14,514
could you take the silly bird
for a flea treatment?

221
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,279
Okay.

222
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,360
(The plan is on.)

223
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:21,080
Let me cook some vegetables.

224
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:23,039
I can do it myself.

225
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:25,960
I'm here. I'll serve tonight.

226
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,480
Later, when Yuan Xia takes you out,

227
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:46,399
remember to call her "Yuan."

228
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,360
That's her nickname.

229
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:49,440
Repeat after me.

230
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:51,879
Yuan.

231
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,759
Repeat after me, repeat after me.

232
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,440
No, I'm not repeating after you.

233
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,279
Now, listen.

234
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,840
Call her "Yuan."

235
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,759
Repeat after me, repeat after me.

236
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,399
It's just like the parrot from before.

237
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,679
Just as dumb.

238
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,840
Forget it. Why argue with an idiot?

239
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,440
Idiot, idiot.

240
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,600
Idiot?

241
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,440
Say it again

242
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,159
and I'll shave off your fringe!

243
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,960
Idiot!

244
00:14:14,828 --> 00:14:16,600
I'm going
to shave off your fringe for real!

245
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,509
Dumb!

246
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:20,449
You dumb!

247
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:21,550
Dumb!

248
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:23,279
What are you two doing
so early in the morning?

249
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,879
I... I was teaching it phrases.

250
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,428
I'm going to wash up.

251
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,000
Then I'll take it
for the flea treatment.

252
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,679
Okay.

253
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,114
A passerby would think you two
were having a tearful reunion.

254
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,919
Treat the bird nicer.

255
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:37,639
Sure thing.

256
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,399
Fine, you win.

257
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,440
Remember, call her "Yuan."

258
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,200
Yuan.

259
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:59,100
(MU Communications Opening Ceremony
Rundown Proposal)

260
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:02,200
Remember what I taught you.
Call her that.

261
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,960
Got it?

262
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:06,200
Call her that. Call her that.

263
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:10,840
It's up to you now. You can do it.

264
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:11,679
You can do it.

265
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,360
Drive safe.

266
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,279
Call me if there's anything.

267
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,600
Let's go, silly bird.

268
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:27,600
Thanks.

269
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,200
Be safe on the road.

270
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,840
Silly bird, keep quiet.

271
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,828
If you keep squeaking,
I'll turn you into parrot soup.

272
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,399
Idiot! Idiot!

273
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:12,080
Miss, is this your car?

274
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,000
Park it properly.

275
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,480
Sorry, I'll repark.

276
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,120
Okay.

277
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:16,960
Wait for me here.

278
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:19,720
Idiot.

279
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,559
Idiot! Idiot!

280
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:37,559
Pei Shen?

281
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,159
What are you doing here?

282
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,080
Is this your parrot?

283
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,200
Idiot, idiot! Stupid idiot!

284
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,960
Birdy, be good.

285
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:47,660
You shouldn't speak
to your master like that.

286
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:49,679
What a coincidence.
I also have a pet parrot.

287
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:51,399
I'm here to buy feed for it.

288
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:52,480
It's quite the picky eater.

289
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,942
It would only eat the feed from here.

290
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:56,600
A picky eater is better
than a foul mouth.

291
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:58,399
I brought it here for flea treatment.

292
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,559
Come on, let's go together.

293
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:01,399
Yuan. Yuan.

294
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,879
What did you say?

295
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,759
Yuan. Yuan.

296
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,200
Did you teach it to call me that?

297
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,480
I nagged at it a little just now.

298
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,759
Maybe it picked it up.

299
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,000
Pei Shen, are you...

300
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,200
Am I what?

301
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,079
It's nothing.

302
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:26,640
I'm sure the day will come

303
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,359
when you tell me yourself.

304
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:31,759
Let's go.

305
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,680
The collection and analysis of data

306
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,440
in quantum communication experiments

307
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,319
are crucial to the accuracy
and reliability of the results.

308
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,279
Appropriate detectors should be selected

309
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,559
and their parameters adjusted

310
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:51,000
during data collection

311
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,839
to obtain high sensitivity
and low noise signals.

312
00:17:54,028 --> 00:17:56,480
At the same time, attention
should be paid to photon counting

313
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,559
to avoid errors.

314
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:00,680
Okay, let's take a look...

315
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,160
What the heck? You scared me.

316
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,240
Why are you scared?

317
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,714
Because you're looking for someone
behind Wei's back?

318
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:07,480
Watching Pei Shen, are you?

319
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,160
Don't worry. I won't tell him.

320
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:10,400
Don't be mistaken.

321
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,759
Pei Shen and I are not what you think.

322
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,880
Then why do you keep staring at him?

323
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,000
A lot of his actions
are clearly telling me

324
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,279
that he's the guy.

325
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,599
But somehow,
I don't quite think he is him.

326
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,240
(Did she remember something?)

327
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,000
It's nothing.
Anyhow, it's not what you think.

328
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,200
Besides,

329
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:37,240
this has nothing to do with Wei Ziqi.

330
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,960
Our relationship is fake anyway.

331
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:43,480
This is the rundown
for the opening ceremony.

332
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:44,480
Have a look.

333
00:18:44,514 --> 00:18:46,240
I'm going to proceed with it
if it's okay.

334
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:52,079
Looks fine on my side.

335
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,759
But you might need to add one more

336
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,000
for Hill Capital.

337
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:57,680
Xi Lin wants to come.

338
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:01,359
Jealous?

339
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,359
Why should I be jealous?

340
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,440
No need to explain.
It'll only make it more real.

341
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,000
It's out of Wei's hands.

342
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:10,599
Because Xi Lin
is the benefactor's daughter.

343
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:11,759
He has to make them happy.

344
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:14,680
But you said it yourself.

345
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,480
You and Wei are only pretending.

346
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,960
I don't suppose you'd mind.

347
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:23,039
First, ensure that the quality
and length of the optical fiber

348
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,359
meet the experimental requirements

349
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,200
to avoid bending and damage.

350
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,240
Secondly, the optical fibers
need to be aligned

351
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,550
so that the light between the fibers

352
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:31,359
can be fully coupled.

353
00:19:37,428 --> 00:19:38,880
(I'll be having dinner with Xi Kun.)

354
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,200
(No need to wait for me tonight.)

355
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,759
Silly bird, you even learned
how to break out?

356
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:37,599
Yuan Xia.

357
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,720
Yuan Xia.

358
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,559
Why are you here?

359
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:46,680
Have you eaten?

360
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,200
I'm waiting for you.

361
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:49,400
For me?

362
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,920
I texted you, didn't I?

363
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,160
Telling you not to wait?

364
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,839
Don't you have anything to tell me?

365
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,400
I had dinner with Xi Kun
to talk about the partnership.

366
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,200
Is that it?

367
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:02,359
Nothing more to add?

368
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:06,960
You had dinner with Mr. Xi.

369
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,480
But Xi Lin was there too, right?

370
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,400
How did you know she was also there?

371
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,720
You said you were eating with Mr. Xi.

372
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,200
So your childhood companion, Xi Lin,
had to be there.

373
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:24,559
Childhood companion?

374
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,839
I do have a childhood companion. But...

375
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:29,200
Who doesn't have childhood companions?

376
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,680
I have one too. Don't you remember?

377
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,640
I told you about my childhood companion.

378
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,039
He's the old friend
who ordered food for me.

379
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,359
He works at our company.

380
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:37,640
We've known each other a long time.

381
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,960
Be it the past or present,

382
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,359
he treats me very well.

383
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:41,160
Moreover,

384
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,079
there's a story about a parrot
that we share.

385
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,640
Well then,

386
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,599
aren't you going to get reacquainted
with your childhood companion

387
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,759
and have a little catch-up?

388
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:55,000
What made you think
I didn't catch up with Pei Shen?

389
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:58,720
Who?

390
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,400
The new hire in R&D, Pei Shen.

391
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,109
Next time, go right ahead
and eat with your childhood companion.

392
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,990
I have a childhood companion
to eat with me too.

393
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:07,960
Enjoy your meal.

394
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,359
Pei... Pei Shen?

395
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,759
What...

396
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,680
He just had dinner with Xi Lin.

397
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,880
This terrible mouth of mine.

398
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,720
Why mention my childhood companion
and Pei Shen?

399
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,480
I'm not even sure about it.

400
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:39,160
(Why is this still on?)

401
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,359
(When you go out with Yuan Xia,)

402
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,359
(remember to call her "Yuan.")

403
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,200
(That's her nickname.)

404
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,799
(Repeat after me.)

405
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:50,039
(Yuan.)

406
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:51,200

00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:55,599

410
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:01,079

411
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:03,240
(Yuan.)

412
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:04,599
(Yuan. Yuan.)

413
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:07,240
Hello, Mr. Wei.

414
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:08,799
I'm the new assistant.

415
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:09,759
My name is Yuan Xia.

Yuan Xia.

420
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,240
I've waited a long time for you.

421
00:23:24,914 --> 00:23:26,240
(A driver's instinctive reaction)

422
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,879
(should be to turn the steering wheel
and avoid the oncoming danger.)

423
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,720
But you did the opposite

424
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,069
and hit the barrier directly.

425
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:34,714
Doesn't this bird look familiar?

426
00:23:34,742 --> 00:23:36,350
As if you've seen it before?

427
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,960
It doesn't look familiar to you?

428
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,000
Yuan. Yuan.

429
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,759
You scared me.

430
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,759

(That's her nickname.)

433
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,000
I haven't cooked in a long time.

434
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,400
I might have lost the touch.

435
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:01,359
I'll be sure to practice more.

436
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,759

437
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:05,200

439
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,039

you emphasized

440
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,559
that I'm the first person
to spend the night in your house.

441
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,200
Not just the first one,

442
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:17,559

455
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,599
I wanted to explain to you
what happened.

I was going to eat with Xi Kun.

461
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,519
I didn't expect him to ask Xi Lin
to come get me.

462
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,799
I already know about that.

463
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,960
You explained it in your text.

464
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,279
Is there anything else?

465
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:30,240
If not,

466
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:31,759
I have a call to make

Yuan Xia.

469
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,440
I heard Xi Lin was there too,

470
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,559
so I made up an excuse to leave quickly.

471
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:44,240
I've not eaten anything yet.

472
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:48,039
Neither have you, right?

473
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,960

474
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,200
(You still won't say it, huh?)

475
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:55,599
(Alright. I'll show you.)

476
00:25:57,319 --> 00:25:58,160
Follow me.

477
00:26:07,371 --> 00:26:08,085
(Bing Fen Tangyuan)

478
00:26:46,285 --> 00:26:49,110
(Grilled brains 18 yuan, Grilled marrow
20 yuan, Spicy clam noodle 12 yuan)

479
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:56,359
Check this out.

480
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,759
This one's good. Let's edit it.

481
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:04,559
Boss, how much for one piece?

482
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:06,680
19 yuan for two.

483
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,279
He wants one.

484
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,200
No, ma'am, I don't.

485
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:12,319
He wants it.

486
00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:17,240
We'll take two, then.

487
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:36,880
Sorry.

488
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,160
Sorry about that.

489
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,039
It's okay.
