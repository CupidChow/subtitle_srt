1
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:04,960
Wasn't it you who said

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,910
that we have to live in the moment

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:09,030
and not leave any regrets?

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:10,430
Listen carefully.

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,440
Wei Ziqi,

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,120
I love you.

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,390
I want to be with you

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,320
always and forever.

9
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,390
The moment I was about to
fall off the cliff,

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,070
what I regretted most was

11
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,640
that I had never

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,200
told you personally

13
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,320
that I love you very much.

we will always,

(indicate that all crises are over,)

34
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,760
(and everyone's fate has changed?)

35
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,510
(Are Wei Ziqi and Yuan Xia
from another time and space)

36
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,120
(both safe and sound?)

37
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:04,510
Hello?

38
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,920
It's me.

39
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,790
How's it going?

40
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:08,870
We are all fine.

41
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,630
As you got rid of Pei Shen, the threat,

42
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,120
our endings are completely changed.

43
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,120
(Year 2025)
As for Wei Ziqi and I,

44
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,870
we are living good lives.

45
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,800
Here, have some hot milk.

46
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,120
Pass me the coffee.

47
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,960
The reason you're calling me now

48
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,840
is to ask us to destroy the phone?

49
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,400
We thought about
everything that happened.

50
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,710
It's all because of this phone.

51
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,910
As long as it's still here,

52
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,240
there will be a second,

53
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,800
and even a third Xi Kun.

54
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,710
Therefore, we unanimously decided

55
00:02:42,085 --> 00:02:43,628
that we wanted it to be destroyed.

56
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,520
I agree.

57
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,120
This is also the outcome
my father wants to see.

58
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,190
Although the dual space-time phone

59
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,840
can change the past,

60
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,080
it can also cause people

61
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,240
to wallow in the pain of the past

62
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,371
and ignore the most precious moments
in the present.

63
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,400
We are all fine now,

64
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,680
and that's sufficient.

65
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,000
We should let all of this pass
as soon as we can.

66
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,190
Goodbye then, Yuan Xia.

67
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,310
By the way,

68
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,870
please convey my gratitude

69
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,310
to him.

70
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,030
Are you done?

71
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:17,680
Yes.

72
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,000
What are your plans today?

73
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,710
Let me take a look.

74
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,828
(10,000-day without regrets list)
We have done so many things together.

75
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,400
We watched movies,

76
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,750
went shopping,

77
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,310
and even went camping together.

78
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:39,030
Today's agenda is your long-awaited,
watching a meteor shower.

79
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,240
Let's hurry and pack our things then.

80
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,400
It just so happened
that I checked the weather forecast

81
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,680
and today's light pollution.

82
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,520
We will certainly see
the meteor shower today.

83
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:47,750
Wei Ziqi,

84
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,560
you can't tease me with fireflies

85
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,000
like last time anymore.

86
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,000
The fireflies have to at least
give me a chance.

87
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,910
At most, I...

88
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:55,840
At most what?

89
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,800
I won't tell you yet.

90
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:01,960
You have to leave your husband

91
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,590
some space to keep things from you.

92
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,400
You're acting mysterious.

93
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,520
Let's go.

94
00:04:06,685 --> 00:04:08,120
Before we go to watch the meteor shower,

95
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,285
go somewhere with me first.

96
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,430
Why did you bring me here?

97
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,870
Wait.

98
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:43,630
Try this on.

99
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,920
(Before you come back to me,)

100
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,430
(my memories are filled
with their sweet memories)

101
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:04,160
(from another time and space.)

102
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,360
(You have no idea)

103
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,600
(how much I envy them.)

104
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,430
(Now that you are back,)

105
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,870
(I want to do)

106
00:05:23,314 --> 00:05:25,028
(all the things we did together again.)

107
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,270
(We must catch up with them.)

108
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,120
(I want to give you)

109
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,600
(a special wedding.)

110
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,830
Hello, Sir.

111
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,830
I am the photographer you booked.

112
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,310
Do you have any requests

113
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,440
for today's photography style?

114
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,542
Here, you may refer to this.

115
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,270
What's going on with you?

116
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,360
This is too sudden.

117
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,600
I'm not prepared.

118
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,040
Yuan,

119
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,270
I'm all here now.

120
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,630
What else do you need to prepare?

121
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,120
Both of you, stand closer.

122
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,120
Here.

123
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,830
Come on, smile a little.

124
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:31,750
Don't be shy.

125
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:33,920
Be more natural.

126
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,270
Alright, let me take a look.

127
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,390
Yuan Xia,

128
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,000
let me tell you a joke.

129
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,680
Do you know what is

130
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,040
black, red, and white?

131
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,800
What's that?

132
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,310
A shy zebra.

133
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,800
What a lame joke.

134
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,430
Take it easy.

135
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,000
That was good.

136
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,390
Good, stay that way.

137
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,342
You're very beautiful.

138
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,360
Great.

139
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,270

Pretty good.

156
00:07:58,171 --> 00:07:59,510
Turn right at the next intersection.

157
00:07:59,885 --> 00:08:01,630
What do you need to do
before turning right?

158
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,430
Turn on the right turn signal first.

159
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,920
Then, look in the rear view mirror,
and do not panic.

160
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,160
Slowly switch lanes
before turning right.

161
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:28,680
Watch out!

162
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,320

=Present, is Present=

164
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:35,780
(Year 2024)

165
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,750
Are you alright?

166
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,630
I'm fine.

167
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,960
I got a call.

168
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,870
Xi Kun passed away.

169
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,150
Before he passed, he admitted

170
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,840
it was he who instigated Pei Shen
to do that to you.

171
00:09:56,285 --> 00:09:58,085
Besides, when my father
had heart disease,

172
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:01,030
it was also he
who threw away the medicine.

173
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:04,670
Wei Ziqi,

174
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,030
everything has passed.

175
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,440
I am fine.

176
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,200
By the way, Xi Lin

177
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,840
has never visited Xi Kun,
not even once.

178
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,320
Some of Xi Lin's actions

179
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,840
are always intriguing.

180
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,910
We haven't sounded her out

181
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,960
about the matter with Pei Shen yet.

182
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,060
(Xi Lin)

183
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,510
Mr. Wei.

184
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:49,960
You are here.

185
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,150
There isn't
any other particular reason

186
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,510
for calling you here today.

187
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,870
I just want to say goodbye to you
in person

188
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,440
before you go abroad.

189
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,550
Please wait for me for a moment.

190
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,840
Packing is almost done.

191
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,440
Actually, it doesn't matter

192
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,630
if I don't pack the others.

193
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,750
I just need my music scores.

194
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,600
I have been collecting them

195
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,120
one by one since I was young.

196
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,840
It would be a pity to throw them away.

197
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,150
By the way,

198
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,750
I have not thanked you
about Pei Shen yet.

199
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,030
Since then,

200
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,080
he never called to harass me again.

201
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,550
Pei Shen

202
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,510
passed away.

203
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,240
He committed suicide.

204
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,960
We couldn't figure out

205
00:11:34,571 --> 00:11:35,840
why a man who was bold enough

206
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,510
to kidnap someone in the previous second

207
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,910
would suddenly
commit suicide the next

208
00:11:40,485 --> 00:11:43,720
until when we saw a lot
of your photographs at his house.

209
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,080
My photographs?

210
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,630
He had been to all of your concerts

211
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,120
held in the country.

212
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,960
He even saved many live photographs.

213
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,960
Xi Lin, have you ever thought

214
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,630
that Pei Shen actually liked you?

215
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,550
How is that possible?

216
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,320
I haven't even seen him.

217
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:06,240
Besides, I didn't even know the presence

218
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,720
of my father's subordinate before that.

219
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,150
Well,

220
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,200
could he be

221
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,750
stalking me in hiding all this while?

222
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,000
I understand.

223
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,550
Because of my father,

224
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,480
you will inevitably
get suspicious of me.

225
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,510
However, Ziqi,

226
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,910
you should know me well.

227
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,630
No matter when,

228
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,240
I won't let anyone hurt you.

229
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,840
You talk first.

230
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,270
I need to take a call.

231
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,750
Go ahead.

232
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:01,870
Hello?

233
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,200
Hello.

234
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,120
The phone cannot be destroyed yet.

235
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,150
Who did it?

236
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,550
It was Xi Lin.

237
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:12,670
Of course.

238
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,630
Actually, in the beginning,
I could clearly feel

239
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,320
that Pei Shen wanted to
drag me down with him

240
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,390
but you mentioned Xi Lin

241
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,750
and that triggered him,

242
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,030
hence he pushed me away

243
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,270
the moment he fell off the cliff.

244
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,630
I didn't expect Pei Shen to be so crazy.

245
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,150
He seemed so polite

246
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,630
at the company before.

247
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:32,670
After all, he is someone

248
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,870
trained by Xi Kun.

249
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,540
Perhaps money
and the dual space-time phone

250
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,550
weren't what he wanted at all.

251
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:41,240
Could it be that he wanted to protect

252
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,200
someone very important to him?

253
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,150
Could that person be Xi Lin?

254
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,200
You can test it out.

255
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:53,200
Alright, I know what to do now.

256
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,390
Yuan Xia,

257
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,240
tell Wei Ziqi

258
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,360
the last thing I should do
is let you drive.

259
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,510
I'm not a good coach.

260
00:14:03,714 --> 00:14:05,657
I shouldn't have taught you
to drive like that.

261
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,270
Ziqi,

262
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,270
I dropped the phone
by accident and it broke.

263
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,630
What should we do?

264
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:32,550
It's fine.

265
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,080
We're getting it destroyed soon anyway.

266
00:14:35,171 --> 00:14:37,142
I'll take care of it
at the company tomorrow.

267
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,457
We won't need it anymore.

268
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:40,390
It's fine.

269
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,630
Xi Lin,

270
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,840
is there anything else
you need our help with?

271
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,840
Packing is almost done.

272
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,150
It's good that you are here.

273
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,900
=Episode 14=
(The Original Ending)

274
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,630
What was said on the phone?

275
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,390
The phone cannot be destroyed yet

276
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,870
as it serves another purpose.

277
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,240
Did something happen

278
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:13,670
to someone else?

279
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,240
You know, it feels like

280
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,840
we are unboxing surprise boxes now.

281
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,000
It's just unfortunate

282
00:15:22,114 --> 00:15:24,085
that I'm the one
who got the joker this time.

283
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,030
It's because of Xi Lin.

284
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,630
It happened at the fork of the road

285
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,942
at the foot of Stargazing Station.

286
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,080
I was turning
and she was going the opposite way.

287
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,080
Both our cars would collide head-on.

288
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,030
I died on the spot.

289
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,030
You from a year later even asked me
to tell you

290
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,840
that what he regretted most

291
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,550
was letting me drive.

292
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,960
He said he was not a good coach

293
00:15:48,028 --> 00:15:49,840
and shouldn't have taught me
to drive like that.

294
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,114
However, what does that have
anything to do with you?

295
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:56,240
It's foul luck at best,

296
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,440
being targeted by a psychotic.

297
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,480
Speaking of this,

298
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,240
Xi Lin's really persistent with me.

299
00:16:03,771 --> 00:16:06,270
Those who didn't know would think
she was going to commit suicide.

300
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,720
By the way, there's something else
I find strange.

301
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,200
I noticed many gifts

302
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,750
in the corridor of Xi Lin's house.

303
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,840
These are the gifts Ms. Xi prepared

304
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,550
for her friend's birthday.

305
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,240
Why aren't they sent out?

306
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,000
I'm not sure why either,

307
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,910
but these are quite expensive gifts.

308
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,910
She would come over from time to time
to take a look

309
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,670
and we aren't allowed to touch them.

310
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,200
Does she

311
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,750
give you birthday presents every year?

312
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,440
But I returned all of them.

313
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:51,270
Are you sure
you return them every year?

314
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:02,030
I'm not too sure
about the year my father died.

315
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,160
I spent the year in misery

316
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,160
so I didn't care about this.

317
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,750
The gift I received that year

318
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,590
is sealed together with
my father's belongings.

319
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,057
Otherwise, I won't be able to find it.

320
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,000
To Ziqi: Happy birthday.

321
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,830
This is my favorite

322
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,720
and most satisfying gift of the year.

323
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,230
I'm giving it to you.
I hope you like it.

324
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,030
From Xi Lin.

325
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,070
Wait.

326
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,030
This is a bracelet

327
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,640
that I made with my own hands.

328
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,030
I also personally gave it to Mr. Heng

329
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,830
on the night of your birthday.

330
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,440
I made this bracelet myself.

331
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,480
You take it first.

332
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,510
Please pass this to him
when you see him.

333
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,200
I wish him to be happy
every day in the future.

334
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,070
Sure.

335
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,350
My father won't pass Xi Lin

336
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,440
something you gifted.

337
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:21,110
How did this thing
fall into her hands, then?

338
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,750
It's impossible

339
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,680
that she picked it up by chance, right?

340
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:27,400
No way.

341
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,440
Someone like Xi Lin

342
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,510
wouldn't gift something
she picked up by chance

343
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,110
to someone she likes.

344
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,310
You have a point.

345
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,440
This is peculiar.

346
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,070
In fact, the psychological aspect
of this

347
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:41,960
is easy to explain.

348
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,960
When a murderer

349
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,480
with sociopathic traits kills,

350
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,550
he will remove objects from the victims

351
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,880
to collect them as trophies.

352
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:52,200
Are you saying that Mr. Heng...

353
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,480
Impossible.

354
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,920
They have no grudges.

355
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,750
I have a guess.

356
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,960
Just listen and judge.

357
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:02,030
Mr. Wei from a year later
called and said

358
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:05,270
that Xi Lin would murder
Yuan Xia in 2025,

359
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:05,880
right?

360
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,510
Her motive would be you.

361
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,880
Similarly, the reason
she attacked your father

362
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,310
could be because of you, too.

363
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,640
I've seen a very typical case of

364
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,240
antisocial personality disorder

365
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,640
in my psychology class before.

366
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,200
To get closer to the crush,

367
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:21,270
the murderer killed her whole family.

368
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,510
His purpose is to make himself

369
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:26,440
the only person his crush
can rely on in this world.

370
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,960
Isn't that sick?

371
00:19:28,114 --> 00:19:30,240
Yes, it is indeed a mental condition
in medical terms.

372
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,200
Besides, when Xi Lin was hospitalized,

373
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,920
we gave her a psychological evaluation.

374
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,790
I remember my colleague
complained to me that Xi Lin

375
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,960
was the most self-centered person
he had ever seen.

376
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:40,885
There's no way
that she'd commit suicide.

377
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:44,030
If it's really like you said

378
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,350
that it was Xi Lin who killed my father,

379
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,270
then she's pretty good.

380
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,240
Xi Kun and Pei Shen

381
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,750
were blamed for everything,

382
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,350
and she was totally fine.

383
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,310
She won't be fine.

384
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,030
I will make her show her true colors.

385
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,790
According to Dr. Xing's analysis,

386
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,830
if Xi Lin has an antisocial personality,

387
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,240
she will definitely not allow me

388
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,200
to continue to stay by your side.

389
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,240
Besides, I guess she was the one

390
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,790
who picked up
when Pei Shen made the call

391
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,160
before the accident in Lin County.

392
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,270
When you first reached out to me

393
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,790
and placed the bellflowers in my hand,

394
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:31,240
I could do anything for you.

395
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,310
So Xi Lin

396
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,400
is the one who really wants to kill me.

397
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,640
If I guessed correctly,

398
00:20:38,114 --> 00:20:40,914
she must already know the existence of
the dual space-time phone.

399
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,960
So she will definitely find a way

400
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,030
to cut us off from the future

401
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,030
before she kills me.

402
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,510
No wonder you let her find out

403
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,310
that we planned to destroy the phone
at her house.

404
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:54,742
To force her to take action.

405
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,200
Yes.

406
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:58,680
She won't watch the phone
getting destroyed

407
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,110
without any action.

408
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:00,920
Of course.

409
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:02,920
The phone is just the first step.

410
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,550
More importantly,

411
00:21:04,714 --> 00:21:07,028
we have to catch the evidence
of her committing murder.

412
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,270
Yuan Xia, I know what you're thinking

413
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,440
but I disagree.

414
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,830
If she is really like what I said,

415
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,200
then she is extremely dangerous.

416
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,550
We can think about it first.

417
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,830
There could be other ways.

418
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,440
She will go abroad soon.

419
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,790
Isn't she going to kill me?

420
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,350
Just let her do it.

421
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,257
But this time,

422
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,240
we have to make her
follow our script to kill me.

423
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,000
No.

424
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,680
Ziqi, I know what you are worried about.

425
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,000
You don't want me to take risks

426
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,920
but I really can't sit still
and wait for death.

427
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,440
From our first time

428
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,550
trying to change my ending until now,

429
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,790
all our efforts have been in vain.

430
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,350
It's like the universe is telling us

431
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,960
that everything is already fixed.

432
00:21:40,142 --> 00:21:41,310
So I'm willing to take the risk

433
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,030
this time around.

434
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,030
I don't want to be frightened anymore.

435
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,339
(It happened at the fork of the road)

436
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,685
(at the foot of Stargazing Station.)

437
00:22:08,771 --> 00:22:11,085
(I was turning and she
was going in the opposite direction.)

438
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,750
(Both our cars would collide head-on.)

439
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,680
(I died on the spot.)

440
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:21,030
(You from a year later even asked me
to tell him)

441
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,790
(that what you regretted most)

442
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,510
(was letting me drive.)

443
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,960
(He said he was not a good coach)

444
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:29,114
(and shouldn't have taught me
to drive like that.)

445
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,440
(Drive?)

446
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:34,880
(Drive like that?)

447
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,070
(If only)

448
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,440
(Wei Ziqi noticed the danger then...)

449
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:47,640
Watch out!

450
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,857
(He would definitely
make the car turn left)

451
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:52,750
(so that his side
will meet with Xi Lin's car.)

452
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:55,830
(To protect Wei Ziqi, Yuan Xia)

453
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,110
(would definitely let
her side of the car)

454
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,480
(collide with Xi Lin's car.)

455
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,750
(Xi Lin must not have expected)

456
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,510
(that Yuan Xia would protect Wei Ziqi)

457
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,510
(and made her side of the car
face the impact.)

458
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,070
(If that's the case,)

459
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:16,960
(the one who Xi Lin
wanted to kill is me.)

460
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,240
(From our first time)

461
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,440
(trying to change my ending until now,)

462
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:27,790
(all our efforts are in vain.)

463
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,400
(It's like the universe is telling us)

464
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,030
(that everything is already fixed)

465
00:23:31,114 --> 00:23:32,457
(so I'm willing to take the risk)

466
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,960
(this time around.)

467
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,200
(I don't want to be frightened anymore.)

468
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,480
Have you really decided to do this?

469
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,070
I still think it's too risky.

470
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,200
What if Xi Lin gets the phone

471
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,480
and destroys it?

472
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,200
After all, if we lose the phone,

473
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,240
we won't be able to change the fact
that Yuan Xia died.

474
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,510
Besides,

475
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,200
how can we make Xi Lin get the phone

476
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,571
without raising her suspicion?

477
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:08,440
If she really wants to get the phone,

478
00:24:08,885 --> 00:24:10,657
she will definitely do it
by utilizing Chenchen.

479
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:11,790
Chenchen?

480
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,750
That's Wei Ziqi's
administrative assistant.

481
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,440
No.

482
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,680
As long as Xi Lin holds a concert,

483
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,160
our fan club must give full support.

484
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,960
Fine, that's everything for now.

485
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,750
Xia.

486
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,880
Are you a fan of Xi Lin?

487
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,400
Yes.

488
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,640
I am the president

489
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,480
of her fan club.

490
00:24:28,514 --> 00:24:30,657
When we went to the hospital
to visit Xi Lin before,

491
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:32,510
the postcard among the flowers
by her bed

492
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:33,960
has Chenchen's signature.

493
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,790
If Xi Lin intends to steal the phone,

494
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,720
she will definitely use Chenchen.

495
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,750
There's one last problem left.

496
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,030
How do we make
Wei Ziqi from a year later

497
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,030
cooperate with our plan?

498
00:24:52,742 --> 00:24:54,310
Just make a phone call and he'll know.

499
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:58,500
(2024.12.28 12:00)

500
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,830
There's something I want to tell you.

501
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,720
We may need you to cooperate with us.

502
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,240
This is roughly the plan.

503
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,790
This is the only way

504
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,400
to collect evidence
of Xi Lin's crime.

505
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,550
I won't help you

506
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,720
because it's too dangerous.

507
00:25:27,028 --> 00:25:28,428
(2024, 2025)
Did he also agree?

508
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,240
Even if it's for revenge,

509
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,020
he can't push you out there
and use you as bait.

510
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,400
This has nothing to do with Wei Ziqi.

511
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,310
I decided to do this myself.

512
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:36,350
Besides,

513
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:38,240
we have already made
extensive preparations.

514
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,720
You just have to act like

515
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,550
you don't know that
the phone is with Xi Lin

516
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,640
and make a call to her

517
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,750
to give her a heads-up of my death.

518
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,440
How are you going to
solve the fatal danger brought

519
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,310
by the cold and the bellflower allergy

520
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,790
after entering the cold storage?

521
00:25:50,885 --> 00:25:52,309
(2024, 2025)
If it's preserved flowers,

522
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:54,110
there will be no allergic reaction.

523
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,110
As for the cold storage,

524
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:58,960
I believe in Ni Ning.

525
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,720
That's not enough.

526
00:26:00,028 --> 00:26:01,714
(2024, 2025)
That's far from enough.

527
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,750
Convey my message to him, please?

528
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,920
Wei Ziqi asked me to tell you something.

529
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,200
I know what he regrets most

530
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,200
and I won't let it happen again.

531
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:19,920
Tell him this,

532
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:21,680
and he will help us.

533
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,270
He said

534
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,510
he knows what you regret most

535
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,640
and he won't let the same thing
happen again.

536
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,110
Don't worry,

537
00:26:32,085 --> 00:26:33,800
they will do their best to protect me

538
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,440
the same way you did.

539
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,480
Come in.

540
00:26:45,914 --> 00:26:48,030
Xia, Finance Department
has called you to a meeting.

541
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,350
Let's go.

542
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,310
Yuan Xia, don't speak.
Just listen to what I have to say.

543
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,310
Your future has not changed.

544
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,750
You will still be locked up
in the cold storage

545
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,640
at Lakeside Hotel on December 31st.

546
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,830
I would be pretending
to propose to Xi Lin

547
00:27:45,942 --> 00:27:47,714
in an attempt to get evidence
of Xi Kun's crime.

548
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,030
I will do it myself.

549
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,940
(Yuan Xia)

550
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,440
Wei Ziqi,

551
00:28:18,514 --> 00:28:19,640
I know that you were the one

552
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,070
who called me last night.

553
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,400
I thought it was a harassment call

554
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,790
when you didn't speak at first

555
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,160
but I heard you calling me Yuan

556
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,960
when I was hanging up.

557
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:29,110
I didn't react at first,

558
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,240
but when I passed by the market
and saw a parrot,

559
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,550
it finally hit me

560
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,000
that you are the boy in the attic,

561
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,640
is that right?

562
00:28:34,771 --> 00:28:36,640
You've always known
that I was Yuan, right?

563
00:28:37,057 --> 00:28:39,070
I have something very important
to pass to you.

564
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:40,920
Wait for me at the hotel.
I'll go find you.

565
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:56,830
Ziqi, are you ready?

566
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:01,960
Let's go.

567
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,780
(Xi Lin & Wei Ziqi)

568
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,030
Miss, please sign here.

569
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,440
Hello,

570
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,440
are you Miss Yuan?

571
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,350
A gentleman asked me to tell you

572
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:33,028
that he is waiting for you
at the restaurant.

573
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,550
Sure, thank you.

574
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,310
You're welcome.

575
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,750
There is still time before your death.

576
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,390
It's the same
as the original time and space.

577
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,270
The only difference is

578
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,480
my engagement with Xi Lin

579
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,960
will become ours.

580
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,440
Pei Shen who killed you
would also be dead.

581
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,790
You must be wary of Xi Lin.

582
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,790
Ziqi, don't worry.

583
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:33,960
I like the death
you mentioned very much.

584
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,030
(I will definitely give you
a perfect wedding.)
