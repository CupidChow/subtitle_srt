(Year 2025)

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:04,910
Be careful.

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,380
(Fork in the road Stargazing Station)

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,510
(Turn right at the next intersection.)

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,870
(What do you need to do
before turning right?)

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,670
(Turn on the right turn signal first.)

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,670
(Then look in the rearview mirror.)

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,230
(Take it easy, change lanes slowly.)

9
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:20,440
(Turn right again.)

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,640
Enough, Wei.

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,440
Stop torturing yourself.

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,600
I think

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,920
if you were in the driver's seat then,

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,240
you would have made
the same choice as Yuan Xia.

15
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,150
I told Wei Ziqi that day

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,710
I regretted teaching Yuan Xia
to drive like that the most.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,390
(Slowly change lanes
and then turn right.)

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,750
Be careful!

19
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,960
If I was the one driving the car

20
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,520
or she didn't learn it...

21
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,320
Wei Ziqi,

22
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,470
there is no need to learn
how to love someone.

23
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,070
Yuan Xia protected you

24
00:01:02,775 --> 00:01:04,140
just like how you protected Yuan Xia.

25
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,200
It's all instinct.

26
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,430
Moreover,

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,120
there's still time for everything.

28
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,640
Wei Ziqi asked me

29
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,480
to tell you something.

30
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,000
He said

31
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,350
he knows what you regret the most.

32
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,310
He won't let this happen again.

33
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,150
I should have guessed it

34
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,310
a year ago.

35
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,640
The one whom Xi Lin hates
and wants to kill the most.

36
00:01:30,275 --> 00:01:32,050
She deliberately drove
on the opposite side

37
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,920
and aimed at the front passenger seat.

38
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,950
The person she wants
to take down with her own life

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,120
is me.

40
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:33,100
=Present, Is Present=

41
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:41,500
(Year 2024)

42
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:46,630
What are you thinking about?

43
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,680
Are you worried

44
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,870
that Xi Lin won't follow our plan?

45
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,800
I'm thinking about how to
propose to Yuan Xia.

46
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,240
Propose?

47
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,430
I thought you were doing that

48
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,680
just to agitate Xi Lin.

49
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,080
You are serious?

50
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,430
Of course, I am.

51
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,470
How long have you two been together?

52
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,470
That's too fast.

53
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,630
Every day I spend with Yuan Xia

54
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,000
is like a countdown.

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,190
Of course, I would be in a hurry.

56
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,960
But compared to me...

57
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,240
What about you?

58
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,150
I mean,

59
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,430
for someone like me,

60
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,470
a walking dating guidebook
is in front of you.

61
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,750
Why didn't you ask me?

62
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,630
I just don't want to be fooled

63
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,080
by your textbook tricks.

64
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,430
I want to be more sincere this time.

65
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,630
I want it to be formal.

66
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,120
Will Yuan Xia agree?

67
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,800
After all,

68
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,310
her own future is uncertain.

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,360
I don't care if she agrees or not.

70
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,470
My proposal

71
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,870
is the sincerity and sense of security
I want to give her.

72
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,360
Okay, I'll help you.

73
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,520
I will handle it.

74
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,360
I'm the one who came up with the method
of proposal.

75
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,920
I even have to prepare the decorations.

76
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,070
Am I proposing or him?

77
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,600
Seriously, everything Wei does
is one step ahead of me.

78
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,680
Even proposing.

79
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,680
Can't he let me win once?

80
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,680
What now?

81
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,190
You don't want to give Wei ideas

82
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,360
and be his wingman?

83
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:36,870
I wouldn't dare to do that.

84
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,310
Work quickly, then.

85
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,630
They should be here soon.

86
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,660
=Episode 15=
(Our Wedding)

87
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,510
I have something to tell you.

88
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,270
Go ahead.

89
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,920
Wei Ziqi, let's get married.

90
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,680
Why? Do you think this place
is not romantic enough?

91
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,190
You don't want to?

92
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,830
No.

93
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,360
I just think

94
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,720
that my girlfriend is too great.

95
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,870
Whatever I wanted to say and do,

96
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,190
you did it all.

97
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,920
I am a bit flattered.

98
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,480
Then let me say it formally again.

99
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,560
Mr. Wei Ziqi,

100
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,310
if one day,

101
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,040
your relationship status
becomes widowed,

102
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,430
would you regret it?

103
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,600
If it were you,

104
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,600
would you?

105
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,560
Of course, I won't.

106
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,120
I will follow my wife.

107
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,270
My answer is the same as yours.

108
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,510
Just one final step.

109
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,040
Ms. Yuan Xia,

110
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,680
will you marry me?

111
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,160
I...

112
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,830
I think the formality
is not proper enough.

113
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,160
Ms. Yuan Xia,

114
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,750
will you marry me?

115
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,240
I will.

(Wei Ziqi)

143
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,320
Hey, Wei.

144
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,150
We're almost done here.

145
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,030
Have you set off?

146
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,510
Can we be on standby?

147
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,030
We aren't going there anymore.

148
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,630
Okay.

149
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,480
What did you just say?

150
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,670
You're not coming?

151
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,960
We were so busy

152
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,870
preparing everything.

153
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,430
Now you're saying
you aren't coming over?

154
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,670
Aren't you going to propose?

155
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,440
No. What do you mean?

156
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,080
What do you mean by not proposing?

157
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,270
Because I've already been proposed to.

158
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,510
And I've already agreed,

159
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,840
so the proposal ceremony is completed.

160
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,000
It's hard to make a reservation
at that restaurant.

161
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,900
I booked the whole venue.

162
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,240
I'll leave the dinner to you two.

163
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,120
Don't waste it.

164
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,390
Let's make a bet.

165
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,630
Do you think Xing Nan will confess?

166
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,320
We've created opportunities
to this point.

167
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,910
If he doesn't confess

168
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,250
he deserves to be single
for the rest of his life.

169
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,030
Happy Wedding.

170
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,750
Happy Wedding.

171
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,600
Such a gentleman.

172
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,120
Dr. Xing,

173
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,000
could it be that

174
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,910
you have an ulterior motive?

175
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,750
What ulterior motives can I have?

176
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,320
I just noticed how clumsy you are.

177
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,840
What crime did this cattle commit?

178
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,320
It was killed while alive.

179
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,475
Even in death, it has to
be cut into pieces by you.

180
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,240
I thought

181
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,480
you wanted to take this opportunity

182
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,790
to tell me something.

183
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,720
Well.

184
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,030
What do you want me to express?

185
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:14,840
Should you really
be asking this to a girl?

186
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,000
Ni Ning.

187
00:12:31,725 --> 00:12:33,200
Actually, I have never been in love.

188
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,670
All my relationship skills
and ways to seduce people

189
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,670
including...

190
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,200
Including the setup for today's proposal

191
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,510
are all that I read on Zhihu and Baidu.

192
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,080
I didn't know

193
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,630
how it felt to like somebody

194
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,000
until I met someone.

195
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,120
Thanks.

196
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,875
Whenever I see her, I blush
and my heart beats faster.

197
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,630
I would overthink her words.

198
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,360
And in my mind,

199
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,630
her figure frequently appears.

200
00:13:07,975 --> 00:13:09,320
Don't be afraid. Just look at her.

201
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,270
You're a veteran, Dr. Xing.

202
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,840
Can I interpret this

203
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,120
as you teasing me?

204
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,440
When you ride a motorcycle,

205
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,360
are you wearing a helmet?

206
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:28,630
When you are fighting,

207
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,300
would you get injured
from trying too hard?

208
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,240
I...

209
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,630
I searched on Zhihu and Baidu.

210
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,600
They say I like her.

211
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,120
That's right, Ni Ning.

212
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,670
I've fallen in love with you.

213
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:46,790
Didn't you ask me

214
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,360
if I wanted to express something to you?

215
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,030
I...

216
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,030
I'll admit it.

217
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,510
Actually, for myself,

218
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,070
there is a hurdle in my heart
that I have not been able to overcome.

219
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,910
In love,

220
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:58,270
I always feel like a loser.

221
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,750
So I always retreat at critical moments.

222
00:14:00,975 --> 00:14:02,120
I obviously like you very much.

223
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,270
I really want to be with you.

224
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,910
But I don't dare to tell you.

225
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,030
I could only use some clumsy techniques

226
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,080
to come near you.

227
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,270
Recently,

228
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:14,670
the things that happened between Wei
and Yuan Xia have reminded me

229
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,270
that meeting someone
you like is not easy.

230
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,375
Moreover, we can stay together
for a lifetime.

231
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,240
So,

232
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,270
I don't want my cowardice

233
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,440
to be the cause of missing you.

234
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,300
I would regret it for the rest
of my life.

235
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,630
Are you sure?

236
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,720
People like me

237
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,480
like excitement

238
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,910
and challenges.

239
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,960
I also like to keep pushing forward.

240
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,510
It is impossible for me

241
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,000
to retreat to the background willingly
for somebody's sake.

242
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,600
I will probably always be like this.

243
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,080
I will keep pushing forward.

244
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,000
And my life

245
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,840
will always be full of danger.

246
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,550
Feel free to charge forward.

247
00:15:04,975 --> 00:15:06,320
Don't forget what I do for a living.

248
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,960
If you get hurt, I will bandage it.

249
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,600
If you die, I will perform CPR on you.

250
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:10,960
Moreover,

251
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,200
didn't you say

252
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,790
that you always wanted to sleep with me?

253
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,840
Sure, I will let you sleep with me.

254
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,720
Are you crazy?

255
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,030
I'm not finished yet.

256
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,150
I don't accept a fling.

257
00:15:24,075 --> 00:15:25,850
I only accept official relationships.

258
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,840
Sure, you can sleep with me.

259
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,775
But you must be responsible for it.

260
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,440
Ni Ning.

261
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,320
I like you.

262
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,270
Would you like to be with me?

263
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,200
To be honest,

264
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,080
I never thought

265
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,630
I would be responsible for other lives.

266
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,320
Before this, when I was bored,

267
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,630
I thought about getting a pet.

268
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,720
But I'm afraid it will become
a burden to me.

269
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,120
I didn't dare to get one.

270
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,790
This was also the reason

271
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,630
I wanted to push you away before this.

272
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,390
Later,

273
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,550
it was the first time

274
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,480
somebody stopped my car

275
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,350
while I was on my way to my mission.

276
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,390
It was the first time

277
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,480
somebody blocked all the sunlight for me

278
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,750
after my mission ended

279
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,630
just so I could have a good sleep.

280
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,440
Maybe from then onwards,

281
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,910
I feel like the burden
has turned into worry.

282
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,240
I started to think that
this wasn't a bad feeling.

283
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:43,870
As for official relationship...

284
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,630
Xing Nan,

285
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,390
didn't you always say

286
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,910
Wei is always one step ahead of you
in everything he does?

287
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,790
Let me help you win once.

288
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:57,320
I have always been unruly.

289
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,480
You,

290
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,790
I want to sleep with you.

291
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,320
This certificate,

292
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,440
I will get it.

293
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,000
Let's get our certificate tomorrow.

294
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:10,640

Why aren't you talking?
What's that expression?

317
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:38,830
Young lady.

318
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,680
Let me have a few words with the bride.

319
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,510
Okay, you guys chat. Call me later.

320
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,270
What's up?

321
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,270
Acting all mysterious.

322
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,000
Say it.

323
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,790
Xing Nan and I...

324
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,000
Wow, you guys are fast!

325
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,940
(Certificate holder: Xing Nan.)
I didn't expect it either.

326
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,275
Yesterday, I was still a 'Miss.'

327
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,550
Today, I'm a 'Mrs.'

328
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,160
The world is truly ever-changing
and unpredictable.

329
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:19,110
Miss Ni, there is Mr. Xing
looking for you outside.

330
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,240
Okay.

331
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:24,110
Miss Ni, your Mr. Xing
is looking for you.

332
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,590
Stop making fun of me.

333
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:28,000
After today, you'll have a husband
who will call you every day.

334
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Go quickly.

335
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,110
Bye.

336
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,640
Are you nervous?

337
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:41,830
No. How could I be nervous?

338
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,960
Great.

339
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,960
What's the use of getting
an early start?

340
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,030
The important thing is
to seize the opportunity.

341
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,350
Overtaking at the corners.

342
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,920
The corners are the real test.

343
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,510
How is it?

344
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,450
I'm better than you this time, right?

345
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:55,960
Sure.

346
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,880
You are the best.

347
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,350
It's okay. Don't be nervous.

348
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,880
It will pass quickly.

349
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,680
It's almost time.

350
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:27,960
Why is it you?

351
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,830
Of course, it's me.

352
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:31,790
To be precise,

353
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,000
today was meant to

354
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,920
be the wedding
between you and me, right?

355
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,070
Where is Yuan Xia?

356
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,830
Yuan Xia...

357
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,550
She should be dying now.

358
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:26,960
Xing Nan.

359
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,030
Go to the dressing room.

360
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:28,750
Okay.

361
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,720
Wei Ziqi.

362
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,720
You must never abandon me.

363
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,440
Otherwise, I will be angry.

364
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,750
Take a closer look.

365
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,640
The person standing in front
of you now is me.

366
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,920
Xi Lin.

367
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,440
Today is our wedding.

368
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,830
Look at this scene.

369
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,790
This is exactly the wedding
of my dreams.

370
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,830
Then this will be the biggest nightmare
in my life.

371
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,550
Knowing you.

372
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:04,960
Being liked by you.

373
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,880
This is the scariest thing

374
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,400
I've encountered in my life.

375
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,240
Do you believe that I can kill
Yuan Xia right now?

376
00:22:15,425 --> 00:22:16,975
Then, I will destroy this phone again.

377
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,200
Let's see how will you save her then.

378
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,790
Didn't you try so hard to kill my father

379
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,070
just for this phone?

380
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,400
Now you want to destroy it?

381
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,480
Are you willing to do that?

382
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,720
It turns out you know everything.

383
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,720
My father has no grudges against you.

384
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:42,160
Why do you want to kill him?

385
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,400
Why?

386
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,240
Why?

387
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,310
Of course, it's because of you.

388
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,480
Mr. Heng.

389
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:54,590
Mr. Heng, get in the car.

390
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,200
Come on! Don't hesitate.

391
00:22:59,030 --> 00:22:59,830
Stop.

392
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,000
Don't run.

393
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,310
Xi Lin.

394
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,640
Why are you here?

395
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,440
I know my father has been
looking for you.

396
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,440
So, I came with him.

397
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,820
It's a coincidence that I met you.

398
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,110
Thank you, Xi Lin.

399
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:20,680
Xi Lin.

400
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,720
They can't catch up now.

401
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,110
Stop ahead.

402
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,240
Let me down.

403
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,640
Absolutely not, Mr. Heng.

404
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,440
It's too dangerous to let you down now.

405
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,960
I have to make sure you are unharmed
and send you to Ziqi.

406
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,310
Never tell Ziqi about this.

407
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,510
Xi Lin, you must not tell Ziqi.

408
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,270
Okay.

409
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,640
You should go home quickly too.

410
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,680
Don't let your father find out.

411
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,310
You might get implicated too.

412
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,310
Listen to me, Xi Lin.

413
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,110
Pull up in front.

414
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,590
Listen to me, Xi Lin.

415
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:06,720
Mr. Heng.

416
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:07,880
Mr. Heng.

417
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:09,400
Mr. Heng.

418
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,240
Has my father been looking for

419
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,240
a cell phone?

420
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,480
Can you just give it to him?

421
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,070
If you do, he will let you go.

422
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,240
Mr. Heng.

423
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,070
Xi Lin.

424
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:23,590
You didn't meet me by chance, right?

425
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,000
You and your dad are in cahoots.

426
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:30,550
You two acted out a scene to trick me.

427
00:24:30,675 --> 00:24:32,270
Tricking me into giving up my phone?

428
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,350
No, Mr. Heng.

429
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,440
Let me tell you.

430
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,510
I won't give my phone to anyone.

431
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,000
Mr. Heng, you really misunderstood me.

432
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,960
I'm really doing it for you and Ziqi.

433
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,880
I  don't want anything

434
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,830
between you and my father

435
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,270
to affect my relationship with Ziqi.

436
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,270
Don't mention Ziqi anymore.

437
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,750
I do not have a phone.

438
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,880
Mr. Heng, just listen to me.

439
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,640
I don't have a phone.

440
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,070
Please.

441
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:48,640
No phone.

442
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,270
I beg you.

443
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,070
No, I don't have it.

444
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:50,720
Please.

445
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,625
I do not have a phone...

446
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,000
Mr. Heng.

447
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,590
Mr. Heng, can you hear me?

448
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,270
Mr. Heng.

449
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,000
Medicine.

450
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,240
Mr. Heng, where's the cell phone?

451
00:25:05,475 --> 00:25:07,620
Just give it to my father
and everything will be fine.

452
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,110
Mr. Heng.

453
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,200
What happened?

454
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,240
I only wanted to get the cell phone.

455
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,030
Why did this happen?

456
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,110
Ziqi.

457
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,920
Dad, Ziqi will definitely hate me.

458
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,030
What should I do?

459
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:46,550
Lin.

460
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,200
None of this
has anything to do with you.

461
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:50,110
You have never seen

462
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:52,110
everything that happened here today.

463
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:52,920
Dad!

464
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,000
What if I killed someone?

465
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,590
I am here.

466
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,200
What to do?

467
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,440
You'll be fine.

468
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:00,920
Get out of here right now.

469
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,960
Go abroad for two years.

470
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,070
Leave the rest to me.

471
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,790
Trust me.

472
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,000
When you come back,

473
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,350
everything

474
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,790
will be the same as before.

475
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:13,880
I will never let Wei Ziqi

476
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,880
know this matter.

477
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,200
Trust me.

478
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:35,160
If Xi Kun hadn't insisted
on sending me abroad,

479
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,160
the person accompanying you
during those dark days

480
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,000
wouldn't be Yuan Xia, but me!

481
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,790
The one standing next to you now

482
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,830
also wouldn't be Yuan Xia, but me!

483
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,600
Xi Kun got sick.

484
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:46,470
He surrendered himself
and took the blame for me.

485
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,960
That's his due diligence.

486
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,590
(These flowers are fake.)

487
00:27:05,425 --> 00:27:07,000
(The air conditioner is not on either.)

488
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,830
(Everything went according to plan.)

489
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,590
(This time, we will definitely get
the evidence of Xi Lin's crime.)

490
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,030
(How long has it been?)

491
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,550
(Why hasn't Xing Nan come yet?)

492
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,125
Yuan Xia.

493
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,160
How are you?

494
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:26,880
I'm fine.

495
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,350
Ni Ning.

496
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:31,510
Shouldn't you go to Wei Ziqi?

497
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,160
Where is Dr. Xing?

498
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,070
Forget it.

499
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:37,310
I was trapped in the corridor just now.

500
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,510
After I came out,

501
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:40,325
I found that I couldn't contact
Xing Nan at all.

502
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,240
So I came over to have a look.

503
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:43,750
Where is Xi Lin?

504
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,440
She is at the wedding scene.

505
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,030
(The wedding scene?)

506
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,790
(She should have run away
after trapping me here.)

507
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,250
(Why did she go to the scene again?)

508
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,510
(Scene. Ziqi!)

509
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,680
(Not only does she want to kill me,
she wants to kill...)

510
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,440
Open the door!

511
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:59,480
Quick, Ni Ning!

512
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,750
Open the door quickly!

513
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,680
Ni Ning, Ziqi is in danger!

514
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,440
Let me remind you again.

515
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,680
Without this phone,

516
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:09,880
Yuan Xia's death

517
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,920
will be set in stone forever.

518
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,550
Xi Lin.

519
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,310
At this point,

520
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,400
there is no need
to threaten me with Yuan Xia.

521
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,350
She is not the person you want to kill.

522
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,030
Am I right?

523
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,590
That's right.

524
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:45,200
From the moment I received
the dual space-time call,

525
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,960
I knew that you set this up

526
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,750
to bait me into killing Yuan Xia.

527
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:54,200
But just when I confessed to you,

528
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:58,030
I saw clearly that in your eyes.

529
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,400
There is no me at all, only Yuan Xia.

530
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,400
My hatred for Yuan Xia

531
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,200
will be passed on to you.

532
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:05,640
Xi Lin.

533
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,550
I really regret meeting you.

534
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,200
If it weren't for you,

535
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,880
my father wouldn't have died either.

536
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:14,160
Yuan Xia wouldn't be wandering
on the edge of life and death.

537
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,440
As you wish, Wei Ziqi.

538
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,550
The person I hate and want to kill
the most right now is not Yuan Xia.

539
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,350
It's you.

540
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:26,790
Growing up,

541
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,640
I could get whatever I wanted.

542
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,200
But you.

543
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,310
I tried my best to find ways
to please you,

544
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,270
but you wouldn't even look at me!

545
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:36,750
You trampled my pride hard
on the soles of your feet.

546
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,200
Now,

547
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,720
I want you

548
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,240
to feel it as well.

549
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,880
The trampling that I felt.

550
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,590
Ziqi!

551
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,160
Yuan Xia!

552
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,310
Yuan Xia!

553
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,590
Wei Ziqi.

554
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:18,240
This knife was my birthday present

555
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,110
to you which you refused!

556
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:22,270
I've said it before.

557
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:24,240
You'll be fine.

558
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,960
You will regret this.

559
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,000
Yuan Xia, I'm here. You'll be okay.

560

I thought that after Yuan Xia left,

593
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,440
he would do something stupid
in these few months.

594
00:32:05,775 --> 00:32:08,160
But other than being a little broken in
the first few days,

595
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,880
he seems too calm the rest
of the time.

00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,830

he would follow Yuan Xia's wishes
