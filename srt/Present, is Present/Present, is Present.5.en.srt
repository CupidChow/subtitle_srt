(An individual won millions but failed
to show up to claim the prize.)

3
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,160
Look.

4
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,320
It's stained with your blood!

5
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,960
You soiled the lottery ticket!

6
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,759
After the board meeting tomorrow,

7
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:36,960
we'll discuss the proper compensation.

8
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:38,520
Who asked me to be such a busybody?

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,960
I can only accept my bad luck.

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,479
(MU's new PR manager.)

11
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:42,520
(Don't resign from MU.)

00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,560
(Don't leave Wei Ziqi.)

13
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,799
(Doesn't it look familiar to you?)

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,719
This parrot looks just like the one
I had when I was little.

15
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,560
How did you not recognize it?

16
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,759
(I actually have)

(MU, a leading communications technology
company, has changed its chairman.)

25
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,400
Quite the spectacle.

26

His love life goes everywhere.

27
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,159
He's quite good-looking.

28
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,560
Too bad he's a scumbag.

29
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,319
(Rumors go viral!)
A rich Casanova with no shame.

30
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,149
Despicable businessman.

31
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,800
(Two Double C ladies fight)
Such a douche.

32
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,200

00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:55,560

34
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,960
But they're suddenly trending again.

35
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,840
Someone is clearly
targeting our company,

36
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,080
challenging our PR Department.

37
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,759
Yuan Xia, calm yourself. Take a seat.

38
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,120
No thanks. Just get to business.

39
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:05,680
Whatever your plan is, I'll cooperate.

40
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,879
Mr. Wei, I want you
to answer me truthfully.

41
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,479
What's really going on
with you, Cici, and Coco?

42
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,710
You seem to care a lot about them.

43
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,879
Obviously!

44
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:17,759
All the articles are talking about them.

45
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,960
Here's the plan. Ask them out.

46
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:21,919
Okay.

47
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,940
=Episode 5=
(Girlfriend? Girlfriend!)

48
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,960
Later, when Ms. Yuan gets here,

49
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,719
I want you to remember
these three points.

50
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:30,840
One,

51
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,759
clarify that there's no secret affection
among the three of us.

52
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:34,360
Two,

53
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,485
give your full cooperation
to Ms. Yuan's PR strategy.

54
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:37,599
Three,

55
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:41,319
I hope you'll read the air better.

56
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:43,280
Give me and her some alone time.

57
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:44,560
Got it?

58
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:48,639
Check this out.

59
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:51,319
The flavor is quite good.
I ate it a lot.

60
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,719
Lili told me before.

61
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,680
This place...

62
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:17,750
It's been two years since we last met.

63
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:18,639
Why?

64
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,560
Aren't you going to acknowledge
my being back?

65
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,639
This is a gift I specifically
picked out for you

66
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:29,319
from a pre-loved shop in Europe.

67
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,920
Here, how do you like it?

68
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:37,680
Cici.

69
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,279
Send a gift to the young lady,

70
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,800
to welcome her back.

71
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:48,560
Welcome back, Ms. Xi.

72
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,920
Clear-out fee.

73
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,319
Check the amount. Is it enough?

74
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:01,920
Take it and leave.

75
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:04,959
Thanks, Ms. Xi.

76
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:05,639
Wait a minute.

77
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,160
Cici, Coco, you two...

78
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:11,639
Ziqi.

79
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,680
I'm not being critical.

80
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,680
I mean,

81
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,480
what's the matter with your tastes?

82
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:22,920
Those two just bow?

83
00:05:23,057 --> 00:05:24,680
What kind of subpar standard is that?

84
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,720
I could barely hold it in.

85
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,519
Sure. Go on and introduce
some good ones to me, then.

86
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:32,560
I can do that.

87
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,920
Let's make it tonight.

88
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:36,519
We'll have dinner.

89
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:39,279
I will formally introduce myself to you.

90
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:41,639
Thank you.

91
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,439
Xi Lin.

92
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,519
I told you long ago.

93
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:51,560
You're not the type I like.

94
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,360
So please stop wasting your time on me.

95
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,079
That's okay.

96
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,399
I like you.

97
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,759
It's not your business,

98
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:02,720
but my own.

99
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,120
One day, you'll realize

100
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:07,480
that I'm the best match for you.

101
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,680
Don't forget.

102
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,560
You and I grew up together.

103
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,428
The way you act in front of people...

104
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,680
People might misunderstand

105
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,879
but don't think I was fooled.

106
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,519
Besides,

107
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:21,199
if you're really turning me down,

108
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,120
then please,
get yourself a real lady partner.

109
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:26,319
I'm not going to give way

110
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,519
to some ditzy, glamour girls.

111
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,959
I'm not that dumb.

112
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,519
Who said I didn't have one?

113
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,160
I'm waiting for
my dearest beloved right now.

114
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:36,399
Dearest beloved?

115
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,360
Don't tell me
that's your dearest beloved...

116
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,920
Have you been waiting long?

117
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,000
Sorry, I'm late. The traffic was bad.

118
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,560
Are you...

119
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,800
What?

120
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,360
There's someone else here.

121
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,319
Aren't you going to introduce us?

122
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,120
She is Xi Lin.

123
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:03,000
Xi Lin, this is Yuan Xia.

124
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,759
She is my...

125
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,279
I'm Ziqi's girlfriend.

126
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:07,240
Girlfriend?

127
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,399
Those two barely left,

128
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,959
and here's another one.

129
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:15,079
Ziqi, even if you're pretending,

130
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:17,319
at least do a better job at it.

131
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,959
Those scenes from idol dramas
won't cut it.

132
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,279
I'm talking about
simply finding a stray

133
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:24,639
and making up
a contractual relationship.

134
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,319
You really think I have a negative IQ?

135
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,680
The two girls just now?

136
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,160
Coco and Cici? I know them.

137
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:34,399
Actually, I was the one who asked Ziqi

138
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,920
to organize this gathering.

139
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:38,279
I wanted Ziqi to ask them out

140
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:40,120
so he could clear things up.

141
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,519
But I certainly did not expect

142
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,720
to have another surprise guest like you,

143
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,160
Ms. Xi.

144
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,240
Ziqi.

145
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:01,199
Your props need to be improved.

146
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,399
What is this?

147
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,879
You won't even spend money
to buy your girlfriend

148
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,759
some nice shoes?

149
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,199
That's... I...

150
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,480
I didn't let him buy.

151
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:18,040
I'm quite superstitious.

152
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,480
Gifting shoes has a bad connotation.

153
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,959
Like you're sending someone off,
like breaking up.

154
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,040
It's not very nice.

155
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:26,519
Besides, you know what?

156
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,439
I've mentioned it to him a few times

157
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,680
about wanting to quit.

158
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,199
But he just wouldn't agree.

159
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:33,519
I guess he can't be without me.

160
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,519
You are from MU Communications?

161
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,200
Yuan Xia is my assistant.

162
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,559
She wanted to keep it private

163
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,159
because having a workplace relationship

164
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,320
can get tricky.

165
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:55,159
Alright.

166
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
My dad is holding
a welcome-back party for me

167
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,120
at our hotel in a few days.

168
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:02,600
If you two are free,

169
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:04,679
why don't you bring her along, Ziqi?

170
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:08,679
Do you want to go?

171
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:12,639
It's up to you.

172
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:13,879
See you on the day, then.

173
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,919
Okay.

174
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:18,840
Let's go.

175
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,840
Okay.

176
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,480
Your arm...

177
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,799
Wait a little.

178
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,879
Boss, what the heck was that?

179
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:33,159
Give me my bag. Thanks.

180
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:35,320
I was playing along with you.

181
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,559
It's because you said
you're my girlfriend.

182
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:39,440
That's because the actor I hired

183
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,720
couldn't make it last minute.

184
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,559
That's why I had to do it myself.

185
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:44,440
I had asked the actor

186
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,960
to pretend to be your fiancée.

187
00:09:45,971 --> 00:09:47,150
If they didn't believe it,

188
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:48,480
then she'd say that she was pregnant.

189
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,879
If Cici and Coco refused to cooperate,

190
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:53,000
then we'd have to resort
to moral coercion.

191
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,399
But...

192
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,120
You acted the part well.

193
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,679
If you need an upgrade,

194
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:04,519
I'm willing and ready.

195
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:06,080
The expectant dad, right? I can learn.

196
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,919
Alright, enough jokes.

197
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,480
Anyway, with Xi Lin,

198
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:13,320
you have to be extra careful.

199
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,559
She's at least 10 times scarier

200
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:16,519
than Cici or Coco.

201
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,200
Give me a second, sir.

202
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:21,200
Xi Lin.

203
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,869
No wonder the name rings a bell.

204
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,371
She's the genius violinist

205
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,428
(Xi Lin, Certification: Violinist)
with millions of followers.

206
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,039
Also,

207
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,879
I think she's the daughter
of Hill Capital.

208
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,519
Boss, I think

209
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:37,320
you two make a great pair.

210
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,759
If you two become a couple,

211
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:40,080
not only will it help resolve

212
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,320
the current PR crisis,

213
00:10:41,428 --> 00:10:43,360
but it can also change your image
of a libertine

214
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,559
and solve the company's
financial problems.

215
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:49,559
Are you suggesting

216
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,390
that it's not enough for me
to be a two-timer,

217
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:53,120
so you're adding a third?

218
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:55,960
Okay, I get it.

219
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,320
Seems like Xi Lin

220
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,260
didn't come back at all
in the past three years.

221
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,879
I can't possibly tell the world

222
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:03,360
that my boss and Xi Lin
were having an online relationship.

223
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,679
That's too unbelievable.

224
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:08,519
Moreover, Xi Lin has more male fans.

225
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,740
Sir. I really don't think
you should mess with her.

226
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:12,559
Forget it.

227
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:13,519
Yuan Xia.

228
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:17,200
You're the head of PR right now.

229
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,799
And you gave the idea

230
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:20,159
about the girlfriend.

231
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,960
So it's your responsibility and duty

232
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,399
to fix the problem.

233
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:24,519
Also,

234
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,085
there's another reason why
I accepted the invitation

235
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:28,879
to her welcome-back party.

236
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,080
You want Hill Capital to invest?

237
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,879
That's a big fish.

238
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:50,799
Fine.

239
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,960
Only this once. No next time.

240
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,720
No problem.

241
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:55,919
Consider it as a field trip.

242
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:57,600
It won't be for free.

243
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,440
The company will reimburse
the preparation fee.

244
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,080
Come on.

245
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:01,080
Hey.

246
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:02,320
I...

247
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,360
How did I end up agreeing?

248
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,519
Boss!

249
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,159
No, no, no.

250
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:47,720
The back is too exposed.

251
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:52,559
Try another dress.

That's the one. Bill it.

Sure thing. Please wait a moment.

258
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:27,879
How much is the dress?

259
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:28,720
56,000.

260
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,000
Boss.

261
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,510
I think we should change stores.

262
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:33,759
This is way overpriced.

263
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:35,759

Don't throw the tag away.

274
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,080
I can put this on Xianyu later on
[*Second-hand goods trading platform]

275
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,480
and make a profit.

276
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,080
You're here to help me.

277
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,600
I will make up

278
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:13,720
the extra amount.

279
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,519
Alright?

280
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:19,320
There.

281
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,519
It looks wonderful.

282
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:24,200
Wonderful indeed.

283
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,039
It's as if

284
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:26,960
the dress was custom-made for Ms. Yuan.

285
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,360
You're glowing in it.

286
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,600
Also, those heels.

287
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,159
They're a perfect fit too.

288
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,600
Yes, it does look nice.

289
00:14:33,542 --> 00:14:34,670
(It has a bad connotation.)

290
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:36,879
Like you're sending someone away,
like breaking up.

291
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:38,120
It's not very nice.

292
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,120
Hang on.

293
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,399
About the heels,

294
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:44,919
we'll pass, okay?

295
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,799
Why?

296
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:54,879
It's a lot over the budget.

297
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:57,480
If you like them,
you have to pay for them yourself.

298
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,120
Why should I?

299
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,879
I think if you wear your white sneakers,

300
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:02,879
you'll look equally good.

301
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:04,320
Why don't we wear these?

302
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:07,759
Have you seen anyone wear white sneakers

303
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:08,879
with such a nice gown?

304
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:09,799
I doubt you have.

305
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:11,240
You can't see them anyway.

306
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:11,879
Just wear these.

307
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:13,440
I can totally see them.

308
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:15,320
It's so obvious.

309
00:15:16,657 --> 00:15:17,720
Are you going to switch?

310
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,519
No.

311
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:24,679
We're buying the whole look.

312
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:29,120
Excuse us, please.

313
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,519
Sure.

314
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,200
Boss, buy the dress and the heels.

315
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,080
Come here.

316
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,159
Imagine going up and down the stairs

317
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,559
to run errands for me.

318
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,080
It'd be a hassle.

319
00:15:57,514 --> 00:15:58,320
The other foot.

320
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,600
I... can do it myself.

321
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:03,879
I'll have to deduct your pay
if you delay.

322
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,080
Let me see.

323
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,320
Perfect combination.

324
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,120
Come, stand up.

325
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:25,640
Not bad.

326
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,640
Very nice.

327
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,680
Yes, it was.

328
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,440
Ziqi, you two are here.

329
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,240
It's your fault.

330
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,599
We're late for the party.

331
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:43,559
Yes, it's my fault.

332
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:44,799
Xi Lin.

333
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,240
Yuan Xia prepared this specially

334
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,079
for your return.

335
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:49,000
Welcome back.

336
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:50,160
Thank you.

337
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,599
How nice of you, Yuan Xia.

338
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,400
Here.

339
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,440
Ms. Xi.

340
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,880
The hotel prepared
this special cake for you.

341
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,519
Yuan Xia.

342
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:03,599
That's our hotel signature.

343
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,240
Could I ask you to cut the cake with me?

344
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:10,160
Sorry.

345
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:13,240
Yuan Xia is allergic to bell flowers.

346
00:19:13,342 --> 00:19:14,830
Sorry, she can't cut the cake with you.

347
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:15,960
I'm fine.

348
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,640
Is that so?

349
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:22,880
Sorry about that.

350
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,720
Isn't Wei Ziqi's plus-one

351
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,279
his former assistant?

352
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,400
It is her.

353
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:30,599
Xi Lin got herself
a formidable opponent.

354
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,310
That woman managed
to keep a rein on Wei Ziqi

355
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:34,039
and even got him to stand up for her.

356
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,839
I bet she's got some tricks.

357
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:37,599
She totally looks like a gold digger.

358
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,400
I don't get it.

359
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,960
What does Wei Ziqi see in that woman?

360
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,599
Yeah.

361
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,480
Were you people discussing

362
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,200
why I chose to be with Yuan Xia?

363
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,599
Even though the question in itself
is problematic?

364
00:19:56,839 --> 00:19:58,240
What you should be asking is

365
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,680
why a great woman like Yuan Xia

366
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,279
chose to be with me.

367
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:04,240
Aside from a little luck,

368
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,880
and a pretty good family background,

369
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,839
I don't have many other traits.

370
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:10,160
Also,

371
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,839
you all commented
on Yuan Xia's love for money

372
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:17,079
in a condescending manner.

373
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,599
I'd like to ask you guys.

374
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:22,160
Do you love money?

375
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:24,039
Do you love money?

376
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,640
Sure you guys love money.

377
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,240
So do I.

378
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:27,839
Stop talking.

379
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:28,519
It's alright.

380
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:33,960
But apart from living like parasites,

381
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:36,200
eating and drinking and using stuff

382
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,109
from our families,

383
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,485
which one of you actually made one penny
with your own hands?

384
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:44,359
Who has run to catch the 8 AM bus?

385
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,559
Who has stayed up late working
for their livelihood?

386
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:49,039
Only Yuan Xia did.

387
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:50,599
Every penny she made

388
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,039
was earned with her own effort.

389
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:58,240
So what right do we have to judge her?

390
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,000
Of course.

391
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:05,400
I too, wish she was as you people said,

392
00:21:05,685 --> 00:21:06,880
that she was after my money,

393
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,279
liked my status.

394
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,440
That would make me feel lighter,

395
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,640
and less of a burden.

396
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:18,759
But that's not true.

397
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,799
As a couple,

398
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:24,880
I'm the one who's reaching out to her.
I'm undeserving of her.

399
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,240
So,

400
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,279
do be mindful of what you say and do.

401
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:33,440
If because of your nonsense

402
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,240
and the girlfriend I worked
so hard to get dumps me,

403
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,640
who knows what I'd resort to?

404
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,160
Today, allow me to formally introduce
to you all.

405
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:47,839
This is my girlfriend,

406
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,759
Yuan Xia.

407
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,240
Xi Lin.

408
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,079
I'm sorry for ruining the mood.

409
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:15,359
We'll skip the cake-cutting ceremony.

410
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:17,390
I'm going to take her outside
for some fresh air.

411
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,240
You guys enjoy it.

412
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,039
Ziqi...

413
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,160
I'm sorry, Yuan Xia.

414
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,839
It's okay.

415
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,599
I mean everything I said just now.

416
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:58,240
You mean it?

417
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:02,079
Yuan Xia.

418
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:05,599
I owe you a formal apology.

419
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,960
I'm sorry for the things
that happened before.

420
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:10,559
Of course,

421
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:12,640
you can choose not to forgive me.

422
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,759
I just hope

423
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,240
that you won't be affected
by what happened.

424
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,440
I've told you.

425
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,559
The past has been written off.

426
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,160
I meant it.

427
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:30,599
Thank you, Yuan Xia.

428
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,759
I should thank you too.

429
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,839
There's no point dwelling on the past.

430
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,039
It's better to live in the present.

431
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:40,319
Mr. Xi.

432
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,742
- Hello, Mr. Xi.
- Good day, Mr. Xi.

433
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:44,599
Long time no see, Mr. Xi.

434
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:45,319
Hello, hello.

435
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:46,599
Mr. Xi, it's been a while.

436
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,640
Long time no see.

437
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:48,680
Long time no see.

438
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,680
- Hi, Mr. Xi.
- Mr. Xi.

439
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,599
Good day, everyone.

440
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:52,400
Long time no see.

441
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:53,400
Mr. Xi.

442
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,240
Long time no see.

443
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,000
Is that Xi Kun,
the chairman of Hill Capital?

444
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,240
And the main reason why you came?

445
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,200
Yes.

446
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,480
I'm going to have a chat with him.

447
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,759
Wait for me here.

448
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:08,079
Things were going well a moment ago.

449
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,759
What's wrong? Who made you upset?

450
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,000
Dad.

451
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:16,039
I think Ziqi

452
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:18,680
really has a girlfriend.

453
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:23,880
That's good.

454
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:25,200
That'll save you

455
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:26,839
from thinking about him all day long.

456
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,640
Dad, how could you say that?

457
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:30,880
I've told you before.

458
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:32,200
You two are not suited

459
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:34,119
for each other.

460
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,240
Dad.

461
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:36,680
I'm telling you right now,

462
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,240
I will not give up no matter what.

463
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:38,759
Mr. Xi.

464
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:39,680
You have to support me.

465
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:41,240
Long time no see.

466
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,039
You finally show yourself, lad.

467
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:47,759
I've been looking for you

468
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,400
since I got here.

469
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,160
What a coincidence.

470
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:52,400
I happened to have something
to discuss with you too.

471
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,000
Then why don't we go somewhere quiet

472
00:24:58,228 --> 00:24:59,200
and sit down for a chat?

473
00:24:59,200 --> 00:24:59,920
Okay.

474
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:03,359
Is that alright?

475
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:06,160
You go ahead, Dad.

476
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,400
This way.

477
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,240
Cheers.

478
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,799
Yuan Xia.

479
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,720
Xi Lin.

480
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,839
To be able to make Ziqi do that for you?

481
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,920
I must say I'm impressed.

482
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:45,160
Thank you.

483
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,000
To be frank,
if Wei Ziqi wasn't in the picture,

484
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,759
I reckon

485
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,880
you and I would be good friends.

486
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,240
Xi Lin.

487
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:56,839
Your performance just now was terrific.

488
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:58,000
As your adoring fan,

489
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,880
can I have a photo with you
to post on Weibo?

490
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:00,920
Sure.

491
00:26:02,942 --> 00:26:04,160
Can you take the photo for us?

492
00:26:11,342 --> 00:26:13,510
I also graduated
from the Vienna Music Conservatory.

493
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:14,319
Speaking of which,

494
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:14,960
I suppose

495
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,559
we are both Fritz Kreisler's juniors.

496
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:17,440
Fritz Kreisler

497
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,039
is my favorite violinist.

498
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,085
It's too bad.
Heaven is jealous of heroic geniuses.

499
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,960
Don't be standing there. Crouch down.

500
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,839
Step back a bit, will you?

501
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:29,680
You're going to make my legs look short.

502
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:34,960
First of all,

503
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,000
you should have some manners
when asking someone for help.

504
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,559
- Secondly...
- Secondly.

505
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,342
You should know
how your legs actually look.

506
00:26:42,371 --> 00:26:44,000
What do you care
about being photographed?

507
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,480
You're going to edit the photo anyway.

508
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:47,400
And, here's a piece of advice.

509
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:48,960
Next time you wish
to cozy up to someone,

510
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,559
it's best you do some homework first.

511
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,599
You're not fooling anyone
by simply spouting names.

512
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:53,960
Fritz Kreisler

513
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,880
did graduate
from the Vienna Conservatory,

514
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,640
yes.

515
00:26:56,839 --> 00:26:58,680
But he lived till 87 years old.

516
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,000
In that era, he certainly wasn't
a victim of heaven's jealousy.

517
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:04,359
I only asked for a photo together.

518
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:05,720
Forget it
if it's not convenient.

519
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,720
It's not like I actually wanted
the photo with you.

520
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,480
She's Wei Ziqi's girlfriend, right?

521
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:12,200
I only did this so you could vent
your frustration.

522
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:14,079
I thought you liked Wei Ziqi.

523
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,279
You?

524
00:27:16,828 --> 00:27:18,114
Who do you think you are?

525
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:19,319
Also,

526
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,920
who are you anyway?

527
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,000
Did I invite you?

528
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:25,960
Shall I spell it out for you?

529
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:28,599
I'm asking you to leave.

530
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:41,960
I must say now, you've impressed me.

531
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:45,480
I admit it.

532
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,000
I like Wei Ziqi.

533
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:48,519
But I will not use

534
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:49,839
such cheap tricks.

535
00:27:50,028 --> 00:27:52,600
Whatever it is I wanted,
I've always gotten it fair and square.

536
00:27:52,857 --> 00:27:54,590
Besides, it's not like
you two are married.

537
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:56,359
I'm okay with him
playing around some more.

538
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,589
So long as he ends up in my possession.

539
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,714
That's all that matters.

540
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:04,480
I have an important call to take.

541
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:07,599
Go ahead.

542
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,240
Don't say anything.

543
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,440
First, answer my questions.

544
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,000
Okay, go on.

545
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,000
I remember you telling me over the phone

546
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,759
to not go to a certain place.

547
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,839
In the next year where you are,

548
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:52,880
did something happen to me?

549
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:53,880
Yes.

550
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,519
Then, where did it happen?

551
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,000
December 31st, 2024.

552
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:02,240
Lakeside Hotel.

553
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,599
Lakeside Hotel?

554
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,960
That's where I am right now.

555
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:11,079
Whatever it is,

556
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:13,079
you must leave that place right now.

557
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:13,880
Okay.

558
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:16,720
Your death is likely related
to this dual space-time phone.

559
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,440
So you mustn't let anyone know

560
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,680
about the phone's existence.

561
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:21,400
Remember, no one can know.

562
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,885
(Why did the connection break again?)

563
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,257
(It disconnected.)

564
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:35,640
You.

565
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,240
You almost tricked me.

566
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:41,839
I had given you the hint

567
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,000
to come to me directly
if you're in any trouble.

568
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,079
But what did you do?

569
00:29:45,685 --> 00:29:47,350
You went and shouldered it all yourself.

570
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:50,200
At last, you even stopped
all contact with me.

571
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:51,599
Sorry about that, Mr. Xi.

572
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,599
I was being watched.

573
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:54,839
I couldn't tell you.

574
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,920
Why are you following me?

575
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,000
Ms. Yuan, you're mistaken.

576
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,160
I'm with Concierge.

577
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,680
I helped Mr. Wei park his car.

578
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:20,599
This is the path we take
to retrieve the guest's car.

579
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,240
I'm sorry.

580
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,000
It's okay.

581
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,279
Do you need your car?

582
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:26,400
I can get the key for you.

583
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:29,400
Thank you.

584
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,480
Sure. I'll be right back.

585
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:35,039
Say,

586
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,440
how happy your dad would be

587
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,400
if he saw you now?

588
00:30:45,571 --> 00:30:46,640
Let's not talk about that.

589
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,440
I heard you're restarting
the quantum communication experiments

590
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,000
to fulfill your father's last wish.

591
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,839
As his closest friend,

592
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,359
I'm afraid I won't be of much help.

593
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,839
If you're lacking in funding,
let me know.

594
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:04,359
I'll cover it.

595
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,000
Thank you, Mr. Xi.

596
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,000
Your words have reassured me.

597
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:27,820
(Calling Mr. Wei)

598
00:31:30,285 --> 00:31:31,342
(Where are you?)

599
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:33,142
(I had to leave first
because something came up.)

600
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,142
(Calling Mr. Wei)
(Wei Ziqi, pick up the phone.)

601
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:06,000
(What is Zhou Wei doing here?)

602
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,599
(He must be here for Wei Ziqi.)

603
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:13,960
(No, I have to get to him.)

604
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,039
Thanks a lot for today, Mr. Xi.

605
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:27,240
I will ask our Legal Department
to prepare the contract right away.

606
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,000
Alright, I'll be waiting.

607
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,519
Well then, sir. I shall...

608
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,039
Go on.

609
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,000
Enjoy yourself.

610
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,720
Sure thing.

611
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:49,599
Hello, Mr. Xi.

612
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:50,960
Have you seen Wei Ziqi?

613
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,559
You are?

614
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,000
I'm Wei Ziqi's girlfriend.

615
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,200
Ziqi?

616
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:57,640
He just left.

617
00:32:57,839 --> 00:32:59,079
I think he went looking for you.

618
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,759
Thanks, Mr. Xi.

619
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,640
So that's Wei Ziqi's girlfriend?

620
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,000
Find someone
to look into her background.

621
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,839
I'm curious to know

622
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,279
how exactly
she's better than my daughter.

623
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:12,160
Yes, sir.

624
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:29,857
(15 Missed calls, Yuan Xia.
New message from Yuan Xia)

625
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,880
(Where are you?)

626
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,828
(I had to leave first
because something came up.)

627
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:58,000
Mr. Wei, are you leaving?

628
00:33:59,485 --> 00:34:01,590
This is a memento Ms. Xi
has prepared for the guests.

629
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,000
This one is for your partner, Ms. Yuan.

630
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,720
Would you like to take it together,

631
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,839
or should I pass it to her

632
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:07,680
when she's leaving?

633
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,559
She hasn't left?

634
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:12,800
Don't blame me for killing you.

635
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,800
Blame it on Wei Ziqi.

636
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,440
He put me in this sordid state.
