00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,880
One month ago, 

2
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,980
my workplace was insanely exploitive, 

3
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:21,870
so I quit the job 

4
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,590
as I was never treated like a human being.

[ Rejection of Employment E-mails ]

6
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:33,950
Now I have no job. 

7
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,970
I can't pay rent or my phone bill. 

8
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,900
Even my student loan payments are in trouble. 

9
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,520
I just want to disappear. 

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,610
- Ya-ho!
- Hey!

11
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,970
- Join us!
- It's carefree here!

12
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,650
They look like they're having fun. 

13
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,670
That might actually work. 

14
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,370
Ah, I got one.

I-I'm Kanako Nishino! 

18
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,300
I worked at a small ad agency. 

19
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,770
I am experienced at sales, admin, errands, cleaning, 

20
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,230
and organizing company parties... 

21
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:30,940
Hey.

22
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,650
You do realize we're an assassin agency, right? 

23
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,400
Can you even kill someone? 

24
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:43,430
No way! No way! Get otter here! 

25
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,690
Wait, an assassin? 

26
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,020
You mean, like, an actual killer? 

27
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:48,400
What do you mean? 

28
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,770
But it's an agency, right? 

29
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:50,830
Oh... 

30
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,610
"Agency" as in killing on behalf of someone? 

31
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,230
You did manage to track us down. 

32
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,830
So clearly you've got some skills. 

33
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,870
What?! 

34
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,800
My job hunting was a total disaster. 

35
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,690
So I even applied to shady websites?! 

36
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,600
No, no, no, no snail way! 

37
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,200
I'll turn down. I'm leaving. 

38
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,730
President, why are you running an assassin agency? 

39
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,510
I finally escaped an exploitive company... 

40
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,700
And this is even shadier and not a normal company! 

41
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,770
I'm sorry but I have to say no. I'm sorry. 

42
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,470
Um, in the end...

43
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,550

Full social insurance. 

48
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,470
And, of course, pension benefits. 

49
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,000
You in? 

50
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,640

51
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,950

52
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:34,690

This is your entrance test. 

56
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,860
Shoot the target with this. 

57
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,600
Huh? 

58
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,330
Wait, what? 

59
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,100
No, no, no, no snail way!  

60
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,420
There's no way I can kill someone! 

61
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:54,770
Yeah.

62
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,100
I looked into you. 

63
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,270
Kanako Nishino. 

64
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,650
Your father died of an illness when you were eight. 

65
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,480
Your mother works at a local supermarket in the fried foods section. 

66
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,050
You even know that? 

67
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,270
After graduating from university, 

68
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,470
you got a job at an ad agency. 

69
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:12,110
But you boss there abused you terribly.  

70
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,420
And in your third year, you quit. 

71
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,270
And your target is your former boss. 

72
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,530
What? 

73
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,020
You really put up with that for three years? 

74
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:37,800
Apparently, there were others who ended up depressed and killed themselves because of him.

75
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,480
Well, at least quitting was the worst that happened to you.  

76
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,020
You've already shot him? 

77
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,400
Sorry! 

78
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,560
My finger slipped! 

79
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,000
I wasn't supposed to shoot yet, was I? 

80
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,350
I'll redo it! 

81
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,290
Ah, but I already shot him! 

82
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,400
Alright, I'll just shoot the one over there! 

83
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,350
Not bad. 

84
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,390
Alright. 

85
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,800
Time for a welcome party.

86
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,810
A welcome party? 

87
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,200
No way! 

88
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,060
After killing someone, 
a welcome party is just insane!  

89
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,360
Cheers!

90
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,270
Boss? Boss! A toast!

91
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,430
Ah, let's wait for this.

92
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,060
Cheers!

93
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:31,870
Boss! Who knew alcohol could taste this good after killing someone?! 

94
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,480
Flap meat. 

95
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,200
Whoa... 

96
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,050
I feel so strangely refreshed! 

97
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:42,810
Excuse me!

98
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:43,970
Excuse me! I'd like to order!

99
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:44,990
Yes? Yes?

100
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,150
I'll go buy beer. 

101
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,750
I'll buy one. 

102
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,440
A beer and premium highball, please! 

103
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,470
- Yes!
- Understood. 

104
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,450
Rump cap. 

105
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:00,940
Boss! 

106
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:04,930
I'll do my best as an assassin! 

107
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,000
The rump cap is so good!

108
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,160
Being an assassin is awesome!

109
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,850
Don't say that out loud. 

110
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:19,020
I will say these...

111
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,950
"I quit." 

112
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,650

Yesterday, I got carried away and shot my ex-boss, but...  

115
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,400
I can't tell my mother I'm a killer. 

116
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,690
I'll say, "I quit."  

117
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,440
Um... 

118
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,520
Uh... 

119
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,200
Ah, Boss.

Uh... 

123
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:49,020
This is really hard to say, but...

124
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,480
Was that your first time killing someone?  

125
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:52,940
Yes, Sir. 

126
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,770
You're... 

127
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,190
...a genius. 

128
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,170
Huh? 

129
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,310
That's the first time I've ever been praised. 

130
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:10,520
No, no, no, that's bunny ears! 

131
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,330
You shouldn't be happy about that! 

132
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,530
I killed someone! 

133
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,360
You nailed a perfect headshot from that distance. 

134
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,500
I did? 

135
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,640
Yeah, that was no ordinary feat.  

136
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,400
Whaaat?!

137
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,020
Where did you learn to handle a gun? 

138
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,020
Online. 

139
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,270
Just that? Any other training?  

140
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:32,300
Late-night overtime shifts and heavy workloads? 

141
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,360
What about hiding your presence? 

142
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,520
Should I not do that?

143
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,230
I was scared of being yelled at so I learned to avoid standing out.  

144
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:43,020
Wow! So that actually came in handy! 

145
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,270
Am I suited for this? 

146
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,580

Take him out. 

154
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:20,240
What? He's just a regular young guy.  

155
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,590
Should we really kill him? 

156
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,190
Even if it's a job, this is... 

157
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:27,400
He has repeatedly raped female college students. 

158
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,120
Three victims this year alone. 

159
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,600
And his parents keep bailing him out. 

160
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,730
Let's kill him!

161
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,690
Wait, hold on... 

162
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,530
Do you drink? 

163
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:39,440
A little.

164
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,400
Stab him with a syringe as you pass by. 

165
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,230
His heart will stop like he's just fallen asleep. 

166
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,020
Don't attract attention. 

167
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,270
Hey. 

168
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,810
Keep an eye on her.

Wait, at home? 

171
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,630
Oh, that's cool.

172
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,580
What about your other sizes?

173
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,300
B-cup.

174
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,920
- We want to test it out ourselves first. 
- What?

175
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,110
Are you free tonight? 

176
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,340
- Yeah, I'm free.
- Oh, okay.

177
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,660
Alright, see you later tonight. 

178
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,290
Yeah.

179
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:27,730

180
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:28,400
- See ya.
- Later.

186
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,140
That's kind of hard to justify. 

187
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,590
I mean, I can't kill anyone in the first place! 

188
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,990
I can't! 

189
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,070
- How about her?
- She's gross! 

190
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,270
You responded fast!

191
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,110
She's gross!

192
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,330
What was her name again? 

193
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:08,670
No idea. Gifu? 

194
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,390
"Gifu" is easy to remember. 

195
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:14,180
Should I call the Gifu girl?  

196
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,700
Only scumbags would judge others by their looks. 

197
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,270
Call an ambulance!

198
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,630
Good afternoon. 

199
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:09,270
I just finished work. 

200
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,630
See you again tomorrow. 

201
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:16,570
Wow, it really disappears.

202
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:18,310
Amazing. 

203
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,380
Hello? 

204
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,290
Oh, hey, Mom. 

205
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:30,000
The package arrived! 

206
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,070
They don't sell these here. 

207
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:35,090
How's it going, Kanako? Been busy?

208
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:36,930
Hmm, it's the usual. 

209
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:40,040
You sound like you're doing well. 

210
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,130
Really?

211
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,630
Umm... 

212
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:45,200
Mom... 

213
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,230
I changed jobs. 

214
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,840
Oh, really? 

215
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,770
But you said you liked your old job. 

216
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,840
Well, a lot happened. 

217
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,170
So today was my first day. 

218
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,660
I had to go straight to the field. 

219
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,760
The field? 

220
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,150
For what? 

221
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,810
For the agency's survey. 

222
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,770
Did you do it properly? 

223
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:11,860
Yeah, more or less. 

224
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,560
It went pretty smoothly. 

225
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,370
Maybe an 80 out of 100. 

226
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:18,400
Not bad. 

227
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:22,330
Well, good for you. It went well. 

228
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:23,350
Yeah. 

229
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,980
I might be good at this new job. 

230
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,270
I see. 

231
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,530
That's good. 

232
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,100
I'll do my best. 

233
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,060
But don't overdo it. 

234
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,730
You always push yourself too hard. 

235
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,600
I'll be careful. 

236
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,040
I'll kill you! 

237
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,270
Okay! 

238
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,620
Newbie, where did you disappear to yesterday? 

239
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,580
 Umm... 

240
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,850
I went straight home. 

241
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,150
Sorry. 

242
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,900
But the boss said once I messaged him...

243
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,690
If you get in my way, you're dead. 

244
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,570
I'm gonna croak with fear! 

245
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:00,390
Is he your senior? 

246
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,050
His name is Sakurai. 

247
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,290
He always saying "I'll kill you." 

248
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,180
He definitely hates you. 

249
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,440
You think so? 

250
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,700
He's so scary! 

251
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,770
Also, I have no experience doing a surprise attack in the dark. 

252
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,400
Newbie. 

253
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,100
I'll kill you.

254
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,770
Who is it?

255
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,020
What's going on?! What's going on?!

256
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,100
Oh no!

257
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,600
Stop dragging your feet, or I'll kill you. 

258
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:52,330
Slow, slow, I'm dinosaur slow. 

259
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:55,400
As I thought I'm not cut out for being an assassin. 

260
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,340
Yeah... 

261
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,940
Someone as useless as me... 

262
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:01,130
Should just live deep in the mountains... 

263
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,900
Quietly, without bothering anyone. 

264
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,210
That's right... 

265
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,940
I won't get in the way anymore. 

266
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,860
Poof.

267
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,190
Did she die? 

268
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,830
Good work, Sir. 

269
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,850
Since when were you there? 

270
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,520
Uh, the whole time. 

271
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,800
"Stop dragging your feet." 

272
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,030
"I'll kill you." 

273
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,560
I was here since you said that. 

274
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,190
Uh, well... 

275
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,270
I was trying not to be a bother. 

276
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:48,020
And since there were a lot of people, 

277
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:51,170
I figured sticking close would cause the least trouble. 

278
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,440
So for now... 

279
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,000
I stuck close... 

280
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:05,420
Did I piss him off? 

281
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:09,730
I could probably handle them one at a time. 

282
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:20,270
I have to do this properly... 

283
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,800
I need to say something... 

284
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,900
I feel like I'm gonna croak literally... 

285
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,580
Um, Sakurai... 

286
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,220
That was amazing earlier. 

287
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,380
You kill so smoothly. 

288
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:01,100
Have you been an assassin for a long time? 

289
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,070
No, no, that's not what it! 

290
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,100
I should change the subject... 

291
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,870
So, Sakurai... 

292
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,150
Who's your favorite member BLACKPINK? 

293
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,480
Rosé?

294
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,560
Hey. 

295
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,440
Yes?! 

296
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:36,780
Before, you... 

297
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:55,660
Are they chasing us?! 

298
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,190
Deal with them.

299
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,350
Huh? 

300
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:02,150
Show me how it's done. 

301
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:10,900
Did you already shoot? 

302
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,000
Ah, sorry! 

303
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,770
I'll make sure to aim properly next time. 

304
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:19,310
My former boss always said that I should get things done in three seconds, so I just reacted.

305
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,630
Is she for real...?

306
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,810
I'm sorry. 

307
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:31,830
I accidentally put a hole in it the rear window... 

308
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:46,740
In the gentle sunlight of spring,

309
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,400
Our Failure

310
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:54,840
I was nestled in your kindness 

311
00:17:54,840 --> 00:18:01,350
And I was such a coward, wasn't I?

312
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:08,440
Good work on the late-night shift. 

313
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,920
Sakurai got mad at me... 

314
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,230
I'm sorry. 

315
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,090
That's just how he is. 

316
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,350
He actually think highly of you. 

317
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,350
What?! That's surprising!

318
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,310
I put in a little extra for your first paycheck. 

319
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:33,230
From now on, please take care of me

320
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:38,610
I know I'm like this, but forgive me with a smile

321
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:43,650
Always cherish me, okay?

322
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:44,030
Becau...

323
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,530
