1
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,490
Takehara. 

2
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,600
Why would we, in the detective division, 

3
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,580
bother coming here on a Sunday morning 

4
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,420
to a suicide scene? 

5
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,440
Do we need to? 

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,730
The deceased is a man in his 40s, 
working at an ad agency. 

7
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,820
No suicide note. 

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,050
Ruled as suicide due to overwork. 

9
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:35,930
So? 

10
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:37,820
Actually, this guy 

11
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,380
was notorious for workplace harassment. 

12
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,280
He pushed a subordinate to quit right before he died. 

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,900
In the past, one of his subordinates even killed themselves. 

14
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:48,650
So? 

15
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:52,550
Do you really think someone like him would commit suicide? 

16
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:55,380
A head-first dive? 

17
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,360
Who knows. 

18
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,940
Maybe he got called out for harassment, took it to heart, and broke down.  

19
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,080
Omori, listen. 

20
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,150
Lately, the accidents and incidents happening around here all share a certain pattern.   

21
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,520
A pattern? 

22
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,940
Remember the college student who fell down the station stairs and died?  

23
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,470
He was a serial rapist. 

24
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:17,440
Female college students had filed complaints. 

25
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,060
And the car that exploded in flames two days ago.  

26
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,100
The car is from underground ring linked to the Yakuza.   

27
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:28,180
Are you saying the victims were people who "deserved" to die? 

28
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,150
You don't think it's just a coincidence? 

29
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,080
Yeah.

30
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,810
Coincidence, huh... 

31
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,250
From this emergency staircase, 

32
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:40,220
trace cleaning agents were detected. 

33
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,770
The same kind used indoors. 

34
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,230
That workplace bully threw his cigarette here, 

35
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,690
and someone cleaned up this filthy staircase. 

36
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,050
This guy... 

37
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,770
...was killed first. 

38
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,750
Wait... 

39
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,120
So they cleaned up after killing him 

40
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,680
and made it look like a suicide? 

41
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,830
That means... 

42
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,520
A pro did this. 

43
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,150
This was probably done by someone who has zero hesitation in taking lives. 

44
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,650
A professional hitman. 

45
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,110
Finisher Sentai Todomenger!  

46
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,770
Finisher Sentai

47
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,770
Todomenger

48
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,330
Having weekends off is nice. 

49
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,110
Get them!

50
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,650
I'll shoot from here! 

51
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,140
He's shooting from a distance! 

52
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:44,840
That's dirty!

53
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,690
You Hitman Monster!

54
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,150
That's right!

55
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,920
Red! We must use a finisher! 

56
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,060
Good idea!

57
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:50,650
That's right.

58
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:52,730
Finisher! 

59
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,520
Finishing Guns! 

60
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,980
It would have been a shot from over there. 

61
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,400
Warriors of justice who won't get evil get away! 

62
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,520
Warriors of justice!

63
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,650
- Todomenger!
- Todomenger! 

64
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,800
A "warrior of justice," you say? 

65
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,770
Happy Kanako's Killer Life

66
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,770
Episode 2

67
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,620
Finish them! Finish them!

68
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,860
Finish them!

69
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,610
Todo Todo Todo Todomenger!

70
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:39,770
I told you, I'm returning it! 

71
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,310
It's not the one I ordered! 

72
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,460
I apologize. 

73
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,030
Since you have eaten it... 

74
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,790
A complainer?

75
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,150
I don't care! I'm not asking! 

76
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,160
Didn't I tell you to put a cheese flavored one! 

77
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,480
But you put a big amount of salt in it! 

78
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,370
No, this is customer harassment. 

79
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,300
Sorry. 

80
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,230
You're late, huh? 

81
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,300
No... Uh... 

82
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:00,920
Look. 

83
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,170
Because of your service,

84
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,270
both me and those girls

85
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,460
end up with this kind of hassle!

86
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,550
I deeply apologize.

87
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,600
He's making a scene.

88
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,580
My stomach hurts for awhile now.

89
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,020
Wait, is this extortion?

90
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:10,860
Ow! Ow! Ow!

91
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:16,650
You're not even fix your nasty fake lashes?!  

92
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,330
It's fixed now! 

93
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:19,530
You idiot! Geez!

94
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:21,810
Excuse me. Let's discuss things over there.

95
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:23,490
You're bothering other customers so...

96
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:24,920
Aren't I also a customer?!

97
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,480
I'm taking everything here in this video!

98
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,500
Don't you get it? You will be flamed in the internet!

99
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,110
And when you get flamed, you might as well disappear!

100
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,050
Do you want that to happen?!

101
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,320
Finish them! Finish them!

102
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,180
Finish, finish, finish, finish them!

103
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,730
Finish them! Finish them!

104
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,520
That's weird. Fine, let's go to the back.

105
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:47,950
Finish, finish, finish them!

106
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,000
Let's go. Let's go to the back.

107
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:51,060
Finish them! Finish them!

108
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,940
- What? What? Are you looking?
- No, don't! You're video recording. 

109
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,920
Sorry, please come to this counter. 

110
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,270
A groper.

111
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,130
Before when I wasn't a hitman, 

112
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,380
I would've just put up with it. 

113
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,770
But now... 

114
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:21,700
Hey! 

115
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,810
Stop that! 

116
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,380
Huh? 

117
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,670
It's just a coincidence. 

118
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,980
You're not even worth touching. 

119
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,600
Hey, hey, shut the kid up! 

120
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,280
To think you brought a brat during rush hour!

121
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,920
Women who can't even earn money should just stay home!  

122
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,850
I'm sorry, really.

123
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,130
Right?

124
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,100
But you're just as rude. 

125
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:59,270
Me-Sphinx he should die! 

126
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,860
Helping people through killing? 

127
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,150
Yes. 

128
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,600
Like there's a really bad person!

129
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,190
Of course that's not allowed. 

130
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,010
We're not running some charity. 

131
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:10,100
We don't work for free. Remember that. 

132
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,560
Thank you for the food. 

133
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,480
I'm done eating. 

134
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,790
Eat properly at...

135
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:33,850
When did you eat? 

136
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,940
At my previous job, 

137
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,850
they told us to finish lunch in five seconds so I got used to it.  

138
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,470
I'll go wash them. 

139
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,050
Of course. 

140
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,720
Just because someone is struggling, 

141
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,000
doesn't mean I can kill whoever I want. 

142
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,350
Newbie. 

143
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,850
Sakurai?! 

144
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,020
You should quit already. 

145
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,700
What? 

146
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,470
I guess so. 

147
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:28,980
I'm just a useless little chick anyway. 

148
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,120
Just because I got praised for killing people,  

149
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,190
I got cocky, spoke up to the boss and got scolded. 

150
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:36,680
And now I'm sulking and sighing.  

151
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,590
Like "Why are you acting like a protagonist? I'll kill you!" huh?

152
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,270
What? 

153
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:45,880
Wait, wait! 

154
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,150
No way, no way, no way, arma-no-dillo! 

155
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,480
Wait, Sakurai, are you by chance saying... 

156
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,250
"You should quit already." 

157
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,650
"But if you're not quitting, 

158
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:56,350
then stop sulking here, 

159
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,170
and go find your own work." 

160
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,480
That's what you were trying to tell me?! 

161
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,350
Definitely! 

162
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,100
Sakurai! 

163
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,480
Thank you so much! 

164
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,730
I have come to my senses! 

165
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,910
Can you do it? 

166
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,820
I finally got it! 

167
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,300
Boss! 

168
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,420
That guy who kept making complaints at the store? 

169
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,940
He's been extorting businesses and shutting them down. 

170
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,470
And I successfully got a hit request on him! 

171
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,280
That counts as a job, right? 

172
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,270
I'll investigate that pervert too and make sure he's dead! 

173
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:37,310
Gotta prepare! Gotta prepare! 

174
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,670
Alright! 

175
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,740
Time to kill... 

176
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,610
Did you say something to her? 

177
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,720
I said she should quit.

178
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,100
Where should I kill him? 

179
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,190
Let's see... 

180
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,380
Give him an injection. 

181
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,620
Turn on the gas.

182
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,210
Induce an incomplete burn reaction on the body, then... 

183
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:16,070
Hm?! 

184
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:19,120
No, wait. No, no! Uh, turn on the gas... 

185
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,440
Turn on the injection, 
I mean give him an injection... 

186
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,600
Huh? 

187
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,870
Thumpity, thump, thump, turtley thump? 

188
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,940
Hmm... 

189
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,030
Even though Sakurai is in another case,  

190
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:36,370
it's fine to at least him check me, right? 

191
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:37,480
Yeah. 

192
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,230
Right? 

193
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:40,780
Better than messing up and causing trouble. 

194
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,800
Yeah, it's better. 

195
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,630
You gave it some thought, Mr. Fukui?  

196
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,980
It's fine that I get it out and as a regular citizen.  

197
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:58,410
You'll probably get flamed online though! 

198
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:59,520
I see.

199
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,800
You say it's my fault that you can't focus on your work.

200
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,400
Okay.

201
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,190
No, stop making excuses already! 

202
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,600
What the heck? You make me sick.

203
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,930
I can do it alone! 

204
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,130
I did it alone! 

205
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,760
You idiot! 

206
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,230
I told you not to stand out. 

207
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:09,440
[ Breaking News ] Explosion Occurs in Apartment
"I thought a plan had crashed" - One male resident died

208
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,990
Who told you to blow up the house and get it into the news?   

209
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,900
Even all the watchers in the area freaked out. 

210
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,770
I'm sorry... 

211
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,440
I'll kill you. 

212
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:22,400
Forget it. Leave. 

213
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,000
Yes, Sir... 

214
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,940
Kanako?! 

215
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,480
It really is you, Kanako! 

216
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,510
What? Yoshioka?

217
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,660
It's been so long! I'm so happy! 

218
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,150
But why call me by my last name? 

219
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:08,400
Call me Kiyomi, like in middle school! 

220
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,220
No, no, no, I can't bunny do that! 

221
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:16,250
Yoshiaka was the council president and a model student.  

222
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,010
I was casually calling her by first name just because we sat next to each other.  

223
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:21,100
I wanna punch my past self for that! 

224
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,810
Heading home? Want to grab a meal first? 

225
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,690
Well... 

226
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,220
There's nothing to talk about, and I'm feeling down. 

227
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,350
We just want to go home today. 

228
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,570
Cheers! 

229
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:37,290
I couldn't say no... 

230
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:43,400
It kind of weird strange drinking with a middle school friend, huh?    

231
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,900
Isn't it...? 

232
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,580
Friends? 

233
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,400
Can we really call it friendship after ten years of no contact? 

234
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,400
What are you up to these days, Kanako? 

235
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,330
Uh... um... 

236
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:55,770
I'm in an ad agency. 

237
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,770
Of killing. 

238
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:58,760
Huh, really? 

239
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,950
Office work? 

240
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:02,910
Um... more like a field job? 

241
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,450
Of killing.

242
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,700
Even today? 

243
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,100
Yeah. 

244
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,060
Of killing. 

245
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,730
H-How about you?

246
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:11,730
Me? 

247
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:13,840
I'm a middle school teacher now. 

248
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,900
I have a homeroom class. 

249
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,260
Oh, wow! 

250
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,310
That's so cool! 

251
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,920
Not at all. 

252
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,810
Nothing ever goes smoothly. 

253
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:29,400
Middle schoolers are in such a tough age.  

254
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,630
Even when I mean well, it backfires, and they end up resenting me.  

255
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,060
I can do this alone. 

256
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:41,550
Communication never goes the way I want.  

257
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:47,020
With just one little comment from the students hurts me too.   

258
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,860
I'll kill you. 

259
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:52,060
And it's frustrating when I can't meet expectations. 

260
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,150
Even all the watchers in the area freaked out. 

261
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,860
I'm sorry... 

262
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,610
I totally get that! 

263
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,580
Really?! 

264
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,320
Different jobs have the same struggles, huh? 

265
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:02,980
Yeah!

266
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,900
Sometimes I just want to get killed too! 

267
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,850
I sure cheetah-ed it... 

268
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:20,310
I'm sure she thinks I'm a mess... 

269
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,150
But that's fine. 

270
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,190
It's not like we'll see each other again. 

271
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,800
Say. 

272
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,690
Wanna grab a drink again sometime?  

273
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,020
She's too kind. 

274
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,220
Well, um... 

275
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,610
Don't you think it's boring to hang out with me? 

276
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,790
Not at all! 

277
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,600
You always cheer me up, Kanako. 

278
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,620
What?! 

279
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,550
No way! 

280
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,720
It's true, really! 

281
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,250
You're always trying your best, right?  

282
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,070
That's why, watching you... 

283
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:55,520
Made me want to try harder too. 

284
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,180
See you again! 

285
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,490
I'm relieved you haven't changed! 

286
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,270
That was surprising. 

287
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,900
I never thought 

288
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,940
I could've had an impact on Kiyomi. 

289
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:23,880
Maybe I can start liking myself a bit more.    

290
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,680
I don't get it! 

291
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,020
You're not quitting? 

292
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,230
No. 

293
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,950
Let's tail him as soon as we spot him. 

294
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,980
Then kill him somewhere out of sight.  

295
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,480
Got it. 

296
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,450
If you mess up, I'll kill you. 

297
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,330
Understood. 

298
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,600
Sakurai... 

299
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,150
He's doing it again! 

300
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,100
Listen up. 

301
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,550
Unlike a useless leech like you... 

302
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:10,150
I actually work hard and contribute to this country.  

303
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,060
I...! 

304
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:21,020
When I'm being groped... 

305
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,530
I start thinking it was my fault. 

306
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,950
I feel ashamed of how weak I am. 

307
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,980
And I end up blaming myself. 

308
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,670
I don't want... 

309
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,770
to be more people who bury their true selves to survive like I used to.

310
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,560
Can you erase your presence here too? 

311
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,350
Yes. 

312
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,360
The world would be better off without you. 

313
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,220
A murder occurred on the Hokuto New Liner train. 

314
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,690
The victim was shot and killed. 

315
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:06,160
But no gunshot sound were reported by any witnesses.  

316
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:07,810
Subway shooting incident
None of the passengers noticed, and the perpetrator's whereabouts could not be traced

317
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,230
So we have no idea when exactly the victim was killed.  

318
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,270
The police are currently are  

319
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:15,040
 checking for possible witnesses and at the same time...   

320
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,320
They're analyzing security footage

321
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,620
and are continuing their investigation. 

322
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,020
You did it again, huh? 

323
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,440
I'm sorry! 

324
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,400
You messing with me? 

325
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,900
I let her do it. 

326
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,380
It's about time... 

327
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,270
I decide what to do with this idiot. 

328
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,580
I'll be fired. 

329
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,320
Of course I will... 

330
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,660
I figure I'll be fired. 

331
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,900
Goodbye. 

332
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:58,460
It sure was short. 

333
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,770
My life as an assassin. 

334
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,310
Nishino. 

335
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,900
Yes, Sir. 

336
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,310
Become a legend. 

337
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,060
Huh? 

338
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:34,140
Until now... 

339
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,920
I did this job just to survive. 

340
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,060
But lately... 

341
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:42,120
Watching you grow has been a small joy for me.  

342
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,810
If it's for that... 

343
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,810
I'll take the risk. 

344
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,120
I'm not fired? 

345
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,190
A company 

346
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:14,310
takes care of employees who work hard. 

347
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,730
This is really a good company! 

348
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,080
Thank you very much! 

349
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,950
Really, thank you! 

350
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:50,770
Sure, I'm a little anxious

351
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:58,140
But this is the path I've chosen to live

352
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:09,240
Lately, things have been going great for us

353
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,730
Whoa, the stars are beautiful! 

354
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,730
I'll kill you. 

355
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,770
Coming!

356
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,680
Sorry about that, and thanks! 

357
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:11,460
Sorry! 

358
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:17,260
Let's keep this up together

359
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:23,190
The best part is still to come

360
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,660
Sakurai... 

361
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:23,190
How long does it take for a corpse to become soil?  

362
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:27,040
So stay with me until the end

363
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:24,310
I'll kill you! 

364
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,900
Okayyy!
