1
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,590
Come on! Huh?!

2
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:10,350
I'm sorry!

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:11,630
I'm so sorry!

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,380
Are you messing with us?!

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,670
Good evening, Sir!

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,100
Boss. 

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,930
He's one from the Ryudo group. 

8
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,980
In the first place,

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,400
it's because you're damn soft on my orders 

10
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,280
that everyone's looking down on us, the Otaki group! 

11
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,230
Right?! 

12
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,270
Wrap this up! 

13
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,370
Yes, Sir!

14
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,980
I'm gonna croak! 

15
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,150
My heart went clang! 

16
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,360
Like bam! 

17
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,250
Bam, then boom, then bang! 

18
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:52,230
Do you like octopus? 

19
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,020
Yes, Sir!

20
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,600
Then you must have no joints. 

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,900
Humans have 260 joints, you know.  

22
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,090
Count them up. 

23
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:09,980
Yes, Sir!

24
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,480
2...

25
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:12,560
2!

26
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,560
3!

27
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,880
4... 5... 6... 

28
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,270
Anyway, who are you? 

29
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,440
I-I came from Smile Agency! 

30
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,100
I-I'm Kanako Nishino! 

31
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,440
Are you a hitman?

32
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,220
Y-Yes!

33
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,690
I'll kill with everything I've got! 

34
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,940
Kid, do you know K?  

35
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,540
K, you say...? 

36
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,050
The subway hit awhile back, 

37
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:17,250
there is a rumor among us that it was K who did it. 

38
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,560
No matter the situation... 

39
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,980
Bang!

40
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,700
He can kill anyone. 

41
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,730
A top-notch hitman. 

42
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:26,680
That's Kanako, right? 

43
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,610
Maybe the reason he is called "K" 

44
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,650
is because... 

45
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:37,050
it is the first letter of "Killer" or something? 

46
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:41,670
Boss, no. That's Kanako's "K."  

47
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,450
So this K... 

48
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,560
Is he employed at your firm? 

49
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:54,860
Well, who knows? 

50
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,650
I have no clue. 

51
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,220
Hey! 

52
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,840
Excuse me. 

53
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,220
If you'll ask K to do it, 

54
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,150
then I'll pay double.

55
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,560
Tell that to your boss. 

56
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,190
Wow! 

57
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:20,650
Happy Kanako's Killer Life

58
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,650
Episode 3

59
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,530
Graffiti on the wall is graffiti of the heart! 

60
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:32,060
I-I-It was me who did it! 

61
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:39,810
Hitman K is amazing

62
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,810
"Assassin K and 30 Billion Yen Lover"?! 

63
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,380
So it's a manga. 

64
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,730
It's messing my search! 

65
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:48,480
Hitman K is cute

66
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:46,510
Cute...

67
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:53,150
Could be my name? 

68
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,480
Assassin K's true identity Kanako Nishino

69
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,480


70
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,730
No results! 

71
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,770
Ah! Instagram? 

72
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,900
Why you! 

73
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,850
Uh, can I ask something? 

74
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,600
Do you know K? 

75
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,870
K? 

76
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,230
You know, the one people are talking about lately.  

77
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,660
I don't know! 

78
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,230
It was in the news recently. 

79
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,940
Haven't you heard the guy who was killed on the train? 

80
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,400
No! 

81
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,560
Seriously, I don't know anything! 

82
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,240
What...? 

83
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,520
Hi-? 

84
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,190
"Hi-"? 

85
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,400
-t-? 

86
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,100
Hm? "-t-"? 

87
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,710
...ni...

88
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,200
- Then forget it.
-Wait, wait, wait!   

89
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,670
Hold on! Hold on! Hey!

90
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:17,870
What?! 

91
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,810
It's better I should know?! 

92
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,220
Ah, no, no... 

93
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,870
Ah! Aah! 

94
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:23,610
Ah, I've heard!

95
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,690
I've heard! I know! I know! I know! 

96
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:26,890
You mean this, right? 

97
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:32,350
H-H-H-Hit-... Hit-... 

98
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,730
-li-, -li-, -li-...

99
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:36,650
-ma-...

100
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,540
-ma-, -ma-, -ma-... 

101
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,600
-m... -m... 

102
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,630
-n! -n! -n! -n! 

103
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,060
-n! -n! 

104
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,600
K-K-K... 

105
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,690
- Hitman K!
- Hitman K!

106
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:54,460
That's it!

107
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,770
Yes! Yes! Ugh... 

108
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,270
Have you heard any rumors of them? 

109
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,280
Rumors? 

110
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,270
No idea! 

111
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,150
Really? 

112
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,520
Wait, wait, wait, wait! 

113
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,250
Hold on! Hold on! 

114
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,700
I've heard one! I've heard one!

115
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,350
I know really! Um, well... 

116
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,790
You know, heard that... 

117
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,930
Heard that...

118
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,850
Heard they're amazing! 

119
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,510
Really?! 

120
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,100
In what way? 

121
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,850
What way? 

122
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,280
What way are they amazing? 

123
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,770
Um, um, uh... 

124
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,600
They have... incredible skills.  

125
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,310
Ah!

126
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,910
Um... uh...

127
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,980
They are really... um... 

128
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,860
...cool? 

129
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,730
Ah!

130
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,150
Uh... 

131
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:45,980
It's K, right? They're a hitman after all! 

132
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,150
Scary?

133
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:52,080
What? Scary? 

134
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,140
- Forget it.
- No! No! No! 

135
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,700
I messed up! I messed up! I was wrong! 

136
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,680
That's someone else! 

137
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,900
It's a different person!

138
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,630
I know! I know! Ahhh! 

139
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,940
Ah, yeah, yeah, that's it... 

140
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:05,800
Uh, uh, um... 

141
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,440
Well then... No, no! Um, uh... 

142
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,810
Cute? 

143
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,150
What?! 

144
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,160
That's the rumor about them?! 

145
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,020
Oh man! That's embarrassing! 

146
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,420
Yeah...! 

147
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,980
To top it off, heard they are super cute!  

148
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,230
Like they are as cute as Sayaka Isoyama!

149
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:27,900
Don't know her. 

150
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,770
It's fine! You don't need to know her! 

151
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:33,520
Anyway, heard that they're unbelievably cute!  

152
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,980
That Hitman K!

153
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,850
You know...

154
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,520
Actually... 

155
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,770
Actually...? 

156
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,510
K is... me! 

157
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,310
K is... me! 

158
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,060
Rea...

159
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,060
I'll kill you!

160
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:17,240
Mmm, so good! 

161
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,650
Thanks for bringing me along! 

162
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:21,810
Of course! It's hard to come alone to a place like this.  

163
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:23,980
Is this french based? 

164
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,780
I don't think so. 

165
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:31,230
Did something good happen? 

166
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,550
Huh? Why do you ask? 

167
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:35,230
You seem more lively than last time. 

168
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,210
Really?

169
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:42,530
But actually, I kinda got some recognition from work.   

170
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:43,910
That's great! 

171
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:44,900
What did you do? 

172
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,520
The subway job I did before got a good reputation.   

173
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,360
That's great! 

174
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,860
It's nothing like that! 

175
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:57,400
But a client said that if I was assigned for the job, they would pay double!   

176
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,030
Double?! Wow! 

177
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:03,020
The company must be happy since you transferred there.  

178
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,730
No! No way! 

179
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,830
I'll take a picture. 

180
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:11,060
Hey, stop that! 

181
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,190
Sorry. 

182
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,090
Hello? 

183
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:26,820
Is this by chance Kanako Nishino's phone? 

184
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,660
Yes. 

185
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,770
I am...

186
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:31,980
I'm Takehara from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department. 

187
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:38,520
 We'd like to ask you some questions at the station regarding the matter from before.

188
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:41,550
Oh no, oh no, oh no, Oki, no-wan Rail! 

189
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,650
I forgot about them...

190
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,100
Kanako? 

191
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,050
Then, see you tomorrow. 

192
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,220
Thank you for your cooperation. 

193
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,230
Goodbye. 

194
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,330
You're trying too hard to sound cool. 

195
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,460
Kanako Nishino, right? 

196
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,450
Do we need to talk to her? 

197
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,690
Of course we do. 

198
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,230
She was the murdered guy's former subordinate. 

199
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,680
It's not decided that it was a murder. 

200
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,900
And it happened again with the subway incident.  

201
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,450
That was strange too, right? 

202
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,560
With that many people around and not a single witness.  

203
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:29,230
In the underground world they say it was K's doing.  

204
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,940
K? 

205
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:35,100
Just an urban legend. 

206
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:39,520
K... 

207
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,370
Kanako's "K." 

208
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,680
Die. 

209
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,440
Boss! Boss! 

210
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,920
What should I do? 

211
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,070
Am I getting arrested? 

212
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,450
Imprisoned? 

213
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,810
Will I get a shaved head?! 

214
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:55,730
Calm down. 

215
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,480
So they figured out it was a homicide. 

216
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,580
That detective's sharp. 

217
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,440
Well... 

218
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,850
Seems like they're just checking everyone who might have a grudge.

219
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:06,700
Boss. 

220
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,810
Did I have an alibi?  

221
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:11,800
Where was I? What was I doing at the time of the crime? 

222
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:15,360
I was selling rifles on the rooftop!  

223
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,300
Acting natural is best. 

224
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,600
Just stay calm during interrogation. 

225
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,030
Interrogation. 

226
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,020
Feels like I'm the suspect. 

227
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,150
Sorry for the trouble. 

228
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:43,550
Thumpity, thump, thump, turtley thump!

229
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,190
Ah! I'm so nervous! 

230
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,100
Boss, I can't act natural!  

231
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,180
What should I do? 

232
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,470
Smile? 

233
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,060
For now I'll just smile.  

234
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,600
For identity verification, please state your name and date of birth.  

235
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,770
Kanako Nishino. 

236
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:08,520
Born on November 11, 1999. 

237
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,100
25 years old. 

238
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,940
I'm 30. 

239
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,150
And your occupation? 

240
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,230
I work at an agency. 

241
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,690
An agency? What kind? 

242
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,030
What kind? Did he just ask "what kind"?  

243
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:32,020
Wait, are they expecting me to say "assassination"?  

244
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,350
Is it a leading question? 

245
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,800
Um... 

246
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,270
Advertising? 

247
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,990
Advertising. 

248
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,270
Fancy. 

249
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,080
Scary! She just slammed his chair!

250
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,450
So this is the good cop, bad cop thing? 

251
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,550
Next, the desk lamp's gonna flash, right? 

252
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,850
By the way... 

253
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:57,350
Where were you around 8 PM on April 16 and what were you doing?  

254
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:00,410
April 16? 

255
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:01,020
Yes. 

256
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:05,150
Where were you and what were you doing? 

257
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,310
Here it is... 

258
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,580
At that time... 

259
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,480
I was at home. 

260
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,460
Watching Todomenger. 

261
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,520
A recorded episode. 

262
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,230
What? 

263
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,320
I cheetah-ed it! 

264
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,880
They totally think I'm lying! 

265
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,400
Can I keep pretending? 

266
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,900
No, no, no! I can't, I can't! 

267
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,520
I'm done for...

268
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:40,810
I-I-It was me who did it! 

269
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,850
Huh? 

270
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:49,900
What?

271
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,130
Takehara? 

272
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,580
Sorry, sorry. 

273
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,520
I know that show. 

274
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,980
That was the Graffiti Monster from last week's Todomenger episode.   

275
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:01,700
What?

276
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,400
Actually... 

277
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,150
I like it too, I watch it every week. 

278
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,720
Last week's episode was great, right? 

279
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,250
"Graffiti on the wall is graffiti of the heart." 

280
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:12,830
"I-I-It was me who did it!" Right?

281
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,350
"Graffiti on the wall is graffiti of the heart!" 

282
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:19,480
"I-I-It was me who did it!" 

283
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,500
I see! 

284
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,300
Todomenger, huh? 

285
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,170
Great! 

286
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,420
Finish them. 

287
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,520
Finish them. 

288
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:37,120
Finish, finish, finish, finish them! 

289
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:39,080
She doesn't know this, sorry. 

290
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,420
Finish them. 

291
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,050
Come on!

292
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:42,200
Finish them.  

293
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:42,620
Hey!

294
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:46,290
Finish, finish, finish, finish them! 

295
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:47,910
- Sorry. 
- Excuse him. 

296
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,150
Ah, yes. Excuse me. 

297
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,470
She has nothing to do with the case. 

298
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,380
Satisfied now? 

299
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,350
What is this...? 

300
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,330
This feeling... 

301
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:08,810
What's wrong? 

302
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,820
I don't know. 

303
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,210
But... 

304
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,650
It really bothers me. 

305
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,020
So what's wrong? 

306
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:33,400
Finisher Sentai Todomenger! 

307
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,830
Come on, let's all cheer for Todomengers! 

308
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:38,980
Everyone, sing along! 

309
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,380
Here we go! 

310
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,690
One, two...! 

311
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,980
Finish them! Finish them!

312
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,520
Finish, finish, finish, finish them!

313
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:48,400
- Yeah!

314
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,610
Finish them! Finish them!

315
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:53,460
Finish, finish, finish, finish them!

316
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,690
- Yeah!

317
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:56,060
Finish them! Finish them!

318
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,490
Finish, finish, finish, finish them!

319
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,150
Take this laser!

320
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,110
Same goes for you all! 

321
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,480
Todomengers! 

322
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,870
I'll take my revenge! 

323
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,810
Oh no! At this rate... 

324
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:14,680
Todomengers will be defeated! 

325
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,490
Please, lend them your power!  

326
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:19,980
Here we go! One, two! 

327
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,400
Finisher Power! 

328
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,690
Full charge! 

329
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,440
Full charge!

330
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,940
Full charge!

331
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,690
So Takehara's also here. 

332
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:36,940
Takehara?! 

333
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,650
Nishino! 

334
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,620
So you also watched. 

335
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,090
Yes...

336
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,940
You really like them, huh? 

337
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:01,880
Yes.

338
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,780
My favorite is Red. 

339
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:05,650
What about you? 

340
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,380
Yellow. 

341
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,230
I think that's nice. 

342
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:16,280
Aren't the Todomengers usually just plain, ordinary people?

343
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,940
But even so, they can still become heroes of justice.  

344
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:23,920
Watching them gives me courage.  

345
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,690
I know! 

346
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:29,560
Sorry, I got a little passionate. 

347
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,580
No, it's fine. 

348
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,900
Um... 

349
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,610
Are you free after this? 

350
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,970
Well, no. 

351
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:40,230
I have plans. Bye! 

352
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,200
Wait! 

353
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:49,560
Then how about next time?

354
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,730
Um, could that be another interrogation? 

355
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,820
No! 

356
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,120
It's outside of work! 

357
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,400
Um... 

358
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:07,150
If you'd like, maybe we could get something to eat?!  

359
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,300
Seriously? 

360
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,900
Could that be...

361
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,830
He's asking on a date! 

362
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,860
Is it, though? 

363
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,710
But he's a cop. 

364
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:17,940
How do I turn him down? 

365
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,780
Why? It's not like you're a criminal. 

366
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,820
Hmm, true... 

367
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,950
But right now, I'm not really looking for someone to date... 

368
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,480
Just go once and see how it is. 

369
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,850
When's the date? Let's go buy clothes!  

370
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:32,020
Maybe you should diet too? 

371
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:35,730
I don't need to diet! 

372
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,280
Have you ever been on a diet?  

373
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,060
Yeah, I have. 

374
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,310
Even though I run this much... 

375
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,530
My calorie burn is... 

376
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:55,510
Only 130?! 

377
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,400
Sakurai, you're so skinny. 

378
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:37,650
What do you eat? Chicken breasts? 

379
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:39,200
Noodles.

380
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,070
Not fair! 

381
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,610
Even my parents never hit me! 

382
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,030
I'll kill you. 

383
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:07,150
I mean, I did ask for this...  

384
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,980
Just wanted to slim my arms a bit... 

385
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,900
Ow!

386
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:30,990
Ow.

387
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,350
Come again tomorrow. If you're late, I'll kill you. 

388
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,860
A few days later... 

389
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,070
Huh? 

390
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,170
Whoa... 

391
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,330
Who goes on a date looking like this? 

392
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:55,270
Looks like a domestic violence case. 

393
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,560
No protective gears this time. 

394
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,650
Why?! 

395
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,390
I have a date tomorrow... 

396
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,370
At least don't hit my face. 

397
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,650
That's enough for today. Go home. 

398
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,480
What?

399
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:51,560
I'll kill you! 

400
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,720
Thank you very much! 

401
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,150
Yo. 

402
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,900
You didn't hit her once, huh? 

403
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:08,040
She was just lucky. 

404
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,730
To think you hit her every day before. 

405
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,250
This is the security footage from Musashi-Nakano Station. 

406
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,500
Thanks.

407
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,770
Wasn't today your date with the girl we asked questions?  

408
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:49,070
Hm? Yeah... 

409
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:51,560
Nice shirt. 

410
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,940
Really?! 

411
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,070
Thanks! 

412
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:57,750
This is a nice shirt, huh?! Right?! 

413
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,020
Actually... 

414
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,030
I brought two, just in case. 

415
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,950
But yeah! This one is best, huh?!

416
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,980
Right?!

417
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,320
You got good style after all! 

418
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,520
I trust you! 

419
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,450
I'm more confident!

420
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:10,460
Thank you!

421
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,250
Omori! 

422
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,690
Alright! Let's go!

423
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,900
Okay, okay. 

424
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,970
I'll give you a ride. 

425
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:20,880
You're awesome...!

426
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,030
Really?! 

427
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,900
You're really dolled up today.

428
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,800
I appreciate your compliment. 

429
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,100
Hey. 

430
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:37,600
Kirishima. 

431
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,700
Yes, Sir.

432
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,150
Today's job is just overseeing the deal site. 

433
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,310
We hand over the kid to the Ryudo group. 

434
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,400
And take the cash in exchange. 

435
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,230
If they resist... 

436
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:52,400
Only shoot if we lose the case. 

437
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:53,610
Any questions? 

438
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,150
About what time will we finish? 

439
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,270
Huh? 

440
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:59,650
Ah, it's fine. Sorry. 

441
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,400
Looks like it's gonna be over late.

442
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,770
Hey. 

443
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:13,830
Ryudo. 

444
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,370
You look pale.  

445
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:20,190
Got liver problems or something? 

446
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,230
Mr. Otaki. 

447
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:27,230
How's life at the nursing home? 

448
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,900
Shut up, punks! 

449
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,770
I'm relieved it's a simple job. 

450
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:47,520
I'll go change at the office, then... 

451
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,860
Hm? 

452
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,570
What should I talk with him? 

453
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:52,510
I can't talk about work.

454
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:54,410
Ah! Todomenger! 

455
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,950
Ahh! 

456
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:59,180
My nails are chipped! Why?! 

457
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,810
I don't have a nail polish remover! 

458
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,420
What happened?! 

459
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,710
Sakurai! 

460
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:16,950
Focus... 

461
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,560
There's a sniper over there. 

462
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,630
What do I do? 

463
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:24,410
I'm sorry, it's my fault! 

464
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,810
I should call an ambulance! 

465
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:27,400
Hey, I'll kill you. 

466
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,650
Tell the boss and get out of here! 

467
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,770
Sakurai! 

468
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,060
Sakurai! 

469
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,510
I'm sorry... 

470
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,750
I'm sorry! 

471
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,910
It's my fault! 

472
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,320
Because of me, you're...! 

473
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,230
I'm sorry! 

474
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,170
I'm sorry... 

475
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,080
I'm sorry...

476
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,110
Someone like me... 

477
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,290
Someone like me... 

478
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:22,340
...is nothing but a cockroach! 

479
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:08,600
Who's there?! 

480
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,560
Boss! Run! Run!

481
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:04,980
So it's K.

482
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,420
No way...

483
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,520
Good work. 

484
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,980
He won't die. 

485
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:39,020
I-I'm sorry... 

486
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,980
I'll kill you. 

487
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,110
I'm really sorry. 

488
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:02,720
There! Straight, straight! 

489
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,780
No, no! Right, right! 

490
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:03,970
Huh?

491
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:05,480
Right! No, left! Left! 

492
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,920
- Which way?!
- No, right, right! Left?! 

493
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,220
W-Which way?! Right?

494
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,740
Why are we involved in another case on a day like this?!

495
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,440
Huh?!

496
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:11,770
What?!

497
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:12,950
Because it's natural! 

498
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:13,920
Huh?

499
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,150
Because it's natural!

500
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:16,650
Natural?

501
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:17,390
I'm putting this out. 

502
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:19,350
- Huh? Don't!
-We won't make it in time. 

503
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,420
- I'll put this out!
- No! 

504
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:21,310
- Here goes.
- Stop! 

505
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,100
Thanks! You're a lifesaver! 

506
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,150
Your phone!

507
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,940
Nishino! 

508
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,020
Sorry! I'm late! 

509
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:58,660
Sorry.

510
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,260
It's okay. 

511
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,540
Well then, shall we?  

512
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:06,100
Ah, you see...

513
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:06,730
Um...

514
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:07,390
Yes?

515
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:08,340
Wait...

516
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,180
What's wrong? 

517
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,510
Takehara! 

518
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,550
Omori?

519
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,520
What's wrong? 

520
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,770
Your phone... 

521
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:16,690
Thanks! 

522
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,950
Sorry. 

523
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,530
I'll be going now.

524
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:21,750
Okay.

525
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:22,930
Hey. 

526
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:42,730
So you're the detective from before.  

527
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,230
May I ask who are you? 

528
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:51,070
Ah, um, well, you see... 

529
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:57,480
Don't lay a hand on my woman.

Armadillo here. 

549
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,580
It's still pretty 
cold, huh? 

550
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,420
How's everyone 
holding up? 

551
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,110
I read in the

Kanako returns 
to her hometown. 

555
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:15,050
It's cheating to get 
approval from your family. 

556
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:16,710
It's an advice. 

557
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:19,480
