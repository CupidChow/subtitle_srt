1
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:16,100
I'm sorry. 

2
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,810
I'll clean up. 

3
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,220
Tomorrow. 

4
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,220
I'll do it tomorrow. 

5
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,770
Please forgive me. 

6
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,350
So it was today? 

7
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:32,150
So these furniture are these big. 

8
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:33,150
Nishino? 

9
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:34,930
Oh. 

10
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:36,350
Hosomi. 

11
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:38,030
Good evening. 

12
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,550
Ah. 

13
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:43,440
Sorry. 

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,640
You can't get through, huh? Sorry!

15
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,100
Um... Wait a sec...

16
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,440
Oh no, oh no, oh no, Oki-no-wan Rail!

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,690
A super sparkly guy's way is

18
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,800
being obstructed by my furniture.

19
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,850
Ah, go ahead and step on them.

20
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,810
Would you like me to help?

21
00:00:59,160 --> 00:00:59,850
What?

22
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:01,550
If you don't mind that is. 

23
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:02,690
I don't mind. 

24
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:05,560
Let me then. 

25
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,290
They only really just need to put inside.

26
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:09,810
Ah! Wait, hold on! 

27
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,130
Ah, can I just use a quickle wiper? 

28
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:16,270
Happy Kanako's Killer Life

29
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,270
Episode 6

30
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,190
So you're saying your neighbor is a hottie?! 

31
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,380
Yeah, really~ 

32
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,790
Whoa, it's just like a drama! 

33
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,950
What's he like? What's his orientation? What's his work?

34
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,550
No, I don't know anything yet. 

35
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,990
He just helped me put my furniture inside. 

36
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:30,780
He brought them in? 

37
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:31,230
Then? 

38
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,280
Just that!

39
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,610
You offered him tea? 

40
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:34,060
No. 

41
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,440
Have you asked him to assemble the furniture? 

42
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,740
No way, no way! 

43
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:39,320
Those kinds of dazzling guys 

44
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,230
are just meant to date influencers or someone like Ai Tominaga. 

45
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,650
Kanako. 

46
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:49,190
If you keep eating parfaits all the time, 
don't you start craving pickles?

47
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,940
I'm a pickle? 

48
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,760
No, that's not it. It's like this.

49
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,770
Um...

50
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:01,270
Isn't an old, cozy pajama more relaxing than stiff, formal clothes? 

51
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,070
I'm a worn-out pajama?

52
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,830
In a good way, I mean that in a very good way. 

53
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,150
In a good way, but like, the opposite? 

54
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,060
Yeah! Think of it this way. Um...

55
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,200
I-It's like finding more joy in a cave than in a mansion.

56
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,350
Like it's more exciting? 

57
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,250
Yeah, exciting. 

58
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,200
Like it's something unknown and kind of scary.

59
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,310
In a good way, though? 

60
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,770
Yeah, in a good way. 

61
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,890
Oh, Nishino. How's your new place?

62
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,810
It's really nice! 

63
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,320
I wonder if the Feng Shui sense in it is good. 

64
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,940
Like, I can feel the strong energy. 

65
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,480
Hm?

66
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,810
I'm talking about the hitman after you. 

67
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,100
I'm asking if you have you noticed anything strange. 

68
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:44,900
Oh, that? 

69
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,650
What? 

70
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,420
Uh, no, um... 

71
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,320
Got it! I'll do my best! 

72
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,110
What's with her? 

73
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,930
Let me know now.  

74
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,820
I'm still investigating. 

75
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,440
Any info about K? 

76
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,770
I'm still investigating. 

77
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,110
The client is in a hurry.

78
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:09,670
I'm currently in contact with K's mediator. 

79
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,730
I'll send backup. 

80
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:15,740
No need. Leave it to me.  

81
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,270
No way, no way, arma-no-dillo! 

82
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,940
Am I being followed? 

83
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,620
A hitman? 

84
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,190
Some creep? 

85
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,350
What should I do? 

86
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,310
Nishino! 

87
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:54,360
I knew it was you. 

88
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,190
Hosomi. 

89
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,680
Let's go home together.

90
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,690
Ah, okay! 

91
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:05,150
Um, thank you. 

92
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,050
Huh? 

93
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:08,800
Well, I just felt like I was being followed. 

94
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,440
It was scary. 

95
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,310
Right? 

96
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,620
But I'm glad. 

97
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,310
Huh? 

98
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,450
Honestly, if I mistook you for a different person, I'd just make a run for it.

99
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,220
That's even scarier! 

100
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,370
Huh? You think so?

101
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,940
Yeah, definitely!

102
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:27,900
Should we assemble your furniture? 

103
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,830
What? 

104
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,430
I have a Makita. 

105
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,550
Makita? 

106
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,690
Whirr! 

107
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:37,850
Whoa! 

108
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,230
Whoa, amazing!

109
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,230
Wanna try it?

110
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:44,400
Yeah.

111
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:46,400
That's it! 

112
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,270
Makita. 

113
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:53,730
Ready, set... 

114
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:57,310
Ah, it would be better if it's over there. 

115
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,170
Ah, wait a sec. 

116
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:01,690
Okay. 

117
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,320
Maybe I'll go with putting it over there. 

118
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:04,820
Over there? 

119
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,030
- Yeah.
- Okay. 

120
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,560
Oh, but... 

121
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,320
Let's turn around. 

122
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,060
Ah, turn around. 

123
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:15,870
Go back for a bit. 

124
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:16,680
Go back. 

125
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,150
What should I do? 

126
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,790
Ah, went too far. 

127
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:19,810
Should we put it down for now? 

128
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:36,200
Finish them! Finish them!

129
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,110
Finish, finish, finish, finish, finish them!

130
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,810
Oh, that's my nephew's.

131
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,650
Finish them! Finish them!

132
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:41,980
That one's my niece's. 

133
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,810
Finish, finish, finish, finish them!

134
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,480
As for those... 

135
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:45,610
Finish...

136
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,170
Those belonged to my late grandfather. 

137
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,810
Thank you very much, really. 

138
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,470
Bye then. 

139
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,730
Ah! 

140
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,670
See you again. 

141
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,560
We're neighbors, after all. 

142
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,270
Yeah. 

143
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,050
You should say "I should properly thank you"! 

144
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:20,770
Do it! 

145
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:21,900
Okay. 

146
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,080
You should say "I should properly thank you".

147
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,730
You're not really pushing through it!

148
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:29,150
No, I'm gonna push through it.

149
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:29,730
Huh?

150
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:33,770
It's only proper that you return the favor as thanks.

151
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:34,670
Ah. Yes, Sir.

152
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:34,980
Right?

153
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,610
Go to his place. 

154
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,900
Okay, thank you very much. 

155
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,100
That's right.

156
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,110
Is that woman K's mediator? 

157
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,440
If so, you should hurry and... 

158
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,850
I told you to leave it to me, right? 

159
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:15,270
Let's ask him tomorrow. Yeah, tomorrow's better. 

160
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,270
Daytime is better, right? Yeah. 

161
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:18,930
Good evening. 

162
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:19,980
Whoa! 

163
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,440
Do you need something? 

164
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,750
Um. 

165
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,270
Um, as thanks for the other day, here. 

166
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,750
Uh, this isn't much, really.

167
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,450
Uh, for today, let’s just leave it at that. 

168
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,480
Thank you!

169
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,100
Oh, they're sweets. 

170
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,280
I hope it suits your taste. 

171
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,680
Good night. 

172
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,780
Nishino. 

173
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,850
Huh? 

174
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,520
Can I ask you one more favor? 

175
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,560
What? 

176
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:59,310
Finish them! Finish them!

177
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:02,310
Finish, finish, finish, finish, finish them!

178
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,600
Silver Blade!

179
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,120
Ah, there's Silver!

180
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,030
Go! Silver!

181
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,610
Shoot... 

182
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,900
Shoot me! 

183
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,900
Silver... 

184
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,800
Silver! 

185
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,710
- Silver!   - Silver!
- Silver! 

186
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:56,860
Silver.

187
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,020
Silver...

188
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:02,100
Silver!

189
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,770
Sorry. 

190
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:14,030
I never thought Silver would fall into darkness and die.  

191
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:19,610
He was the biggest believer in justice, after all!

192
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,100
Is that so? 

193
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:25,520
The movie was nice. 

194
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,400
Thank you very much. 

195
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:36,770
I think Silver would... be happy too... 

196
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,440
Nishino. 

197
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,230
Yes? 

198
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,480
I know this isn't the best time, but... 

199
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:49,060
I like you, Nishino. Please be my girlfriend.  

200
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,770
A problem has occurred and we will restart your computer

201
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,830
What do you think? 

202
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,770
Please take care of me as your girlfriend. 

203
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,320
I'm so happy. 

204
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,690
Let's go eat. 

205
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,310
I want to get married! 

206
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:26,650
I don't think I'll ever love anyone more than this!

207
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:27,480
Whoa, whoa. 

208
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,080
That's way too fast! 

209
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,150
Go out with him for at least a year first. 

210
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,650
There's still a lot you don't know about him. 

211
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,110
He plays coop games. 

212
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,980
He loves gardening. 

213
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,320
He studied too hard as a kid. 

214
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,520
So he doesn't know much about the real world. 

215
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,980
That's right. You already told me those earlier.

216
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,110
Hm? 

217
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,560
Some weird guy...! 

218
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,980
Came up and he rescued you.

219
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,350
He called you "Nishino." You already told me.  

220
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,480
We watched a movie!

221
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,920
You already said that. 

222
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,400
But there are still secrets you haven't told each other, right?   

223
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,020
Hmmm... 

224
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:05,560
Excuse me! One double Hakushu highball, please!

225
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,230
Coming right up! 

226
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:07,400
Marriage?! 

227
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:12,480
Shouldn't you take some time to see how things go for about two years?  

228
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,630
Two years?! 

229
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,250
Yeah. 

230
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,020
Even an apartment has a two-year contract, right?  

231
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:17,560
Right... 

232
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,440
Do you want us to take care of him?

233
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:21,950
We'll make sure to...

234
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,190
No, it's alright! 

235
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,400
Marriage?

236
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,300
You should at least date for three years and live together after... 

237
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,250
No, no, no, no. 

238
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,480
I-It's just a hypothetical question.

239
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,600
If for example, in the future...

240
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,900
I met someone like that... 

241
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,230
As long as you can keep it a secret, it's fine if you quit the company.

242
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,730
Quit? 

243
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,480
Think of it carefully.

244
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,480
Yes, Sir.

245
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,520
Okay...

246
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,680
That aside, is it okay for me to leave the office now?

247
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,060
I have dinner plans later. 

248
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,230
Okay.

249
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,230
Thank you very much!

250
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,500
I'm off!

251
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,570
Goodbye!

252
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,470
She sure is popular.

253
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,850
Was that harassment too?

254
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,520
Just pulling your gun?

255
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,190
Whoa!

256
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,150
You did all these?

257
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,200
Yeah, that's right.

258
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,900
Sorry.

259
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:38,060
I forgot the drinks, I'll go buy for a sec.

260
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,730
Huh? I'll go do it. 

261
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:40,940
It's fine. 

262
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,150
Just wait here. 

263
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,670
I'll be right back. 

264
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,440
What, what, what, what did I just dodo?! 

265
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,150
I ended up in his place! 

266
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,610
Would you tell him that you're a hitman?  

267
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,940
Hmm...

268
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,030
This ornament sure is stylish! 

269
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,880
You think so?

270
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,980
Isn't it creepy?

271
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,570
Maybe he's his friend. 

272
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,520
 Oh, it's this kind of thing is nice!

273
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,360
If I hide a gun here at my place... 

274
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,770
Am I imagining things? 

275
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,150
Nope, it's real. 

276
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,850
A lot sure was inside it.

277
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,150
I'm back.

278
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,800
Hosomi. 

279
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,650
Convenience stores these days have pretty good wine. 

280
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,730
Is red wine okay? 

281
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:10,770
Hey, what's the meaning of this?  

282
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:12,350
I got some beer too. 

283
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,870
Want beer instead?

284
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:22,820
Are you... 

285
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:26,480
...the hitman after me? 

286
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,190
Yeah.

287
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:50,120
Of course!

288
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,020
Someone as amazing as you 

289
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,520
would never fall for me. 

290
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:58,250
If I had thought about it for a second, I'd know. 

291
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,520
Somehow, I just got the wrong idea.  

292
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,230
How embarrassing! 

293
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,460
So, what should we do now? 

294
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,600
Are you going to kill me? 

295
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,150
I don't have a gun right now anyway. 

296
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:17,320
I won't. 

297
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,770
Let's get married. 

298
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,700
What? 

299
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,540
I want you to marry me. 

300
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,220
At first, I was going to kill you. 

301
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,070
That was the order I was told to. 

302
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:44,480
But I got interested in you. 

303
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:51,670
You're a top-class assassin and yet you're just a normal girl.

304
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,100
Before I knew it you were all I could think about.  

305
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:22,470
I was raised as an assassin and that's all I've ever known.   

306
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,490
But, you know, my dream is...

307
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:36,160
...to be normal. 

308
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,940
To get normally married, work a normal job... 

309
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,810
And normally raise kids. 

310
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:48,100
If you're with me, that dream can come true. 

311
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,150
We're both assassins, you know.  

312
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:56,270
We'll both quit, of course. 

313
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,750
I'll give my client a fake corpse.  

314
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,230
That way, they'll think K is dead.  

315
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,820
It'll be fine. 

316
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,700
I promise it'll work. 

317
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:18,770
I'll make K disappear. 

318
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,920
Wait, let me process this for a second. 

319
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,950
Yesterday, you went to his place for the first time. 

320
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:34,810
Yeah...

321
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:37,020
And he proposed to you there. 

322
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,060
Yeah...

323
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,870
Sorry, but I don't see any problem at all. 

324
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,740
I mean, I did say it's too soon. 

325
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,230
But you said it yourself that you want to get married.

326
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:51,950
But there's a lot going on. 

327
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,900
What do you mean, "a lot"? 

328
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,100
If I don't understand that part, I can't help you. 

329
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,190
About that... 

330
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,710
Umm... 

331
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:16,310
Actually, I'm an assassin.  

332
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,620
And... 

333
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,400
He's an assassin too, so I thought,  

334
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,520
it's lucky of me, right? 

335
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:26,770
But when we get married he wants me to quit being an assassin.   

336
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:32,840
And if I refuse, he might need to kill me. 

337
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:35,570
But actually... 

338
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:41,000
I'm supposed to kill him too... 

339
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:44,560
What kind of metaphor is this? 

340
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,230
Ah... Well...  

341
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,800
If it were me, I'd quit. 

342
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,080
I mean if I don't, I'll get killed, right? 

343
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,310
By an assassin. 

344
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:00,020
But if... 

345
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,650
I stop being an assassin...

346
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,520
What will I become? 

347
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,530
Yeah... 

348
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,690
Seriously, what is this metaphor? 

349
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:48,880
Excuse me... 

350
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,810
Sakurai. 

351
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,870
If... 

352
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,270
If I quit... 

353
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,940
That was croaky scary. 

354
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,140
I'm sorry about that! 

355
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,820
Um... 

356
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,310
If I quit... 

357
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,870
Would you...

358
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:21,150
...have more fun at work?  

359
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,860
I'll kill you. 

360
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,350
I never thought about fun in work... 

361
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,900
...not until recently. 

362
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,470
Hey, hitmen!

363
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:48,450
Where are you?! Hey!

364
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:49,350
Let's go kill them! 

365
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:51,520
Yes, Sir!

366
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,560
Welcome. 

367
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,810
This looks terrible. 

368
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:47,750
Yeah.

369
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,720
It's not personal. 

370
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,850
Meaning? 

371
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:53,440
The company uses pro assassins. 

372
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,730
They get the job done in one hit. 

373
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:57,620
The target is a pro too. 

374
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,560
K? 

375
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,650
Their style is different. 

376
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:03,060
That was meant to look like a warning. 

377
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,480
It's an internal dispute. 

378
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,350
Can you tell the gun they used? 

379
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,080
Yeah, I can tell right away. 

380
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,350
Forensics! 

381
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,980
You're kidding. 

382
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,990
It was the same gun! 

383
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:17,750
Huh? 

384
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,310
The same as the one who attacked Nishino! 

385
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,520
He killed someone and ran! 

386
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,310
Nishino is not answering her phone! 

387
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:25,610
So, tell me her addre... 

388
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,190
Damn... 

389
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,230
Damn it! 

390
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,980
Hurry, Sakurai! 

391
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,480
Looks like you're unarmed. 

392
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,310
Which means... 

393
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:57,690
Can I take that as a good sign? 

394
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,750
Hosomi. 

395
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,100
Yeah? 

396
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:05,120
Hosomi. 

397
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,980
What do you like about me? 

398
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:10,870
Let's see... 

399
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:17,230
I like how normally cute you are, I guess. 

400
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,950
Can you call it normal and cute when I am a hitman? 

401
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,690
Nishino. 

402
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,870
I really do love you. 

403
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,800
It's okay. 

404
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:39,100
You and I can have a normal, 
happy life together. 

405
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,370
What even is "normal"? 

406
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:50,750
The "normal" I know

407
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,770
is totally exhausting. 

408
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:57,150
You have to squeeze into packed trains. 

409
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:59,860
You have to deal with gropers, and it's scary. 

410
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:03,080
You can't even kill your power harassing boss.  

411
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,150
Even if you have a baby... 

412
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,820
If they cry on the train, 

413
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,900
some jerk will yell at you. 

414
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,330
Even if you work at a store,

415
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:14,350
if some weirdo picks a fight with you, 

416
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:19,900
even when it's not your fault, you still have to apologize and say "I'm sorry, I'm sorry."  

417
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,690
Hosomi... 

418
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,270
Can you actually live that "normal" life? 

419
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,190
It's because... 

420
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:39,370
I couldn't do it. 

421
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,000
That's why I've come this far. 

422
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:50,560
Nishino... 

423
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:56,530
My happiness is... 

424
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:04,710
...this life as an assassin. 

425
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:43,970
I really loved you...

426
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,510
You should have known already... 

427
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,990
If you'd paid more attention... 

428
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:29,060
You would've known I was gonna kill you...

429
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,850
At least when you're gonna kill me... 

430
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:46,920
Look at me closely! 

431
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,550
Okay, got it. 

432
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:58,400
Leave the rest to me. 

433
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,450
Nishino. 

434
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:05,440
Maybe he wanted you

435
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,150
to be the one to kill him. 

436
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,110
Don't think too much about it. 

437
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:42,400
Huh? 

438
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:46,600
You just did what you had to do. 

439
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,330
Aaaah! 

440
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:02,320
Idiot! 

441
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,250
Idiot, idiot! 

442
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:06,350
Like I'd die so easily! 

443
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,660
I am...! 

444
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,300
The assassin...!

445
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:15,400
Kanako Nishino! 

446
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:18,310
Sakurai! 

447
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,950
Next stop, karaoke! 

448
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:24,400
I'll kill you! 

449
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:38,470
You could just went home for today, at least. 

450
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:45,420
It turned out okay, huh? 

451
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,350
Nishino is safe.

452
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:51,080
Yeah. 

453
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:53,480
To think I thought she was weak. 

454
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:58,150
Nishino is strong. 

455
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,620
I can tell. 

456
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:06,400
 She said she's fine while dumping you over a call after all.

457
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,230
Well... 

458
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:17,500
Someone out there probably likes a predictable,   

459
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,150
simple-minded guy like you somewhere.  

460
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:21,950
Yeah... 

461
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:24,730
Nishino said something similar. 

462
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:27,480
That she was closer than I thought. 

463
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:37,380
What's this? What are they? 

464
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,770
What's wrong?

465
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:44,800
From now on, please take care of me

466
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:50,150
I know I'm like this, but forgive me with a smile

467
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:54,940
Always cherish me, okay?

468
00:30:54,940 --> 00:31:00,310
Because I come with a lifetime guarantee
