1
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,350
Don't make a fuss. 

2
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,570
No way, no way, no way, arma-no-dillo!

3
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,400
Who is he? 

4
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,970
Someone from a different company? 

5
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:32,470
First time meeting one. 

6
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:35,020
Tell me everything you know about "K." 

7
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,300
K-K... K... K?

8
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,340
Kei Tanaka. 

9
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,020
I know you're connected to K. 

10
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,400
Who is K? 

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,130
Ah, b-b-but I, um...  

12
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,360
I really don't know anything! 

13
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,150
You barely have any communication with the outside. 

14
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,270
Do you erase them? 

15
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:03,150
I-I don't have many friends... 

16
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:08,460
Ah, but I do have a f-few... 

17
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,920
Are you...

18
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,900
...a newbie? 

19
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:11,940
Huh? 

20
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,990
Ah, um, I'm technically, um... 

21
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:17,750
For a mediator, I expected someone with more guts. 

22
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,690
I'm sure K would be someone from...

23
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,150
Don't move! 

24
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,280
Uh, what now? 

25
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,740
Well, how unexpected. 

26
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:42,560
So you're K? 

27
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,650
Rats, rats, rats, rats, I'm busted!

28
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:51,400
If you are really someone who could erase her presence... 

29
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,690
Sakurai, why are you here? 

30
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,440
I'll take responsibility. I'll call an ambulance.  

31
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,650
A robbery happened, you resisted, and you got shot.

32
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:34,940
Got it?

33
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,480
O-Okay. But...! 

34
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:42,150
Please don't look inside my room. 

35
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:56,610
Happy Kanako's Killer Life

36
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,610
Episode 5

37
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,930
Until you opened the entrance... 

38
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,210
You didn't realize you were being followed... 

39
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,050
Yes. 

40
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:11,600
And when you resisted,

41
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,980
you got shot with a gun. 

42
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,710
Then your boyfriend, who felt something was off, helped you.

43
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,110
No.

44
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,560
Huh? 

45
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,500
Boyfriend? Boyfriend.

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,750
Yes. 

47
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:30,560
That's a relieve that your boyfriend was nearby.  

48
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,310
I'll take responsibility. I'll call an ambulance. 

49
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,050
I was too useless... 

50
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,450
If he comes back, I'll...

51
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:42,520
No! 

52
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,460
Nishino... 

53
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,230
Never do anything dangerous. 

54
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,150
Sorry. 

55
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:55,730
Is there a reason why someone might bear a grudge against you?

56
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,060
Like, relationship troubles? 

57
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,530
No, not at all. 

58
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,350
I don't have any romantic drama like that. 

59
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,350
Ah, no.

60
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,190
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

61
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,900
Oh! Are you okay?

62
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,440
- Ah, wait. You should...
- Go and press that button over there.

63
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:18,260
Something feels off, though. 

64
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,530
Again...? 

65
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:20,150
Huh?! 

66
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:23,170
That's basically stalker behavior, you know. 

67
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,260
She said she has a boyfriend. 

68
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,970
No, no. That's not what I mean.  

69
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:29,330
I'm saying, does a normal robber bring a gun? 

70
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,060
Even if they had one, they'd just use it to threaten and take money, right? 

71
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,000
Is that what you mean? 

72
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,530
You've got a point. 

73
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,230
Let's go see her boyfriend. 

74
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,940
Smile Agency Ltd.

75
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,600
Hurry up!

76
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,190
- Where's the details? 
- It's in the drive! 

77
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:49,820
Thanks!

78
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,360
Where's the Master Gallery?

79
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,350
Ah, it's here!

80
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,550
How about the changes?

81
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,480
- Ah!
- Oh, excuse me.

82
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,230
Sakurai, excuse me.
Could you check this estimate?

83
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,980
We made it in time!

84
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,050
Thank goodness.

85
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:02,980
That's a relief.

86
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,690
Okay, this is approved.

87
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:06,900
Understood. 

88
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,540
I'm detective Takehara. 

89
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,960
I'm Omori. 

90
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,320
Sorry to bother you when you're busy. 

91
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:13,970
No, it's okay.

92
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,330
We made the deadline anyway.

93
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:16,980
I'm Yazawa, the company president. 

94
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,900
He's Sakurai. 

95
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:28,440
Sakurai, what do you do at the company? 

96
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,020
Sales. 

97
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,170
Sales? 

98
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:38,400
Sales?

99
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,400
Clients love his work. 

100
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,560
Even so... 

101
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,870
That must have been tough. 

102
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,230
Someone important to you got hurt. 

103
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,320
Someone important...? 

104
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,230
Someone important...? 

105
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:04,770
Sakurai, why were you near Nishino's house at the time of the incident? 

106
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,690
Are you cursed to die if you talk? 

107
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,230
We had plans to meet at night. 

108
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,940
He said he had plans to meet that night. 

109
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,080
I see. 

110
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,810
I'll get straight to the point. 

111
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,310
Is this...

112
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:34,230
...a romantic entanglement? 

113
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,150
That's right. 

114
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,440
Do you have any idea? 

115
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,730
Actually, a while ago... 

116
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:51,820
Nishino said she felt like a stranger was following her. 

117
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,520
Right?

118
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,580
Which means... 

119
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:02,400
There's a third party following Nishino without permission. In other words... 

120
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,740
A stalker is a possibility. 

121
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,990
A stalker?

122
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:07,880
Yes. 

123
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,350
The police will put all efforts into protecting Nishino. 

124
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,900
Thank you. 

125
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,530
Yes. 

126
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:14,850
Excuse us. 

127
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:16,530
Ah... 

128
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:17,670
Sorry.

129
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,370
One more thing... 

130
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:25,870
Do you know someone named K? 

131
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:26,950
K? 

132
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,440
Crystal Kay? 

133
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,980
Never mind. Let's go. 

134
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,410
Hey. 

135
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,310
This is all way too much delusion. 

136
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,010
What do you mean "protecting"?

137
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,020
That's a lie. 

138
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,400
Now what? 

139
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,220
That president is lying. 

140
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,920
About a lot of things. Everything.

141
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,930
Huh? 

142
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:55,860
Your proof? 

143
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:58,530
Intuition.

144
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,260
Let's investigate the whole company. 

145
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,100
How great do you think your intuition is? 

146
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,770
Thank you very much! 

147
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:13,170
We look forward to working with you again. 

148
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,400
That detective is a tough one. 

149
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,770
For now, let's make Nishino move.  

150
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:22,150
She must be feeling down too. 

151
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,130
Whoa! 

152
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,870
It says a designer place costs 400 thousand yen. 

153
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,920
Ebisu is really out of the question. 

154
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,560
The company is covering moving costs, right? 

155
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,020
Why not just go big and say it! 

156
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:35,690
You're right!

157
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:36,720
Yeah.

158
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,670
Oh, this one isn't bad. 

159
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,730
It's in Kichijoji. 

160
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:42,210
1DK, bath and toilet are separate. 80 thousand yen a month.   

161
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:43,470
That's cheap! 

162
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,870
Ah, it's 30-minute walk from the station... 

163
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,570
Oh, this is Musashi City too. 

164
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,110
But the rentals... 

165
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,680
Shimokita is nice too. 

166
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,310
Oh, this one's cheap. Why? 

167
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,100
Something's off about it. 

168
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,600
Skip it. 

169
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,420
What? But it's in Shimokita...

170
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,350
Kanako.

171
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,190
What's the point of moving from one stigmatized property to another? 

172
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,440
True. Right?

173
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,730
Um, excuse me. 

174
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,900
Are you sure about this? 

175
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,770
Since we can't send you back to a house where the suspect knows,

176
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,500
you'll be staying here until your new place is settled. 

177
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,650
Since it's police property, it's safe. 

178
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,920
No, no, no, that's bunny ears! 

179
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,150
How does a hitman staying at a police house even work? 

180
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,020
That's weird, huh? 

181
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,870
Thank you very much. 

182
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,530
This place makes it easier for us to guard too. 

183
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,310
Omori will also stay over. 

184
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,510
What?! 

185
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,600
Um, I think I'll just... 

186
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,690
As long as the suspect is carrying a gun,  

187
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,940
if you let your guard down, and you'll get shot again. 

188
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,130
Ah, well, but... 

189
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:57,310
Is there a problem with the police being here? 

190
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,810
No, not at all. 

191
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:02,980
Let's go. 

192
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,300
Come in. 

193
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,070
Okay... 

194
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,460
Wow~! 

195
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,660
How much is the rent here? 

196
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:17,520
What? 

197
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,770
Um... 

198
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:27,490
What are you doing? 

199
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,470
Preparing documents. 

200
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:33,030
Ah, document prep sounds tough, huh? 

201
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,670
I used to pull all-nighters doing that at my old job. 

202
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,190
Could you not look without asking? 

203
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,530
Sorry. 

204
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:51,400
Omori, what do you do on your days off? 

205
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,230
I don't like pointless small talk like that, so I'm usually alone. 

206
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,830
I'm sorry.

207
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,560
No way, no way, no way, no snail way!

208
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,900
Why does everyone in this industry talk so little?  

209
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,530
Yeah, that's true. 

210
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:07,500
No, it's fine. 

211
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:11,400
Even Sakurai is fine with it. 

212
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:16,100
Um, you're always with Takehara, right?   

213
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,610
Like a partner? 

214
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,440
Did she just ignore me? 

215
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,100
No, there was a reaction. 

216
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,620
Really? Is she mad?

217
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,730
Seems like she's not. 

218
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,530
Isn't calling him her partner okay? 

219
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:34,440
I see. 

220
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,960
Well, Takehara is a good person. 

221
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,250
If they weren't, working together would suck. 

222
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,420
Right? 

223
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,200
They sure get along, huh? 

224
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,300
Well, it's not just that... 

225
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,800
They probably respect each other. 

226
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,450
And help each other out, right?

227
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,940
Same with you with Sakurai. 

228
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:51,290
Oh, yeah.

229
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:51,770
Yeah. 

230
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:52,570
That's right.

231
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:53,100
Yeah. 

232
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,150
I'm sure of it! 

233
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,110
You like Takehara, don't you?

234
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,070
Ah. 

235
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:03,900
Huh? 

236
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,330
Wha... 

237
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,170
What?! 

238
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:17,400
How does your brain even work? 

239
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,230
I don't like Takehara or anything! 

240
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:23,450
Just so you know, I... 

241
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,350
Back in college, 

242
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:27,710
I was chosen as a tour model and stuff! 

243
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:31,910
And in Katsushika, Omori is a big deal! 

244
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:32,850
She's serious. 

245
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:37,980
It's only 9 minutes to this station from his house. 

246
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:39,820
This bus stop...

247
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,350
Good morning! 

248
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,870
Oh, Nishino. Have you decided on your new place? 

249
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:44,490
Yes. 

250
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:47,800
The contract is done and I'm planning to move this weekend.  

251
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:52,020
Most likely, since he lives alone, a place good for commuting would be best.

252
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:56,770
Yeah. Should we stage it as an accident?  

253
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:57,820
A new one? 

254
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:00,230
I'll do it! Since I've grown dull.

255
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,170
Okay. 

256
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,810
Alright. 

257
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:04,680
The target is... 

258
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,510
Senior Officer, Kazuo Takehara. 

259
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,090
Of the investigation... 

260
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,080
Wait, hold on! 

261
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,270
Takehara?! 

262
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,100
Yeah. 

263
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:11,900
This time... 

264
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,860
Uh, uh, you see... 

265
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,110
Isn't killing him unnecessary? 

266
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,170
He's dangerous. 

267
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,650
Eventually, he'll figure out the truth.   

268
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,130
But... 

269
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,560
You don't want to kill him? 

270
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,350
That's not it... 

271
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:32,800
You do it. 

272
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,060
So then, make it look like an accident.

273
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,350
Wait, wait, wait, wait! 

274
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,310
Please wait! 

275
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,060
I-I'll do it. 

276
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,400
I... 

277
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,980
 I'll kill the hitman who's targeting me. ... 

278
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,770
That way, Takehara doesn't have to die, right? 

279
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,070
Well, if you can get rid of the hitman... 

280
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,350
That should be the priority. 

281
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,230
Right? 

282
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,020
That's fine, isn't it? 

283
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:10,650
The target this time is a drug broker. 

284
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:13,480
He even sell inferior products to kids. 

285
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:15,520
Nishino, it's your return work. 

286
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,480
Sakurai, back her up. 

287
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,380
For now, I'm glad Takehara didn't have to die, but... 

288
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,970
I still have to take care of that other hitman. 

289
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:38,560
Once I see him...

290
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,880
Hello, my friend. 

291
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,650
It's me. 

292
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,400
The goods are ready. 

293
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,650
So I'm leaving from Narita tomorrow.  

294
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,730
No, no, no. 

295
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:48,900
Cash only. 

296
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,020
I told you. 

297
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,690
Business is business. 

298
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,170
Just kidding you!

299
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,150
Found him. I'll begin.  

300
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,400
Next time that hitman comes... 

301
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,490
I'll do this... 

302
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:05,690
And this... 

303
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:06,850
And this... 

304
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,060
This!

305
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,350
And this!

306
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,630
Then this!

307
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,500
It's fine. 

308
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,440
You'll feel better soon. 

309
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,130
You'll get sleepy... 

310
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:26,600
And die just like that. 

311
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,520
You bastard...! 

312
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,600
Ah! This is...!

313
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,730
It's that Dyson water drainage thing. 

314
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,900
This is it. 

315
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,310
What do you think of this? 

316
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,730
What? 

317
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:49,060
Is this good? 

318
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,190
Yeah... 

319
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:56,940
It sucks up trash? 

320
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,750
It's amazing... 

321
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,190
I see. 

322
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,150
And how about mopping?

323
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,680
How about mopping?! 

324
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,550
Mopping?! 

325
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,180
They're shiny! 

326
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,980
I knew it. 

327
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,050
I read the reviews, but... 

328
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:19,770
It's best to ask actual users, right? 

329
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,070
Whoa... 

330
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,270
Why do you have that? 

331
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,070
What is it? 

332
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,480
Rimowa!

333
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,150
Huh? 

334
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,400
Hey! 

335
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,650
Hey!

336
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:42,800
What do you think of this? 

337
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,110
Do you need this size? 

338
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,190
I...

339
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:49,870
I... 

340
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:51,850
I...? 

341
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:54,530
I... 

342
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,950
I actually use it a lot. 

343
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,980
I see. 

344
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:01,370
I like this color. 

345
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:02,940
Salmon pink? 

346
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:04,230
Huh? 

347
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,230
What? Is it wrong? 

348
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:13,720
Papaya... 

349
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,810
Orange... 

350
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,230
I see! It's the mint green series.  

351
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:27,490
This room sure has everything I want.  

352
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,650
You can take them. 

353
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:31,600
No way. 

354
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,230
That would be a crime. 

355
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,770
Whoa! 

356
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:39,440
This is nice, right? 

357
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,940
How are the breads? 

358
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:46,900
Huh? 

359
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,640
Hey! Wake up!

360
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,710
How are the bread?! 

361
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,370
Even if random... 

362
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,850
Random... 

363
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,300
Random bread... 

364
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:08,690
They become so fluffy. 

365
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,540
So it is amazing. 

366
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,940
Should I buy one? 

367
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,120
Ah, how about cleaning? The cleaning? 

368
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,600
I squirrel mess up... 

369
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,010
I'll kill you. 

370
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,100
Sakurai... 

371
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,400
Don't say that all of a sudden in a place like this. 

372
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,950
I know already. 

373
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,480
There's no suspicious person. 

374
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,570
Sakurai.

375
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:17,570
We kind of look like Shoplifting G-Men, huh? 

376
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,100
Thanks you very... 

377
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:52,810
Sshhhhh.

378
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:15,230
It would be about three minutes until Sakurai will notice something's off. 

379
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:20,650
I came to check on things today on you.

380
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,900
Impressive. 

381
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,310
You're really K. 

382
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,480
Interesting. 

383
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:14,650
I did it. 

384
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,440
We're in the third floor, K-block.

385
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,650
You should go back

386
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:18,890
Okay. 

387
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:55,520
Sakurai : There are no suspicious people

388
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:55,520
As expected of a
night moving company.

389
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,180
Next time for sure...  

390
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:05,900
Me-sphinx will kill him! 

391
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:27,020
Ow!

392
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,770
Huh? 

393
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,710
A-Are you okay? 

394
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,690
Sorry, I'm fine. 

395
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:40,400
I was trimming the flowers and cut my finger. 

396
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,130
Oh, hello. 

397
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,940
Did you just move in? 

398
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,670
Ah, yes. 

399
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:51,600
I'll be in your neighbor from today. 

400
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:55,020

401
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:57,410

Ah, bye then... 

404
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:26,160
He's so handsome! 

405
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:32,020
His name is Hosomi, he says! 

406
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:44,520
Nice to meet you, she said. 

407
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,190

This is frog. 

428
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:44,300
This is the thing where if you press "Next" at the bottom, it skips, right?

429
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,500
Huh? 

430
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:49,070
Then it means that the ones who do that don't watch this, huh?

431
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,070
Huh? 

432
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:53,400

no one's watching this?
