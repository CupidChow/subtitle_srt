1
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,530
You idiot! 

2
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,480
Are you pissing off the Ryudo gang?! 

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,830
The hitman called K did it! 

4
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:16,270
Huh?!

5
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:19,170
Man, it gave me chills. 

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,360
To think K was there. 

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,770
What's going on? 

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,250
The Ryudo group, including the head boss, were killed or disappeared. 

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,870
Disappeared? As in, overseas? 

10
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,170
No, I mean literally vanished. 

11
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,520
You know the hitman K? 

12
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:33,330
K... 

13
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:35,800
The hitman K? 

14
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,610
Who the hell is that? 

15
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:37,530
K? 

16
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:38,690
Is he real?

17
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:39,770
What's his next move? 

18
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,190
Kei's a ninja? 

19
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,810
I'm asking where K is and what he's doing! 

20
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,810
What's his target? 

21
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:46,600
K? 

22
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:48,540
K...?

23
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:01,830
I had forgotten. As I close my eyes

24
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:05,660
I reclaim the song of love

25
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:07,600
English muffin and... 

26
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:09,360
Hidden in the blue sky

27
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,190
Crispy bacon. 

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,900
I reach out once more

29
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,580
With an egg on top. 

30
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,250
With a special mayo! 

31
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:17,150
Ayano Tsuji

32
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,840
With just one heart

33
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,540
Don't let it be consumed by sorrow

34
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:27,910
I'll turn your sighs into a spring breeze

35
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,600
Want some? 

36
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:35,750
Riding up a sunlit hill on my bicycle

37
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:42,660
Carrying the memories I lost with you

38
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:45,410
I sure haven't killed someone yet. 

39
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,380
La la la la la, humming along

40
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:49,400
Killer Kanako's Day Off

41
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,400
As it colors my lips

42
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,880
Nishino. 

43
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,270
Take a break for a while. 

44
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,630
What? 

45
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:56,300
Did I mess up or something? 

46
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,830
You stood out too much. 

47
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:00,940
After what happened last time, the underground is having a field day. 

48
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:04,730
Even the higher-ups in the Ryudo group are looking for K with what happened on Chiba.   

49
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,270
Lay low. 

50
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,540
Want to go back to your hometown? 

51
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,780
No, wait... 

52
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,970
If I'm gonna take a break anyway, 

53
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,170
somewhere other than my hometown would be better. 

54
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,780
Okay. 

55
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,690
I can arrange a place here. 

56
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,100
It's a hidden forest. 

57
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,350
It's safe there as no one comes around.   

58
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,930
Brown bears appear there, but this Sezaki will stay with you, so you're safe.

59
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,280
Um, my hometown would be...

60
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,900
There's also the Philippines route but you'll need a passport. 

61
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,270
- My hometown would be...
- Oh, Sezaki? 

62
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,140
Someone's coming over. Her name is... 

63
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,540
Boss! 

64
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:40,560
I'll just go back home.

65
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,000
Are you sure?

66
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,100
By the way, any word from Detective Takehara?  

67
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,020
Don't lay a hand on my woman.

68
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,070
Um... 

69
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:02,480
I think I have no contact with him anymore...  

70
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,240
Passing through. 

71
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,190
Excuse me.

72
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:08,980
Ah, here it is. 

73
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,980
Excuse me. 

74
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,100
W-Why...?! 

75
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,200
Excuse me. 

76
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,440
I assigned Sakurai to guard you. 

77
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,700
No, no, no, no bunny way! 

78
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,500
What now? 

79
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,570
Just me and Sakurai together like this? 

80
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:43,360
For how long? 

81
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,410
Including transfers, about 2 hours 20 minutes. 

82
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:48,030
No, no, no, no, no snail way! 

83
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,060
How do we pass the time? 

84
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,170
More importantly, you need to ask him. 

85
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:54,090
Ask him why he said "Don't lay a hand on my woman"! 

86
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,770
Can you even ask him? 

87
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:00,020
I can't. 

88
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,830
This is awkward. 

89
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,150
I feel sick. 

90
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:13,170
Does talking to him feel like a death curse? 

91
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,730
That might actually be true. 

92
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,520
An act.
(shi-ba-i) 

93
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,060
Strawberry.
(i-chi-go) 

94
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,560
Ah, "ko" is fine too. 

95
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,060
I'll kill you.
(ko-ro-su-zo) 

96
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,850
"zo." 

97
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:39,560
Paramecium.
(zou-ri-mu-shi)

98
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:42,850
"Shi."

99
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:45,830
"Shi." 

100
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,980
Hey, hey. 

101
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,920
It's not a game of word chain. 

102
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,190
Huh? This isn't some travel attraction? 

103
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,350
It was an act to get the cops off your back. 

104
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,950
Ahh! 

105
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,560
Ah, the one you said back then? 

106
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,810
O-Of course I know it was! 

107
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,930
I knew it! 

108
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,470
Right? 

109
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,060
It was good acting! 

110
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,700
But seriously, someone saying

111
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,390
"Don't lay a hand on my woman."

112
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:14,260
is something even shoujo manga don't use that anymore.  

113
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,600
It's beyond old and it's just cringy. 

114
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,320
And the phrase "my woman" itself is totally outdated too! 

115
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,150
I sure cheetah-d it! 

116
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,570
Still hung up on her? 

117
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:40,990
I am not. 

118
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,600
I see.

119
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,760
Hey, Omori. 

120
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,980
Is he really her boyfriend?  

121
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,600
So you are hung up on her. 

122
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,540
That way of thinking is messed up. 

123
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,620
That kind of convenient delusion leads to stalking, you know.   

124
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,410
Yeah... 

125
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,430
Sorry! 

126
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,520
Have you heard about the Ryudo group? 

127
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,730
So it was K. 

128
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,330
Hey, Omori. 

129
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,230
Gropers are the enemy of women, right?  

130
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,730
What are you talking about now? 

131
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,190
I'm gonna hit you. 

132
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,130
I'm just thinking that K maybe... 

133
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,400
...is a woman.

134
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,310
What? 

135
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,870
Maybe she is a woman. 

136
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,100
Huh? 

137
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,630
Really? 

138
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:47,780
That's an interesting theory, Acting Inspector Takehara. 

139
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:58,400
Let's see who finds K first.   

140
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:06,290
Riding up a sunlit hill on my bicycle

141
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:12,980
Carrying the memories I lost with you

142
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:16,690
La la la la la, humming along

143
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,560
Want some? 

144
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:21,060
As it colors my lips

145
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:29,310
The happiness I found with you, like a blooming flower

146
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,860
Sakurai: Go back home. I'll kill you.

147
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,310
I'm sorry!

148
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:37,190
I had forgotten, as I open the window and run, this a song of love

149
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,980
Entrusting it to the blue sky

150
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,230
Kanako. 

151
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,310
Did you greet Dad? 

152
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,220
Not yet. 

153
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,200
Whoa... 

154
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,440
We can't eat this much if it's just the two of us.

155
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,720
It's fine, it's fine. 

156
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,880
Thank you for the food. 

157
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,000
Say, have you gotten used to the new company? 

158
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,140
Well, more or less.

159
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,490
I should probably greet your president or something. 

160
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:19,480
No, you don't have to.

161
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,190
Well, you look well, 
so it's kind of reassuring. 

162
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,370
Food's great. 

163
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:30,270
I thought you'd bring a boyfriend or something. 

164
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,470
No way. 

165
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:34,900
Mom, aren't you lonely? 

166
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:35,970
Not at all. 

167
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:38,990
I've made more friends and even use social media accounts. 

168
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,400
Really? Wow! 

169
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:45,080
There's someone named Jeff. 

170
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,860
Jeff?

171
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,930
Yes, he's a nice guy and loves Japan. 

172
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,070
He's foreign? 

173
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,150
He's from Florida. 

174
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:58,270
He's so handsome too!

175
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,280
Jeff from Florida?

176
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,970
Yeah, Jeff. Jeff. 

177
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,630
Here he is, here. 

178
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:13,170
Hmm? 

179
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,150
Wait, could he be a doctor? 

180
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,170
Huh? He was a neurosurgeon. 

181
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,360
But right now, he's a pilot. 

182
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,520
Of hereditary disease? 

183
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:22,830
Yeah. 

184
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:24,530
You know him? 

185
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,900
That's a scam! 

186
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,850
It's one of those international romance scams. 

187
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,310
Jeff is not that! 

188
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,900
No, no, no. 

189
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,230
We can't meet right now, but... 

190
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:38,150
He says he wants to come to Japan someday. 

191
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,670
He hasn't asked for money, though? 

192
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:44,240
He said that he has money problems. 

193
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,560
See?! 

194
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,710
Jeff is alright! Why you, Kanako! 

195
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,190
Right, Jeff?

196
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,270
Ah, our eyes met. 

197
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,850
What are you talking about?

198
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,190
It's definitely a scam, right?  

199
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,850
But Mom's totally over the moon about him. 

200
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:10,130
She says Jeff is alright! 

201
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,900
Who even is Jeff?! 

202
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,330
Just the name Jeff is already suspicious, right? 

203
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:16,810
If it were Benedict or something, it would be better.

204
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,930
I'm heading home. 

205
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,510
See you tomorrow. 

206
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:27,200
Since you're here, mind if we do some training? 

207
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,930
My body's getting stiff. 

208
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:29,810
Tomorrow morning then. 

209
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,900
You're finally up. 

210
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,030
Morning! 

211
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:55,970
Sleep in your room. There's a bed, you know. 

212
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,980
I fell asleep reading manga. 

213
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:04,330
How long do you plan on staying?  

214
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,790
Why not go outside? 

215
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:11,000
Already?! I was in full vacation mode just yesterday. 

216
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,940
Say, Kanako. 

217
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,150
Can I go and use your room?

218
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,200
Sure. 

219
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,030
Hm, what for? 

220
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:21,100
I want to become the wind. 

221
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,020
It's alright if I use your room, right?

222
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,900
Okay.

223
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,690
Huh? What do you mean? 

224
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:29,770
Because I'll become the wind.  

225
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,360
Huh? Wind? 

226
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,440
Huh? What's that? 

227
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,650
You want to become the wind? 

228
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,060
Kaze Fujii. 

229
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,070
Oh, you mean Kaze Fujii? 

230
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:40,230
So you want to become Kaze Fujii, huh? 

231
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,190
What do you mean by "become"? Become Kaze?

232
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:46,770
It means exactly what it sounds like. 

233
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,980
What? 

234
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,750
It's 5 PM. 

235
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,520
If you're playing outside... 

236
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,830
Please go back home. 

237
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,680
No way! It's already this late?!

238
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,830
Yeah.

239
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,900
I'm sorry. 

240
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,970
It's because my mom said she wants to become the wind.  

241
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,980
Huh? Was that funny? 

242
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,360
Did that really got Sakurai? 

243
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,600
Want to take a walk? 

244
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,270
Not like I can sleep anyway. 

245
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:31,220
Over there's my old elementary school. 

246
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:34,850
Wow, the building looks so nice now. 

247
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:39,030
Back then, this river flooded like crazy.

248
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:43,300
When I went to check it during a typhoon, my dad scolded me so bad.  

249
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,700
Oh, something's swimming. 

250
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,120
Wow! 

251
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,480
This place is still around! 

252
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,330
That's the barbershop I used to go. 

253
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:06,480
One time, they accidentally cut my earlobe. 

254
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,770
It just flapped open. 

255
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,900
That's a lame story, huh? 

256
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,000
Ah! 

257
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,330
After getting a haircut here, 

258
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,830
we always went to this bookstore.  

259
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:25,060
My dad bought me the new Conan volume.  

260
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,020
Huh? 

261
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:34,980
Conan! 

262
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,520
Detective Conan! 

263
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,630
Seriously, Sakurai? 

264
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:48,230
You don't know Conan? 

265
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:50,770
What have you been reading your whole life? 

266
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,860
Mister Ajikko. 

267
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,270
That's it? 

268
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:00,570
That's from Boss's bookshelves. 

269
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:13,690
What volume is that?

270
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,720
Lend that to me. 

271
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:20,990
Oh, that's the volume where Ai Haibara...

272
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,150
I'll kill you. 

273
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,600
Oh, sorry. That's a spoiler. 

274
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,770
I'll go buy some juice. 

275
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:28,850
Want some cola? 

276
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:31,790
Okay! 

277
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,870
See you tomorrow. Bye bye!

278
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:38,440
Bye!

279
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,150
Huh?! Kanako?! 

280
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,490
Long time, no see! 

281
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,040
It's me Juri! Juri, Juri! 

282
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,930
Yeah, long time, no see.

283
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:48,150
The last time I saw you was in school. 
So, that's seven or eight years ago? 

284
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:52,310
You've really glowed up. 
That's an octopus, huh? 

285
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:53,670
You're staying in Tokyo now, huh? 

286
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,640
Ah, yeah...

287
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,520
This is my daughter~! 

288
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,370
Hello~! 

289
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,730
Tana. 

290
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:06,800
Say hi to Mommy's friend. 

291
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,420
Good girl!

292
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,400
Yes, hello? 

293
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,150
I'm with someone right now. Yeah. 

294
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,300
You'll be here for awhile?

295
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,070
Let's go drinking with Miho. 
When are you free?  

296
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:19,610
No, it's not a guy. 

297
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,980
I'm heading there now. 
Yeah, I'll text you later. 

298
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,970
Yeah, yeah, I'm hanging up. 

299
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:24,770
Okay. 

300
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,630
Let's go!

301
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:29,400
Let's go see Daddy. 

302
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,730
Daddy's jealous, thinking I'm with a guy. 

303
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:44,500
Mom thinks I picked up a stray dog or something.  

304
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:56,000
You remember that girl who talked to me earlier today?  

305
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,870
Back in high school, she used to bully me like crazy.  

306
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,310
Can you believe that? 

307
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,690
Would you just go up and say hi like nothing happened? 

308
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:07,940
We were friends at first. 

309
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:12,850
But then one day, 
she just started ignoring me.  

310
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:17,490
She did all kinds of awful things. 

311
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,690
And because of that, I almost stopped going to school.  

312
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:26,050
But I didn't want to worry my mom, so I forced myself to go.  

313
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:30,400
I still have trauma from it. 

314
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,030
And now she just acts like a good person. 

315
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,520
Asking me to go out for drinks? 

316
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,560
Isn't that unfair? It is unfair, right?  

317
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,400
Should we kill her? 

318
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:09,200
It's okay. 

319
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,060
I'm going back. 

320
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,480
Then, I'll go back too.

321
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,980
You stay here. 

322
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,400
Quit this job too.

323
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,560
No!

324
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,970
You and I are different. 

325
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:45,940
If you die, there'll be no one left to eat that fried chicken. 

326
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:51,240
We'll look into Jeff. 

327
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,940
Why? 

328
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,870
Why do you only talk a lot... 

329
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:05,240
when it's about random things like this? 

330
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:15,170
Back then... 

331
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:20,360
Every day sure was miserable. 

332
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,230
I tried to end my life so many times. 

333
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:39,100
But I was too scared that I didn't do it. 

334
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:45,520
So I went to school pretending I was already a ghost. 

335
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,270
I... 

336
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:02,070
...was killing myself over and over... 

337
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,510
...long before I became a hitman. 

338
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:18,730
No! 

339
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,260
It's okay. 

340
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:46,410
So... 

341
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,950
Let's go together. 

342
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,060
Excuse me! 

343
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:22,060
Excuse me! 

344
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,190
I hate to trouble you, but... 

345
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:29,850
Is this the way to Nishino's place?  

346
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:37,930
Jeff is clear. 

347
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:38,940
I checked everything. 

348
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,690
He's coming to Japan. 

349
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:52,000
I had forgotten. As I close my eyes

350
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,820
This way? 

351
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,910
I reclaim the song of love

352
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,170
Thank you very much! 

353
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:55,910
Take care!

354
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:59,390
Hidden in the blue sky

355
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:03,270
I reach out once more

356
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:07,000
With just one heart

357
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,660
Don't let it be consumed by sorrow

358
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:18,070
I'll turn your sighs into a spring breeze

359
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:25,310
Riding up a sunlit hill on my bicycle

360
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:25,310
Killer Kanako's Day Off

361
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,310
The End

362
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:47,740
Who the hell are you?! 

363
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,840
I'm out.

364
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:12,210
You bastard! 

365
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:25,570
W-Wait a second! 

366
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,810
I-I got Boss's approval! 

367
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:38,770
You were still not finished, right? 

368
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:46,310
Amuro is about to show up next.

369
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,650
Huh?

370
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,910
Oh no. Sorry about that. 

371
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:58,530
One, two, heave-ho. 

372
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:04,800
Thanks.

Sakurai.

374
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:13,980
Heave you read up to Akai's death? 

375
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:20,310
I'll kill you. 

376
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,470
Ah... 

377
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:25,070
Not yet? 

378
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:25,770
Sorry! 

379
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:29,200
But it's not a big deal, or rather... 

380
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,650
He's not even dead, so... 

381
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:33,810
It's totally fine. 

382
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:36,360
I think you can still enjoy reading. 

383

For my final moment, I want it to be with you

396
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:54,830
Rather than saying goodbye like this

397
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:57,810
I'd rather die

398
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:00,730
