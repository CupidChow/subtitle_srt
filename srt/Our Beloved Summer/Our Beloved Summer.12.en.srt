00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:46,504
YOUTH DOCUMENTARY
OUR BELOVED SUMMER

2
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,258
Do you remember these two individuals

3
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:54,262
from an early summer ten years ago?

4
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:59,768
Kook Yeon-su really exhausts people.

5
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,853
Why does she live such an exhausting life?

6
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:04,981
Early birds just get tired earlier.

7
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,859
What is he going to be when he grows up?

8
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:09,861
We can sleep all we want when we're dead.

9
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,406
I'm sure he's going to be lazy
his whole life.

10
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,617
They were youthful 19 year-olds

11
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:20,163
who garnered national attention
and birthed so many memes.

12
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,664
Were they "loved" by people?

13
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,416
I enjoyed watching it too.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,293
They were

15
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,337
extremely immature.

16
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,631
At first, I thought it was just Ung.

17
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:33,384
But if you think about it,
Yeon-su seemed more immature.

18
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:34,511
But to be honest,

19
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,763
they're both a mess.

20
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:37,806
Hey!

21
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:41,017
Kook Yeon-su! You are crazy!

22
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,060
Darn it!

23
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,694
I thought you were a ghost!

24
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,283
But in fact,
they weren't always bickering.

25
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:00,870
They grew on each other
since they were always together.

26
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:04,207
I could feel something else.

27
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,000
You know what it is, right?

28
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,419
That was what made it intriguing.

29
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,964
MORNING, AN ALLEYWAY IN HWIYEONG-DONG

30
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:12,340
You're three minutes late.

31
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:14,509
Just three minutes?

32
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:16,803
Three minutes is like
three years for us seniors.

33
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,555
Don't be ridiculous.

34
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,224
I now go to school
30 minutes earlier thanks to you.

35
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:24,477
Exactly.
I'm helping you save a lot of time.

36
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:27,313
Gosh, do we have
to walk to school together?

37
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,233
Hey.

38
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,489
No, thanks.

39
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:39,033
This isn't from me. It's from my mom.

40
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:42,078
Do you even have breakfast
if you go to school this early?

41
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:45,456
Thanks.

42
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,543
Hey.

43
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,504
Did you borrow volume three as well?

44
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:52,589
Yes.

45
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,841
Can you just let me read in peace?

46
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:56,634
I'm a speedy reader.

47
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,553
Can you let me read it first?

48
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:01,973
Maybe that's why

49
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,768
many people are wondering
how they're doing.

50
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,604
WILL WE GET TO SEE THEM AGAIN
AFTER 10 YEARS?

51
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:11,733
I doubt it'll be easy
to get them in front of the camera again.

52
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,568
A lot of time has passed.

53
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:17,196
And as you know,
they were never that cordial.

54
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,532
Now that I think about it,

55
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,993
the atmosphere was very tense.
I know for a fact that

56
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:23,703
they don't get along.

57
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,705
Hey. Let's do a retake.

58
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:27,999
I doubt it'll be easy.

59
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:29,709
WHAT'S YOUR IDEAL TYPE?

60
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,544
Someone who's very kind.

61
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:35,089
A petite and adorable girl
with a round face.

62
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,925
Someone who'll shower me with love.

63
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,718
Someone with whom I can always be--

64
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,511
How about just raising a dog?

65
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:46,517
I'm certain that the man I like
will be someone really incredible.

66
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,855
We spent that summer watching these two.

67
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,567
How are they doing now?

68
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,778
-Anyway…
-One thing I know for sure is that--

69
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:59,322
…I won't have to see
this annoying face again.

70
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,407
That's what I wanted to say.

71
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:44,158
EPISODE 12
BEGIN AGAIN

72
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,341
How did you first find out about it?

73
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:03,928
Well…

74
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:07,265
I can't remember that well.

75
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,144
But I think I just did.

76
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,758
The earliest memory I have

77
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:46,262
is probably of that day.

78
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:52,018
Every fall around this time, on this day,

79
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,105
my parents

80
00:05:57,106 --> 00:06:00,568
always seemed very sad.

81
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,073
I didn't know back then.

82
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,699
I only found out later.

83
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:14,373
That's when I began having those dreams.

84
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,337
Dad.

85
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,882
Dad, where are you?

86
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:25,927
Dreams where I was abandoned repeatedly.

87
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,053
Dad.

88
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,184
In those dreams,

89
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:37,230
I couldn't see the face of the person
I was looking for.

90
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:38,773
-Hello.
-Welcome.

91
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,149
Come on in.

92
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,238
-Ung. Hello.
-Gosh.

93
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,572
Come on in.

94
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:49,033
Are you hungry? Would you like a hotteok?

95
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,244
But I knew

96
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:53,121
-that I wasn't looking for
-Wait here.

97
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,373
-the parents I have now.
-Welcome.

98
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:01,921
That's all.

99
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:04,423
There's not much to it.

100
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:10,972
I was lucky to have been adopted
by such great parents.

101
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,807
Do they know?

102
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,393
That I know?

103
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,647
No. I didn't see the need to tell them.

104
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:27,947
You must have been lonely.

105
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,997
It must have broken your heart.

106
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,000
How did you endure it all by yourself?

107
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,633
I want to comfort you…

108
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,681
but I don't know how.

109
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,270
And I don't know what to say.

110
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,939
You've already comforted me.

111
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,400
What?

112
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,487
You're here by my side
and listening to my story.

113
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:09,822
That's enough.

114
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:25,796
Are you leaving already?

115
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,132
Don't worry.

116
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,093
I'll leave once you fall asleep.

117
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:34,847
Okay.

118
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,770
I really have trouble sleeping.

119
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,855
Yes.

120
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:44,982
But strangely enough,

121
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,568
I was able to sleep soundly…

122
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,532
when you were by my side.

123
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:58,829
Yeon-su.

124
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,817
-Ho!
-Hey, Chang-sik.

125
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,028
I thought you'd be back soon,
but you were closed for days.

126
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,989
I was bored to death.

127
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:37,910
Since we took some time off,
we decided to sightsee a bit.

128
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:41,622
What's gotten into you?
You don't even close during the holidays.

129
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:44,000
Just because. The weather was lovely.

130
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,752
You should have taken me along with you.

131
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:50,006
How could you go without me
when you knew I was alone?

132
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,091
You hurt my feelings.

133
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,260
Chang-sik.

134
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,597
Kids nowadays use this term,

135
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,515
"K.Y.P."

136
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,559
What's that?

137
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:06,355
It's short for "Know your place."

138
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,399
I see. So?

139
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:14,238
But you never stop butting in.

140
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:19,577
-What do you mean?
-Gosh, you're so slow-witted.

141
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,203
-Gosh.
-Mr. Choi.

142
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,705
Hey, Ji-ung.

143
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,915
-When did you return?
-We came back yesterday.

144
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,710
Hold on. Are you already going to work?

145
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,462
-No, I'm actually going home.
-What?

146
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:31,839
I need to get changed and head back.

147
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,382
-My gosh.
-Are you still filming?

148
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,469
I didn't get much screen time lately.
Don't you need me?

149
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:37,928
-Geez.
-We're done filming.

150
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:41,515
-We had our final shoot a few days ago.
-Good work.

151
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,977
I bet Ung was difficult to deal with.
Thanks for everything.

152
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,063
But why in the world are you filming Ung?

153
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,565
He's quiet and boring.

154
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,859
I'm sure Ji-ung has his reasons.

155
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,861
You really don't know your place.

156
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:57,782
Do you have any idea
how popular my son is?

157
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:00,242
I'm asking you. Do you?

158
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,285
Answer me.

159
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:05,414
Fine. You're so snappy.

160
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:10,086
Ji-ung. Now that you're done,
what will you be filming next?

161
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,296
If this is going to be aired on TV,

162
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,424
you should film my hardware store

163
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:19,136
and tell everyone
that we sell great tools.

164
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,055
Gosh, why are you hitting me?

165
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:22,681
Just ignore him.

166
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,141
You must be tired. Go home.

167
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:28,813
If you've been working until now,
does that mean you stayed up all night?

168
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,564
No, I slept a bit at work.

169
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,734
I'll let you know if I film
anything interesting again.

170
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,153
-Okay.
-I should get going then.

171
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,572
-Go on. Come by for a meal later today.
-I will.

172
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,783
Okay. Bye.

173
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,368
What a well-mannered kid.

174
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:46,705
He sure is different from your son
when their names are so similar.

175
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:47,748
You're still here?

176
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,172
Hey, what is it?

177
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,175
No, I'm fine.

178
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:02,179
I just came home to get changed.

179
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:06,559
No, have the meeting. I'll leave soon.

180
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,352
Bye.

181
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,015
Are you expecting a call from someone?

182
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,475
What? No.

183
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:50,436
Then hurry up and dig in.

184
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,770
Fine.

185
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,498
Watch out! It's dripping everywhere!

186
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,791
Wasn't it my phone?

187
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:13,876
No, it was mine.

188
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,548
What's the matter with her?

189
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,843
Grandma, I'm leaving now.

190
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,859
I can call him first. It's not a big deal.

191
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,492
What if he just fell asleep?

192
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,915
Or maybe he's still up.

193
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,300
What?

194
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,344
Why are you here?

195
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:06,971
When did you get here?

196
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,014
You should have called.

197
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,475
I was working. I just came.

198
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,019
Do you usually go to work at this hour?

199
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,355
I would have left sooner
had you told me you'd come.

200
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,148
Did you get some sleep?

201
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:22,403
No, I wasn't sleepy.

202
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:26,657
You need to stop staying up
all night just because you're not sleepy.

203
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,033
Have you been drinking jujube tea?

204
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,869
You should still try to sleep.

205
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,246
How can you sleep
when you're out and about?

206
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:34,874
You're going to take
sleeping pills again, aren't you?

207
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:38,460
I told you those pills
aren't good for you in the long run.

208
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,629
You may not quit cold turkey,
but you should--

209
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:41,630
Are you done?

210
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:47,970
I'm just saying you should've stayed home
and tried to sleep.

211
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,515
I'd rather be here right now.

212
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:56,312
What's that face? Are you happy or not?

213
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,689
I'm ecstatic.

214
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,276
Then you should've just said so
from the get-go.

215
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,069
Let's go. I'll drive you.

216
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,488
To work? I can take the bus.

217
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,115
It's quicker by car.

218
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:10,326
You can't drive
when you haven't slept a wink.

219
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,994
-That's--
-There you go again.

220
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:15,080
Fine, but at least
let me drive you to the bus stop.

221
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,498
Okay?

222
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,208
Okay. That's fine.

223
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,962
How can you nag me
every time I say something?

224
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,256
It's only because you keep worrying me.

225
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,257
I'm not a kid.

226
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,384
Exactly. So when will you grow up, Ung?

227
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:41,148
Then when will you grow up, Yeon-su?

228
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,447
Can you skip work today?

229
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,284
No way.

230
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,287
Come on. Just one day will be fine.

231
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,289
Work isn't like school. I can't do that.

232
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,792
You don't need to drop me off.

233
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,335
Just go home and sleep.

234
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,671
But you said I could.

235
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:06,006
I've changed my mind, so don't follow me.

236
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,888
Ung.

237
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,265
I have a question.

238
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,559
Are we dating again?

239
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,354
Did you think we weren't all this time?

240
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,649
I mean, I just wanted to be sure.

241
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,568
I thought it was obvious enough.

242
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,531
Ung.

243
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,827
I hope we get along.

244
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,416
He's so straightforward.

245
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,585
She's so adorable.

246
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:04,106
-Stop staring.
-Do you have good news or something?

247
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,650
-Why?
-I mean,

248
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:11,864
you've been coming here to eat often,
which is rare for you.

249
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:14,908
How was your trip?

250
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:18,871
Good. We also enjoyed
the autumn leaves on our way home.

251
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,456
We took a lot of photos too.

252
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,082
Look.

253
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,253
Look. Isn't it beautiful?

254
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,047
Yes, it is.

255
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,508
Resting for a few days
made me want to take a longer break.

256
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,928
Should we just close down for good
and enjoy our free time?

257
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,930
I've been telling you to do that.

258
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,308
Just rest and live off your S.C.C.

259
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,018
What is that?

260
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:42,853
"Son's credit card."

261
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:46,065
That sounds lovely.

262
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,486
You should have taken me with you.

263
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,489
To our trip?

264
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,867
Well, you don't really like
visiting the countryside.

265
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,827
And we thought you'd be busy.

266
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,789
It's okay.

267
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,584
I'm really fine,
so take me with you next time.

268
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,797
Okay. We will.

269
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:13,675
Hey, Ung.

270
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:17,971
I heard you're done filming
the documentary.

271
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,306
What do you say?

272
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:25,312
Isn't it about time
you returned to being our cashier?

273
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:30,025
Honey, Ung told me
to quit working and use my S.C.C.

274
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,778
S.C.C? What is that?

275
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:34,947
Do you not know?
It stands for "son's credit card."

276
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:38,200
What? Hey, son. What about me?

277
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:41,036
You should do something
that's even better and more popular.

278
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,079
What is it?

279
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,497
M.A.L.F.Y.

280
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,124
M.A.L.F.Y…

281
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:49,211
-Is that something better?
-Of course. It's much better.

282
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,630
"Making a life for yourself."

283
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,467
Thank you for the meal.

284
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,177
-Come by for dinner too.
-"Making…"

285
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,888
-I'll make dumpling soup.
-Don't tempt me with food.

286
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,974
That's the only way I can bring you here.

287
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:06,436
Hey, wait. "Making a…"

288
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,234
-Mr. Park.
-Hey, Intern.

289
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:15,237
-Where are your seniors?
-They're in a meeting with Ms. Lee.

290
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,322
How was the shoot?

291
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,992
We ended it with an interview of the cast.

292
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:21,785
Well…

293
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:23,912
What is it?

294
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,249
It was strange.
They didn't even look at each other.

295
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,834
No, not them.

296
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:32,171
Did anything interesting happen?

297
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:35,132
You know, with Chae-ran and Ji-ung.

298
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:39,219
Please don't ask about them anymore.
I don't think this is right.

299
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:43,640
-What did you say?
-And if this is because you think

300
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,601
they have feelings for each other,

301
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,436
then I definitely can't tell you anything.

302
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:51,315
I don't think it's right
to suspect your colleagues like that.

303
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:56,069
And why do you think something's going on
between Ms. Jung and Mr. Kim?

304
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,239
They're hardworking people
who are only focused on…

305
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,159
Ms. Jung.

306
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,289
Is this what you've been up to lately?

307
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,043
What do you mean? What's wrong?

308
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:17,674
Oh, him? He always stands there
and rambles on like that.

309
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,510
I thought he was just practicing
for some speech.

310
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,638
-Why are you here anyway?
-Sorry?

311
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,514
I was too lenient on you, wasn't I?

312
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:28,310
I always let you go home on time,
but I guess you had nothing better to do.

313
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,103
No, Ms. Jung. That isn't--

314
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,980
I'm going to set you straight, Intern.

315
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,274
No more going home for you.

316
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:36,818
Hello?

317
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,029
Ms. Jung, it's a misunderstanding.

318
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:40,447
-Hello?
-Mr. Park.

319
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,032
-Mr. Park.
-Yes?

320
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,015
Are we ready?

321
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,100
Yes, sir.

322
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:18,193
Right. What was the last question again?

323
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,195
"What will you be doing

324
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,823
ten years from now?"

325
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,978
-Ji-ung, are you okay?
-What do you mean?

326
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:55,647
You didn't look well during the meeting.

327
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,734
You've been pulling all-nighters recently,
so just go home tonight.

328
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,153
-I'll wrap things up here.
-I'm fine.

329
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:05,782
You really don't look fine.
I think you should go home.

330
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,659
You could faint.

331
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,786
It's better to faint here than at home.

332
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:11,621
What?

333
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,665
Never mind.

334
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,835
I'll go home if I'm too exhausted,
so don't worry.

335
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:31,683
Look. You're running a fever.

336
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:32,809
This won't do. Get up.

337
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:35,771
-I'm really fine.
-I'm kicking you out. Go.

338
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,022
-Hey.
-Hurry.

339
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,940
-Hey.
-Go on.

340
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:42,444
I'm using this room tonight.
You can't come in.

341
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,821
What? What's going on?

342
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:49,534
Ji-ung's going home. He's running a fever
and might get us sick too.

343
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,787
-It's not that bad.
-What is it?

344
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:54,206
Is it a cold?

345
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:55,874
Go home, okay?

346
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:59,961
I suffered from a terrible flu last time.
Don't bother her, and just leave!

347
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,172
Take care, then.

348
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,176
Why is she overreacting all of a sudden?

349
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:10,806
Don't you think
she's just worried about you?

350
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,433
You're really slow-witted, aren't you?

351
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,851
Just go home.

352
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:16,394
Don't upset her.

353
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:18,146
What do you mean?

354
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:24,444
She hasn't been able to go home

355
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,613
since you've been pulling
all-nighters here.

356
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:29,950
I told her she could go home first.

357
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,952
Is she still
walking on eggshells around me?

358
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:35,080
Do you seriously think that's why?

359
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,459
Forget it. You're a lost cause.

360
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,211
How frustrating.

361
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:44,256
So frustrating.

362
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:00,981
This is terrible.

363
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:03,733
Gosh.

364
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,964
What's the matter with him now?

365
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:31,511
Gosh, that's hot.

366
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:35,891
Will you please focus?
We have so much to do.

367
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:39,686
They published the interview
you did last time.

368
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,523
Let's see.

369
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:46,735
They want to use
some of your drawings for the documentary.

370
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:50,197
Should I pick them out myself?
Or will you talk with Ji-ung about it?

371
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:54,159
What? Give it some thought.

372
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:58,371
By the way, I haven't seen him
since the shoot ended.

373
00:24:58,455 --> 00:24:59,539
He must be busy.

374
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,666
Also, the gallery called.

375
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,418
You wanted to see
the night lighting, right?

376
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:05,712
They said you can come today.
Should we go?

377
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:08,590
No. Not today.

378
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,342
I have something to do.

379
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,260
What? Drawing?

380
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:19,017
Then Ye-in will be in charge
of the online marketing.

381
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,310
Ji-un, please help her.

382
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:21,770
-Okay.
-Okay.

383
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:24,856
I think you've all become too lax
after finishing a big project.

384
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,567
We still have
one more project left for this year.

385
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,402
So let's focus on that.

386
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:30,695
-Okay.
-Okay.

387
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:33,031
Good work. That'll be all for today.

388
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:46,586
Do you want to have dinner with me
after I get off work today?

389
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,094
I left my pen behind.

390
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:07,107
I can't today. Something came up.

391
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:10,443
Seriously? Didn't he ask me
to skip work this morning?

392
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,114
Is he upset?

393
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:17,325
Why?

394
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,287
What is it?

395
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,040
Don't tell me you're upset--

396
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:27,711
Okay.

397
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,396
This house never feels welcoming.

398
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,486
Just a second…

399
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:58,783
I'll just rest for a minute.

400
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:22,515
The person you have called…

401
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:53,129
The person you have called…

402
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,987
Why are you here?

403
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:19,739
You have a fever.

404
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:28,498
It isn't that bad.

405
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:33,336
Right. It doesn't seem that bad.

406
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,505
When did you get here?

407
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:36,798
A while ago.

408
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:39,968
I had just looked up
how to medicate someone who's sleeping.

409
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:42,470
Oh, well. Take this.

410
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:52,897
Why does your house feel so empty?

411
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:55,775
You know I live here, right?

412
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:00,155
Why are you sick?

413
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:05,034
What kind of a question is that?

414
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,954
I mean, you've always been proud
of how healthy you were.

415
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:09,914
So I can't help but feel curious.

416
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:13,918
What did you do to get sick like this

417
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:16,129
and throw a pity party?

418
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,257
Nothing much.

419
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:22,427
I just pulled
a few all-nighters. That's all.

420
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,971
I'm going back to bed.

421
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:26,431
I won't see you out.

422
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:37,233
You must have
something you want to tell me.

423
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:39,861
I do.

424
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:42,405
But…

425
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:46,701
I'm not sure if I should
since you're sick right now.

426
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:03,593
Can I not hear it if I don't want to?

427
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,846
Yeon-su and I are dating again.

428
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,434
I guess I had no choice.

429
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:18,650
So? Why are you telling me this?

430
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,780
Because, just like when we were young,

431
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,699
I wanted you to be the first to know.

432
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:33,915
I got a girlfriend.

433
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,879
And just like then

434
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,465
I have nothing to say to you.

435
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,428
Should I congratulate you?

436
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:50,765
No, that's okay.

437
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,477
If you're done,

438
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,898
-can I go back to sleep?
-Yes.

439
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,363
One more thing.

440
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:06,573
Yes?

441
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:09,492
Can you please get lost?

442
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:12,912
Okay.

443
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,033
Hello?

444
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:51,910
Hey, are you up?

445
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:52,952
Yes.

446
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:57,749
I woke up a while ago.
I'm about to go out.

447
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,335
And you? Did you not sleep again?

448
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,045
No, I slept a bit.

449
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:08,468
Right. Did you have breakfast yet?

450
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:10,136
Have some breakfast and go to bed.

451
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:11,888
Okay.

452
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:14,682
Are you going to work?

453
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,684
Yes, I am.

454
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,311
I see.

455
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:19,646
That's right.

456
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,735
Well, what are you doing this weekend?

457
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:27,195
This weekend?

458
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,780
Yes, this weekend.

459
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,157
Do you want to hang out if you're free?

460
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,785
Let's see. This weekend…

461
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:35,912
If you're too busy, then it's okay.

462
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:39,874
No. I'm free this weekend. Let's meet.

463
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:41,793
Okay, then.

464
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,379
All right, then.

465
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:47,799
I should go to work now. I'm hanging up.

466
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:49,509
Okay.

467
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:55,807
Why does this feel so awkward?

468
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:00,269
Just be yourself, Yeon-su.

469
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,940
Darn it.
Maybe I shouldn't have asked to meet.

470
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:12,156
Gosh. It feels so awkward.

471
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,704
What are you doing?

472
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,332
-What?
-Aren't you going to work?

473
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:24,419
I am. I was just about to leave.

474
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:36,055
She's acting like she's caught some bug.

475
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:37,890
Hold on.

476
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:40,268
Maybe I did too.

477
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,738
I haven't talked to her
on the phone for so long.

478
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,114
Should I call her again?

479
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:55,158
No.

480
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,912
What is this? A water park?

481
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:03,541
My gosh!

482
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,836
Where's your head at?
Are you still half asleep?

483
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:10,089
This will be a pain to clean up.
Good luck.

484
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:13,051
-Hey, can you clean this up?
-What? But…

485
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:15,636
I didn't come here to clean.

486
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,138
Come on.

487
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,724
I'm your manager, not your servant!

488
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:24,854
I did ask him out first,
but he didn't seem that elated.

489
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:27,899
It didn't seem like
he was too excited to get back together.

490
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:29,525
So? Did he refuse to see you?

491
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,527
No, it's not that.

492
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,946
But it keeps bothering me.

493
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,532
It's as if I forced him
to hang out with me.

494
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:37,992
But you are seeing him.

495
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,995
Did you expect him to jump for joy?

496
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,122
You're not teenagers anymore, you know?

497
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:46,000
Still. It's not like him
to react that way.

498
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,252
He's definitely changed. It's weird.

499
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,546
Do you know what I find
the weirdest right now?

500
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,714
What?

501
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:54,592
The fact that you called me first.

502
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:59,764
You made the effort to call me
during work hours.

503
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,975
I'm not working right now. I'm driving.

504
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:05,478
You used to be a rude brat

505
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:07,772
who'd tell me to be brief
whenever I called you.

506
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:12,944
But you called me first,
and you're rambling on about Ung.

507
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,655
Well, that's because--

508
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:18,116
Okay. Who do you think has changed?

509
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:21,077
Who's the weirdest one here?

510
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:25,039
Anyway, stop worrying over
things like that. Just follow your heart.

511
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,542
It took you long enough
to get back together.

512
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:31,337
So can you please stop hesitating
and step up already? I'm hanging up.

513
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:34,382
Goodness. I can't believe I said that.

514
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:37,051
Hang up! Can you please hang up?

515
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,222
Gosh, that felt great.

516
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:43,891
What an adorable, little brat.

517
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,686
Gosh, why have I become so timid?

518
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,483
Has dating always been this difficult?

519
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,412
What did she want?

520
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,372
Ung and Yeon-su are going out again.

521
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:07,957
Are you serious?

522
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:14,672
Why did they go through all that
if they were going to get back together?

523
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,679
-How do you feel?
-What?

524
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:25,057
I know you don't really like him.

525
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,393
Gosh, my opinion doesn't matter.

526
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:29,729
She likes him, so what can I say?

527
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:34,358
That boy looks so sickly.

528
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,903
I'm sure he's fine.

529
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:40,907
But I am worried about his mental health.

530
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:43,242
He's a bit…

531
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:48,414
Never mind. Anyway, I'll keep
an eye on them. Don't you worry.

532
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:53,169
Or should I introduce her
to a few more men?

533
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:57,798
There are many wonderful candidates.

534
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:01,677
No, it's okay. Don't bother. Let her be.

535
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:02,887
Have this.

536
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:05,056
It's fine.

537
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:06,432
You must like him.

538
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:09,727
Not at all. Why would I like
that good-for-nothing?

539
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,355
Then take your time.

540
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:15,149
I should find her a good man

541
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,777
before I get any older and croak.

542
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,112
I don't have much time.

543
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:24,075
I have to see him again.

544
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:26,827
The building is quite huge
and there are many shops around here.

545
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:32,333
-Is it three stories tall?
-Yes.

546
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:40,132
It'd be nice if you give
this area a lot of exposure.

547
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:43,469
The sunset looks beautiful from up here.

548
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,012
Okay. I'll let them know.

549
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,681
Do you have any other requests?

550
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:50,434
I'm sure you'll do a great job.

551
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:52,687
Let me check the time.

552
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:55,106
You'll be able to see the sunset.

553
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:57,024
Take a look around with your colleague.

554
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,902
I'm here alone today.
I'll come by with them again next time.

555
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:03,072
What? I thought you came with him.

556
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,159
He's been here for a while.

557
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,121
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

558
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:28,514
I had forgotten…

559
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:45,698
What are you doing here?

560
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,409
…who I was in love with.

561
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:51,162
Are you here to see me?

562
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:55,750
Why did you want to meet on the weekend?

563
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:58,127
What?

564
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:00,504
I can't wait

565
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,590
that long.

566
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:06,302
Whether he changed or not doesn't matter.

567
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,888
Get back to work. I won't get in your way.

568
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:12,600
I didn't know about this place.

569
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,770
I could hold my exhibition here someday.

570
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:23,652
It was Ung.

571
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:26,447
I just loved him for who he was.

572
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:37,500
It won't take long.
Just wait a little while.

573
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:47,009
I was right.

574
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,720
The weekend was too far away.

575
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,940
This way.

576
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,951
There's an exhibition hall upstairs.

577
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:27,383
EDITING ROOM

578
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:39,895
Ji-ung, are you sure
you're feeling better?

579
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:43,107
Yes. You took my temperature earlier.

580
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,777
Did something good happen?

581
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:49,613
No.

582
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:57,079
Can we use a different insert?

583
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:59,748
Yes, we can. I'll find you one.

584
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:05,087
Thank you.

585
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,351
HOT AND SAVORY ROASTED CHESTNUTS

586
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,951
This feels like

587
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:38,412
we're on a date today.

588
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:45,836
It finally feels like
we're going out again.

589
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:51,884
It took a long time,

590
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:53,844
didn't it?

591
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,399
Darn these corn dogs.

592
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,820
-Can you hold this for me?
-No.

593
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:13,614
Okay, then.

594
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:36,887
-Do you want a corn dog?
-Okay.

595
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:44,061
-Let's go.
-This looks tasty.

596
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:47,565
BEGIN AGAIN

597
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:53,070
Mr. Kim.

598
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:56,532
What was that? You just saw me.

599
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:59,410
-Were you just going to walk by?
-What brings you here?

600
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:01,537
You know I'm doing a special documentary.

601
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,999
Is Mr. Choi done with his documentary?

602
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:08,043
How's it going?
I'm really looking forward to it.

603
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:10,337
We're done shooting,
and we're editing now.

604
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,590
Are you going to use my footage too?

605
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:15,342
By the way,
is Mr. Choi very busy these days?

606
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:18,345
Is he still busy even after the shoot,

607
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,347
or is he just pretending to be?

608
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:22,725
I just can't seem to reach him.

609
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:35,404
Don't tell me that's your dinner.

610
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:38,449
That won't fill you up. Chi-seong.

611
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:40,367
Goodbye. Yes?

612
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:41,535
Am I done for today?

613
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:44,121
Yes. I thought
you were going to head home.

614
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:47,499
I'm going to have dinner with him.

615
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,917
Just you two?

616
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:52,004
What do you say?
I have some stuff to ask you anyway.

617
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:55,132
I was just going to have
a light meal while editing.

618
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,885
Are you that busy?

619
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:01,013
Well…

620
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:05,684
Now, tell me.

621
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:09,313
Explain the look
on your face from earlier.

622
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:10,439
What look?

623
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:13,275
When I said I couldn't reach Mr. Choi,

624
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,820
this was how you looked at me.

625
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:19,740
That's just how I look.

626
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:22,743
That's not true. I definitely saw it.

627
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:26,997
What is it? Tell me.

628
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:28,916
Has word got out
that Mr. Choi rejected me?

629
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,756
It seems like
you're the one telling people.

630
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,593
Then do they all know that
we're acting like the rumors are true?

631
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,930
You're the first person to tell me this.

632
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:46,475
Then do they also know
that Mr. Choi likes Ms. Kook?

633
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,520
I guess they do.

634
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,648
Could he not hide it better?

635
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:54,942
You knew?

636
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:57,319
They'll soon know
that the feeling is mutual.

637
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,407
You know a lot of things.

638
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:05,327
Do you want anything else?

639
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:07,955
Ma'am, can we get
a bottle of beer and soju?

640
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:08,956
Coming right up.

641
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:11,375
That's for me. You can order your own.

642
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:15,254
We can't be sober for this kind of talk.

643
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:22,511
How did you know that I'd be there?

644
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:25,681
Ye-in from your team told me.

645
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:28,392
Why did you contact her?

646
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:30,102
She contacted me first.

647
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:31,270
Why?

648
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:35,190
She was the only person
who asked if the scandal was true.

649
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,318
Oh, that.

650
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:47,744
I'm sure you already know,
but it was a false report.

651
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:56,003
Interesting, right?
All because I know a celebrity.

652
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,049
-But…
-Yes?

653
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:04,178
-…the photos were real.
-What?

654
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:08,432
I didn't know you were close enough
to go over to her house.

655
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:11,768
Hold on. I'm sure you could tell
from the photos,

656
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:13,645
but I didn't actually go inside the house.

657
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:15,939
Well, they can't take photos
of inside the house.

658
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:19,651
It's true. I was invited but I declined.

659
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:21,904
She invited you?

660
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:26,074
She also invited Eun-ho, I think.

661
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:28,744
So she invited you over to her place.

662
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:31,330
Is that important right now?

663
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:36,043
Well, it wasn't before.
But I'm not so sure now.

664
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:37,628
Hey.

665
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:46,428
-We're here.
-If you go now, things will be awkward.

666
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:47,971
Hey.

667
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:51,683
Look at you standing
in front of a woman's house again.

668
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:52,684
Hey.

669
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:55,103
Is this a new habit you picked up?
You've changed.

670
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:56,438
That's enough.

671
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:00,817
-Do you know what I hate right now?
-What?

672
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:02,528
We're not students anymore.

673
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:06,281
You don't have to go home so early.

674
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:09,368
Come back outside.

675
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:16,917
Come here.

676
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,669
It's too early to go home.

677
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:20,379
No. You can't go.

678
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:24,132
Who is that?

679
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:25,884
Is that you, Yeon-su?

680
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:32,558
Who in the world
is still out at this hour?

681
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:43,944
Would you like…

682
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:50,284
-to come over for some jujube tea?
-What?

683
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:51,952
I'm serious.

684
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:54,204
I want to get rid of…

685
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:55,330
I mean…

686
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:57,791
Let's have some together.

687
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:04,256
Pick it up. It's okay.

688
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:21,898
Or do you want to go see something lame?

689
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:27,446
I saw it coming,

690
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:31,033
so I wasn't that shocked.

691
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:48,133
The thing is,

692
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:52,721
I didn't see any harm in having a crush

693
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:55,349
since I never had one before.

694
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:57,726
But now that I do,

695
00:48:57,809 --> 00:49:00,437
I feel motivated every morning

696
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:04,191
and I become hopeful
over the smallest things.

697
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:08,111
It makes me feel really special.

698
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:14,534
On top of that,
my imagination started going wild.

699
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,912
I even thought of becoming
a writer because of that.

700
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:19,915
I thought that was my calling.

701
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:25,962
This all came to me
after I started having a crush on him.

702
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:30,092
So how great is that?

703
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:43,480
No.

704
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,691
To be honest, it sucks.

705
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:48,527
How could he make me feel so miserable?

706
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:54,658
I feel like a worthless person

707
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:57,953
who came in between their precious love.

708
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:01,248
Do you get what I mean?

709
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:09,673
This is so wrong. I give up on my crush.

710
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:15,470
I take back what I just said.

711
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:17,931
I know.

712
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:21,059
Know what?

713
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:24,104
That I can't give up on him?

714
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:28,775
So annoying.

715
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:31,361
What? Don't get me wrong.

716
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:36,283
I'm not talking about you.
I'm talking about this lousy situation.

717
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:43,790
It gets better.

718
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:48,044
Having a crush on someone

719
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:51,256
is hard at first.

720
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:53,341
After a while,

721
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:55,761
it gets even worse.

722
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:58,096
Then…

723
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:01,433
it becomes unbearable.

724
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:03,602
But after that…

725
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:07,439
you get used to it.

726
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:11,443
Does that mean I'll be able to give up?

727
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:13,445
No.

728
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:19,201
You get used to the pain

729
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:22,454
that you eventually become numb…

730
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:28,168
and you get used to the heartache.

731
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:33,048
Then…

732
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:37,677
when does it stop?

733
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:41,890
Well…

734
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:47,979
I haven't thought of that.

735
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:53,109
Having a crush is so miserable.

736
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:01,451
Thank you

737
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:04,412
for helping me come to my senses.

738
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:18,218
The gallery at this hour? Isn't it closed?

739
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:19,761
It won't take long.

740
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:24,933
What? You have the key card?

741
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:30,897
Do you want to come in?

742
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:45,620
Is this where you'll be holding
your solo exhibition?

743
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:46,580
Yes.

744
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:52,127
I forgot what a great artist you were,

745
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:53,211
Mr. Choi.

746
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:59,342
But why did you have to come
and check at this hour?

747
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:03,346
I'm thinking of holding
a nighttime exhibition.

748
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:04,514
Late at night?

749
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:07,434
Yes. It'll last throughout the night.

750
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:12,606
I doubt many people will come
if it's too late.

751
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,816
Promoting your exhibition
won't be easy either.

752
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,277
That's why my idea keeps getting rejected.

753
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:22,532
Artists really do think differently
than us regular people.

754
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:25,160
But why at this hour?

755
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:29,748
Because it's when I drew them.

756
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:30,999
Plus…

757
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:35,003
it's when I'm always awake.

758
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:24,844
Just now,

759
00:54:26,262 --> 00:54:29,599
I imagined the time you spent awake
alone at this hour.

760
00:54:31,267 --> 00:54:32,769
It must have been lonely.

761
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:39,442
What goes through your mind
when you're drawing?

762
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:45,198
What do you think about

763
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:49,452
during that long period of time?

764
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:53,581
I'm not sure.

765
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:56,459
I never really thought about it.

766
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:03,049
But I couldn't have imagined
anything as perfect as this.

767
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:17,731
Every thin line that I drew…

768
00:55:19,315 --> 00:55:20,567
Every second

769
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:23,028
that went by…

770
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:32,871
Every year…

771
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:38,918
Every moment…

772
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:44,841
Yeon-su was always there.

773
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:49,721
What did you imagine?

774
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:52,932
And continuously…

775
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:02,442
I will spend all of my time

776
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:13,119
loving Kook Yeon-su.

777
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:30,845
Let's go home.

778
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:33,681
Okay.

779
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:21,146
EPILOGUE

780
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:32,115
If there's an end to this crush,

781
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,910
I hope it's now.

782
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:10,111
Your fever's down. I'm leaving now.

783
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:12,280
I told you to leave earlier.

784
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:18,745
What now? Do you have something to say?

785
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:25,585
Hey, do you want to move in with me?

786
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:26,794
What?

787
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:31,424
Your place feels somewhat lonely.

788
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:35,011
Cut the nonsense and go already.

789
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:36,638
Thank goodness.

790
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:39,265
I was worried you'd say yes.

791
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:41,893
Rest up.

792
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:44,687
You should always sleep at home.

793
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:47,649
And that includes my place too.

794
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:54,489
I'm sick and tired of…

795
00:58:57,116 --> 00:59:00,328
always being the bad guy.

796
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:10,213
BEGIN AGAIN

797
00:59:30,858 --> 00:59:34,195
I want to keep living in this world.

798
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:38,199
Because misfortune always comes
disguised as happiness.

799
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:39,701
It's nothing.

800
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:42,829
Let's just ignore it.

801
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:45,373
I'm not going to be friends with you.

802
00:59:45,456 --> 00:59:47,875
How are you going to end it?

803
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:50,420
But Ji-ung… Why aren't you looking at me?

804
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:53,631
I just don't get
why you're seeing Yeon-su again.

805
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:56,884
They say couples who fight
and break up often…

806
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:59,012
What are you doing, Yeon-su?

807
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:01,014
…have a higher chance
of breaking up again.

808
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:09,689
