1
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:45,420
I'm sure it's obvious.

2
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:47,589
He liked me first.

3
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:51,384
Is that what she said?

4
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,636
Is she ill or something?

5
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,057
He followed me around
even after the documentary had ended.

6
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,852
I believe he asked me out first.

7
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:05,190
Gosh, I should've snapped out of it
and run away

8
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:06,941
when she threw herself at me.

9
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,781
Well, I don't remember.

10
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:15,950
It's not anything
worth remembering after all.

11
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:19,829
She doesn't remember? My gosh.

12
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,415
I remember clearly.

13
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:25,835
It was that day
when everything started going haywire.

14
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:29,923
Gosh.

15
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:33,301
It was the final day of the shoot.

16
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:35,220
It's raining cats and dogs.

17
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:37,806
This wasn't in the forecast.

18
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,098
How's your camera?

19
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,475
It's fine.

20
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:43,561
But we do have a problem.
It has run out of battery.

21
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,188
What?

22
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:48,525
This is the perfect place
to end our shoot.

23
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:52,445
I'm sure this is just a sudden shower.

24
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:55,573
Let me go get more batteries
and some umbrellas.

25
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:58,701
Wait here.
We have to have our final interview.

26
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,328
Just the two of us?

27
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:01,955
It won't take long.

28
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:03,498
Let me go with…

29
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:18,638
How should I put it?

30
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,268
Everything felt awkward that day.

31
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,730
It was just very awkward.

32
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,567
It was sunny until just a while ago.

33
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,360
I know.

34
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,373
I started worrying about her
all of a sudden.

35
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,560
What's this for?

36
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:13,318
Thanks.

37
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:20,074
Everything felt a bit different.

38
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,492
Aren't you cold?

39
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,912
No. Not at all.

40
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:32,295
Maybe it was
because it was our last shoot.

41
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:50,980
And…

42
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,234
I wasn't the only one who felt that way.

43
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,820
She also…

44
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,992
Don't make me laugh.

45
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:05,828
Is that what he said?

46
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,540
He's fabricated his memory again.

47
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,089
It wasn't like that at all.

48
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,298
What are you looking at?

49
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,931
It was like every other day.

50
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,935
Stop distracting me and sit down.

51
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:38,903
It was sunny until just a while ago.

52
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,363
Atmospheric instability.

53
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,574
The upper layers of the atmosphere
contain cool air.

54
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:46,995
The sharp increase in temperature
has made the atmosphere unstable.

55
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,038
The strong updraft creates rain clouds--

56
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,667
Do you have to do this now?
You're tiring me out.

57
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:56,337
I'm only telling you since you probably
didn't pay attention in class.

58
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,632
Choi Ung was still dumb as usual.

59
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,603
And he was still an idiot.

60
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:13,563
What are you doing?

61
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,525
Oh, did you notice?

62
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:24,240
-Just keep it on.
-It's okay.

63
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,242
No, don't force yourself. Just wear it.

64
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,077
No, I'm fine.

65
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,120
Gosh.

66
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:30,872
Take it. Here.

67
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,843
The minor details may be different but…

68
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:48,931
He must remember himself
as some really amazing guy.

69
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,893
She must remember herself
as being all nonchalant,

70
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:54,187
but she was the one who was odd that day.

71
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,190
I was just being my usual self that day.

72
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,275
It was unlike her to do that.

73
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:00,651
He was the one who--

74
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,862
She was setting the mood.

75
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,497
I need to move the cabbage.

76
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,918
You're not going to mention
how she and I dated, are you?

77
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,461
I'm not sure. That's up to me.

78
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,296
Are you insane? You can't.

79
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,424
As the producer, I have the right.

80
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,636
Ni*e, C*ca *ola, M****ald's.

81
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,638
S**s***, V*lv*, Lo*** Vui****on, Cha*el.

82
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,349
****ole, ****ard, **it.

83
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:33,601
**tch, *****ss, ****er,

84
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,312
***** you, **** you, **** off.

85
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,482
Air it if you want,

86
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,484
but you'll have to censor
everything I say.

87
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,486
You guys are like twins.

88
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:47,365
Don't you dare mention
anything about us dating.

89
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,367
Are we done?

90
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:53,663
THE BOY, OR THE GIRL, WE LIKED THEN

91
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:57,708
EPISODE 4

92
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:03,005
So these are your terms?

93
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,842
I'll be straightforward
since you know everything.

94
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,969
We're not doing this because we want to.

95
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:10,346
In fact, it'll be extremely uncomfortable.

96
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,516
Is it uncomfortable for you? Not me.

97
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,601
Gosh. I wonder why.

98
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,019
Really? Are you?

99
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,313
I'm relieved.

100
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:23,025
Since you're quite childish and pathetic,

101
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,360
I was worried about you.

102
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,571
Pathetic?

103
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:30,158
I beg to differ. A lot of time has passed.

104
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,827
And as you can see,
I've changed quite a bit. Well…

105
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:37,248
I'm successful enough for someone
to visit and beg to work with me.

106
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:40,251
Hey. I never begged.

107
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,546
You're the one
who picked a fight by calling me pathetic.

108
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,797
I'm sorry,

109
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,467
but can I read this in peace?

110
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,808
DO NOT FILM MY PRIVATE LIFE
WITHOUT CONSENT

111
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,977
VIOLATION OF THE ABOVE TERMS
WILL LEAD TO TERMINATION OF THE SHOOT

112
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,772
TERMS AND CONDITIONS

113
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,941
DO NOT ANNOY ME
DO NOT BOTHER ME

114
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:09,572
All right. I'll do my best
to respect your wishes.

115
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:14,160
First of all, you need to get used
to having cameras around you.

116
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:17,830
We won't do anything special.
You can go on with your daily lives.

117
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,625
We'll also film you two
spending time together.

118
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:25,254
All I do is go to work then go home.
Would that be okay?

119
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,049
And I doubt my boss will let you film me.

120
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:30,468
He's already said yes, so we'll be there.

121
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,803
He was happy
his project would gain attention.

122
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,598
I can't work
if there are others around me.

123
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,517
Then we'll just set up the camera.

124
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,895
Do you honestly think
this will be entertaining?

125
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:43,189
I can already see that it'll be boring.

126
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:46,234
That's up to me to decide,
so don't you worry.

127
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,944
Any other questions?

128
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:51,531
The both of you seem to be
okay with the shoot.

129
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:52,698
Everything's fine, right?

130
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,201
Let's give it a shot.

131
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,086
Ji-ung. I'm afraid this will be a flop.

132
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,894
Hey, I'm here!

133
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,190
What's this?

134
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,819
Are you filming again?

135
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,489
Are you filming him too?

136
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,200
-Hello.
-Hey.

137
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:40,162
By the way… Hey.
What's the concept for today?

138
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:43,165
Don't worry about that.
You can just go ahead and eat.

139
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,835
-How could I not worry about that?
-Goodness.

140
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,713
Chang-sik, you're here. Over here.

141
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:51,507
By the way, Ji-ung,
are you not filming my hardware store?

142
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,425
Gosh.

143
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,556
You're doing this again with Ung?

144
00:09:58,639 --> 00:09:59,890
Have you gone insane?

145
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,935
Do you think I wanted to do this?

146
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,438
This is just one of those things
I can't help but do

147
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,356
just to make ends meet.

148
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,525
Are you okay seeing him again?

149
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,361
-Are you guys--
-Enough with your nonsense.

150
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,824
What's over is over.

151
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:19,535
-Get a grip, okay?
-It's not like that.

152
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,955
When did you get here?

153
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,541
Don't worry about us and talk freely.

154
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,628
You won't be able
to air this if we talk freely.

155
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:32,632
Most office workers
rest or sleep on the weekends,

156
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:33,883
but not me.

157
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:37,303
I hate wasting time.

158
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:40,264
That's why spend my weekends productively.

159
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:43,768
Usually, I jog in the morning.

160
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:47,188
-I don't like naps.
-She's enjoying this.

161
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,814
You should only sleep at night.

162
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,735
I hate being lazy in the day
and taking naps like someone does.

163
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,196
Anyway, I'll take it slow today.

164
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,489
Follow me.

165
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:01,827
It's so obvious
she was looking forward to this.

166
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,122
What is she trying to do?

167
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,775
STAR START-UP COMPANY

168
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:05,141
It's our new menu. Try it.

169
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:14,775
How is it? Good, right?

170
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,945
-Not really.
-Go home. Why are you here?

171
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,155
Get lost.

172
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:26,662
Hey, stop filming and
come help me peel these onions.

173
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,330
Consider me invisible.

174
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,250
Poor Mr. Kim.

175
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,420
You need to make this entertaining,
yet here I am, peeling onions.

176
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,382
Should I peel them
in an entertaining manner?

177
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,178
He must be insane.

178
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,185
Hi, guys.

179
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,311
Why the long faces?

180
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,815
Where are the new staff members?

181
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:56,525
Right.

182
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,069
-Bye.
-Dong-il.

183
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,780
I'm doing my best,

184
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,115
but they're already busy.

185
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,035
The ones who are available
don't want to work with you.

186
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,536
That's not my fault.

187
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,540
How could you not help us
after forcing me to do this?

188
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:12,958
All right.

189
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:16,420
I promise to send you some reliable staff,

190
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,423
so hang in there.

191
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,384
Chae-ran, I'm sorry
you have to go through this.

192
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,518
-Any salvageable footage?
-No, not at all.

193
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,898
Call them over right now.

194
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:39,902
What?

195
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,112
Ji-ung.

196
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,491
Are you not here?

197
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:49,537
Did he leave?

198
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:06,178
This filming could come to an end
more quickly than I expected.

199
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,352
Finally, some peace.

200
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:45,092
I can't sleep deeply.

201
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:52,266
I'm always half-awake.

202
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:03,986
I probably have 500 dreams at a time.

203
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:19,001
That's why I often can't differentiate

204
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,712
a dream from reality.

205
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,224
-Hey.
-This is probably a dream.

206
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,559
Are you all right?

207
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,434
-What was that?
-What?

208
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,104
What? What are you doing here?

209
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,147
What was that?

210
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,358
You're real.

211
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:26,902
What are you talking about?
Were you dreaming?

212
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,405
When did you come here?

213
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,949
You came over unannounced. I was startled.

214
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:33,367
I just arrived.

215
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,202
Ji-ung wanted to talk.

216
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,706
Why are you sleeping during the day?

217
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:40,708
I can't sleep well.

218
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,418
Why not?

219
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:51,844
Where's Ji-ung?

220
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,930
He went out for a minute.

221
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,390
I see.

222
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:01,562
Gosh.

223
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:23,167
I'm going to head down to my studio.

224
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:24,835
What?

225
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:29,757
If you have nothing to do,
check out my drawings.

226
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,262
They're downstairs.

227
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,871
I love that one.

228
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,957
Don't study them too closely.

229
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,502
Where's that building?

230
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,755
Oh, this one?

231
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,674
It's in Paris.

232
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:16,845
He designed Soen Shop.
He's my favorite architect.

233
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,848
I see. So that's why
you took up on the offer.

234
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,350
Yes.

235
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,942
This is really unexpected.

236
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,194
What do you mean?

237
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:36,073
Back then, when you were always drawing,

238
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,492
I thought you just didn't want to study.

239
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:41,286
Hey, everyone has their own forte.

240
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,331
Yet you nagged me
to study day in, day out.

241
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,959
Do you finally realize
how sadistic you are?

242
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:49,586
Thanks to my nagging,
you attended university.

243
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:58,762
What?

244
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:03,142
Isn't this…

245
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,286
Oh, no. My bad.

246
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,790
Hey, this is nothing serious.

247
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,834
-You can just erase it.
-No…

248
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,427
-Please turn off the camera.
-Please don't.

249
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,805
-Please do.
-No, please don't turn it off.

250
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:47,060
Hey, Kook Yeon-su!

251
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,021
Come with me. Damn it.

252
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,031
You said you threw it away.

253
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:26,451
I thought I did. Why was this in there?

254
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,579
You caused a scene
and blamed me for ruining it.

255
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:32,416
See? If you just glance at it,
you can't even tell.

256
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:35,627
It's true that you ruined it.
And it does show if you look closely.

257
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,546
Come on. That's not too bad.

258
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:40,799
Yet you were so petty and sulked for days.

259
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:43,468
This isn't the only thing you ruined.

260
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:47,597
Hey, I only messed up your drawings once…

261
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,892
No, twice. That's all.

262
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,562
You also ruined my life.

263
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,480
You caused havoc.

264
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,150
I shouldn't have said that.

265
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:59,067
Hey.

266
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,071
That was a bit harsh.

267
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,744
What did I ruin?

268
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,205
Why did I say that?

269
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:15,834
What is this?
Are you not going to explain yourself?

270
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:17,627
It's true, though.

271
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,966
Why do I get so upset like this at times?

272
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,053
How long will you keep this up?

273
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:29,264
How badly did I ruin your life?

274
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:32,392
Look at this.
You're doing very well. Where's the havoc?

275
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:35,103
Maybe it's hard to tell at a glance
just like this drawing.

276
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,444
How long are you going to keep
guilt-tripping me?

277
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:47,866
We've agreed to do this documentary,
so can't we please just get along?

278
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,202
That was my intention too.

279
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,955
I'm sorry I can't be as nonchalant as you.

280
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,876
So why am I being so pathetic?

281
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:10,430
You think you're the only victim here
since I'm not saying anything.

282
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:11,681
You're ridiculous.

283
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,600
Then speak your mind.

284
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,354
Do you think
I'm solely to blame for our breakup?

285
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,041
Stop filming, Ji-ung.

286
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,794
Gosh. How did you know?

287
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:43,088
Are you just going to film everything?

288
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:46,716
Well, that is my job.

289
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,302
What took you so long?
Let's go up and talk.

290
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,431
Let's go.

291
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:07,028
The atmosphere feels tense.

292
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,449
Or is it just me?

293
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:20,959
I'm sorry, but I have other plans today.
I should go. Give me a call later.

294
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,635
Then how about you…

295
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,972
I'm having second thoughts
about this documentary.

296
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,230
It's a total mess.

297
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,648
We couldn't even talk about the concept.

298
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,692
We did see this coming, though.

299
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,447
Should we just continue
following them around?

300
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,200
Let's call it a day.

301
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:55,619
Are you going home? I'll drop you off.

302
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,460
We should start with their reviews.

303
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:04,377
What?

304
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,671
On how they felt when they first met,

305
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,341
why they had agreed
to film the documentary ten years ago,

306
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,344
and how they feel after being reunited.

307
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,263
Let's make them reminisce
the good memories.

308
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,431
Right.

309
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,184
They dated each other, didn't they?

310
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:20,810
Can you tell?

311
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:23,772
After watching the documentary
and seeing them in person,

312
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,106
it was too obvious.

313
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:28,401
You're very quick.
No wonder you're our star employee.

314
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:32,364
When did you first meet Mr. Choi?

315
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,157
At the elementary entrance ceremony.

316
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:36,284
He was standing behind me.

317
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,911
He shouldn't have been there.

318
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,288
He seemed quite charming.

319
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,540
He must have been popular in high school.

320
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,251
I'll take back that compliment.

321
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:45,794
You're a terrible judge of character.

322
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:50,632
Yeon-su was the popular one.

323
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:51,883
Ms. Kook?

324
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:56,263
I could tell, although she looked cold
in the documentary.

325
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:58,848
That's why the boys
found her unapproachable.

326
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:03,436
She probably doesn't know this,
but many guys had a crush on her.

327
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,316
Were you friends with Ms. Kook too?

328
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:10,652
I'm not sure.

329
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:13,822
I think I've always been just an observer.

330
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,701
I think we're almost there.

331
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,744
You can pull up over there.

332
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:25,083
Don't come in early tomorrow.
There's not much to do.

333
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:26,543
Did you know?

334
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:29,587
Our colleagues think
you're very cold and unfriendly.

335
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,798
I know I'm not popular.

336
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:34,301
That's why no one wants to work with me.

337
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:35,969
You are popular.

338
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:38,096
It's just that you seem unapproachable.

339
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,434
You probably don't know this,
but I bet many women have a crush on you.

340
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,520
What was that?

341
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,856
Thanks. It's comforting.

342
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:51,151
I wish more people knew this side of you.

343
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,361
Thank you for dropping me off.

344
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:54,738
Sure. Take care.

345
00:26:57,824 --> 00:27:00,160
What is this? Who is he?

346
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:03,621
Didn't you see him?
He was in the car all along.

347
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:07,042
-Who is he?
-He's our reliable help sent by Mr. Park.

348
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:08,501
He's an intern.

349
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,338
Hello, sir. My name is Im Tae-hun.

350
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:12,797
An intern?

351
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:16,468
He started yesterday
and hasn't gone home since.

352
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:17,635
I'm fine.

353
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,220
Why would he send him to us?

354
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,431
This isn't a daycare.

355
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:24,017
This isn't the first time
he's done something like this.

356
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,477
Damn it.

357
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,355
Everything about this documentary
is going awry.

358
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:29,689
Send him back.

359
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:31,316
I'd rather work alone.

360
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:35,570
-Get out.
-Sorry?

361
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:36,571
-Okay.
-Okay.

362
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:54,214
You also ruined my life. You caused havoc.

363
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:57,550
Why did I have to say that
and sound pathetic?

364
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:00,261
Damn it.

365
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,482
I guess I won't be sleeping tonight.

366
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,449
Do you think
I'm only to blame for our breakup?

367
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:25,870
Gosh, I shouldn't have said that.

368
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:30,750
Yeon-su, are you insane?
You should have kept your cool.

369
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:58,319
I have to do this for an entire month?

370
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,918
HE'S LYING DOWN, HE'S SLEEPING

371
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:19,424
What should I do with them?

372
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:28,767
In any case,
I'm glad that we could do this together.

373
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:32,479
It's our pleasure.
We're truly honored to work with you.

374
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:34,272
It wasn't easy,

375
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:37,025
but Ms. Kook truly put her heart into it.

376
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,194
Oh, I'm flattered.

377
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:45,116
I hope this documentary
can also be used to promote our project.

378
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,788
And I'd like to meet
with the artist in person.

379
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,998
Then we can all meet here--

380
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:53,666
No, I'll go to you.

381
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:57,086
It must be a hassle for you
to come all the way here.

382
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,631
It'll be better
since I'm the only one going there.

383
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:02,550
We'd be very grateful
if you could do that.

384
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:03,927
Shall we end the meeting?

385
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,179
Right. Go first without me.

386
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:10,475
We'll be holding
a small opening party this Friday.

387
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:13,186
-If you're free--
-A party? That'd be great.

388
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:20,777
Will you be able to attend as well?

389
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,737
-I--
-You should come too.

390
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:27,575
Sure. I'll go if I'm not busy.

391
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,578
I'd like to speak
with Ms. Kook in private.

392
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,038
Okay.

393
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,711
-What do you think?
-Looking at them again, it's convincing.

394
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:41,381
-What's this about?
-I'm 900-percent certain.

395
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:42,632
Come here.

396
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:44,425
-Hurry up.
-What about Ms. Kook?

397
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,135
I have no idea.

398
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,388
Your work is loved

399
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:51,724
-by many people these days.
-What? He even makes TV appearances?

400
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:54,561
What do you think won their hearts?

401
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:57,188
-I'm not sure.
-Did you pull an all-nighter?

402
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,982
You were still filming.

403
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:00,358
Hello.

404
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:02,569
You've ruined my morning
with that mug of his.

405
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:05,864
Nu-a is even making
TV appearances these days.

406
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,408
I don't care.

407
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:11,578
It's about time you revealed yourself

408
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:14,205
and got rid of all the copycats.

409
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,832
Should I schedule an interview?

410
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:18,877
No, thanks.
What's my schedule for the week?

411
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,380
-You have a meeting for that live how.
-People are saying that your drawings

412
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:24,424
-are quite similar to Ko-o's.
-What?

413
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:25,592
-Really?
-And then?

414
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:28,344
-What is that bastard saying?
-People are even saying

415
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:29,804
that this is plagiarism.

416
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,472
What's your take on this?

417
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,516
Ung. Come here right now.

418
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,476
This is serious. Hurry up.

419
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,770
-What is it this time?
-I'm not sure.

420
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:41,983
-Plagiarism? I don't know about that.
-That bastard is ridiculing you right now.

421
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:45,486
Plagiarism isn't always black and white.

422
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,821
-Right.
-Right.

423
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,741
I'm sure that Ko-o knows best
whether they plagiarized me or not.

424
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:53,578
Or maybe I just inspired them.

425
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,080
-I don't mind at all.
-I see.

426
00:31:57,624 --> 00:32:00,543
Has he gone insane?
He's accusing you of plagiarism.

427
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:03,880
This won't do. Ung, don't worry.
I'll contact all the reporters I know.

428
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,548
Forget it. Ignore him.

429
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,509
How can I ignore him
after what he just said?

430
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,803
Don't bother responding. It's tiring.

431
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:13,765
You don't have to do anything.
I'll take care of it. I'll call--

432
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,602
Don't do anything
if you want to keep your job.

433
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,825
Ms. Kook, you should see this.

434
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,501
IS KO-O GUILTY OF PLAGIARISM?

435
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:45,129
What should we do?
Should we report this to Soen?

436
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:50,176
I'll talk to Soen about this.

437
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:52,845
And don't contact the artist. Just wait.

438
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,682
-Would that be okay?
-The public is quite upset.

439
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,058
It's okay.

440
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:02,981
Is there something you know?
How are you so confident?

441
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:06,275
It's not plagiarized.
So don't worry and keep working.

442
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:33,928
Hey, how is Ung? What did he say?

443
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,555
Can't you see he's kicked me out?

444
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,515
He's upset, isn't he?

445
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,769
He remained tight-lipped,
so I just gave up.

446
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,814
Damn it.
We should counter that allegation.

447
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:47,316
Let him be.
He doesn't want to be involved.

448
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:51,988
This is what I think.
He and Nu-a must have known each other.

449
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:54,574
But it's frustrating
because he won't tell me anything.

450
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,617
Do you know anything?

451
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,372
No. But he does seem familiar.

452
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:14,218
BEER IS LIFE
DAILYBEER

453
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:18,139
We don't know anything
since he won't talk.

454
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,098
At times,

455
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:23,269
I just don't know
what's running through his mind.

456
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:27,148
His mom and I were very busy
ever since he was little.

457
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:31,861
He'd play in front of the shop
by himself every day.

458
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,155
Maybe that's why he's like that.

459
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,617
But he was different
when he was with Yeon-su.

460
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:41,037
He seemed energetic and lively.

461
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,832
When I heard that you were filming
that documentary again,

462
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,835
you have no idea
how happy I was to hear that.

463
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:52,757
I'd be very grateful
if he could become lively again.

464
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:06,854
Come in.

465
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,067
Ung.

466
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,778
The Soen meeting is tomorrow.

467
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:16,906
Should I reschedule it
if you're not up for it?

468
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:18,658
What do you mean?

469
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:21,494
What if they bring up
that plagiarism issue?

470
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:23,121
It's fine. You don't have to do that.

471
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,915
Did anyone call us about that?

472
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:26,999
You mean, Soen?

473
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:30,628
Well, just anyone.

474
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:31,587
No.

475
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:35,842
I see. You can go.

476
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:38,427
Okay, then.

477
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:42,849
I'm going to sleep at home today.
I hope you get some sleep tonight.

478
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:44,559
-Bye.
-Bye.

479
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:58,739
What's going on?

480
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,450
Does she have no interest in me?

481
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:18,217
RISING STAR KO-O ACCUSED OF PLAGIARISM

00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:04,096
How could you make me wait
and still call yourself a manager?

484
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,432
I'm really sorry. I'm almost there.

485
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:10,311
Just head inside, say hello,
and sit down. Okay?

486
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,395
Bye.

487
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:15,441
Well…

488
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:17,151
I'm afraid

489
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,737
I'll have to find a new manager.

490
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:27,078
I knew it. I was right about them.
Myeong-ho.

491
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:28,621
Yes?

492
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:31,457
Did you see Mr. Jang a while ago?

493
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,418
He looked for Ms. Kook
as soon as he arrived.

494
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:35,628
He even brought her coffee.

495
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:38,506
Yes, I saw him. Now I believe you.

496
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:39,715
Believe what?

497
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,511
Mr. Jang has a crush on Ms. Kook.

498
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,554
Right. You weren't
at the previous meeting.

499
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:47,265
It was obvious that day.

500
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:52,436
He was overly kind to Ms. Kook
despite his nasty temper.

501
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,647
See? I'm telling you.

502
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:58,567
The meeting is about to begin.
Is everything ready?

503
00:37:58,651 --> 00:37:59,735
I took care of it.

504
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,779
-Goodness.
-Thank you.

505
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:04,323
Is Ko-o here? I can't wait.

506
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:05,658
Same here.

507
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:08,244
-If you're that eager, join the meeting.
-Okay.

508
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:11,747
-I'll be waiting inside.
-Okay.

509
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,040
-Bye.
-Bye.

510
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,292
My goodness!

511
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,794
Did I spill my coffee?

512
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:21,090
That could have been catastrophic.
How may I help…

513
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:26,178
What? No way! You're Choi Ung!

514
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,115
This way, please.

515
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:47,658
Please.

516
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,126
-We can skip this part.
-Okay.

517
00:38:57,209 --> 00:39:00,004
-We should take it from here.
-Okay.

518
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,424
Excuse me.

519
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,802
Mr. Jang has a crush on Ms. Kook.

520
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:17,396
Should we begin once your manager arrives?

521
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,399
It's okay. We can start right away.

522
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,360
I think it'd be best if he came.

523
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:26,530
Then would you mind if I ask you
a few questions before we begin?

524
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:28,532
Sure.

525
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:31,744
I'd like to ask about
the ongoing controversy.

526
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:35,331
Did you plagiarize him?

527
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:37,666
-Mr. Jang--
-I tend to be straightforward.

528
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:41,587
I'm sorry if I offended you,
but this is very important to us.

529
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:51,013
Must I answer that?

530
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,932
That'd be best for our sake.

531
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:07,154
There's nothing to worry about.
I didn't do such a thing.

532
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,784
From what I know,
plagiarism isn't all black and white.

533
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:14,662
I heard it's difficult to prove
that you didn't plagiarize anyone.

534
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,330
How will you go about it?

535
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,666
Are you certain
that this won't be an issue?

536
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:21,043
Sir, I don't think
that's something you should--

537
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:22,336
It's simple.

538
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:25,214
There are many reasons
to back my argument,

539
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:28,134
but they won't find any proof
that I plagiarized anything.

540
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:29,802
That's why I'm confident.

541
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:35,850
Thank you for your reply.

542
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:38,310
I had no choice but to confirm this.

543
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:40,896
It was obnoxious of me to do so,
but I had to ask.

544
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,816
Since you're certain,
I'll trust you and resume this project.

545
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:45,651
Sure. It's fine.

546
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:49,321
By the way, if you're free this Friday,

547
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:52,199
would you like to attend
Soen's opening party?

548
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:55,411
I'd also like to make up
for my behavior today.

549
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:58,873
-I'll have to think about--
-Ms. Kook will be attending as well.

550
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:02,793
You are, aren't you?

551
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:06,172
Well…

552
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,636
I'll go.

553
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:17,099
Thank you for the invitation.

554
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,896
Hello. I'm sorry for being late.

555
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,063
Please sit down.

556
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,148
Okay.

557
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:28,611
All right, then.
Let's skip the first half.

558
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:31,030
You better not be late
for another meeting.

559
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:33,657
I'm truly sorry. Should we get a cab?

560
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:35,284
Hold on.

561
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:40,581
Have you ever been to a party before?

562
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:44,460
A party? What kind? A birthday party?

563
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:46,879
No. A classy one.

564
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:48,672
Oh, that kind.

565
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,758
-Have you?
-No.

566
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:53,385
I only saw them on TV.
I've never been to one. But why?

567
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,805
What am I supposed to wear?

568
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:00,267
A tuxedo and a bow tie?

569
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:05,481
Forget it. I shouldn't have asked.

570
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:06,941
What's this about?

571
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:10,319
Never mind. Go home first.
I need to stop by somewhere.

572
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:13,739
Ji-ung, let's end it here.
This is private.

573
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:17,451
-It's my job to film your private life.
-I'm sure you got enough footage today.

574
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:21,413
And if you never give me any privacy,
I'm just going to drop out.

575
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,415
I'll let it slide for today.

576
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:26,335
But that threat
is going to get old very soon.

577
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,090
Where is he going?

578
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:32,883
It'll look great on you.

579
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,824
KOOK YEON-SU

580
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:19,221
-This way.
-Okay.

581
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:21,724
This way.

582
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:32,860
You're here.

583
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:38,198
I never thought I'd visit
a place like this in my lifetime.

584
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:42,411
I'm obviously underdressed, aren't I?

585
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:45,205
Don't worry. I'm here.

586
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:49,001
I never expected you
to want to shop with me.

587
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:50,419
You're always unpredictable.

588
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:52,546
I'm sorry. You must have been flustered.

589
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:55,382
I was only flustered
that I couldn't say no

590
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:56,842
since I had some free time.

591
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:58,260
That's a relief.

592
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,512
Anyway, thank you for your help.

593
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:03,599
I promise to repay you for your kindness.

594
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:06,602
Honestly, I've never bought a suit,

595
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:08,187
so I didn't know what to buy.

596
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:10,648
And you were the only one
I could think of.

597
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:13,233
Hey. I like what you just said.

598
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:18,822
I hope it'll stay that way.

599
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:20,324
Okay.

600
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:23,535
All right, then. Shall we have some fun?

601
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:43,472
NJ.

602
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:04,159
It's quite comfortable. How are these?

603
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:05,494
What about these?

604
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,014
I like it.

605
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:33,313
NJ, you left your shopping bags.

606
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:36,525
It's okay.
They'll send them over to my place later.

607
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:39,445
Gosh, we live in two different worlds.

608
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:43,198
We shopped for four hours today.

609
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:44,450
Wasn't that quick?

610
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:47,870
-And I only shopped for 30 minutes.
-Aren't you famished?

611
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:50,664
Let me treat you to a meal as a thank-you.

612
00:45:50,747 --> 00:45:52,749
There's something I'm craving.

613
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:04,595
You know, I may not be
as wealthy as you are.

614
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:07,556
But I make more than enough.
You could have had something nicer.

615
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:11,101
Shopping and tteokbokki go hand in hand.

616
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:14,980
I used to starve myself or have tteokbokki
and fish cakes after shopping

617
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:17,441
because I felt guilty
for spending too much money.

618
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:18,484
A guilty pleasure.

619
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:22,404
I see. I'm actually surprised.

620
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:24,740
I may seem like I was born to be a star,

621
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:27,159
but I was just anyone else
when I was young.

622
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:36,793
Why did you want to shop?

623
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,629
Are you going on TV?

624
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:41,632
Are you taking your revenge
on that Nu-a guy?

625
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:42,633
Did you watch that?

626
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:46,762
Of course. It was all over the news.
I always read the news.

627
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:50,516
That's not why.

628
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:52,935
I'm attending a party.

629
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:54,770
A party?

630
00:46:55,854 --> 00:47:00,317
Then wear the first shirt with no tie.
Match that with the second pair of shoes.

631
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,986
Gosh, you really are a professional.

632
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:06,740
It's the price of fame.

633
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:09,117
What?

634
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:12,079
Fame always comes with a price.

635
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,373
It's because you're now famous

636
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:16,959
that people are spreading
ridiculous rumors about you.

637
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:22,130
Thank you.

638
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:26,677
That means you believe
that I didn't plagiarize him.

639
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,930
Of course. I have a keen eye for art.

640
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:36,395
Thank you.

641
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:38,981
-Can we have two soju glasses?
-Okay.

642
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:40,232
Are we drinking?

643
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:43,402
Topping off this evening
with some soju would've been perfect.

644
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:45,487
But I have a photo shoot tomorrow.

645
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:48,865
I'd crave it too much
if you drank some by yourself,

646
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:50,993
so let's just pretend this water is soju.

647
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:07,092
I know you didn't plagiarize anything,
so don't worry about it.

648
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:20,731
Don't take to heart what Mr. Jang…

649
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:35,912
I BELIEVE YOU

650
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:54,806
Baekgu headed straight for the course.

651
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,808
However… Wait a minute.

652
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:58,727
-Did you see my car keys?
-Just what is going on?

653
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:00,437
What did you say?

654
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:02,981
My car keys.

655
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:05,651
Your car keys?
Why would you suddenly look for them?

656
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:08,153
You put them away somewhere
since you never drive.

657
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:15,535
-Did you really not see them?
-Who are you?

658
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,371
I know I look awkward, so shut up.

659
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:18,830
Are you going on a blind date?

660
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:20,582
God, just shut up.

661
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:23,585
That hurt my pride,
but my heart fluttered a bit too.

662
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:24,836
Hey, come back here.

663
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,380
Just shut up.

664
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:27,964
Where are you going?

665
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:29,925
Why aren't you taking me with you?

666
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:58,578
-Hello.
-It's been a while.

667
00:49:58,662 --> 00:49:59,871
Of course.

668
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:03,291
Really? You should watch it.

669
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:15,554
Damn it.

670
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:18,014
Maybe I shouldn't have come here.
It's so awkward.

671
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:23,979
I'm sorry.

672
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:41,663
Where are you going?

673
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:45,459
You can't just leave after you invited me.

674
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:48,253
Well, I was just…

675
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:49,296
Ms. Kook.

676
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,299
-You're here.
-Hello.

677
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:54,176
You're here too.

678
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:55,802
Thank you for coming.

679
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:57,012
I had to keep my word.

680
00:50:57,095 --> 00:50:59,055
Please enjoy the party.

681
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:01,141
-I'd like to introduce you to someone.
-Okay.

682
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:02,058
This way.

683
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,398
They're from France.

684
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:23,371
I have no idea why I came here.

685
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:26,416
Hey.

686
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,211
You've gone too far
by coming all the way here.

687
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:32,214
You said you wanted to show everyone
how much you've changed.

688
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:33,965
Isn't today perfect for that?

689
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:35,717
Well, not bad, right?

690
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:36,927
Whatever.

691
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,222
-Let's film Yeon-su now.
-Okay.

692
00:51:40,305 --> 00:51:42,432
Hey, don't bother.

693
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:45,435
She's surrounded by people
and pretending to be busy.

694
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,395
Bye.

695
00:51:57,697 --> 00:51:58,532
Hey.

696
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:00,742
Long time no see, Ung.

697
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:03,662
You really came. How long has it been?

698
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:09,876
Hey. Where are you going?
I'm talking to you.

699
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:13,672
I'm not interested.
Why would I ever want to talk to you?

700
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:17,050
What's going on? Why are you so touchy?

701
00:52:17,133 --> 00:52:19,970
I'm just not interested.
Can you step aside?

702
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:22,514
Are you still angry at me?

703
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:24,432
I'm not sure.

704
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:27,310
I used to pity you a little.

705
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:28,687
But now I'm indifferent.

706
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:37,070
Why haven't you countered the allegation?
Am I not worth your time?

707
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:39,364
You're smart.

708
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:42,409
Then you must know
that you're wasting my time right now.

709
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:47,873
Well, I look forward to working with you.

710
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:51,167
What was that?

711
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:53,962
What do you mean?

712
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:57,048
Haven't you heard?
Wait, I can't believe this.

713
00:52:58,216 --> 00:53:00,260
Did you think you were doing it alone?

714
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:03,013
What?

715
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:07,017
I'm also doing the live show.

716
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:09,019
I guess they thought

717
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:11,521
you weren't good enough alone.

718
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:27,537
What is he saying?

719
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:30,415
-This is for the best, right?
-Of course, it is.

720
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:33,627
Two controversial artists
will be competing against each other.

721
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:36,171
Gosh. This is great publicity.

722
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:37,547
Do you think so?

723
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:40,216
Of course. I knew he was competent.

724
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,218
But he really is incredible.

725
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:45,138
He seized the opportunity
as soon as the word got out.

726
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:46,765
-Exactly.
-I'm excited.

727
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:47,724
Me too.

728
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:50,810
Hey. Over there.

729
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:53,063
Yeon-su.

730
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:56,691
Yes?

731
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,152
Were you aware of this too?

732
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:01,863
Aware of what?

733
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:04,449
What's going on?

734
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:09,371
Why is he looking at me like that?

735
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:10,622
Did you also

736
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,124
know about it?

737
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:17,253
Sir, what's this about?

738
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:19,214
Did you know

739
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:22,884
that Nu-a was also
taking part in this project?

740
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:25,220
Ms. Kook?

741
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:30,850
What do you mean?

742
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:35,855
Sir.

743
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:38,817
We can talk about that later.

744
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:41,778
See?

745
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:44,572
You're always the one…

746
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:47,826
who ruins me.

747
00:55:15,311 --> 00:55:18,440
I was just being my usual self that day.

748
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:20,734
It was unlike her to do that.

749
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:22,819
He was the one who--

750
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:24,571
She was setting the mood.

751
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:25,488
EPILOGUE

752
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:27,032
On that day, she…

753
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:28,324
Hey.

754
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:32,162
What are you going to say
during our final interview?

755
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:33,788
What?

756
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:36,958
In the previous interview,

757
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:39,669
you said you were
wasting your time because of me.

758
00:55:40,336 --> 00:55:42,922
You heard that?
You shouldn't have eavesdropped.

759
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:47,927
How about now?

760
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:51,097
Do you still think
you're wasting your time?

761
00:55:52,348 --> 00:55:55,143
He looked serious which was unlike him.

762
00:55:55,226 --> 00:55:57,562
Tell me. How do you feel now?

763
00:55:58,188 --> 00:55:59,981
He also asked a strange question.

764
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:04,110
Well…

765
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:09,324
I guess I don't
completely feel that way anymore.

766
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:14,329
Since today is our final shooting,

767
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:16,664
I'll tell them it was all right.

768
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:22,337
She even smiled at me.

769
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:26,841
What about you? How was it?

770
00:56:30,386 --> 00:56:33,014
Tell me. What are you going to say?

771
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:37,227
"She's annoying,
bothersome, and irritating."

772
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:38,978
"I wish she never came to school."

773
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:40,396
"I'd hit her if I could--"

774
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,274
That's enough. I get it, so stop.

775
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:45,944
Why did I even ask?

776
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:49,531
-And…
-I get that you don't like me.

777
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:52,700
That's not true.

778
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:58,081
That's why I blurted out
something so ridiculous.

779
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:00,834
I don't dislike you.

780
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:11,845
Thank you for not disliking me.

781
00:57:16,432 --> 00:57:18,434
He kept staring at me.

782
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:20,228
It was so strange.

783
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:26,401
What about you?

784
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:38,496
Hey.

785
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,582
Your face is red.

786
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:44,836
You're running a fever.

787
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:46,212
I see.

788
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:48,423
What do you mean? Are you okay?

789
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:49,883
You're burning up.

790
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:52,886
No, I'm fine.

791
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,679
Don't be ridiculous.

792
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:56,222
Here.

793
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:57,932
I'm fine. Take it.

794
00:57:58,016 --> 00:58:01,311
I don't want you blaming me. Take it.
So much for trying to look cool.

795
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:03,605
I really am fine. Put it back on.

796
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:06,983
You were only in the rain for a second.
How are you so weak?

797
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:09,527
Didn't I tell you
that taking care of your health

798
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:12,864
-was also an important virtue?
-There you go again.

799
00:58:12,947 --> 00:58:14,824
Are you seriously nagging me right now?

800
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,784
Be quiet and put this back on.

801
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:20,538
Come on. I take back
what I said about not disliking you.

802
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:30,632
The person who made things weird

803
00:58:30,715 --> 00:58:32,383
was Ung.

804
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:33,593
Does that mean

805
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:36,012
you hate me?

806
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:40,642
Or was it because of the weather?

807
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:42,101
No.

808
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:45,730
Or was it because of my fever?

809
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:47,273
Then?

810
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:50,818
Or was I running a fever as well?

811
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:52,320
I'm certain

812
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:55,657
that it was because of
the unpredictable weather.

813
00:58:56,574 --> 00:58:57,825
This isn't good.

814
00:59:04,749 --> 00:59:06,501
I think I like you.

815
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:36,072
Were you friends with Ms. Kook too?

816
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:38,032
I'm not sure.

817
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:41,578
I think I've always been just an observer.

818
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:51,421
THE BOY, OR THE GIRL, WE LIKED THEN

819
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:14,611
This is how Ung always was.

820
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:18,448
His whole world would shatter
whenever Yeon-su appeared.

821
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:19,824
How is it that hard
for you to say you're sorry?

822
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:21,909
I'm the one who gives in
in the end anyway.

823
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:25,663
I'll do it. I'll work with Nu-a.

824
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:29,334
Something more artistic…

825
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:31,502
-Did it just throw up?
-Do you want to die?

826
01:00:32,086 --> 01:00:33,630
I'm sorry.

827
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:35,423
Let's not let our emotions get in the way.

828
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:40,553
