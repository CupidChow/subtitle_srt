1
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,296
Oh, things I hate?

2
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,174
It's still Kook Yeon-su.

3
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:52,886
I can give you about ten reasons
why I hate her.

4
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:57,056
Firstly, as I'm sure you know,
she's so selfish.

5
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:01,019
Yeon-su, can we see your notes
from our last class?

6
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:03,146
I heard we'll be tested on that.

7
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:06,941
You're the only one who took notes.

8
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,612
The test is tomorrow.
Can't you help us out?

9
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:12,781
We'll give it back right away.

10
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:26,044
Sorry, I don't have my notes anymore.

11
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:27,295
Can you go now?

12
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,798
I knew she was stuck-up,

13
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:33,426
but she's just unbelievable.

14
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:40,016
I'm Kook Yeon-su, the leader
of Group 2 who will be presenting today.

15
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:40,934
MAY 24, 2013
673 DAYS OF DATING

16
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,143
My team…

17
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,270
THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV

18
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,271
GROUP 2 KOOK YEON-SU

19
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,272
…is just me.

20
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:49,025
Let me start the presentation.

21
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:52,862
I will be making a presentation
on Book 12, "A Judicial Error."

22
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,614
And she doesn't have much…

23
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,783
I mean, she has no social skills.

24
00:01:56,866 --> 00:02:00,870
FEBRUARY 20, 2012
215 DAYS OF DATING

25
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,500
Let's get drunk today.

26
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,377
I'll take you home, so don't worry.

27
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,295
Why do you think you'll take me home?

28
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,589
I can drink more than you.

29
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:14,926
-You can't be sure of that.
-But since I'm a man…

30
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:15,885
Let's see, then.

31
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:19,055
-What?
-Let's see who wins.

32
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,224
She tries to win at everything.

33
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:22,725
You really mean it?

34
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,692
Hey, we came here to have fun.

35
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,110
-We don't have to do this.
-Drink.

36
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,867
All right. You win, so let's stop.

37
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:44,080
Her useless competitive spirit…

38
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,624
You don't even act like a senior.

39
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,001
How ridiculous.

40
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,545
Is that all you have to show off?
Being my senior?

41
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:52,547
What? I went easy on you, and--

42
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,799
"Went easy on me"? When did you do that?

43
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,634
Do you think you can push me around?

44
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:57,969
-Do you?
-What did you say?

45
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,804
I'm sorry, she's a bit worked up.

46
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,556
Why would you apologize? Move.

47
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:04,893
-Why don't you say that again?
-She picks fights with everyone.

48
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,352
Move.

49
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:09,314
And she's so stubborn.

50
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,443
Have you lost your mind?
Why would I get a hairstyle like that?

51
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,694
Why not?

52
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,738
Do you really think that would suit me?

53
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:20,033
-Why don't you look like this then?
-What?

54
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,284
Do his hair like this.

55
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:26,289
His hair is too short
to do this hairstyle, though.

56
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,041
It's fine. Just do it.

57
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,417
Hey, it's my hair, you know.

58
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,337
The man of my dreams is someone
who can pull off this hairstyle.

59
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,838
I'm not doing this.

60
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:34,923
Please, carry on.

61
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,007
FAITH HAIR SALON

62
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,221
She's a self-centered person

63
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:44,515
who has to do whatever she wants,
no matter what.

64
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,268
Can't you take today off?

65
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:50,730
No. It's not even
something that important.

66
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:53,107
Today's the last day
to see the cherry blossoms.

67
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,236
It's our last chance.
It's raining tomorrow.

68
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,781
Why would we go all the way there
to see cherry blossoms?

69
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:01,574
We can go next year.

70
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,161
You said that last year.
So why not this year?

71
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,956
And they're the prettiest
right before they start falling.

72
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,208
Why would you want
to see flowers like that?

73
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,710
They're just useless flowers
with bunched-up petals

74
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,045
that have no scent.

75
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:20,051
And she has no sense of romance at all.

76
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,429
And… How many are left?

77
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,807
-Hey, Yeon-su!
-Yes?

78
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:29,394
-Hey, you said you'd eat lunch with me.
-Oh, right.

79
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:32,146
Eat with your friend. I have to go
to the library to fix my assignment.

80
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,314
What?

81
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:37,277
I came to school to have lunch with you
when I didn't any classes today.

82
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,028
Eat with him. This assignment's important.

83
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,239
-Bye. I'll text you later.
-Hey.

84
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:43,574
She always has important stuff to do.

85
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,411
I hate that she only thinks about herself.

86
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:49,163
She's your girlfriend? It's her?

87
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,999
She's famous at our school.

88
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,876
She's pretty, but her personality…

89
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,212
Jeez. How can you date someone like her?

90
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,965
Hey, do you even know
anything about Yeon-su?

91
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:01,509
-What?
-Don't talk about her like that.

92
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,095
You don't know anything.

93
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,348
And another thing I hate…

94
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:13,104
AUGUST 31, 2011
42 DAYS OF DATING

95
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,608
This…

96
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:20,486
And this. They'll be on the test,
so study this part.

97
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,822
And read through this
at least three times.

98
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,741
-Okay.
-I'm going to check.

99
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,912
…is that only I know a side of Yeon-su,

100
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:33,499
which nobody else knows.

101
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,419
This is way more fun
than hanging out with Ung.

102
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,590
Ung isn't really
fun to hang out with, right?

103
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:41,966
-He's a snore.
-"Snore"?

104
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,468
We call boring people "snores."

105
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,761
Oh, really?

106
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,763
Mom, I can hear everything.

107
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,474
Mr. Snore has good ears, though.

108
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,601
-Thank you, Mr. Snore.
-Right.

109
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,063
Let's eat before we continue.

320 DAYS OF DATING

113
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,544
If you ever do that to Ung again,
I won't let it slide.

114
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:21,172
Did you think I wouldn't notice you
bossing him around

115
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:22,965
just because he's too nice?

116
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,259
If you ever do that again,

117
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,428
I'll show you how crazy I can really be.

118
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:31,224
APRIL 1, 2013
621 DAYS OF DATING

119
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,648
Why did you want to see me?

120
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,067
-Are you upset?
-Me?

121
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,611
Why? No. Why would I be?

122
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,448
Why would you get upset over one meal?

123
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:48,699
Well…

124
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:52,912
-It's not exactly just one meal.
-Were you counting? You're so petty.

125
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:55,456
Petty? Did you just call me petty?

126
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,626
What? What is it?

127
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,809
We saw the cherry blossoms.

128
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,188
She showed this side of her only to me.

129
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,191
So I couldn't help but love her.

130
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,115
And the ninth reason…

131
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,578
She makes me love her, but then…

132
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,040
Why would we break up?

133
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,044
When I think I can't be any happier…

134
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,756
I'm always the first thing
you abandon when things get tough.

135
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,636
…she takes me to the highest place…

136
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:54,849
Am I the easiest thing you have
that you can throw away?

137
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,604
No.

138
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,191
…and she pushes me off the cliff…

139
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,985
You're the only thing…

140
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:09,739
I can throw away.

141
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,578
…in the cruelest way possible.

142
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,757
What if I was serious
and didn't act childish?

143
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,136
Would you have managed?

144
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:24,146
If you were sincere,
what would you have done?

145
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:46,377
10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU

146
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:51,757
EPISODE 3

147
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,179
IT'S BEEN 10 YEARS ALREADY
IT'S BLOWING UP AGAIN

148
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,472
I'm a friend of Yeon-su.

149
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,808
She does have a bad temper,

150
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:01,976
but she's kind.

151
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:05,313
Choi Ung's the one who usually
picks fights with people around him.

152
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,776
What? Choi Ung's just a bit weird.

153
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,779
He doesn't pick fights.
You're making it up.

154
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:17,825
Do you even know him?

155
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:20,536
"Just a bit weird"? He's very weird.

156
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,747
You're the one who's making up things.

157
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:24,915
You're ridiculous.

158
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,251
You'd be shocked
if you knew how he's doing now.

159
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,128
He's really successful.

160
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:31,005
He's a famous artist. Jeez.

161
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,924
Ung, did you get some sleep?

162
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,343
Are there mosquitos around?

163
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,596
What's he doing, then?

164
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:41,766
I'm sure he won't be as successful
as our smart Yeon-su.

165
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,309
My gosh.

166
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,354
He was only pretending to be dull.

167
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:49,482
He's earning loads of money,
and he's a successful…

168
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,234
What are you doing?

169
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:57,615
Does he have the intelligence
of a mosquito?

170
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:00,785
So…

171
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,621
Eun-ho, how is my schedule?

172
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:07,333
Nothing much besides
preparing for your exhibit. Why?

173
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,669
-Really?
-Are you going to do the live drawing?

174
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:14,840
Get me some more work.
I've rested for too long.

175
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,843
All of a sudden? You said
you wanted to take things slow.

176
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,428
I need to get my mind off things.

177
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:21,972
-What?
-Don't tell me

178
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,642
you're going to be
cooped up in your room working again.

179
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:28,229
No, I won't do that.
But get me a lot of work.

180
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:30,815
And I'll think about the live drawing.

181
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:32,775
All right.

182
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,569
But Ung, you have to get plenty of sleep.

183
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:38,322
Your insomnia seems to have gotten worse.

184
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,370
I guess it's still summer.

185
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,166
YOU'D BE SHOCKED IF YOU KNEW
HOW HE'S DOING NOW

186
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,671
COMMENTS

187
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,508
-What are you looking at?
-What?

188
00:11:58,467 --> 00:11:59,552
Nothing.

189
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,724
-Hey, Sol-i…
-Yes?

190
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,103
Never mind. Forget it.

191
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:15,901
You know,
there are two ways to drive people crazy.

192
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,529
The first is to stop
in the middle of a sentence, and--

193
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,197
I met Ung a while ago.

194
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,910
I mean, I went to see him.

195
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:29,623
You? Why? What for?

196
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,668
-Do you still--
-No!

197
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,879
There was someone

198
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,841
I had to meet for a project,
and it turned out to be him.

199
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,426
Isn't that funny?

200
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:46,265
Goodness. What's he doing?

201
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,225
Is he successful?

202
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:52,021
I don't know what he did,
but he seemed successful.

203
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,901
The same boy who used to
always lie in the shade?

204
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,446
Life is full of surprises, isn't it?

205
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,826
So, how was it?

206
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,787
-What do you mean?
-You know.

207
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,789
How was it seeing him again?

208
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,750
I didn't feel anything.

209
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:14,960
Hey.

210
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,629
You're obviously lying.

211
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:21,550
Even I feel weird when someone
so much as says the name of my ex.

212
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,135
There's no way you felt nothing.

213
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,763
Don't you have too many exes
to be saying that, though?

214
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:29,350
Shut up. Being way too cool
about that isn't normal.

215
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,352
I really am cool about it.

216
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,687
You know I don't hold grudges.

217
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:42,780
Hello?

218
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,158
Kim Ji-ung?

219
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,120
Do what?

220
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:58,796
That again?

221
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,465
Ko-o was putting on an act in front of me.

222
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:04,176
Kook Yeon-su! You are crazy!

223
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,512
He's cute, but he looks like a fool.

224
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:09,598
Right? So how can I resist him?

225
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,475
COMMENTS
NJGODDESS

226
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,644
Nice username.

227
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,563
But why did he film something like that?

228
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:18,607
I don't know. He's full of surprises.

229
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,442
He keeps me entertained.

230
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:22,444
Where is Chi-seong?

231
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,780
The CEO wanted to see him.

232
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,740
Why? For what?

233
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,370
What is it? Just tell me.

234
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,748
I think it's because of your
live show yesterday.

235
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,001
What about it?

236
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:38,627
It seemed people gossiped

237
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:42,923
that you seem to be suffering
from depression and look medicated.

238
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,301
There were articles about it.

239
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,596
If our CEO summons you or Chi-seong,
just tell me.

240
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,638
I'll go instead.

241
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:51,765
Okay.

242
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,561
Just turn it off.

243
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:56,604
All right.

244
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,276
-But who is it?
-"Mr. Choi Ung"?

245
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:05,946
He called me.

246
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,656
Let's get back to filming!

247
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,742
Could I have five, I mean, ten minutes?

248
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,078
MR. CHOI UNG

249
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,125
MR. CHOI UNG

250
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:23,130
I answered a bit late
since I was busy with my shoot.

251
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,757
What's the occasion?

252
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:26,759
Hello?

253
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,720
Mr. Choi?

254
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,518
MR. CHOI UNG

255
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,569
-Hello?
-Why did you hang up so quickly?

256
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,906
-It was the first time you called me.
-Oh, did I?

257
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,950
Yes, you did.

258
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,577
Why did you call me?

259
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,413
Well, that thing you asked for last time.

260
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,332
-Drawing your buildings…
-You'll do it?

261
00:15:58,415 --> 00:15:59,667
Yes, about that…

262
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,961
Since I've always drawn
whatever I wanted to,

263
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,630
I've never been commissioned
to draw something before.

264
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:07,633
I think I'll be able to decide
after seeing your buildings.

265
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:10,636
Sure. Why don't we go see them right now?

266
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,056
I think I'll be busy today.

267
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,350
But aren't you busy as well?

268
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,143
-I am, but I'm not.
-What?

269
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:21,689
I'm busy but I'm not,
so tell me when you're free.

270
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:24,817
Well, then I'll get back to you
after checking my schedule.

271
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,112
Shouldn't I be the one saying that?
I'm the celebrity here.

272
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,905
This feels kind of wrong.

273
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:33,200
NJ! The director says
we have to start filming.

274
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:36,996
Anyway, get back to me later.
And it'd better be soon.

275
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,457
I hate it when people say
they'll contact me and take a long time.

276
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,500
Bye, then.

277
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,043
Alright.

278
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,504
My gosh!

279
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:47,673
You told me to get you more work.

280
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:50,467
But you called NJ yourself
when I'm your manager!

281
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:54,263
Gosh. Are you upset about that?

282
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,306
What? Seriously?

283
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,767
You're unbelievable!

284
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,936
You've really changed, Ung.

285
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,230
Do you think you're a big shot artist

286
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:06,275
because you're contacting NJ in person?

287
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:09,445
You're going to get a lot of hate.

288
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,280
From me, and from NJ's fans.

289
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:14,324
The whole country's going to hate you.

290
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,868
Shut up.

291
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,162
I have a job for you.

292
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:22,458
What? Are you going to meet NJ now?
Should I get the car ready?

293
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,212
I'm your manager,

294
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,965
not your slave.

295
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,134
Do I really have to do this?

296
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:35,179
If you have a conscience,
you'd better earn your keep.

297
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:38,015
You spent days
sleeping and eating at my house.

298
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:41,310
Seriously? Don't be so petty.
It was only a few days and--

299
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:45,105
Hey. You totally emptied my fridge.

300
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,648
You're like a locust.

301
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,359
All the food in my house disappears
whenever you come by.

302
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,236
Should I file a claim for all that?

303
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,405
I'll take care things here.
You can go rest up.

304
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:56,075
Pull out all the weeds
and spread the cement.

305
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,160
-Get a professional for that!
-Hey.

306
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,080
The whiskey on my shelf disappeared too.

307
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,791
I'm actually quite skilled at cementing.

308
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,000
Where should I do it?

309
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,044
Hey, Ji-ung.

310
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,219
What?

311
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:16,887
Let's film.

312
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,307
-What?
-You have to do it.

313
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:24,061
Jeez. Stop annoying me.

314
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:28,232
I have to do it.
So you're going to do it too.

315
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:30,192
What are you on about?

316
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,403
-Did Dad tell you to film me?
-No, it's not that.

317
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:35,447
You and Yeon-su.

318
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,368
Let's film another documentary.

319
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,047
-No way.
-Why?

320
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,259
Are you mad? Do you really think
I'd film that with her?

321
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:58,095
He's right. Those two filming
another documentary together?

322
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:00,931
It'll only take about a month,
and I'll be filming it myself.

323
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,267
Why are you suddenly
trying to film that again?

324
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,522
Listen. As you know,
those videos are blowing up again.

325
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:11,692
And we're thinking of filming
a special youth documentary.

326
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:12,818
You're perfect for it.

327
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:15,946
And most of all, those videos are fun.
It's great material.

328
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,781
Right, they are pretty fun.

329
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:21,201
Hey. You know how I broke up with her.

330
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,828
How can you ask me to do that?

331
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,413
It's been a long time.

332
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,248
-Do you still have feelings for her?
-Gosh.

333
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:29,126
As if. I don't have any feelings left.

334
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:32,921
-I don't want to see her again.
-That means you still have feelings.

335
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,674
Anyway, I'm not doing it.

336
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:42,097
To be honest,
I think it's going to be pretty fun

337
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,141
because of your relationship.

338
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,976
Watch the videos again.

339
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:49,396
There are so many comments,
and you two are very popular.

340
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,732
Are you a sociopath?
Are you trying to use me?

341
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:54,276
And I'm pretty sure she's going to say no.

342
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,903
I already talked to her.

343
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:58,655
What did she say?

344
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,701
What did she say?

345
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:05,537
She started swearing at me,
so I've backed off for now.

346
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,625
I can't believe we agree on something.

347
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,835
Anyway, I'm not doing it.

348
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:14,922
That's just total nonsense.

349
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:23,096
You're going to have
a really hard time convincing him.

350
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,723
He got an amazing offer,

351
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:27,684
but he's hesitating because
Yeon-su's involved.

352
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:28,977
Is that so?

353
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,480
Then they can work together
and film together too.

354
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,273
But what if they do that

355
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:36,360
and Ung starts getting feelings
for her again?

356
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:44,117
He suddenly asked me
to get him a lot of work,

357
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,494
so I'm getting worried.

358
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:50,916
Maybe he has a lot on his mind
because he saw her again.

359
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,836
Gosh. I never want to see him
go back to his old habits.

360
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,296
You saw it too.

361
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,006
It was crazy.

362
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,550
Can you endure that again?

363
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:02,761
Don't you remember?

364
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,892
He was totally crazy
the first few months after they broke up.

365
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:11,103
5 YEARS AGO
JUNE 20, 2016

366
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:12,521
Jeez.

367
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,357
Let's go home, Ung! Get a grip!

368
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:17,901
Eun-ho.

369
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,571
Do you know what Yeon-su hates the most?

370
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,240
What?

371
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:25,867
Getting drunk

372
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,579
and making a scene late at night.

373
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,415
My gosh.

374
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,668
Jeez. He's driving me crazy.

375
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:35,961
Ung, it's late!

376
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:38,297
Hey, where are you going! Darn it!

377
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:42,259
He did everything that Yeon-su hated…

378
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:45,304
JUNE 22, 2016

379
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,018
What is it this time? What are you doing?

380
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,853
Another thing she really hates.

381
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:55,147
Buying things out of impulse while drunk.

382
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:58,108
Why would she nag me
when I'm buying stuff with my money?

383
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:00,694
…and ran about like a mad dog
that broke free from its leash.

384
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:03,155
JUNE 23, 2016

385
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:10,912
Ung, wake up.

386
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,624
-No.
-You have an exam today.

387
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,626
-Get up.
-And another thing…

388
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:18,754
What did you say?

389
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,131
Not going to school

390
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,675
the day after you drink.

391
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,552
What?

392
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:27,763
It's one of the things that Yeon-su hates.

393
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:32,517
He acted like he gave up on life.

394
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:40,901
AUGUST 3, 2016

395
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:48,116
Weren't you the one
who told him about stocks?

396
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,661
I've read online that stocks can
help you get over a breakup.

397
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,705
Stocks during the day
and exercise at night.

398
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,540
That leaves you no time
to mope about your ex.

399
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,169
I guess it was quite effective.

400
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,841
He was busy doing part-time jobs

401
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:07,427
making up for all the money he lost.

402
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,972
Ready, go!

403
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,308
One, two! One, two!

404
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:16,311
Two, two! Two, two!

405
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:18,980
Thanks to me,
he got a lot of exercise then

406
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,941
and was able to keep himself healthy.

407
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:24,194
SEPTEMBER 29, 2016

408
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:36,790
But, for some reason…

409
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,335
despite keeping himself busy,

410
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,712
he still seemed miserable.

411
00:23:44,422 --> 00:23:46,716
After he kept doing that on and off again…

412
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,843
Mother.

413
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,262
That's when it started.

414
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:51,513
Hasn't he come out yet?

415
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:57,519
Choi Ung. This is enough. Open the door.

416
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:00,147
I'm counting to three,
then I'm just breaking in.

417
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:03,191
One, two, three!

418
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:27,048
And to put Ung and Yeon-su together again…

419
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:29,968
Wouldn't that be disastrous?

420
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,694
Early birds just get tired earlier.

421
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:50,947
Hurry up.

422
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,366
COMMENTS

423
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,035
Jeez.

424
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:56,369
HE'S LIKE A SQUID

425
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:57,746
UNG IS SO CUTE

426
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:01,791
What did I tell you?

427
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,461
It's nice seeing such compliments, right?

428
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,924
Stop pretending to be asleep.
I already saw you.

429
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:18,308
Anyway, give it some thought.

430
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:22,103
Once you see all the videos,
you might change your mind.

431
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:23,772
I did, too.

432
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:27,359
And…

433
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,155
Never mind.

434
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:38,620
Well…

435
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:42,958
Yeon-su did seem to hate the idea
more than you.

436
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,462
I'm just saying.

437

SBC SPECIAL DOCUMENTARY
SCHOOL LIFE PLAYBOOK

440
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:51,526
Choi Ung skipped class and ran away again.

441
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,446
It's his life his ruining.

442
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,114
-I was so young.
-What can I do?

443
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,825
My skin used to be so elastic.

444
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:00,243
Hurry up.

445
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,669
Kook Yeon-su really exhausts people.

446
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:13,048
Why does she live such an exhausting life?

447
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,217
Early birds just get tired earlier.

448
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:20,138
That's why I'm living
such an exhausting life.

449
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:25,894
What is he going to be when he grows up?

450
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,896
We can sleep all we want when we're dead.

451
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,900
I'm sure he's going to be lazy
his whole life.

452
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:36,196
He became a famous artist, Yeon-su.

453
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:40,116
Life really is unfair.

454
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:12,899
What?

455
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:15,110
IT'S BEEN TEN YEARS ALREADY
I WONDER WHAT THEY'RE UP TO

456
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:18,363
THIS IS WHAT BEING YOUNG IS ALL ABOUT

457
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:21,199
THEY'RE SO YOUNG AND INNOCENT
LIKE SUMMER

458
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:23,034
I thought you were a ghost!

459
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:30,750
-"This is what being young is all about."
-"This is what being young is all about."

460
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,837
-"They're so young and innocent
-"They're so young and innocent

461
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,506
-like summer."
-like summer."

462
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:45,682
Sorry.

463
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,311
Hey! I'm sorry!

464
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:51,896
I said I'm sorry!

465
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,398
Sorry!

466
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:55,108
Hey.

467
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,657
Don't run! Stop running!

468
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:07,662
Hey!

469
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:11,124
Kook Yeon-su! You are crazy!

470
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:24,095
Darn it.
Why did Ji-ung have to bring it up again?

471
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:34,022
I won't ever see him again, anyway.

472
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,657
ARTIST NU-A

473
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,743
But the problem is this.

474
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,811
I never ran into him

475
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:15,438
during the past five years
since we broke up.

476
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:44,551
But, all of a sudden,

477
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:48,221
we keep running into each other
to the point of being weird.

478
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:10,243
Wait. My crutch!

479
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,161
Just a minute, sir.

480
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:20,920
That brat.

481
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,964
It get that it can happen once or twice.

482
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:29,470
Excuse me.

483
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,267
But how is this even possible?

484
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,196
Why is this happening?

485
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,380
Why is this happening to me?

486
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,429
The paper bags here are so…

487
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:20,772
Are you following me around?

488
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:22,398
That's ridiculous.

489
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:24,233
Then why are you in my neighborhood?

490
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,444
I live around here, you know.

491
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:28,029
You moved!

492
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,865
So? Do you even know where I live now?

493
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,037
Hey. Does this even make sense?

494
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,915
We never ran into each other
for the past five years.

495
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:40,833
If it bothers you, go somewhere else.

496
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:44,504
What? No. I'm not bothered.

497
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:45,797
You're the one who's bothered.

498
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,341
He's still as childish as ever.

499
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:50,468
Me? No, why would I be?

500
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:52,971
You mean nothing to me.

501
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:57,016
How is she so skilled at being annoying?

502
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,226
Gosh.

503
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:02,021
You're lingering around me
because of that project, right?

504
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,898
You're hoping I'll change my mind.

505
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:07,068
Oh, that? You don't need
to worry about it anymore.

506
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,821
We're getting another artist
to work on that project.

507
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:10,863
What? Who?

508
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:13,533
This artist named Nu-a
who's pretty popular these days--

509
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:17,245
Hey, Nu-a's just a total knockoff.

510
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,789
Nu-a's always just copying my style.

511
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:24,377
Well, it's up to the public
to decide who's copying who.

512
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:27,213
I think Nu-a's art
is much better than yours.

513
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:30,258
Hey, don't cross the line.

514
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,301
Where are you going? I'm not done here.

515
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:35,513
You seemed to be bothered by me,
so I'm avoiding you.

516
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:37,056
I'm not.

517
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,101
And you really shouldn't work
with Nu-a. You'll regret it later.

518
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,729
Find a different artist to work with.

519
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:45,565
Just listen to me. Hey!

520
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,401
Gosh. My bad.

521
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:50,695
It went all the way over there. Go get it.

522
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:54,407
-Hey, Yeon-su!
-I can be childish too.

523
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,242
I should've done this earlier.

524
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:57,493
I feel great.

525
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:02,623
-What?
-It was supposed to be Ko-o.

526
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:06,419
He wants to cancel the contract
if we're working with Nu-a instead.

527
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:12,133
You said you found Ko-o.
Why are you suddenly changing the artist?

528
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:15,803
Well, Nu-a is also
a popular artist these days.

529
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,889
It will be great with Soen Shop.

530
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:20,141
And Nu-a's been very enthusiastic.

531
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:23,478
I know, but he said he only wants Ko-o.

532
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:26,064
Why? Did he ask for too much money?

533
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,649
Well…

534
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,652
Yeon-su. It was going well.
What's going on?

535
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:34,989
You know how important
this project is for our company.

536
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,866
Everyone's counting on you.

537
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:44,123
I don't care. If he wants more money,

538
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,917
write up a new estimate.

539
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,919
I'll try to make it work.

540
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:13,986
Why is everything a mess?

541
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:23,579
All of this began after Choi Ung appeared.

542
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:30,586
Bye, sir.

543
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,547
Right. Get out of here.

544
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,593
Chae-ran.

545
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:41,347
Where is this jerk?
I haven't seen him all day.

546
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,016
He's trying to cast
the people for the documentary.

547
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,895
So, has he gotten them on board?

548
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,982
He never reports his progress to me.

549
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,943
He never fails
when he sets his mind on something.

550
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:56,904
Right. That's why I can't
scold him for anything.

551
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:58,990
He's so annoying.

552
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:03,452
Why did he suddenly
decide to do the documentary though?

553
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:06,205
He spent a few days
watching through the old videos.

554
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:08,249
I guess it piqued his interest.

555
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,626
All of them?

556
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,507
You know,

557
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:21,137
I did such a good job.
There are so many fun episodes.

558
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:26,017
So he watched everything.
That's kind of adorable.

559
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,227
Come to think of it,

560
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:30,855
Ji-ung was pretty cute
when he was in high school.

561
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:32,940
When he appeared on the screen,

562
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:35,234
he would freeze.

563
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:41,407
By the way, why do you always
ask me about Ji-ung?

564
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,992
What do you mean?

565
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:46,495
Everyone keeps asking me
about Ji-ung, not just you.

566
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:48,789
Well…

567
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:54,503
-Because you know him best.
-What?

568
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:57,465
Everyone asks you first
when they're looking for Ji-ung.

569
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,383
Didn't you notice?

570
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:03,387
-Why?
-It's obvious.

571
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:25,409
Should I tell you
what Ji-ung was like in high school?

572
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:29,580
-Well, if you're not interested…
-You can tell me if you're bored.

573
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,214
Looking at Ji-ung…

574
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:44,512
always reminds me of my high school days.

575
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:47,265
So I have to tell you
about my high school days first.

576
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:50,434
Why did Ms. Kook suddenly
get off work so early?

577
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:53,354
She probably went
to talk to Ko-o about our project.

578
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,481
Thanks to her,
we got to get off work early.

579
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:57,024
So how about some drinks?

580
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,402
I'm on a diet.

581
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:01,737
No way.

582
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,783
Hey, isn't that Ms. Kook?

583
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:07,868
Goodness!

584
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,706
Did she get off early to go on a date?

585
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,167
They look so good together.

586
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,169
I can't believe this!

587
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:20,589
Wait, there's no way.

588
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:21,841
Why do you say that?

589
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:26,637
To be honest, I was shipping her
with someone else.

590
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:30,308
What do you mean? Is she going somewhere?

591
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:32,518
That's not what I mean.

592
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:37,857
I meant that I thought
she would end up dating Mr. Jang.

593
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,525
What? Ms. Kook and Mr. Jang?

594
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:41,027
What do you mean?

595
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:44,780
I have a sixth sense
when it comes to stuff like this.

596
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:48,409
Something's going on
between Ms. Kook and Mr. Jang.

597
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,286
I can smell it.

598
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:52,079
And they do look good together.

599
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,957
I don't think so.
They're always at each other's throats.

600
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,209
That's how romance usually begins.

601
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:59,378
-You haven't got a clue.
-I actually do.

602
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:02,757
You're wrong anyway
since that guy came into the picture.

603
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,927
We can't know for sure yet.
I have to keep watching them.

604
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,180
Then how about discussing that

605
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:12,016
over some thin pork belly?

606
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:14,852
Didn't you hear me?
I'm on a diet right now.

607
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:18,147
Didn't you hear me?
I said, thin pork belly.

608
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,485
Well, I guess thin slices are okay.

609
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:24,362
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

610
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:30,743
I think you're just wasting your time.

611
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:32,161
I told you I won't do it.

612
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:33,746
Still, I want a reason.

613
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:35,081
Don't you know already?

614
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:37,124
It's Choi Ung.
Why would I do that with him?

615
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:40,461
Why not? There's nothing between you two.

616
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,172
Don't tell me
you still have feelings for him.

617
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,466
Did you come here just to annoy me?

618
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:48,427
Being childish won't work on me.
Go try your luck with Ung.

619
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:53,766
-I knew it wouldn't work.
-Then why did you come here?

620
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:55,851
It's still my job to get you on board.

621
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,062
If this doesn't work,

622
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,856
I'll have to do this by the book.

623
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,525
Fine. Let's see you try.

624
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:05,653
I'm sure I won't change my mind,
but I'll hear what you have to say.

625
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:14,745
Why do you think people decide
to star in a documentary?

626
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:18,499
Well…

627
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,001
To promote their businesses, or…

628
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:24,130
I'm sure most of them don't have
businesses to promote.

629
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:29,343
For the pay. You get paid for them.
That's why I did it back then.

630
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,262
Then you know it's not a huge sum.

631
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:33,722
Are you telling me to come up
with a reason?

632
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,599
I'm always honest when I'm casting.

633
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:40,146
"There's only one thing
we can give to you."

634
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:44,900
"We're recording
a part of your life for you."

635
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:48,362
You're right.

636
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:52,450
Most people seem to think
that it's not a big deal.

637
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:53,742
But…

638
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:58,414
when we finish shooting,
and they see the completed work,

639
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:00,624
they realize then what I meant.

640
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:03,461
They realize

641
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:07,673
how precious it is to be able to
capture and store a moment in their lives.

642
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:12,219
That's why it's actually easier for me

643
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,638
to convince you than other people.

644
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,726
You've had those records before.

645
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:22,646
Then you'll know the best.

646
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:25,274
You have a memory
of your summer from when you were 19.

647
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:28,277
Be honest with me.
Does that really mean nothing to you?

648
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,866
Well…

649
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,951
Did you even watch them?

650
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:41,373
-No.
-You and Ung are the same.

651
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:44,919
Why do you both try so hard
to avoid seeing those videos?

652
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,213
To be honest,

653
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,007
I first thought that this was meaningless.

654
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,510
But when I looked through the videos,

655
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:57,264
I realized that you two are perfect
for our documentary on youth.

656
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:02,937
You're good with words, Ji-ung.

657
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,314
I give you that.

658
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:09,193
But you've failed to convince me.
Sorry, but I still won't do it.

659
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:17,034
Fine.

660
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:19,620
What?

661
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,207
Is that it?

662
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,960
I've never failed at casting people.

663
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,380
That means I have another plan.

664
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,133
That doesn't sound good.

665
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:37,846
Will you tell me
if I ask you what you're going to do?

666
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:42,601
About Ung…

667
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:48,732
I can't let her work with Nu-a.

668
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:51,360
See? You should have thanked her
and accepted her offer

669
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:53,487
when she wanted to work with you.

670
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:54,947
You idiot.

671
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,365
Over my dead body.

672
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:59,535
As an adult, you should know how to keep
your personal life separate from work.

673
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:03,289
Everyone's nagging me about that
as if they're any better.

674
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:06,625
Jeez, you're such a loser. Unbelievable.

675
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:08,502
Ung, be honest.

676
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,630
You want Yeon-su to come
and beg you to work with her, right?

677
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:14,675
You're doing this
because you want her to beg you,

678
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:16,552
even if it's because of work.

679
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:20,723
-She'll never do that.
-That's what I mean!

680
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:23,267
You know that, so why are you doing this?

681
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:26,103
You seem to be the one
picking fights with her.

682
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,105
It's so annoying.

683
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:30,941
She pretends she doesn't care
and acts indifferent.

684
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,568
No. Why would I be?

685
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:35,029
You mean nothing to me.

686
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:36,822
She's always like that.

687
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:39,408
Oh, that? You don't need
to worry about it anymore.

688
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:40,534
We're getting another artist.

689
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,745
This artist named Nu-a
who's pretty popular…

690
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:45,497
She's so selfish
and always so full of herself.

691
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:46,832
Well, she won again.

692
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:51,003
Just go and say
that you'll do that project.

693
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:54,214
If you agree to do it,
they'll choose you over Nu-a.

694
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:57,009
Hey, why would I ever do
something that benefits her?

695
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:59,970
I should be doing stuff that she hates.

696
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:03,265
Darn it.

697
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,356
I just had an idea.

698
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:24,161
What's with that look?
I have a bad feeling about this.

699
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:26,789
Right.

700
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:29,750
I should be doing the stuff she hates.

701
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:32,753
A great way to win against Yeon-su.

702
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:36,924
I don't know what you're thinking,
but I want to stop you.

703
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,050
Hey, Eun-ho.

704
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:40,886
I have some work for you to do.

705
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:42,721
What? I cemented your backyard!

706
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:45,265
No, I mean work as my manager.

707
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:47,976
Your manager? Is it about NJ?

708
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:52,106
Does this involve NJ?
Can I look forward to it this time?

709
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:02,908
Why didn't I think of this before?

710
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:30,352
He's a total player. I'm sure of it.

711
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:39,486
Why do men say
they'll call you but never do so?

712
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:43,449
He said he'll call me,
so I can't bring myself to call him first.

713
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:47,411
But he hasn't called for days.
Why is he acting like this?

714
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:49,413
He said he was my fan…

715
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,085
He said he liked me when we first met.

716
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:57,629
So why isn't he contacting me? Why?

717
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:05,095
You know why. He's not into you.
He's not interested.

718
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:06,513
He's keeping you on the hook.

719
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:09,391
He could just be cautious.

720
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:10,851
Right.

721
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:34,917
CHOI UNG

722
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:43,091
My name is Gu Eun-ho.

723
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:47,179
GU EUN-HO

724
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:00,484
STAY HEALTHY

725
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:07,824
WENT DRINKING WITH UNG

726
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:09,034
I can't believe this.

727
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:12,079
He's drinking and having fun,
but why isn't he calling?

728
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:19,086
No, I can't like a photo of someone
who isn't a celebrity.

729
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:49,658
All right, I get it.

730
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:52,578
Yes, I'm totally fine.

731
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:55,080
I'm almost home!

732
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:56,665
Yes.

733
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:58,625
All right.

734
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,672
It's been so long
since I last saw a vending machine.

735
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:11,263
Wait.

736
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:22,941
I knew it. It's Yeon-su again.

737
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:27,487
Did everyone else
in this neighborhood disappear?

738
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:28,947
Why is it always her?

739
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,082
Have you been drinking?

740
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:51,720
Just go home.

741
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:55,265
Ten reasons why I hate Kook Yeon-su.

742
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:58,310
Am I the easiest thing you have

743
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:00,270
that you can throw away?

744
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:03,315
No.

745
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:05,901
You're the only thing

746
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:08,236
I can throw away.

747
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:12,991
Why are you doing this?

748
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:17,454
What reason do you have?

749
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:20,916
Why do we have to break up?

750
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:02,374
The tenth and the last reason.

751
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:08,755
She erased me from her life so quickly.

752
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:23,770
Good morning.

753
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:25,439
-Ms. Kook!
-You're here!

754
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:28,066
You seem to be in a good mood.

755
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:32,112
Of course. You gave us
an amazing present, Ms. Kook.

756
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:33,905
-What present?
-Come on.

757
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:36,283
Did you keep it under wraps
to surprise us?

758
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:38,285
What do you mean?

759
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:40,579
Someone from Ko-o's agency visited.

760
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:43,248
We heard that you were friends with Ko-o.

761
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:45,417
Why didn't you tell us?

762
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,669
Wait. Who came?

763
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:51,047
His manager came to say
he'll work on the Soen Shop project.

764
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:54,009
Choi Ung, no wait.

765
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:55,761
Ko-o said he'd do it?

766
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:56,678
Yes.

767
00:50:56,762 --> 00:51:01,308
He said he'd do it because
you promised him to help with something.

768
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:04,227
-Me?
-"Me?"

769
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:07,397
Come on.

770
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,691
Who knew you'd have such connections?

771
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:12,861
I already told Soen Shop
this amazing news.

772
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:15,697
No way. That's impossible.

773
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:19,910
Excuse me for a moment.
I need to meet someone.

774
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:21,369
I'll be out for a minute.

775
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:22,871
What?

776
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:33,590
Why did you send me
to get the contract so early?

777
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:35,509
I thought it was about NJ.

778
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:37,719
Did you do as I told you?

779
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:38,887
Yes.

780
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:40,931
Did you see Yeon-su?

781
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:42,307
No, she wasn't there.

782
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:43,975
Is that so?

783
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:47,938
It's going to get noisy here soon.

784
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:49,773
You'd better stay away.

785
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:51,817
Why?

786
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,944
It's going to get messy here soon.

787
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:56,863
What?

788
00:51:56,947 --> 00:52:00,283
One, ten, hundred, thousand…
17 thousand likes?

789
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:06,122
Why did 17,867 people like
my photo of us eating meat?

790
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:07,624
What do you mean?

791
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:18,009
What's wrong with you?

792
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:20,178
NJ.

793
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:23,682
NJ liked my photo!

794
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:25,976
-What?
-Look.

795
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:27,143
What?

796
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:29,229
NJ!

797
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:33,567
NJ liked my photo!

798
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:36,278
NJ liked my photo!

799
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:41,950
About Ung…

800
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:44,452
I think it was when we were nine.

801
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:46,913
I always teased him and ran away.

802
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:48,623
What about it?

803
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:51,084
I think he wanted to get back at me.

804
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:54,170
One day, he brought
bingsu for us to share.

805
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:55,922
So I gladly ate it.

806
00:52:56,006 --> 00:53:00,427
But it contained peaches.
I'm allergic to them.

807
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,137
But he's allergic to them too.

808
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:05,891
Right. That crazy bastard
ate peaches with me

809
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:07,225
just to get revenge on me.

810
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:10,770
Jeez. He really is nuts.

811
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:13,940
We were both taken
to the emergency room with swollen faces,

812
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:18,862
and he smirked at me
from the bed next to me.

813
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:21,698
That's when I stopped bullying him.

814
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:24,492
But why are you telling me this?

815
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:29,915
Choi Ung is the kind of person
who isn't afraid to be in pain

816
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:33,501
if he can make others suffer.

817
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:37,130
And you'll soon find out what that means.

818
00:53:38,423 --> 00:53:42,636
No way. Would he really go that far?

819
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,598
That's what I thought,

820
00:53:47,515 --> 00:53:50,018
but seeing his face made me realize it.

821
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:52,979
He really is nuts.

822
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:56,066
What do you mean?

823
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:59,611
Don't tell me you agreed
to do our project just so that…

824
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:02,447
Yes. Because you'll be helping me too.

825
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,284
By helping you, do you mean…

826
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:08,453
I want to film the documentary again.

827
00:54:08,536 --> 00:54:09,537
With you.

828
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:14,584
This may not be different
from when I ate those peaches.

829
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:15,961
That's my condition.

830
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:19,005
Let's film that documentary together
for a month.

831
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:22,509
Hey.

832
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:25,303
Choi Ung!

833
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:28,723
If Yeon-su hates it this much,

834
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:30,558
then I can endure it.

835
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:41,069
EPILOGUE

836
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:42,237
This is so ridiculous.

837
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:45,281
Does he still hate me that much?

838
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:49,953
Well, as for me…

839
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:51,913
I don't care.

840
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:55,000
That's just how I am.

841
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:57,585
I don't hold grudges against people.

842
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:58,878
I mean it.

843
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:03,633
FIVE YEARS AGO
AFTER THE BREAKUP

844
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:28,450
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

845
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:29,743
You can leave that here.

846
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:31,745
-Okay, thank you.
-Thank you.

847
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:35,749
Welcome.

848
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,500
-I want to make an order.
-Yes.

849
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,513
If you have something to say,

850
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:52,307
stop staring at me and just say it.

851
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,354
Are you sure you're okay?

852
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:01,524
What do you mean?

853
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:14,037
You broke up with Ung.

854
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:17,791
You dated for such a long time.

855
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:22,587
Hey, you can be honest with me.

856
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:25,340
Just tell me if you're in pain.

857
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:28,802
It's scarier seeing you act
as if nothing's happened.

858
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:30,386
It's making me uncomfortable.

859
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:32,347
You sure have a lot to worry about.

860
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:35,934
Are you really okay?

861
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:38,186
Yes.

862
00:56:38,686 --> 00:56:40,063
I really am.

863
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:51,699
Grandma, I'm home.

864
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:20,371
I'm totally fine.

865
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:22,290
I mean it.

866
00:58:25,376 --> 00:58:32,383
10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU

867
00:58:57,784 --> 00:58:59,536
Don't make me laugh.

868
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:01,246
Is that what he said?

869
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:05,875
The minor details may be different but…

870
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:09,254
It was that day
when everything started going haywire.

871
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:10,588
Hey.

872
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:13,967
-Since you're quite childish and pathetic…
-Hey.

873
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:18,096
I believe you.

874
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,932
You also ruined my life.

875
00:59:21,015 --> 00:59:22,517
You caused havoc.

876
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:28,481
