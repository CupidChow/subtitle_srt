1
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:43,877
Did you also

2
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,045
know about it?

3
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,923
Sir, what's this about?

4
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:50,300
Did you know

5
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,220
that Nu-a was also
taking part in this project?

6
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,055
Ms. Kook?

7
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:01,644
What do you mean?

8
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:08,401
Sir. We can talk about that later.

9
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,278
See?

10
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:13,448
You're always the one…

11
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,576
who ruins me.

12
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:29,547
It all started…

13
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:31,716
YEAR 2000

14
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,510
-…a long time ago.
-It's you, right?

15
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,970
-You're here!
-Your dad runs Ung's Snack Bar, right?

16
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:39,140
You're so lucky.
Do you eat freetteokbokkievery day?

17
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:41,434
-Can I come?
-Me too!

18
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,186
It was all because of our names.

19
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,729
-You got the wrong person.
-What?

20
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,648
My dad doesn't run the snack bar.

21
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:48,983
His dad does.

22
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,363
"Kim Ji-ung?"

23
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,532
So your dad runs Ung's Snack Bar?

24
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,117
It must be him!

25
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,661
Hey, let's be friends.

26
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:02,038
-Come on.
-Hey, Choi Ung!

27
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:04,999
It was likeThe Prince and the Pauper…

28
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,626
-Come on.
-I want to go.

29
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:07,544
GAMJATANGWITH UNG

30
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,963
…where the prince and the pauper

31
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,590
-Thanks for the food.
-Sure.

32
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:16,594
-To be honest…
-Goodness.

33
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,888
-…why would a kid be jealous of that?
-You must be Ung. Gosh.

34
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:22,392
You're lucky to have
a restaurant named after you.

35
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,977
That's right.

36
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,896
Are you going to take on
the family business?

37
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,983
Of course he will.
The restaurant was named after him.

38
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:30,942
To a kid…

39
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:33,278
-You're so lucky.
-…it sounded like nonsense.

40
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,617
Hey.

41
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:42,453
Don't you dare lie like that again.

42
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,790
Oh, I'm sorry.

43
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,669
-What are you doing here?
-I'm just sitting here.

44
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:52,255
How come you've been
sitting here for hours?

45
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:55,675
Mom told me to stay put and play here.

46
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:56,634
Why?

47
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,012
She said it's dangerous.

48
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:02,098
And he seemed a bit pathetic

49
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,101
to be a prince.

50
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:07,520
Funny, right?

51
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,856
Me feeling sorry for someone.

52
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:38,843
I guess he seemed more lonely…

53
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:45,892
than pathetic.

54
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:53,858
WITH UNG

55
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,406
Do you want to hear a scary story?

56
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:07,830
I'm not making this up.
It really happened.

57
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:11,876
Every night at 12 a.m.,
when the bell rang three times…

58
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,672
I think that's how we became friends.

59
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:23,429
But having a friend

60
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:30,728
-I have to go eat.
-You're leaving to eat again?

61
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,313
What are you, a puppy?

62
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:36,067
I had fun today. See you tomorrow.

63
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:43,491
In the end, I was all alone.

64
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,998
Hey, when is your mom coming home?

65
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,375
Late at night.

66
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,461
-How come?
-She's working.

67
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:57,922
What about your dad?

68
00:04:59,298 --> 00:05:01,009
I don't have a dad.

69
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,971
Then who do you eat with?

70
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,061
Ta-da.

71
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,188
Eat up, Ji-ung.

72
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:16,899
Thank you, ma'am. Thank you, sir.

73
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,319
Gosh, you're so polite.

74
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:24,824
Your name is similar to my son's
and you're so polite and smart.

75
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:28,286
One, two, three. Ta-da.

76
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:33,374
-It's hot!
-Come and have dinner with us often, okay?

77
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,960
Thank you for being
such good friends with Ung.

78
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,589
What do you want, Ung? Eggs?
Do you want eggs?

79
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,841
Let's see… Here.

80
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,551
-What about you Ji-ung?
-Meat.

81
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:46,888
-Right. Have some meat. Here.
-Meat.

82
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:49,223
Okay. What about me?

83
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,767
-You eat on your own.
-Gosh.

84
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,143
-I had never been…
-A sausage.

85
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:53,728
…that jealous of someone before.

86
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,438
Dig in.

87
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:58,107
I'll have garlic scapes.

88
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,278
I thought I'll never be able to

89
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:03,404
Here you go, Ung.

90
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,448
-What?
-Look.

91
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,617
Okay, line up everyone.

92
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,993
-Come forward.
-But…

93
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,536
My seat.

94
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,581
My mom packed sausagegimbapfor me.

95
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,083
-Do you want to share?
-Okay.

96
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,793
What's that?

97
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,589
This is for you.

98
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,842
But Choi Ung didn't seem to be jealous.

99
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,138
Are you done eating?

100
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,431
Thank you for the food.

101
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,892
Gosh, you're so polite.

102
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:34,685
Eat up.

103
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,646
I heard you guys are going bike riding.

104
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,398
Excuse me, ma'am.
Could you come taste this?

105
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:42,401
Okay. Dig in. Have some bananas too.

106
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:43,569
Okay.

107
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,368
Can you eat some for me?

108
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:02,255
Choi Ung shared everything with me

109
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:21,691
He shared his time…

110
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,280
Come on. That's cheating.

111
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:31,075
I told you, you can't beat me.

112
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:32,994
Sir, let me help you.

113
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,620
It's okay.

114
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,914
It's okay, Ji-ung.

115
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:39,208
Put it down. It's heavy.

116
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,003
Choi Ung. Where do you think you're going?

117
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:43,754
Ji-ung is strong.

118
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,798
-Gosh, that little…
-…his daily life…

119
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,091
Then Ji-ung…

120
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:50,511
Here I go. One, two, three.

121
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,639
Hey, come on over here.

122
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,641
-Yes. Come here, Ji-ung.
-Sir.

123
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,602
Thank you. Come over here, Ji-ung.

124
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:02,356
Sir, please make sure my two sons
look good in the photo.

125
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,566
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR GRADUATION

126
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:06,736
…and even his family.

127
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,446
Smile.

128
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:11,365
-Smile.
-One, two, three.

129
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:17,330
Thanks to him, I was able to

130
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:28,257
But there's always a third character

131
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,942
It's obvious. It's so obvious, but…

132
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,754
It seemed like you needed it.

133
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:16,973
Do you

134
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,308
need this back?

135
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,937
-Of course not.
-Thanks.

136
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,652
She was unbelievably beautiful.

137
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,323
HWIYEONG HIGH SCHOOL ENTRANCE CEREMONY

138
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:40,246
The principal will now make a speech.

139
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,754
Spring is finally here.

140
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,716
The weather is pretty cold.

141
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,635
I would like to extend my gratitude…

142
00:09:59,140 --> 00:09:59,974
But…

143
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,561
I wasn't the only one who thought so.

144
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,981
That's how the story always goes.

145
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:11,319
But it wasn't a problem.

146
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:25,541
All I had to do was…

147
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:31,005
take a step back.

148
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,428
I don't think

149
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,098
I'm the main character in this life.

150
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,851
Let's wrap it up now.

151
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:44,977
Thanks.

152
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,565
A SECRET THAT CAN'T BE TOLD

153
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:53,361
EPISODE 5

154
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,240
Things got
more complicated than I thought.

155
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:03,537
-Mr. Jang.
-Yes, Ms. Kook?

156
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,998
What did he mean just now?

157
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,542
Will Nu-a be participating in the project?

158
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,127
It's just as he said.

159
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:13,130
Didn't I send you the data
proving he didn't plagiarize anyone?

160
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,049
-So how could you--
-One second.

161
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:19,720
Excuse me.

162
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,936
What is the one thing
we need most right now?

163
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,398
Publicity.

164
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,817
Right now, I think this is the best way--

165
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:37,238
But this is clearly a breach of contract
and is disrespectful to the artist--

166
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:39,990
I'm not sure about that.
I already checked the contract

167
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,867
and there doesn't seem to be a problem.

168
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:43,994
Disrespectful…

169
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,206
You're being unusually emotional.

170
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:50,251
This could be a great opportunity
for both artists.

171
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,628
So what is the problem?

172
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,515
I'm disappointed in you.

173
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:08,227
I thought you were more like me.

174
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:11,480
I guess you don't know how to keep
private matters separate from work.

175
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,403
Let's have a meeting about his later--

176
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,572
You're going to have to apologize.

177
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,826
-Pardon?
-I'm telling you

178
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,662
that you're going to have to
apologize to Go-oh.

179
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:29,248
-Ms. Kook.
-I'm not being emotional.

180
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,416
I'm being empathetic.

181
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,420
Being good at your job without
empathy isn't something to be proud of.

182
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,630
Empathy is linked to intelligence.

183
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:40,551
You lacked respect
for the artists and their art, Mr. Jang.

184
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:46,015
What you need to do is
apologize to him in person.

185
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:49,894
And it will be up to me
to pick up the pieces as the project lead.

186
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:52,646
I hope there aren't
any more surprises like this.

187
00:12:57,026 --> 00:13:00,404
I can't believe you thought
I was like you.

188
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,199
It makes me reflect on my past actions.

189
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:09,371
Should we get going too?

190
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,415
Let's go. It's over.

191
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,512
Ung has always been this way.

192
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:26,680
Are you okay?

193
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,016
Yes.

194
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,435
He's usually calm and quiet.

195
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:35,814
But his whole world would shatter

196
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,567
The Choi Ung I knew

197
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,779
was always unfaltering.

198
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:43,989
Over here.

199
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,241
Let's go.

200
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,700
Let's get some rest.

201
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,035
Go in deep.

202
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,917
Hey, stop drawing
and shoot some hoops with us.

203
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,086
Come on.

204
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:01,340
He had no interest in the world.

205
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,259
Here.

206
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,179
-Look, it's Kook Yeon-su.
-Who?

207
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,765
The girl who entered the school
with the highest grades.

208
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:12,059
She's pretty but she's stuck-up.

209
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,571
That was until Yeon-su appeared.

210
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,834
I know it may sound weird,

211
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:43,716
but I always thought Choi Ung was

212
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:51,140
But everything changed.

213
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,434
I got a girlfriend.

214
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:01,817
Did you break up again?

215
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:06,280
When it came to Yeon-su,

216
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,660
Is this the fifth time? The sixth?

217
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,623
Shouldn't you be used to it by now?

218
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,542
Just be sad once every two breakups.

219
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:30,220
He would become immature

220
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:37,811
Hey.

221
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,691
Never mind. We'll talk later.

222
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,791
I'm home.

223
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,878
You're here early.
I thought you were going to be late.

224
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,422
Then you should have just gone to bed.

225
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:06,799
What are you doing outside?

226
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:10,386
I have to see my granddaughter
come home before I sleep.

227
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:16,475
Gosh, my granddaughter looks
so pretty wearing that.

228
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:19,269
Your granddaughter looks pretty
wearing regular clothes too.

229
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,313
Goodness. What were you doing?

230
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,773
Nothing special.

231
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:27,027
So how was the party or whatever?

232
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,656
Everyone was so relaxed and cool

233
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:33,784
as if they were taught
how to be like that.

234
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,337
Were you alone all day?

235
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:48,257
Yes, I guess.

236
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:52,928
How come your friend
hasn't been visiting these days?

237
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:55,597
She's probably busy.

238
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:57,599
Did you two fight?

239
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,560
Of course not.

240
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:05,816
She kept talking nonsense,
so I just set her straight.

241
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:06,900
We didn't fight.

242
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,694
So you did fight.

243
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:12,239
You were harsh on her
and hurt her feelings again, didn't you?

244
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:14,116
I didn't!

245
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,453
Stop talking nonsense.
Go get washed up and go to sleep.

246
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:20,247
Gosh, we are so much alike.

247
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,459
Can't you just get along with her?

248
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,839
Go see her tomorrow.

249
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:31,633
-No thank you.
-Then I'll bring her here.

250
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:35,554
I told you no.
She probably doesn't want to.

251
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:40,350
Stop being so stubborn
and apologize to her.

252
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,329
Stop being so stubborn and apologize.

253
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:02,790
For what?

254
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:07,294
You should have realized by now
what you've done wrong.

255
00:18:08,086 --> 00:18:10,839
But you didn't call me or come see me

256
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,967
because of your pride.

257
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:18,388
I know you've been thinking about
what to do all day.

258
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,308
Who? Me?

259
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:25,479
That's why I came to you first.
I'll give you a chance. Go ahead.

260
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,556
How is it that hard
for you to say you're sorry?

261
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,686
I can't because I haven't done it often.

262
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,688
Then start doing it more often
from now on.

263
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,941
Then everyone will think I'm a pushover.

264
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:11,984
I don't want to lose.

265
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,904
Then I'll be on my way.

266
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,620
Sorry.

267
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:26,999
I was wrong.

268
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,587
What? I can't hear you.

269
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,633
I said I'm sorry.

270
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:45,017
You idiot. It's okay to say that to me.

271
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,562
I'll keep coming back to you.

272
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:50,647
All you have to do is apologize.

273
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,609
I'm the one who gives in
in the end anyway.

274
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,371
He must be really angry.

275
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,959
He'll probably be bottling it up.

276
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,528
Are you going somewhere?

277
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:22,489
Oh, there's something
I need to take care of,

278
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:24,491
so I'm going to go see Ung.

279
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,326
Some things happened yesterday,

280
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,911
so I'm going to go apologize.

281
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:32,165
It's not like I did something wrong.
It was a small misunderstanding.

282
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:37,087
It's just that it's something
he'd be upset about.

283
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:40,507
So I'm going to go talk to him.

284
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,510
I'm sure he's home.

285
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:44,594
Did you call him?

286
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:49,391
I did yesterday,
but I think he was asleep.

287
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,851
I'll call him again.

288
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:58,942
But I swear this wasn't my fault.

289
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,403
He let his imagination run wild
and is blaming me.

290
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:04,990
Does he really think
I'd do something like that?

291
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:12,414
Even so, he said that I ruined his life.

292
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,624
It's a bit harsh, don't you think?

293
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,294
How in the world did I ruin his life?

294
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:22,382
The person you have called cannot…

295
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:30,223
If so, there's no reason
for me to go him, right?

296
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:33,935
I can just sort everything out
and call him later, right?

297
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:36,938
I changed my mind. I'm not going.

298
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,106
Hey!

299
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:40,358
Yeon-su!

300
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,488
What's strange is that…

301
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:48,742
It's supposed to be quiet here
since I live alone,

302
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:53,080
but I find it very awkward right now.

303
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:55,123
Ung!

304
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,334
Because I'm now used to that.

305
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:03,799
Hello, Ji-ung.

306
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,804
Ung, I heard what happened yesterday.

307
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,514
It's about time.

308
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,432
How could that happen?

309
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:15,060
I know. I'm dumbfounded as well.

310
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:17,521
How could you go to a party without me?

311
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:19,856
You were invited but didn't take me.

312
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,110
You saw me watch TV all alone yesterday.

313
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:25,987
How could you go alone,
dressed up like a penguin?

314
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,614
Shut up.

315
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:31,868
And shouldn't you be
asking me if I'm okay?

316
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,703
-What do you mean?
-What do you think?

317
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:38,208
-They got Nu-a onboard without me knowing.
-Oh, that? Isn't it okay, though?

318
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:42,003
When you two have a drawing show
you can take him down a peg.

319
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,881
-And the plagiarism charges will go away.
-What?

320
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:47,425
Of course, that's just what I think.

321
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:51,972
I gave them hell.
"How could do us dirty like that?"

322
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:55,642
"It was a difficult decision
for us to make. This is unacceptable."

323
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:58,687
I told them in a very cold
and professional way.

324
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,855
I'm impressed.

325
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:04,401
As you can see,
I'm a very competent manager.

326
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,572
You should be filming me.

327
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:10,907
Let's just give it more thought.

328
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,326
You are great at what you do.

329
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:16,413
This is a chance for you
to humiliate him in public.

330
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,336
But Ung.

331
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:28,091
Maybe you should show them
something more artistic.

332
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:32,012
-What?
-Come on. Think about it.

333
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:35,724
If the viewers see this,
they'll think all you do is eat and sleep.

334
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:39,853
Shouldn't you show them
your professional side?

335
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:43,899
Hey, I hate being putting on airs
and being fake.

336
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:47,068
Documentaries are about
showing your natural self.

337
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:50,614
I hate doing things I wouldn't normally do
just because he's filming.

338
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:54,826
Don't expect me to be all pretentious.

339
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:01,791
Whenever I have time,
I come to the museum to enjoy art.

340
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:04,419
It's important for people like me

341
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:08,215
to be constantly stimulated and inspired.

342
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,719
I'm sure the video from ten years ago

343
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:14,512
never showed this side of me.

344
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:17,057
How do I put this…

345
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:22,103
The homogenized Korean education system
forces you into conformity.

346
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:27,234
That was why it was
so hard for me spread my wings.

347
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:31,738
I can say that this is my true self.

348
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:34,741
We're done.

349
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:36,284
Sorry. We ran out of battery.

350
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:40,789
-You didn't get any of that?
-Yes. I'm going to change the batteries.

351
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:43,750
Hey. You should be
shooting things like this.

352
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:47,254
-You only shot useless stuff.
-My camera doesn't want to film you.

353
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:49,673
-Did it just throw up? Are you okay?
-Do you want to die?

354
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:52,175
-I'll go get it.
-It's fine. I'll go get it.

355
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:53,510
You need batteries, right?

356
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:56,137
I'll be right back.

357
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:11,653
Of course, this is none of my business.

358
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,238
Has Yeon-su called you?

359
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:15,991
Why do you ask?

360
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:17,867
Well, after what happened…

361
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:20,161
Shouldn't you meet her in person
and talk it out?

362
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,539
I'll take care of it.

363
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:24,207
I'm sure you will.

364
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:27,627
But if you're going to do it,
do it in front of the camera.

365
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,798
You're taking everything you can,
aren't you?

366
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:33,425
Forget it.

367
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,270
I shouldn't have butted in.

368
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:47,230
You're avoiding her because you're sorry.

369
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:51,484
-What?
-You weren't that bothered

370
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,028
by what happened yesterday.

371
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:56,656
You're not the kind of person
who gets upset over things like that.

372
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:58,908
What do you mean?

373
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:01,578
You were mad at her,
and it had nothing to do with work.

374
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:06,082
You also know that Yeon-su
wouldn't have done that on purpose.

375
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,712
You were taking it out on her
for what happened in the past.

376
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:14,507
I didn't have to say that.

377
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,134
I can tell…

378
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:19,888
you still have feelings for her.

379
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:24,476
What did I expect him to tell me?

380
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,191
Why are so interested in us
all of a sudden?

381
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,985
It's not because of the shoot.

382
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,197
I don't think this is out of the blue.

383
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,282
What do you know?

384
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,243
What don't I know?

385
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,748
What was it that I wanted to check?

386
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,007
Yes!

387
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,802
This is perfect.

388
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:02,305
There's a group reservation today,
so there was a lot to prepare.

389
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:05,558
I told you to hire someone.
How are you going to do this by yourself?

390
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,560
And who's going to pay them?

391
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:11,231
So stop sitting around and help me!
I heard it's your day off.

392
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:13,858
Do you have to make me work on my day off?

393
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,152
Plus, I'm shooting a documentary.

394
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:20,990
Don't you want to film her working?

395
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,909
An everyday moment.

396
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:25,286
You're going to
keep filming her here, right?

397
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,329
Don't mind us.

398
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28,415
What do you know?

399
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,125
What is this anyway?

400
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,133
My gosh.

401
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,135
Octopuses?

402
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,720
They were delivered from
Mokpo this morning.

403
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:46,516
I'll put aside a plate for you.
What do you say?

404
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:52,689
-What do you need me to do?
-I've known Yeon-su for ten years.

405
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,649
We met when we were in college.

406
00:28:54,732 --> 00:28:57,819
As you all know,
she can be a bit of a **tch.

407
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:00,113
So we became friends after a huge fight.

408
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:02,740
I get along well with crazy **tches.

409
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,951
Excuse me. Why are you shooting her?

410
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:07,579
I was a big fan of that video.

411
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:09,205
I wrote a lot of comments.

412
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:11,791
My handle is "I'm Writer Lee."

413
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:15,211
-I used to write scripts for TV shows.
-You're supposed to be filming me.

414
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,922
Have you heard of a show called
Omniscient Psychopath's View?

415
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,632
I was the one who wrote it.

416
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:23,386
And I opened this little bar
using the money I made.

417
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,722
I actually used to have a partner.

418
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:28,224
He was my then-boyfriend.

419
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:30,435
They never asked to hear your life story.

420
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:34,022
On the day when I deposited the premium,
I caught that asshole cheating on me.

421
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,733
That idiot. I caught him red-handed.

422
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:38,568
So I cut him off

423
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:40,987
and was barely able to
open the bar by myself.

424
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,531
No one wants to know.

425
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,784
Do you think that asshole is
watching right now?

426
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,828
Jin-seob, are you watching?

427
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:51,623
A group of ten people
made a reservation today.

428
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:54,375
I'm doing just fine
and I hope you're doing fine too.

429
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,045
So do you also know Choi Ung?

430
00:29:58,004 --> 00:30:00,006
Of course. I know him very well.

431
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:01,883
-When they were in college--
-Look here.

432
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:04,677
There are many onions here.
Is this a Chinese restaurant?

433
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,805
If you want to know anything, ask away.

434
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:09,390
I'll even do an interview
if you film my bar properly.

435
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,935
-Hey. Here's the battery.
-Thanks.

436
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,145
Where's Ung?

437
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:18,900
-Something came up and he had to go.
-What is it?

438
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:21,819
Is it something I don't know about?
Wait. He just left me here?

439
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,530
Can't you see he left me here too?

440
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:26,533
Gosh. He sure is reckless these days.

441
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:29,827
This won't do. As his manager,
I'll give him a piece of my mind.

442
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:31,913
Where are you going?

443
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,873
I… Hold on.

444
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,172
Yes. What is it?

445
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,510
Now? Today?

446
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,013
You can't give me an hour's notice.

447
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,559
Just send the assistant director.

448
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:54,352
No, not Chae-ran.

449
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:58,648
Okay. I'll go.

450
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:01,234
The camera crew is coming too, right?

451
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,027
Okay.

452
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,697
Did something come up?

453
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,991
-Yes. I have to go.
-Wait…

454
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:14,330
I don't know what it is,
but can you drop me off on your way there?

455
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:19,002
I told you about the documentary, right?
He's the producer.

456
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:21,004
Hello. Give it to her.

457
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:27,844
We're shooting a special video
for the 700th episode special.

458
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:29,762
You just have to say congratulations

459
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:33,266
and a simple greeting to the viewers.

460
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:34,934
Did the previous producer quit?

461
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:37,103
I'm just filling in for him today.

462
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:38,688
I see.

463
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:42,525
We're all set, so we'll start shooting
as soon as you're ready to go.

464
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:44,777
Excuse me.

465
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,280
Haven't we met before?

466
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,910
-Pardon?
-Don't you know me?

467
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:57,874
-I'm sure everyone knows who you are.
-No. When I filmed this four years ago,

468
00:31:57,957 --> 00:32:00,335
weren't you the assistant director?

469
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,462
Yes. That's right.

470
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:06,591
I knew it.
How come you pretended not to know me?

471
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:08,593
I wasn't sure if you remembered me.

472
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:12,680
-Well, I tend to remember these things.
-Thank you for remembering.

473
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:17,101
I was very young,
so I was very nervous back then.

474
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,729
But seeing you acting nervous
in the corner there,

475
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:21,773
actually comforted me.

476
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:25,360
You can just talk about the video
naturally like you did just now.

477
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:28,112
Honestly, I don't remember
much from back then.

478
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:31,783
My schedule was pretty packed
and a lot of cameras were pointed at me.

479
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:34,285
And I didn't even know
which companies they were from.

480
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:38,498
Oh, I remember! It was when
they were shooting me meditate.

481
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:41,042
You were in the corner with
a kettle and you dozed off.

482
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,378
You dropped it
and were scolded because of that.

483
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,755
I was actually half-asleep
when I was meditating.

484
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:48,257
I was tired, so I lied I was meditating.

485
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,844
The sound of that kettle dropping
woke me up.

486
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:52,762
I see.

487
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,139
Shall we talk about something else?

488
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:57,767
You seem very different from then.

489
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:02,230
What program are you filming these days?

490
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:06,275
-It seems like you're in charge now.
-I'm doing a special show.

491
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:09,404
Special? What is it about?

492
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:14,909
Here's a plate of sliced raw octopus
that looks just like you.

493
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:20,540
Now that I think about it,
I don't think this covers my labor costs.

494
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:22,792
Eat up.

495
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:25,962
-Do you want a bottle of soju?
-Yes.

496
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,591
Coming right up.

497
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,176
Yes, this is Leezakaya.

498
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,637
Yes. 6:30 p.m., ten people.

499
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,139
What name are you under?

500
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:39,017
Yes. You want to cancel?

501
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:41,436
I see.

502
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:43,688
I guess it can't be helped.

503
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:45,231
Okay.

504
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:50,111
I'll pay for this.

505
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:56,826
This pub is going down in flames!

506
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,204
Why would they order octopus
if they're going to cancel?

507
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:04,125
Excuse me, can you shoot this

508
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:07,295
and send it to one of those
current affairs shows?

509
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,464
Gosh, this is so stressful.

510
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,384
What am I supposed to do
with the octopuses?

511
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:17,388
Let's try to attract customers with them.

512
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,432
When they come, just serve octopus.

513
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:23,144
Have you ever seen customers here?

514
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,731
Well, maybe like one or two…

515
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:31,527
What can I do?

516
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,362
Eat up.

517
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:37,158
You two should come and join us.

518
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,790
Is there anyone you can call over?

519
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,583
Me? What do you think?

520
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:47,460
Why am I your only friend?

521
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:48,419
What about you?

522
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:51,047
I have a lot of exes.

523
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,132
But you only have one ex-boyfriend.

524
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:55,927
Excuse me.

525
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:58,971
I know someone we can call.

526
00:35:04,101 --> 00:35:06,062
SBC CURRENT AFFAIRS AND CULTURE
PRODUCER JUNG CHAE-RAN

527
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,775
Hey. How's it going over there?

528
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:12,819
Yes.

529
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:14,362
DON'T WALK, RUN
RUNNING MAN

530
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:18,282
I see. That's great.

531
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,326
I'll be there once we're done here.

532
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:21,410
Okay.

533
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:25,706
You're the intern, right?

534
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,834
Yes, I'm Im Tae-hun.

535
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:30,002
Go home and get some rest.
I'll wrap it up here.

536
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:32,255
-No, wait--
-I won't say it again. Go home.

537
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:36,134
Thank you, sir!

538
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:43,432
Gosh, you're amazing.

539
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:44,851
You didn't have to do that.

540
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:48,354
When they come,
I will only charge them for the octopus.

541
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:49,814
Alcohol will be on the house.

542
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:52,066
Come here and have a drink.

543
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,861
Come to think of it,
we've never had a meal together.

544
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:57,697
-Thanks, but I'm okay.
-Just turn off the camera and come.

545
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,616
Here. Let's see.

546
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,034
Do you like octopuses?

547
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,996
-Gosh.
-That little…

548
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:08,958
Why would you try to feed
a grown-up and make a mess?

549
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:10,209
Welcome--

550
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:12,628
Wait.

551
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,422
What?

552
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,924
It's been a while.

553
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,392
Meeting like this out of the blue

554
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:32,023
What are you doing here?

555
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,983
I heard we're shooting something here.

556
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,403
I came because
I heard there will be octopus.

557
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,827
I first met Ung

558
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:47,455
when I was working part-time
at his father's shop.

559
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:51,250
There was this unemployed bum
who sat around doing nothing.

560
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:54,754
He turned out to be their son.

561
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:57,298
So I approached him--

562
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:58,883
I can hear you.

563
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:01,928
I noticed that he often doodled
on small pieces of paper.

564
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:05,139
And my animalistic instinct
told me that this was it.

565
00:37:05,222 --> 00:37:07,433
I saw his potential and knew he'd succeed.

566
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:10,937
So that's when I became his manager.

567
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:14,899
I'm actually known to be very diligent.

568
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:17,902
I don't think anyone asked.

569
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:20,613
Anyway, since I've known him the longest,

570
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:22,615
you can ask me anything you want.

571
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:25,826
What do you want to know?
His job? His past relationships?

572
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,244
Hold on.

573
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,372
Haven't we met before?

574
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:33,709
-That's not going to work on me.
-I'm sorry.

575
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,086
Enjoy.

576
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,754
Let me use the bathroom for a bit.

577
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:56,732
I should apologize to him first, right?

578
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:58,776
Right.

579
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:02,321
Since I'm more mature,

580
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,741
-Ung, about yesterday--
-I'm sorry.

581
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:09,286
What I said yesterday was just nonsense.
Just forget what I said.

582
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,915
I was upset,
so words just came flying out of my mouth.

583
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:15,793
I see.

584
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:19,130
Still, I was in the wrong.

585
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:21,215
-I'm sorry--
-I know it wasn't your fault.

586
00:38:21,298 --> 00:38:22,466
It's okay.

587
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:28,014
Okay.

588
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:33,686
Both my team and the Soen Shop

589
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:35,688
will make a formal apology.

590
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:39,025
-And I'll change it back--
-I'll do it.

591
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,862
-What?
-I'll work with Nu-a.

592
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:47,366
What? Why?

593
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,161
There's no reason for me not to.

594
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:52,872
That's true, but…

595
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:56,250
And you don't have to apologize.
I already went to see him.

596
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,794
-Who?
-Mr. Jang.

597
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,798
-You went to see him? When?
-He called me earlier.

598
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:06,510
What did he say to you? Did he apologize?

599
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:09,930
And what did you tell him?
Did you just brush it off again?

600
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,808
You should tell him if you were offended
and have him apologize--

601
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:13,768
I'll…

602
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:17,438
take care of it.

603
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:23,861
But…

604
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:28,282
why does Ung seem like a stranger today?

605
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:32,328
Okay.

606
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,330
Got it.

607
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:39,085
Anyway, we only have
a week until the opening,

608
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:41,128
so I'll make sure to be ready for it.

609
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:44,340
I'm sorry for being so childish.

610
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:48,052
Of course, things are now going

611
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,678
And the documentary…

612
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:54,183
I agreed to shoot for a month,
so I'll do my best.

613
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:57,353
Let's end this smoothly.

614
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,940
What is this I'm feeling?

615
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:08,697
Okay. Let's do that.

616
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:17,498
Why do I feel like

617
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:33,764
What are you doing?

618
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,686
At least pretend to be surprised.
You're so boring.

619
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:42,523
What are you doing here on a weekend?

620
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:46,360
Did you get a haircut? What about
your blind date? Were you turned down?

621
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:49,155
-She said my hair looks like a wig.
-I see.

622
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:50,990
What are you doing here at this hour?

623
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:53,117
I'm making backups
of what we filmed today.

624
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:58,038
I heard Tae-jin made you fill in for him.

625
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:01,041
-Why didn't he make Chae-ran do it?
-She's out shooting.

626
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:05,421
And I asked for an additional
team member, not an intern.

627
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:07,756
So you sent him back.

628
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,509
Send him back to me.
Don't make him go from team to team.

629
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:11,969
Just have him work on my team.

630
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:15,848
Gosh, you are more
kindhearted than you look.

631
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:17,141
Come here, you.

632
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,145
How's the shoot going?

633
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:25,149
I haven't heard from you in a while.
Why aren't you sharing anything?

634
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:27,359
Things are neither good nor bad.

635
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:30,070
Gosh, I'm curious
to see what they're like.

636
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,114
Maybe I should go visit the shoot.

637
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,326
What about you? Are you having fun?

638
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,245
Well…

639
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:41,332
Maybe I shouldn't have taken the job.

640
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,084
Hey, is that fun?

641
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,377
What do you mean?

642
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:47,379
Shooting someone with a camera.

643
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:51,717
Oh, this? Of course, it's fun.

644
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,054
Looking into other people's lives is fun.

645
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:59,516
You end up meeting
all kinds of people in the world

646
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:03,479
and end up feeling grateful
for your insipid life.

647
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,232
Why do you ask?

648
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:09,401
Does it really make you feel grateful
for your insipid life?

649
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:14,156
What is it?

650
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,117
It's not boring,
so stop looking at me like that.

651
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,744
This is just how I look.

652
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:21,705
And just give it time. It'll become fun.

653
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:24,708
You'll realize why I gave you this job.

654
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,377
Because I was available?

655
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,962
Gosh, don't talk like that.

656
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:31,382
I can't believe you don't see
how thoughtful I am.

657
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:34,176
Find out why I put you
in charge of this. That's your homework.

658
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,427
I'm off.

659
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:38,847
Have you been drinking?

660
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:45,854
Here.

661
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,690
It's on the house.

662
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,651
It's fresh clams.
I made a stew out of them.

663
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:53,779
It's on the house
since I haven't seen you in a long time.

664
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:55,823
You're looking good. How long has it been?

665
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:58,075
After you two broke--

666
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:03,247
I mean, we haven't seen each other
since our graduation.

667
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,540
It's been a while, right?

668
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:06,750
You're right. It has been a while.

669
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:09,253
I heard you're quite successful
as an illustrator.

670
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:11,422
No, he's doing great!

671
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:14,300
He's practically a star. Am I right?

672
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:17,761
You used to draw, right?
Is that what you do these days?

673
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:20,264
He's killing it out there
with his drawings.

674
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:23,601
Even Yeon-su came to ask him
to work with him.

675
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:24,727
Need I say more?

676
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:27,855
You can never tell
what's going to happen in life.

677
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:31,233
Who would have known
that the tables would turn like that

678
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:32,610
after their breakup--

679
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:41,035
-I'm going to go get some air.
-Let's go.

680
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:43,162
-Do you smoke?
-No, but I'm going outside.

681
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:44,788
Me neither, but I'm going anyway.

682
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,833
-This way.
-Thank you.

683
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:54,298
Gosh, they messed everything up.

684
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:03,515
Why does he keep acting like this?

685
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:06,393
What else did you ask?

686
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:09,521
Is he still mad? Or…

687
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:14,276
It's been ten years
since you two met on video.

688
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,861
How do you feel?

689
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:19,865
It was a long time ago,
so my memory was a little hazy,

690
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:23,869
but it was
surprisingly nice to see her again.

691
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:26,955
If you saw the video,
you know we don't get along too well.

692
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:33,212
Could he really be okay?

693
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,172
Ms. Kook?

694
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:37,800
Ms. Kook.

695
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:40,135
-Yes?
-How do you feel?

696
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:41,804
Well…

697
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:44,890
It was pretty much the same for me.

698
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:47,893
I was happy and surprised to see him.

699
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:23,762
-You're here.
-Hello.

700
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:28,392
Go-oh sent us a proposal this morning
regarding the collaboration.

701
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:30,936
-It's on our drive, so please take a look.
-Sure.

702
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:32,771
-We haven't heard from Nu-a yet.
-Okay.

703
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:34,940
We'll discuss it
after I take a look at it.

704
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:36,275
-Okay.
-Okay.

705
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:37,818
100 HOURS OF WORK
5 HOURS OF LIVE DRAWING

706
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:39,987
A hundred hours?

707
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:43,699
Is he really going to work for
one hundred hours?

708
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:44,950
I know, right?

709
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:47,995
I think he's going to show us
his work process for the first time.

710
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:51,665
He says he's going to record
his entire work process.

711
00:45:51,748 --> 00:45:54,960
Can he do that in five days? Oh my.

712
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:57,087
He's going to work for five days

713
00:45:57,171 --> 00:46:00,132
and draw the rest live
on the day of the opening.

714
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:02,384
How is that even possible?

715
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:05,304
So aside from when he eats and sleeps,

716
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:07,848
he's going to draw for 19 hours a day?

717
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:08,974
Something like that.

718
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:12,811
He's a far greater artist than I thought.

719
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:21,695
Make sure everything is set up.

720
00:46:21,778 --> 00:46:25,199
Make sure to check everything
thoroughly at the scene.

721
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:27,117
And as for Myeong-ho, I want you to…

722
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:33,123
The event will consist of
the opening ceremony, the opening,

723
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:35,501
the live drawing show, and the closing.

724
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:38,128
Next, I'll guide you through the details.

725
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:42,049
After the cake cutting ceremony,
we'll take a group photo.

726
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:45,260
Yes, it's done.

727
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:47,429
Put that there.

728
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:51,517
We'll put one camera on top
and one over here.

729
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,893
Yes.

730
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:01,235
Let me call you back.

731
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:36,395
As you can see, it saysgamjatang.

732
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:39,273
We weren't really trying to
run a business when we started it.

733
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,233
Let's havegamjatangfor dinner.

734
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:43,652
It's something our family used to enjoy--

735
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:46,113
-Let's go to the chicken feet restaurant.
-Chicken feet?

736
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:48,907
-And the seafood soup.
-He's so excited.

737
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:55,414
Welcome.

738
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:57,499
-A table for two, please.
-Did you just get off work?

739
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:59,084
-Yes.
-Let me know once you decide.

740
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:00,294
Okay.

741
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:02,087
Thank you. Come again.

742
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:03,672
-Excuse me.
-Coming!

743
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:01,915
I'm home.

744
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:03,417
You must be tired.

745
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:37,033
CHOI UNG

746
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:48,712
-Make sure they get more exposure.
-Sure.

747
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:51,840
What do you think about this space?

748
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:54,593
I'll make sure
this entire space is in the shot.

749
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:56,011
All right. Moving on.

750
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:24,664
Ms. Kook.

751
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:28,752
Ms. Kook.

752
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:31,254
Hi, Ye-in.

753
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:33,673
You should go home.
You have a big day tomorrow.

754
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:36,676
You should go get some rest too.
Good work today.

755
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:42,766
How much do you think Go-oh did so far?

756
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:44,851
Do you think he succeeded?

757
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:49,064
I'm sure he did.

758
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:53,401
I bet he didn't even have time
to sleep or eat.

759
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:56,363
Being an artist must be difficult.

760
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,907
I'll get going then.

761
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:16,341
GU EUN-HO

762
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:21,930
The phone you are calling

763
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:24,641
Your call will be directed

764
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:28,186
KIM JI-UNG

765
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:32,858
What's up?

766
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:34,401
Ji-ung.

767
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:38,864
How's Ung? Is he doing okay?

768
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:41,700
Yes. He was doing fine

769
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,286
I see.

770
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:46,496
If you're worried, go ahead and call him.

771
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:47,873
No, it's fine.

772
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:51,877
Eun-ho is with Ung, right?

773
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,129
No, Eun-ho left with me.

774
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:56,631
He said he wanted to finish up by himself.

775
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:58,049
Will he be okay alone?

776
00:52:58,133 --> 00:52:59,175
He won't die.

777
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:02,178
I guess you don't know.
He's like that when he works.

778
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:03,972
I see.

779
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,100
Okay.

780
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:09,519
You're coming tomorrow, right?

781
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:13,064
Okay. See you tomorrow.

782
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:08,578
GO-OH'S 100 HOURS

783
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:09,663
EVENT OUTLINE

784
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:24,094
It won't be weird to call him
since it will be for tomorrow's event.

785
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:26,096
I'll just see if he's still alive.

786
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:34,104
He's super sensitive
so he might cause a scene.

787
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:40,777
Can't he just call me from time to time
to report on his progress?

788
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:42,821
How frustrating.

789
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:46,700
Why do I care?

790
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:49,661
I'm not going to care anymore.

791
00:55:00,338 --> 00:55:03,591
So why am I even here?

792
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:11,391
No.

793
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:15,854
I should check up on the artist

794
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:17,689
This is totally acceptable.

795
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:24,154
Even if the artist wasn't Ung,

796
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:26,489
I would have done the same thing.

797
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:29,826
I would have

798
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:32,829
It's just purely business.

799
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:20,460
I rang the bell, but you didn't answer
so I called you.

800
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:27,342
I didn't come to interrupt.

801
00:56:27,425 --> 00:56:30,929
I wanted to check how it was going
for the event tomorrow, since you…

802
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:34,849
I mean, checking up on the artist
is also a part of my job.

803
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:37,519
I came because I was told to.

804
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:45,360
This is jujube tea. I know you have
a hard time falling asleep…

805
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:47,487
I mean, they told me to give it to you.

806
00:56:48,696 --> 00:56:50,198
Have some tea and get some sleep.

807
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:53,118
It was 95 hours.

808
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:55,912
What?

809
00:56:57,455 --> 00:56:59,249
I just finished working for 95 hours.

810
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:03,336
I'll draw the rest
in front of the audience tomorrow.

811
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:06,089
Really?

812
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:08,299
Did you really manage to do it?

813
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:10,802
You really are amazing--

814
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:17,851
Anyway, drink this and get some sleep.

815
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:27,443
That wasn't so bad, right?

816
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,612
I'm going to go now.

817
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,657
I was very professional.

818
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:39,330
But…

819
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,130
Do you want to sleep over?

820
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:14,574
EPILOGUE

821
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:18,077
I'll do it.

822
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:21,039
I don't care if I do it with Nu-a
or anyone else.

823
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:26,211
You're wiser than I thought.

824
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:28,963
Then we'll just proceed as planned.

825
00:58:30,965 --> 00:58:33,176
I'm sorry for what happened that day.

826
00:58:34,385 --> 00:58:38,139
Well, I was on edge that day.

827
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:40,266
I'd like to apologize as well.

828
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,894
You were upset at Ms. Kook, not me.

829
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:53,530
Well…

830
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:56,324
Can I ask you a personal question?

831
00:58:57,325 --> 00:58:59,118
I can't say that I like it,

832
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:01,412
but since it's you who's asking, sure.

833
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,004
It's nothing.

834
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:17,470
You're very easy to read.

835
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:22,308
When you were looking at Ms. Kook,

836
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:25,436
it didn't seem like you were over her.

837
00:59:26,854 --> 00:59:28,606
What are you…

838
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:30,441
I think everyone knows except you.

839
00:59:31,192 --> 00:59:34,320
As long as you don't ruin the project
because of your personal feelings,

840
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:36,197
I don't really care.

841
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:39,534
And of course, Ms. Kook assured me
that will never happen.

842
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:42,704
She did?

843
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:45,373
As for my answer to your question…

844
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:51,838
Ms. Kook is very talented.

845
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,383
And that's why I like her.

846
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:00,305
As a business partner, of course.

847
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:02,348
It seems it's someone else

848
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:06,060
that you should be worried about, not me.

849
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:10,398
You're coming tomorrow, right?

850
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:11,733
Okay.

851
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:42,764
A SECRET THAT CAN'T BE TOLD

852
01:01:04,118 --> 01:01:07,038
What should I say

853
01:01:07,872 --> 01:01:11,209
I think I finally appreciate Yeon-su

854
01:01:11,292 --> 01:01:14,379
Another artist will be

855
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:16,089
You'll be too captivated to go there.

856
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:19,675
I saw Ung's eyes as he was drawing today.

857
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:22,011
They seemed so soulful.

858
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:23,805
This is a side of you I haven't seen.

859
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:26,849
Do you still like Ung?

860
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:32,397
