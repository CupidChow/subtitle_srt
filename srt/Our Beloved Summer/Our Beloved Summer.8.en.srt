1
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,711
Aren't you happy to be out here?

2
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:46,380
I am.

3
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:49,049
You always talked
about wanting to relax somewhere,

4
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:51,301
-and you're finally here.
-Yes, I am.

5
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:54,638
Do you often go on trips?

6
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:56,640
I do.

7
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:01,603
Any memorable trips?

8
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:07,609
Which trip was the most memorable?

9
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,197
Despite not wanting to remember,

10
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,367
there's one trip that I just can't forget.

11
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,743
Did you not hear the question?

12
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:19,079
And it's also…

13
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:22,416
Hey, Ung.

14
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:25,460
TWO DAYS BEFORE UNG'S DEPARTURE

15
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:26,920
Hey, Ung.

16
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:29,798
…with Yeon-su.

17
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,137
Ung.

18
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,474
Ung.

19
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:45,939
Are you ignoring me?

20
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:48,984
Didn't we break up?

21
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,236
Really? Did we?

22
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:55,657
How could you tell me
to just go so easily?

23
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:58,702
Because you should.
The school is covering the costs.

24
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,580
Are you fine
with being apart for six months?

25
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,959
This is a great opportunity for you
to learn many new things.

26
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:07,919
Of course, you should go.

27
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:14,634
Let's go on a trip.

28
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:17,429
You can go alone.
I'll be going on a long one soon anyway.

29
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,265
Hurry. We need to leave.

30
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:21,433
Where to?

31
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,810
You wanted to see the sea, so let's go.

32
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:24,728
Right now?

33
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,939
Just like now, I had no say on this trip.

34
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:30,233
Yes. I bought the bus tickets already.
Come on.

35
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:33,945
Why didn't you tell me about this sooner?

36
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:38,575
SUWON, JANGAN, HOGOK-RI

37
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,243
Don't you smell the sea already?

38
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:41,411
It was barely a trip.

39
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,121
Who is this trip for?

40
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:46,666
There's no time. We need to hurry
if we want to catch the bus back.

41
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,001
Is this what I think it is?

42
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:51,671
Our final trip together?

43
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,883
How could I forget that trip?

44
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,718
Let's hurry. We need to get a move on.

45
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:58,428
Thank you.

46
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:59,429
-Enjoy.
-Thanks.

47
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:02,557
Check this out.
Doesn't it look scrumptious?

48
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,313
It's my treat, so eat up.

49
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,023
Here.

50
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,527
Is thisThe Last Supperor something?

51
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,696
Look at how plump this is.
I've never had this before.

52
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,076
Are you going to treat me to a nice meal

53
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,536
then leave me here?

54
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:24,496
Just eat.

55
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:27,791
Eat up. Today is going to be a busy day.

56
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,584
She did whatever she liked.

57
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:35,632
I'll take it now.

58
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:36,633
By myself?

59
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,635
Smile. They're all waiting.

60
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,304
-Why aren't you taking it with me?
-All right.

61
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,140
Is this really our final trip?

62
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,724
Before we break up?

63
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,101
I could never read her.

64
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:48,103
One, two, three.

65
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,399
Done. Let's go.

66
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,330
Can't I just appreciate the view?

67
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,249
You need photos to reminisce.

68
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,002
I want to ponder a bit.

69
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:13,628
About what?

70
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:15,964
About our future.

71
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:19,050
Come on. Why bother
thinking about that while on a trip?

72
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:22,387
I was thinking about it at home,
but then you dragged me here.

73
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:26,099
Look at this. You look like a wild deer.

74
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:29,227
Are you ignoring
everything that I'm saying?

75
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,022
What a shame.
It would have been better during the day.

76
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:35,442
She never listened to me

77
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:39,154
Hey. Smile, will you?

78
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,656
I feel like I'm talking to a wall.

79
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,493
We're running out of time.
We need to go to the market.

80
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,913
Hey, let's go.

81
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,098
Take a look.

82
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:09,517
-What would you like?
-It's a long arm octopus.

83
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:11,937
-Gosh, they're very fresh.
-Can I touch it?

84
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,146
Of course.

85
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,358
Stop that.

86
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:19,277
-Goodness. He's such a scaredy-cat.
-Where are you going?

87
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,040
Let's go.

88
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:35,627
And…

89
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,129
Look at the crabs.

90
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:45,178
SUWON, JANGAN, HOGOK-RI

91
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:57,399
Wasn't today fun?

92
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:03,780
Are you sleeping?

93
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,338
You always frown in your sleep.

94
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:25,635
-Here.
-Thanks.

95
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:34,519
Next time, let's take a longer trip.

96
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,442
I took up an extra part-time job,
so I've been way too busy.

97
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,737
I was going to take
the morning shift off but I couldn't.

98
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,865
It was hectic, wasn't it?

99
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,909
This was my first trip,
so I'm still new to it.

100
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:54,247
Next time, let's stay longer
and go farther away.

101
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,292
Do you want me with you next time too?

102
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,794
Who am I supposed to go with?
Should I go by myself?

103
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:03,089
She was always like that.

104
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,385
Hey. Are you really stupid?

105
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:09,554
Why would we break up?

106
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:13,349
Then you should have told me
instead of making me feel anxious.

107
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,060
Must I say it out loud?

108
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,144
Can't you tell?

109
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,354
I can't. I still can't.

110
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,274
Unless you tell me, I can't read you.

111
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:28,782
Choi Ung.

112
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:32,911
Ung.

113
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:40,418
Look at me.

114
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,965
We're not going to break up.

115
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:51,679
If we fight or break up again,

116
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:56,142
just come to me like you did today.

117
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,271
-And then?
-Then…

118
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,788
You could have smiled like this
for the photos.

119
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,623
I need to look at them while you're gone.

120
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,959
Is that why you took them?

121
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,711
You know what? Let's take one now.

122
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,255
-Here?
-Yes.

123
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,384
Okay. Smile.

124
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,597
At times, she'd feel extremely distant.

125
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,683
Other times, she'd pull me closer…

126
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,061
Why aren't you taking it?

127
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:49,362
What's wrong? Do I have an ugly smile?

128
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:57,454
I think I love you.

129
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,959
…and make time stop.

130
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,046
Did you know that?

131
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:14,429
No.

132
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:20,768
I don't.

133
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,063
So remind me every time.

134
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:29,819
So how could I forget that moment?

135
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,285
I had no idea then.

136
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:46,836
I'm not sure.

137
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,839
I don't really enjoy going on trips.

138
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,885
That the promises you make on a trip…

139
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,678
There's nothing memorable.

140
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,555
…are all lies.

141
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:09,984
EPISODE 8
BEFORE SUNSET

142
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:15,573
Honestly, I don't know what's going on.
I tagged along just in case.

143
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:20,286
I do suspect that something's going on
between those two.

144
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,498
Ung has always been irresponsible,

145
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,209
so it's normal for him
to run away or not pick up my calls.

146
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,002
But Yeon-su ran away too.

147
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:32,966
That made me think
something was going on between the two.

148
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,051
Anyway, I'm not here to relax.

149
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:38,346
How do I put it?
I'm here to keep an eye on them.

150
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,517
It's my duty as his manager

151
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,645
to take care of his mental health.

152
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,273
They'll figure it out.

153
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,650
After all, they're adults.

154
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,070
But seeing how childish they still are,

155
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,239
I guess I'm the only one
who's growing old.

156
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,286
Oh, my. I didn't know I brought this.

157
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,956
Is there someplace I can swim
around here? Perhaps, an indoor pool?

158
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:09,252
Anyway, you guys were smart
to lock them up in here.

159
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,046
They're extremely irresponsible.

160
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,508
I'm sure I brought some hangover medicine.

161
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:18,261
I heard you've known them
for a very long time.

162
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,222
Would you say
that they have changed over time?

163
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:27,353
To be honest,
they haven't changed one bit.

164
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,897
They were a headache back then,

165
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,607
and they still are.

166
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:35,111
They're a nuisance
to everyone around them.

167
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,072
By the way, where are they?

168
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,533
Don't tell me they're arguing.

169
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,501
Things have gotten worse.

170
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:54,672
Why now? Why did we have

171
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:17,320
if you were going to run away,
you should have gone farther.

172
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:21,032
That's rich coming from you.
You were caught too.

173
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:24,660
So? Have you given up?

174
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,205
Are you going to keep filming?

175
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,208
What choice do I have?

176
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,508
You said you were sick of me.

177
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,596
How can we be in the same place
if you're that sick of me?

178
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,194
We really came on another trip.

179
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,737
Next time, let's stay longer.

180
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,155
And it's longer.

181
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:02,657
And go farther away.

182
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,908
And farther away.

183
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:06,786
What?

184
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,834
Isn't it the same for you?
You must be sick of this too.

185
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:17,630
We fight, avoid each other, and run away.

186
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,549
That's what we do.

187
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:21,884
And now, here we are.

188
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,554
What can we do though?

189
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:38,234
Do you want some privacy?

190
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:42,905
No, I'll leave.

191
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,924
Why did I have to remember that now?

192
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,524
Gosh, what a nice view.

193
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,694
Why are you breathing down my neck?

194
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,740
I look forward to learning
many things from you on this trip.

195
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:28,367
I'll observe every little thing you do.

196
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:31,954
You better step back
unless you want to be let go.

197
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:37,585
I already told you, but I'm truly glad
to be a part of your team.

198
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:40,463
Both you and Ms. Jung
are incredibly talented.

199
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,797
I'm very eager to learn.

200
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,716
I don't like repetition.

201
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,134
I see.

202
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,179
You have two jobs.

203
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,472
Anything, sir!

204
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,683
Number one. Always be ready
to give Chae-ran what she needs.

205
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:55,603
-I can do that.
-Number two. You shouldn't block my view

206
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,271
when I look around.

207
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,735
What should you do then?

208
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,697
That's it. Simple, right?

209
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:10,743
Anyway, I'll do my best.

210
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:13,830
I know you're being cold
because you think I'll quit too.

211
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:17,291
But I'm not going to quit
and will do my best.

212
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:21,838
I can assure you
that tenacity is my forte.

213
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,345
I want to become
a competent producer just like you.

214
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:34,934
Mr. Park said you also made
many mistakes as a rookie.

215
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,812
But thanks to his guidance,
you were able to grow.

216
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:38,771
So I--

217
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,487
What are you doing?

218
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,157
I will also learn and grow.

219
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:55,037
My heart flutters the most before filming.

220
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,169
I mean it.

221
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,716
This is the most exciting part of my life.
Don't you feel the same way?

222
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,094
Hey, cut this nonsense
and go help Chae-ran.

223
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,804
-Yes, sir.
-Leave that here.

224
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:13,889
Yes, sir.

225
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,565
Why would his heart flutter?

226
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:00,061
My gosh.

227
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,480
What are you doing here?

228
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:03,439
I'm sorry.

229
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,775
May I take a few more photos here?

230
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,444
-Here?
-Wait, sir.

231
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:11,989
Is this building in the drawing
the one we're in front of right now?

232
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:13,991
SEOUL HARDWARE

233
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:15,993
SEOUL HARDWARE

234
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:18,037
Yes, you're right.

235
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,705
See? I told you.

236
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:22,667
He apparently drew many places
in this neighborhood.

237
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:27,463
Then sir, do you recognize this place?

238
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,547
Hold on.

239
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,510
That's the flower shop over there.

240
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,304
-Let's stop by. Thank you.
-Thank you.

241
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:38,766
By the way, what is this?

242
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:41,644
Ho.

243
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:42,603
WITH UNG
MEALS WITH RICE

244
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:46,774
Hey, Chang-sik.
Didn't you stop by this morning?

245
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,484
Once a day will do.

246
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:52,363
Ung must have really put on quite a show.

247
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:55,408
-I told you it's not that kind of a show.
-No, listen.

248
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:59,662
Tourists came by
the hardware store and took photos.

249
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,832
They said they came because they saw
my store in one of his drawings.

250
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,583
Oh, that?

251
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,502
"Oh, that?"

252
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:11,048
What was that? Why aren't you surprised?

253
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:12,925
-Come here.
-What?

254
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,595
-Gosh, enjoy the food.
-Thank you.

255
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:17,888
Enjoy.

256
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:19,807
-Enjoy.
-It's really good.

257
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,058
What would you like?

258
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:23,561
Don't stare
when they're eating. It's rude.

259
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,730
I thought it was weird

260
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:29,525
that we had
a lot of young customers recently.

261
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,318
My goodness.

262
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:34,697
It seems Ung has become quite famous.

263
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,701
Speaking of which, I'm thinking
about hanging his drawings here

264
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,870
and also in the alley.

265
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:44,790
Then this alley
will become a popular tourist site.

266
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:47,209
Honey, don't just stand there.
Help me out.

267
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,169
Coming.

268
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,921
Also, I'm thinking
about wearing a name tag.

269
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:53,007
It's going to say "Ung's Father".

270
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:57,094
Or maybe a cap with the same writing.

271
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:58,888
-Hurry up.
-Okay.

272
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:00,514
Can you give me…

273
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,726
SEOUL HARDWARE

274
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,520
…one of his drawings?

275
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,954
Our latest project was a big success.

276
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:25,706
Good job, everyone.

277
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,625
Soen is very pleased.

278
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,127
It's all thanks to Ms. Kook.

279
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:32,922
I agree. Ms. Kook, thank you.

280
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:36,383
Ms. Kook, have a great vacation

281
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,302
Right. Did you read the news?

282
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:41,472
Everyone loves Go-oh. Here's the link.

283
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:44,350
GO-OH AND SOEN'S SYNERGY

284
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,067
WHO IS GO-OH?
NJ AND GO-OH'S SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP

285
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:01,367
NJ AND GO-OH'S SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP

286
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,661
GO-OH RECEIVED FLOWERS FROM NJ

287
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:14,171
I doubt it's special.

288
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,676
What are you mumbling to yourself?

289
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,095
What? Were you filming me?

290
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,056
Well, filming is a part of my job.

291
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,267
But I don't do it in secret,
so don't worry.

292
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:28,936
As I said before, I'm ethical.

293
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,855
How ethical of you to kidnap me.

294
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,440
You would have run away
had I told you beforehand.

295
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:35,734
I've lost trust in both of you.

296
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,653
At least I explained everything later.

297
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,905
You're getting very annoying these days.

298
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:41,782
You should make things up for going AWOL.

299
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,909
You shouldn't have run away.

300
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:46,120
I wouldn't have
had I known this would happen.

301
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:49,081
Since you're here,

302
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:51,625
just relax and take your mind off things.

303
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:54,211
In front of the camera? How relaxing.

304
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:58,299
Was there anything
you wanted to do on a trip?

305
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,342
I'm not sure. I never thought about that.

306
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,052
Think now. I'll make it come true.

307
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:04,138
I know this is all for the documentary.

308
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:06,974
Geez.

309
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,357
So? How's it going?

310
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:16,525
What do you mean?

311
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,068
That artist you're interested in.

312
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:20,237
What? Is it already over?

313
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:22,281
Don't be absurd. It hasn't even begun.

314
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,867
I'm still working on it,

315
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:27,536
but I did tell him how I feel.

316
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,789
Again? It doesn't surprise me anymore.

317
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,209
What's with the reaction? How could you?

318
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,128
Can you always act surprised?

319
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:37,713
With your face,

320
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,965
I would have seduced
every single man out there

321
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:41,592
and made them ask me out.

322
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,929
Why do you always end up
telling them how you feel first?

323
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,681
What's wrong with expressing my feelings?

324
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,392
This is exactly why you're still single.

325
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:54,104
Speak for yourself.
Were you ever in a relationship?

326
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:58,609
Well, I just told him how I feel for now.

327
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:01,862
He must be taken aback.
He needs some time to think.

328
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:03,238
He must be confused.

329
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,283
One call from me right now,

330
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:08,077
and he'll be swayed.

331
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,036
MR. CHOI UNG

332
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,793
The person you have called

333
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,212
Please try calling again later.

334
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:19,755
What? Is he not picking up?

335
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:23,717
Look at that. You confessed to him,
and he's not picking up.

336
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:27,096
This is fascinating.

337
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,891
Hey, you're not done here.
Where do you think you're going?

338
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:33,602
Why isn't he picking up my call?

339
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:36,105
This will be the end of your interview.

340
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:40,025
Now, you can spend the time
however you want, and we'll film you.

341
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:42,403
Tell me what you'd each like to do.

342
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,367
Can I just lie down?

343
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:50,869
Of course, you can.

344
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:53,414
Eighty percent of your footage
is of you lying down,

345
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:54,623
so keep at it.

346
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:56,583
What difference will it make?

347
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:58,836
Just lie down and don't ever get up, okay?

348
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:08,470
Hey, it took ages to reach downtown.

349
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,974
Imtern, how much
of our company's money did you spend?

350
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,392
She said we needed these.

351
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,394
There are many of us.

352
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:16,645
This isn't much.

353
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,022
Sol-i is an excellent cook.

354
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,982
I don't get why her business is failing.

355
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,525
Shut up and eat your ice cream.

356
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:25,946
What is this?

357
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,907
Gosh, we paid
for someone else's stuff. Geez.

358
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,827
-What? Did you want this?
-Yes.

359
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,328
It's my favorite.

360
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:37,666
You're going to draw?

361
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,252
Yes. What else can I do here?

362
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:41,253
Where are you going?

363
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:42,880
Not too far, so don't worry.

364
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:45,382
I saw many beautiful trees.

365
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,802
Put some more clothes on.
It's cold in the mountains.

366
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:50,596
I'm not going with you.

367
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,598
What? Then who is?

368
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:53,891
Chae-ran will.

369
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:56,060
What about you?

370
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:58,896
I'm going to visit the village
with Yeon-su.

371
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:03,400
I see. Suit yourself then.

372
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:07,154
-Are you ready?
-I don't need to get ready.

373
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:08,489
Can I do whatever I want?

374
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:11,075
Sure. Whatever you want.

375
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,452
Hey.

376
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,705
What time do I need to be back by?

377
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:20,459
Well, there's no set time.

378
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:23,128
This is a rural area,
so it'll get dark soon.

379
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,506
You should come back early.

380
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:26,965
Let's go, Ung.

381
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:31,178
"Ung?"

382
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:34,264
They were never that close.

383
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:36,892
I'm speechless.

384
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:39,895
I'm Ung.

385
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:45,359
I've been feeling frustrated lately.

386
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,820
But now that I'm here,

387
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:50,572
I feel a little more liberated.

388
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:54,701
Also, it's been ages
since I've gone on vacation.

389
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:59,123
Honestly,
I've never really taken any breaks.

390
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,833
So I don't know how to relax.

391
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,043
I think that's why I always work.

392
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:06,672
I've only gone on one trip
in my entire life.

393
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:12,219
Don't you think

394
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:16,515
I'm born to be on camera?
I was just talking endlessly on my own.

395
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:20,435
Gosh, I did you another favor.

396
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,315
I have a question.

397
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:26,525
What is it?

398
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:30,654
How will you film me
if I get on a bicycle?

399
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:36,869
I can drive, fly a Helicam,

400
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,329
or set up a camera far away.

401
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:41,665
In any case, it won't be easy.

402
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:42,875
I see.

403
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,042
Are you going to?

404
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:47,129
Okay. Let me call the others--

405
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,298
No, don't. Let's make this simple.

406
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,759
-That'll be a headache for me.
-Exactly.

407
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:57,556
-You were never this childish.
-Is that a no, then?

408
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:03,270
What are you doing? Go over there.

409
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:06,398
Hey.

410
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,962
-Are you done?
-Yes. Let's go.

411
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,393
This is boring, right?

412
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:26,061
It's okay.

413
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:28,730
He told me to do whatever I wanted.

414
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:31,525
I'm always this boring.

415
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:34,778
I know. I saw all the footage
from ten years ago.

416
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,238
I was boring back then too.

417
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,240
That's why I had no expectations.

418
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,621
Stop hanging out with Ji-ung.

419
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:46,248
You sound just like him right now.

420
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,126
That's a compliment in my line of work.

421
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:56,008
How was it?

422
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,634
The footage from ten years ago.

423
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,220
Did you not watch it?

424
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:02,139
There were parts that didn't air.

425
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:05,434
That was actually the fun part.

426
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:09,229
If it was up to me,
I would have re-edited the footage.

427
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:10,147
Why?

428
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:13,650
They only showed the lives
of the top and the worst students.

429
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:15,444
There's a lot we missed out on.

430
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:17,988
Like what?

431
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:20,532
You're playing dumb.

432
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:26,246
After watching the footage,
I could tell exactly when you started

433
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,332
developing feelings for her.

434
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:31,918
Are you teasing me?

435
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:34,338
Yes. A bit.

436
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:40,302
Let me repeat myself.
Don't hang out with Ji-ung.

437
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:50,062
Then what about now?

438
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:55,359
How do we look from where you're standing?

439
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,655
I think…

440
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:08,914
I've said enough.

441
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:11,667
I shouldn't get involved.
That's how this job works.

442
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:19,508
-You're quite interesting.
-Thanks.

443
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:24,388
In return, it'd be nice if you
made things more interesting.

444
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:28,433
I'll do my best.

445
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,829
Why am I the only one who's exhausted?

446
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,997
Why aren't you tired?

447
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,753
Yeon-su, good stamina is a must
if you want to be a producer.

448
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:58,171
You sicken me.

449
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:01,299
Right, you used to be
in the track and field team.

450
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:06,471
-You remember that?
-You were always running under the sun.

451
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:10,308
But Ung caught my eye even more
since he was always lying in the shade.

452
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:18,900
This is nice.

453
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,545
I could totally fall asleep right now.

454
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:41,756
You must be tired
since we left early in the morning.

455
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,135
I never understood people
who took naps under the shade.

456
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,638
So this is how it feels.

457
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,641
Get some shut-eye. We have a lot of time.

458
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:56,688
If I nap now,
I won't be able to sleep tonight.

459
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,298
Goodness.

460
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:27,761
I haven't seen you around before.
Are you visiting?

461
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,679
Yes. We'll be staying for a few days.

462
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:33,308
I see. You two must be on a trip.

463
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,894
Why would you come here
when there's nothing to see?

464
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,521
But the scenery is nice, right?

465
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:39,814
Yes, it's a beautiful village.

466
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,733
It's quiet and the air is fresh.

467
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,820
There's a small hill over there.

468
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:49,533
The view from up there
looks marvelous during sundown.

469
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:52,702
Go take a look with your girlfriend
when she wakes up.

470
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,371
I will. Thank you.

471
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:59,709
Goodness. It's good
to be young and in love.

472
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:01,211
Tell me about it.

473
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,759
So I'm your girlfriend.

474
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:12,472
And we're young and in love.

475
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:16,268
Are we?

476
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:25,777
Well, I didn't feel the need
to correct them.

477
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,906
They were just being nice.

478
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:45,338
You're back.
I've brought the lighting equipment.

479
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:49,301
Hey, you're back.
By the way, did you see Eun-ho?

480
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,385
Why? Where did he go?

481
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:53,722
We went out a while ago,
and I abandoned him.

482
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,057
Well done. But why?

483
00:32:56,933 --> 00:33:00,103
He talks too much.

484
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:01,730
I just can't take it.

485
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,316
Gosh, he nags so much too.

486
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,942
I get it. Well done.

487
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:12,407
By the way,
are Ji-ung and Yeon-su not back yet?

488
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,200
No, they're not.

489
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:16,161
I didn't see them during my drive either.

490
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,370
They must have gone far.

491
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:22,459
It's getting late though.

492
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:24,794
I'm sure they'll come back.

493
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:28,006
Gosh, I'm tired of resting here.

494
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,883
I already miss Seoul.

495
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:33,595
Sol-i.

496
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:35,680
How could you abandon me?

497
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:40,268
I walked 7km in these sandals.

498
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:43,688
Gosh, Eun-ho is back and in tatters!

499
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:47,651
Hey. I'll give you a piggyback ride.

500
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:49,945
Forget it. Go away.

501
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,988
Do you even know how much pain I'm in?

502
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:58,161
-Let's go.
-Gosh.

503
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:59,287
WITH UNG
MEALS WITH RICE

504
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:01,706
-Let's go.
-We've never closed this early before.

505
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,541
Gosh, we're out of ingredients.

506
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:07,337
Let's wrap up the other shops too
and call it a day.

507
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,339
-Goodness.
-Goodness.

508
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:10,256
Are you closed?

509
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:13,426
I'm sorry. We've closed early today.

510
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,971
We ran out of ingredients.

511
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,347
So it's empty.

512
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:19,057
Yes.

513
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,767
That's better for me.

514
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,102
What? Hold on.

515
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,854
She looks familiar.

516
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:26,773
Is Mr. Choi Ung not here?

517
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:29,859
I see. Are you a fan of his?

518
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:33,029
I am, but I'm also here
because he owes me.

519
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:42,247
-It's good. Try some.
-What?

520
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,503
-It's a bit bland.
-Is it?

521
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,131
This is bland? Is he serious?

522
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:53,758
Gosh.

523
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,179
Yeon-su, try this.

524
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:04,936
This is bland? Gosh, that's infuriating.

525
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:08,064
-Do we have salt?
-Yes, it's in there.

526
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:13,570
What are you doing? Come out.
Let's eat dinner and call it a day.

527
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:17,699
-You must have had a lot to film.
-I guess. Why do you ask?

528
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:21,411
Well, it's just that you came back late.

529
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:23,288
With Yeon-su.

530
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,501
Never mind.

531
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,671
Also, don't let your juniors
take after you.

532
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:34,132
Chae-ran must have done well.

533
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,634
Geez. You're a bad influence.

534
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:37,844
Gosh.

535
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:55,111
Here. Eat up since it was
a tough day for you.

536
00:35:55,195 --> 00:35:57,864
Sol-i, I can't feel my legs. Am I okay?

537
00:35:57,947 --> 00:35:59,949
It's okay. Rest up, and you'll be fine.

538
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:02,744
My hands are trembling too.
Why won't it stop?

539
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:05,288
It's just your imagination. Dig in.

540
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:09,501
Should we drink later?
You guys better not sleep early today.

541
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,878
We'll be drinking all night, so eat up.

542
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:15,590
Right. Where did you guys go?
What took you so long?

543
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:17,133
Somewhere nice?

544
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:20,887
Well, we biked around the village

545
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:22,722
and took a nap.

546
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,308
A nap? Outside?

547
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:27,185
Yes. Why?

548
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,814
Didn't you think
people who took naps were pathetic?

549
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,820
I'm on a trip. I can do whatever I want.

550
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:38,822
I don't know about that.

551
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:42,283
Don't you like having
a tight schedule when you're on a trip?

552
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:46,204
Not every time.
And it also depends on who I'm with.

553
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:51,793
-You must have gone on many trips.
-I've had my fair share.

554
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:01,136
-You're getting a call.
-He is?

555
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,387
It's your dad.

556
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,305
What? It's a video call.

557
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:05,849
I didn't know he could do this.

558
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,642
He's never done it before.

559
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,519
It must be important. Answer it.

560
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:10,728
-Go on.
-Okay.

561
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:12,355
The reception is poor.

562
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:16,943
Hey. It's Ung.

563
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:20,864
Hi, Ung. How are you?

564
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,323
Did you arrive safely?

565
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:26,077
You should have called us to let us know.

566
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:29,163
Dad, who taught you
how to make a video call?

567
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,583
How is Ji-ung doing?

568
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,003
Sure. Your other son is doing fine.

569
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,839
Ji-ung, hi.

570
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,883
Are you having dinner?

571
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,676
Is Yeon-su there too?

572
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,762
-Well…
-Yes, I'm here too.

573
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:46,514
Did you have dinner?

574
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:48,183
Of course, we did.

575
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:51,185
How is it there? Is it nice?

576
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:54,397
I love it here. The scenery is beautiful
and the air is fresh.

577
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,150
You should take a break
and come here for vacation too.

578
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:59,986
Of course. We'll ask Ung
to take care of the restaurant

579
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,906
and we'll go on a trip.

580
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:06,701
Right, Ung. Your friend is here.

581
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:08,745
My friend?

582
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,331
But all my friends are here.

583
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:12,373
I'm disappointed.

584
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:15,210
What? NJ! Why are you there?

585
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,086
What? NJ?

586
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:20,423
Are you holding a memorial service?
Pull it out.

587
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:24,135
You haven't run away from me, have you?

588
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:25,970
Gosh. Goodness.

589
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:28,389
Hey, I'll be back.

590
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:30,600
-Me too. Let's go.
-Sit down.

591
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:15,144
I…

592
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,705
Why did I avoid him like a fool?

593
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,744
Hi, Grandma.

594
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:14,662
Were you sleeping?

595
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,832
I must have woken you up.

596
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,711
But you sound half asleep.

597
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,138
What is it?

598
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:35,433
Nothing. Just go to bed early
since we have to shoot tomorrow.

599
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:39,020
You're being cruel by telling me
to sleep when it's not even 10 p.m.

600
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:42,065
-What about your pills?
-I had no time to pack them.

601
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:45,318
Do you want some hot milk?

602
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:48,029
That's fine. Where are you sleeping?

603
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,615
We got our own place.
We'll come back here tomorrow morning.

604
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:52,325
Okay.

605
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:03,002
What is it?

606
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:05,755
Just say it already,
unless you want to be here all night.

607
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:08,966
We decided to change the angle

608
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:12,553
and focus more on you
and Yeon-su's emotions

609
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:13,888
And?

610
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,932
It confuses me the more I film you two.

611
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:18,267
Your feelings towards Yeon-su.

612
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:22,855
Whether it's because of
your past relationship, or…

613
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:25,358
Or?

614
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:32,782
Ms. Jung told me today

615
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:36,702
that people behind the camera
shouldn't get involved.

616
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:41,290
What are you curious about?

617
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,877
That only applies…

618
00:41:47,547 --> 00:41:49,006
when I'm filming.

619
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:57,557
I have many questions,
but I'll ask next time. Good night.

620
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:33,551
It really feels like you're back, Yeon-su.

621
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,429
I'm really sick of this.

622
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,435
Isn't it the same for you?

623
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:43,895
You must be sick of this too.

624
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:49,233
We fight, avoid each other, and run away.

625
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:50,526
That's what we do.

626
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:52,862
And now, here we are.

627
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:55,781
What can we do though?

628
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:09,253
I'm disappointed.

629
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:13,758
Hey, I'll be back.

630
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:21,182
It's none of my business now.

631
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:23,476
Let's forget about it.

632
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,233
Any memorable trips?

633
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:35,738
I'm not sure.
I don't really enjoy going on trips.

634
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:37,573
There's nothing memorable.

635
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:54,465
That hurt.

636
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:13,025
It confuses me the more I film you two.

637
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:15,486
Your feelings towards Yeon-su.

638
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:19,115
Whether it's because of

639
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:20,616
or…

640
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:29,208
Is it the past

641
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:32,003
That's exactly what it is.

642
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,048
But here's the problem.

643
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:38,342
Despite being in the past…

644
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:41,387
It was hectic, wasn't it?

645
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:44,432
This was my first trip,
so I'm still new to it.

646
00:44:45,725 --> 00:44:48,853
Next time, let's stay longer
and go farther away.

647
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:50,730
If we fight

648
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:52,398
or break up again,

649
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:56,819
just come to me like you did today.

650
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:04,368
I think I love you.

651
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,582
…it's all too vivid.

652
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:44,617
Did someone tranquilize me last night?

653
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:48,829
My gosh. I haven't slept this well
in a very long time.

654
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:50,998
Sol-i, how could you
fall asleep after dinner

655
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:53,542
when you said we'd party all night long?

656
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:55,753
By the way, what's wrong with your face?

657
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:58,381
Were there a lot of bugs last night?

658
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:00,299
This is how I look in the morning.

659
00:46:00,383 --> 00:46:02,635
Did you sleep well? Where are the others?

660
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:05,513
Right. If your schedule
isn't too hectic today,

661
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,181
can you let Yeon-su sleep in?

662
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:09,767
She probably hasn't slept in
like that in ages.

663
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,310
Ung too.

664
00:46:11,394 --> 00:46:13,604
He must have gone to bed late
after drawing all night.

665
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:16,232
Why would he work during the trip?
It's heartbreaking.

666
00:46:17,233 --> 00:46:20,027
Sure. Let's take it easy.
They're on vacation after all.

667
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:21,904
Let's check out the site.

668
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:24,573
But don't you worry about your footage.

669
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:26,325
You have us.

670
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:28,411
Right. We'll let you film us instead.

671
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:31,038
-Let's wrap it up.
-Okay.

672
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:39,171
Sol-i.

673
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:57,815
What? Where is everyone?

674
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:16,208
Are you in there?

675
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:13,682
Did he have trouble sleeping again?

676
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:55,367
Was he awake?

677
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,120
Yeon-su.

678
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:01,123
Yeon-su?

679
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:04,835
-Yes?
-What distracted you so much?

680
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:08,255
I'm sorry. What did you just say?

681
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:10,507
Let's finish the interview
on our way down.

682
00:50:10,591 --> 00:50:14,053
A villager told us about this place
that's beautiful during sundown.

683
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:15,763
Okay. Sure.

684
00:50:20,768 --> 00:50:22,811
-Let me change the battery.
-Sure.

685
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:27,441
What? Why aren't you with Chae-ran?

686
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:29,735
She told me to stay with you instead.

687
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:31,570
Who do you think you should listen to?

688
00:50:31,654 --> 00:50:33,947
But it seems I came at the right time.

689
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:36,200
Gosh, she always
makes me do things instead.

690
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:39,078
Goodness. You're that man from yesterday.

691
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:40,913
Hello. We meet again.

692
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:42,706
You must have come in a group.

693
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:44,333
You're all handsome.

694
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,086
-Where are you going?
-Home, of course.

695
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:50,297
Right. Did you visit that place
with your girlfriend yesterday?

696
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:52,508
She's probably
on her way there as we speak.

697
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:56,095
Geez, not today. It's going to rain soon.

698
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:58,013
I doubt it will.

699
00:50:58,097 --> 00:51:01,308
Goodness. Can you not tell?

700
00:51:01,392 --> 00:51:04,269
You should hurry back
before you get soaked.

701
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:08,232
You should have gone there yesterday.
It's a marvelous place. Goodness.

702
00:51:10,526 --> 00:51:12,778
Let's do our final interview here.

703
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:14,905
Tell me your thoughts on this trip.

704
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:16,031
Okay.

705
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:20,369
Wait. I'm low on battery.

706
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:22,788
I think it'll turn off midway.

707
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:24,832
I should have packed extra.

708
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:27,209
I think this has happened before.

709
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:29,461
Is it a déjà vu?

710
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:33,465
Should we just go back
to the village and finish up there?

711
00:51:33,549 --> 00:51:37,803
Well, let's just do it here.
You said the view was beautiful.

712
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:41,140
Then let me go get
some extra batteries and lighting.

713
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:42,599
Please wait here.

714
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:06,874
Lately, it feels like I've been spending

715
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,180
Sol-i.

716
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:22,347
Yes?

717
00:52:23,015 --> 00:52:24,725
I have a question.

718
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,811
Okay. I'm listening.

719
00:52:29,313 --> 00:52:30,606
What are we…

720
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:33,484
having for dinner?

721
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:38,447
I see. You're always curious
about the most useless things.

722
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:40,199
It's actually quite important.

723
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:43,786
-Light a fire if you're that hungry.
-It's cold.

724
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:45,454
You spat at me.

725
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:46,914
You're disgusting. Go away.

726
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:51,960
Geez. You have a knack
for saying the rudest things.

727
00:52:52,044 --> 00:52:55,506
-Hey. My spit would land on me, not you.
-Gosh.

728
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:56,673
Gosh, that's cold.

729
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:58,217
-What?
-What?

730
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,593
It landed on me too.

731
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:00,969
-What is this?
-What?

732
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:02,137
Is it raining?

733
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:05,808
-What? Just out of the blue like this?
-Gosh.

734
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:07,518
-Darn it.
-Come on.

735
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:09,102
I spent an hour doing my hair!

736
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:11,271
I told you we should have stayed inside!

737
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:29,373
What's going on?

738
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:32,584
Is it raining?

739
00:53:32,668 --> 00:53:34,628
They didn't say it'd rain.

740
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:51,687
This is definitely a déjà vu.

741
00:54:03,115 --> 00:54:05,075
How refreshing.

742
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:16,461
I wish the rain would clear my head
of all this needless worrying.

743
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:18,690
It really is him.

744
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:28,075
What are you doing there?

745
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:31,036
Thinking.

746
00:55:31,954 --> 00:55:32,996
About what?

747
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:39,836
About why I've come to you once again.

748
00:55:43,799 --> 00:55:45,884
How can I explain this?

749
00:55:47,386 --> 00:55:48,762
I must be cursed.

750
00:55:52,975 --> 00:55:55,394
You shouldn't have said that then.

751
00:55:57,062 --> 00:55:59,773
Is it me again? It's my fault?

752
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:02,401
Yes. It's you again.

753
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:05,278
I'm sick of it, but it's you again.

754
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:13,495
Then just go. Don't just stand there.

755
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:18,208
Am I really cursed?

756
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:25,507
Then I'll go.

757
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:48,488
Or has this ridiculous trip bewitched me?

758
00:56:58,582 --> 00:57:00,375
Should I leave or stay?

759
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:08,300
Should I leave or stay?

760
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:10,844
Or maybe…

761
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:18,435
I knew all along…

762
00:58:08,944 --> 00:58:12,322
that this would happen

763
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:28,922
We're not going to break up.

764
00:58:30,715 --> 00:58:34,177
If we fight or break up again,

765
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:37,889
just come to me like you did today.

766
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:42,018
-And then?
-And then…

767
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:47,399
I'll grab onto you and never let go.

768
00:58:54,447 --> 00:59:01,121
JANGAN, HOGOK-RI, IHWA-RI, GOON-RI

769
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:08,211
BEFORE SUNSET

770
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:32,068
I must be losing my mind.

771
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:35,614
But he hasn't called me since then.

772
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:36,698
Ms. Kook.

773
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:39,117
What's going on between you and Ms. Kook?

774
00:59:39,201 --> 00:59:42,204
Are you worried that Ung might say

775
00:59:43,205 --> 00:59:44,414
that it was all a mistake?

776
00:59:44,498 --> 00:59:46,833
Do you like Ms. Kook, Ji-ung?

777
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:50,921
I have no idea what you're thinking

778
00:59:51,505 --> 00:59:52,464
Can I stay over?

779
00:59:53,173 --> 00:59:55,342
I have something I want to hear from you.

780
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:57,636
So I want to hear you say it now.

781
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:03,850
