1
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:44,503
When I was in school,

2
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:47,381
the owner of the stationery store nearby

3
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:51,259
I think the name was Jjongjjong.

4
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,261
Let's see.

5
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:58,475
-How much is this?
-It's 500 won.

6
00:00:58,558 --> 00:00:59,977
-This one too?
-Yes.

7
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,814
-There's one you can fly instead of that.
-Really?

8
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,941
Jjongjjong seemed kind of cold.

9
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:11,446
Where are you going?

10
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:13,907
I'm walking Jjongjjong.

11
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,368
You're the only one walking though.

12
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,621
Jjongjjong likes being in my arms.

13
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:21,748
See you.

14
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:27,838
Jjongjjong was like royalty.

15
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,548
WITH UNG

16
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,258
-Hi, Ung.
-Hello.

17
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:33,385
What?

18
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:36,596
Did you have a baby?

19
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,018
It seemed like an amazing life though.

20
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,896
I've never seen him walk.

21
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,565
He runs around at home though.

22
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,276
My dream is to live like Jjongjjong.

23
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,655
To tell you the truth,

24
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,658
Jjongjjong was abandoned as a puppy.

25
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:58,910
-So he's afraid of the outdoors.
-What?

26
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:01,121
Maybe he was abandoned outside.

27
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,789
He always acts like this outside.

28
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,793
To be abandoned while on a walk…

29
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,129
He must have been scared.

30
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:18,096
So the reason why

31
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,598
I'm not going.

32
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,475
I really don't get it.

33
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,769
I'm really grateful for this opportunity,

34
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:27,022
-but it's too far and it's for too long.
-Ridiculous.

35
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,066
Your skills had improved greatly

36
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,735
when you were gone there for six months.

37
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,445
That's because it was six months.

38
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:36,573
Living there for a few years is different.

39
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,700
And I don't want to go there
all by myself.

40
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,744
My goodness.

41
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,955
I'll cancel my recommendation then.

42
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:52,839
If that's why you don't want to go,

43
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:56,218
then you can go with a friend.

44
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,436
ENGLAND STUDY ABROAD PROGRAM

45
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,563
What else is needed?
My GPA is pretty high.

46
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:09,898
English scores? TOEFL?

47
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,067
I can get that. I'm good at studying.

48
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,653
Is there financial support?
Can I get a scholarship?

49
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,112
What about living expenses?

50
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:22,661
If I mention this to Yeon-su,
I'm sure she'll just tell me to go alone.

51
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,246
But how can I be alone for years?

52
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,248
So do you want to take Yeon-su?

53
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,415
Just take me with you.

54
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:30,961
There are a lot of schools
that Yeon-su could easily get into.

55
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,880
She has a high GPA and everything.

56
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:39,594
So I feel like it'd be nice for us
to go abroad and study together.

57
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,931
But I have to be your manager.

58
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:46,184
But I can't stop you
because it's such a good opportunity.

59
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,020
So will you be living with Yeon-su there?

60
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:52,983
What? Of course we'll be in a dorm…

61
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:59,281
-Wait, would that be okay?
-Isn't it obvious that you should?

62
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,074
You'll be in another country.

63
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:04,160
You need to rely on each other there.

64
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,497
You seem so excited.

65
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,000
Wasn't that
what you were thinking in the first place?

66
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:14,296
No. This is a decision I've made
solely for our future.

67
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,507
And I have to ask Yeon-su first.

68
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,104
Why would we break up?

69
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:37,527
Why are you doing this?

70
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,158
What reason do you have?

71
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,539
Why do we have to break up?

72
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,947
I'm sorry. What was I talking about?

73
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,741
Oh, right. Jjongjjong.

74
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:40,966
I often think about him these days.

75
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:44,552
The way he decided to cope with his pain.

76
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:47,639
See? We can be friends.

77
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,434
I know it seems pathetic…

78
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:10,203
but I'm acting

79
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:26,886
I don't think I can ever face

80
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:35,895
So I've chosen to do the same.

81
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,357
Because nothing will happen

82
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,860
if I don't do anything.

83
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:50,285
EPISODE 11: OUR NIGHTS
ARE MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN YOUR DAYS

84
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,079
Did you get home safe?

85
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,463
Of course.

86
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,214
Thanks for being with me today.

87
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,092
And for putting up with my boring stories.

88
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,562
Call me anytime you need me.

89
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,791
Did you stop by my place today?

90
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,471
WE SPOTTED THE ARTIST GO-OH
SECRETLY MEETING NJ

91
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,317
Why aren't we refuting the article?

92
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,112
We don't have to respond to them all.

93
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,240
But we always have.

94
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,159
That's because you always dated lousy men.

95
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:14,285
It doesn't make sense.

96
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:18,915
You would rush to refute rumors
when I was actually dating those guys.

97
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,000
So why aren't you refuting this article
when we're not even dating?

98
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,711
Compared to your prior scandals,

99
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:26,422
the public's response
to this one isn't so bad.

100
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,675
And he has a pretty good reputation too.

101
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,511
CEO KANG YEON-JU

102
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:35,140
And you said you needed
a place to breathe.

103
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:40,436
If that's what he is to you
then I can turn a blind eye.

104
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,355
Blow off some steam by dating him

105
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,357
and make sure
it won't interfere with work.

106
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,993
Are you hoping this will pass over
like it did all the other times?

107
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,580
Stop treating me like a little kid.

108
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,249
You're too young to know--

109
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,751
And I'm not seeing him to blow off steam.

110
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:07,422
Can't you tell from the photo?
I'm the one who has a crush on him.

111
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,674
All he does is give me more stress.

112
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:12,844
So stop making stupid plans
and just leave him alone.

113
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,430
Don't treat this like some candy
you're throwing at me.

114
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,723
YEON ENTERTAINMENT

115
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,392
He has nothing to do with my actions.

116
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:28,735
"Regardless, NJ would visit his home
whenever she had any free time."

117
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:33,031
"The two would enjoy a meal
at their favorite restaurant

118
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,616
and go to her house."

119
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:37,493
Her house?

120
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:41,623
Isn't this funny?
They're saying you went to her house.

121
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,627
There's no way that you'd go to her house.

122
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,464
But look at this.

123
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,133
It's you in front of her house.

124
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:53,801
This is crazy, isn't it?

125
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:55,136
Do you see this?

126
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:59,390
And look. You're in this paparazzi shot.

127
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:00,808
This is so interesting.

128
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:01,893
Stop it.

129
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:04,479
And…

130
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,898
look at this.

131
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:10,485
This is the first time
I've silenced my phone as your manager.

132
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,780
I need to know something
if I have to answer all these journalists.

133
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,824
But you wouldn't answer any of my calls.
So what could I do?

134
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:17,867
Where's my phone?

135
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:19,827
First…

136
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,623
-tell me.
-What?

137
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,875
-Tell me it's not true.
-It isn't.

138
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:27,919
Really?

139
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,255
All right, then.

140
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,589
It's fine if it isn't true.

141
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:34,133
I know it's not true. Right?

142
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:35,802
This doesn't make sense.

143
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,095
It's impossible.

144
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,930
How can people believe this?

145
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:41,849
It's ridiculous.

146
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:43,977
Just tell them

147
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,230
that we're not dating

148
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,066
and that I'm just a fan.

149
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:56,281
Jeez. This must be so hard for NJ.

150
00:10:56,364 --> 00:11:00,118
She helped us so much,
but we've ruined her reputation.

151
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,414
Hey, where's my phone?

152
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,625
You're asking me? I just came here.

153
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:10,086
I'm sure it's somewhere in your studio.

154
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:18,970
What?

155
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,017
MISSED CALL, GU EUN-HO

156
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:26,686
GU EUN-HO, FATHER, NJ

157
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:43,286
Mr. Choi. Did you lose your phone
and just find it?

158
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,996
How did you know?

159
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,498
I think I know you a bit now.

160
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,545
I just saw the article about us.
I'm sorry.

161
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,465
I never thought about this kind of thing.

162
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,842
I think I caused a lot of trouble for you.

163
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,928
You could be the one in trouble though.

164
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,725
My agency might not refute the article.

165
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:09,270
I guess they think

166
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,273
They're trying to use your good image.

167
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,400
So tell everyone it's not true.

168
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,361
Tell them I'm just chasing you around.

169
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:18,863
You need to teach my agency a lesson.

170
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:23,242
I'm not sure I understand
what you're saying,

171
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,411
but wouldn't that be bad for you?

172
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:30,124
We should be celebrating
on a day like this.

173
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,834
It's your first dating scandal.

174
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:37,215
Too bad my schedule is too packed.

175
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,634
I'll call you again next time.

176
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:40,718
Okay.

177
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,436
Yes, he's NJ's fan.

178
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,857
What? A stalker? What are you saying?

179
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:59,862
Why would he follow her to her house?
No, that's not…

180
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,324
How dare you say that about him!

181
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,660
What are you doing?

182
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,787
Just leave it. Don't do anything.

183
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:09,664
Why?

184
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,417
Just wait until they release an article.

185
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,501
Don't do anything yet.

186
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,629
Why do you keep changing your mind?

187
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,967
Hey, wait.

188
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,220
You didn't just
talk to NJ about this, did you?

189
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:29,100
I can't believe it.
How close are you to NJ?

190
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:35,148
I never knew I'd actually ask this.

191
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:38,443
What's going on between you two?

192
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:41,028
Shut up. Just tell me what my schedule is.

193
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,324
You're acting strange these days.
You're not the Ung I knew.

194
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,410
You're not Ung, are you? Where did he go?

195
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,787
Quit the nonsense, will you?

196
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,290
You're busy this week.

197
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,417
You have those interviews you postponed

198
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,169
and you have documentary shoots.

199
00:13:56,252 --> 00:14:00,298
This Friday's going to be the last shoot.
Yeon-su will be there too.

200
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,303
So it's finally coming to an end.

201
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:11,494
I guess Ung delivered it to you.

202
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,913
That's good.

203
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,123
Tell me if you want anything else.

204
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:20,336
I made your favorite dishes,
but maybe it wasn't enough.

205
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,130
Really?

206
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,759
All right, you should get to work.

207
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,970
Okay. Bye.

208
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,639
Gosh, that brat.

209
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:35,142
I don't know why he has a phone
if he's not even going to pick up.

210
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:36,811
Did you call Ung again?

211
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,814
Just leave him alone. He must be sleeping.

212
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:42,233
He says he can't sleep well.

213
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,986
His meds must be working. That's good.

214
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:49,031
Darn it. He should give us a call though.

215
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,992
I'm so curious.

216
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,327
By the way,

217
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:57,456
do you think there's really something
going on between him and that famous girl?

218
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,626
I'm sure he'll take care of it himself.

219
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,838
He said they're just friends,
so they must be. Plus…

220
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:09,010
Ung has Yeon-su, you know.

221
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,803
-Yeon-su?
-Yes.

222
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:14,599
Is there something going on
between them again?

223
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,601
Weren't they just going to be friends?

224
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:19,979
I don't know. It's just what I think.

225
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,273
Yeon-su…

226
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:27,028
Right. Yeon-su's the perfect girl for Ung.

227
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,946
-Right.
-Of course.

228
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,573
Of course.

229
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,827
It's fall already.

230
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:36,120
You're right.

231
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:39,040
NOW SERVING GIZZARDS, GRILLED OR SEASONED

232
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,795
It's this week, right?

233
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:54,931
I'll tell Ung
that we're going to visit the countryside.

234
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,641
Okay.

235
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,658
INCOMING CALL
SOL-I

236
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,371
-Hey.
-Where are you?

237
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:21,957
I'm going back to the office
after a meeting. Why?

238
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,627
Nothing much.

239
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,046
I'm hanging up if it's nothing.
I'm driving.

240
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:29,590
Are they really dating?

241
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:31,133
-Ung and NJ.
-Bye.

242
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,010
Hey! You brat.

243
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,472
-You didn't even ask him, did you?
-Why would I ask him?

244
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,601
I'm sure you're letting your imagination
run wild right now.

245
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,561
Me? No, of course not.

246
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:46,023
I'm too busy with work
to think about such useless stuff.

247
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:48,609
-You said you're driving.
-Bye.

248
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,348
She's not Ung's type.

249
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:21,892
She's pretty, but…

250
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,187
Right, she is pretty.

251
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,481
But her smile's a bit…

252
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,194
And she's way too young.

253
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,332
Ji-ung, what happened yesterday?

254
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:48,294
Oh, sorry. Something came up.
Did you wait for me?

255
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,629
Well, I had work anyway.

256
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:52,798
But Mr. Choi waited for you.

257
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:56,343
Ung was here?

258
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:58,387
Yes, I told him you were coming soon

259
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,931
so he waited
in the editing room for quite a while.

260
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,933
He had some food for you.

261
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,900
It was your birthday yesterday, right?
Happy birthday.

262
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,569
I stopped Mr. Park
from throwing a surprise party.

263
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,363
Good job. You're so sharp.

264
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:19,617
-Are you going out to shoot?
-Mr. Choi has an interview

265
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,285
so I'm going to shoot that.

266
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:22,328
Ji-ung.

267
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:27,333
If you have time after work tonight,

268
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,834
let me take you out to dinner.

269
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:30,878
It was your birthday yesterday.

270
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:33,047
It's fine. Birthdays aren't a big deal.

271
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,924
-I'll just--
-I want to treat you.

272
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:40,763
Or at least a cup of coffee.

273
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:49,396
All right. I'll make you not want to
buy me anything next year.

274
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:51,565
-Good luck with your shoot.
-Okay.

275
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:00,950
What?

276
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:02,910
How long were you standing there?

277
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,831
You told me to wait here.

278
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,794
Oh, right. Did you get everything?

279
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:12,962
Let's go.

280
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,630
It's this way.

281
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:15,881
I know.

282
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,082
Mr. Choi.

283
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,877
Mr. Choi?

284
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:55,254
Oh, yes.

285
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:58,465
Are you alright?
Was that a difficult question to answer?

286
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,217
No, it's nothing.

287
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,470
I'm sorry, but could you ask that again?

288
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:06,891
You said you don't draw people
in your works.

289
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:10,603
It feels like you've purposely
left people out of them.

290
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:15,065
Like you've intentionally
left those spaces empty.

291
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:19,195
We can feel loneliness and emptiness
in your drawings.

292
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,864
I think that comes
from the exclusion of people.

293
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,074
Is that intentional,

294
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:26,827
or is this something
that you did subconsciously?

295
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:36,587
It depends on the viewer
and their interpretation.

296
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,256
I haven't thought of it that deeply.

297
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:44,428
But sometimes, the artist's attitude
helps us understand their pieces.

298
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:46,722
Well…

299
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,600
I don't have the stories
you're looking for.

300
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,727
Ma'am.

301
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:56,482
Why don't you ask
about his exhibitions instead?

302
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:05,074
It always feels like
I can't do an in-depth interview with you.

303
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:09,536
Ma'am…

304
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,299
You did look quite different
doing that interview.

305
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:27,846
You should show this side of me more
in the documentary.

306
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:31,141
By the way, I saw the article.

307
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:35,354
Would there be a problem
with the footage we filmed of NJ?

308
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,690
Well, it's fine with me,

309
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:40,025
but you'll have to check with NJ's agency.

310
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:45,072
But why aren't you asking
if the scandal is true or not?

311
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,866
Do you think it's obviously not true?

312
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:54,373
Is Ji-ung sending out clones
of him or what?

313
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,583
You're so similar. It makes me feel weird.

314
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,629
I'm sure you don't have room
to think about other people right now.

315
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:02,881
You have your hands full with Ms. Kook.

316
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:06,969
You shouldn't talk about
the casts' private lives like that.

317
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,430
That's why I turned off the camera.

318
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:11,890
Ji-ung would have said that on camera.

319
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:16,228
-Is it off? I should see for myself.
-Didn't you see them in the editing room?

320
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:21,942
I thought you saw Ji-ung's videos.

321
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:27,656
I couldn't figure out what was what.

322
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,368
We're done for today, right?

323
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,084
I'm lonely.

324
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,086
I'm so lonely.

325
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:45,841
The position of CEO makes you so lonely.

326
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:48,385
But as a leader,

327
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:52,514
I guess I should accept my fate
to take responsibility

328
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,975
and develop this company.

329
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:57,269
You saw it just now, right?

330
00:23:58,187 --> 00:24:00,022
Everyone was having coffee without me

331
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:02,524
and didn't let me join their conversation.

332
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:05,903
Right?

333
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,114
Ms. Kook, are you listening?

334
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,492
Hello?

335
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:15,162
Honestly, what did I do to them?

336
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:17,998
Tell me. Am I such a bad person?

337
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:21,877
Don't worry and be honest.
You can tell me anything.

338
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,713
-Yi-hoon.
-Yes?

339
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:27,174
You're just a little more clueless
than others.

340
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:29,718
You're not a bad person.
You were like that in college too.

341
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:31,762
Don't take it too personally.

342
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,683
Me?

343
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,645
I'm pretty quick-witted.

344
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:43,524
I knew what the others
were talking about just a while ago.

345
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:47,236
And I could've joined in on
the conversation smoothly too.

346
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:51,240
They were talking
about Go-oh and NJ all day.

347
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:56,078
What's the probability of your ex

348
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:59,665
They all want to know
if they're really dating or not.

349
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,250
But they don't know anything.

350
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,418
Should I tell you?

351
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:05,671
Of course they're dating.

352
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:08,799
Whatever the chances are,

353
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:11,385
-it feels very, very…
-When Go-oh saw NJ that day,

354
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:13,095
he seemed dumbfounded.

355
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,055
-…crappy.
-See?

356
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:17,224
I'm pretty sharp, aren't I?

357
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,394
You're right.

358
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,855
So why don't you take a hint
and leave me alone?

359
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,565
I'm working right now.

360
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:26,942
Right. I'm leaving.

361
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:28,694
Take it easy.

362
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,447
I'm not that clueless.

363
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:36,785
I have to hear about it

364
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:39,371
Throughout the entire day…

365
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,170
it follows me everywhere.

366
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,633
NJ really must be dating him this time.

367
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,802
Right? Did you see the photo?

368
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:55,637
-He's cute.
-Right.

369
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,556
He's cute in his old photos too.

370
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,766
That's why NJ fell for him.

371
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:03,478
I don't want to hear or know about it.

372
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:13,947
Right. Let's not pay it any attention.

373
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:25,792
Excuse me, how much are these jujubes?

374
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:27,836
It's 5,000 won per basket.

375
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,046
I'll take one.

376
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:30,339
All right.

377
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:34,134
Don't you have any change?

378
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:37,012
I'll take them all, then.

379
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:40,057
Really? Thank you.

380
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:45,729
But what would a young lady
be doing with so many jujubes?

381
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:47,606
Jujube tea is good for insomnia.

382
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:49,358
What?

383
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:51,693
So they say.

384
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,988
Is that so? Here you go.

385
00:26:55,656 --> 00:26:58,992
-Oh, no. Let me put it in another bag.
-Okay.

386
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:00,077
Here.

387
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,580
-Have a good day.
-Bye.

388
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:17,344
Why did I buy these?

389
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,268
We can go somewhere more expensive though.

390
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,687
I was going to buy you something
really delicious.

391
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:29,815
I eat a lot. You'll be surprised.

392
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,068
Mr. Kim!

393
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,987
Wait, Chae-ran's here too!

394
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:38,740
Did you come here to eat?
What a coincidence!

395
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:40,784
This is great!

396
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,912
We're all gathered here together.

397
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:48,959
Come sit with us.

398
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:02,097
Why did I come here?

399
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:22,743
Yes, I'll send… Oh, Yeon-su.

400
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:25,954
I'm sorry.
I'll call you back after I check.

401
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,875
-Are you here to see Ung?
-Yes, I needed to talk to him.

402
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,335
Is he inside?

403
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:32,544
He's not home.

404
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:34,921
He's at the restaurant. Should I call him?

405
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:37,758
No, it's fine. It's nothing urgent.
I can talk to him later.

406
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,092
You came all the way here.

407
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:41,178
-Go and wait inside.
-No, it's okay.

408
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:44,264
You brought a lot of stuff too.
Come on. He'll be back soon.

409
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:45,849
Here.

410
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:48,393
Tell Ung that I left.

411
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:33,313
We should have had
a company gathering earlier.

412
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:36,316
And it was Mr. Kim's birthday yesterday.

413
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,694
Isn't it nice to drink together like this?

414
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,405
Your work's all going well, right?

415
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,949
Mr. Kim, was it your birthday?

416
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,827
I didn't know. Let me pour you a glass.

417
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,371
I already drank enough.

418
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,039
I can't drink as much as you.

419
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,416
My goodness.

420
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:55,210
You've worked here for so long,
but you can't drink?

421
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,379
It's not like we drink while we work.

422
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,172
Oh, jeez.

423
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:02,342
I really can't get along
with people who don't drink.

424
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:03,552
They're so boring.

425
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:05,595
Work is what's most important.

426
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,681
What you're shooting now is boring.

427
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:15,188
He used to be okay
when he used to listen to my advice.

428
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:19,693
But now he just does anything he wants.

429
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:22,028
I don't think I ever did as you wanted.

430
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:26,616
So tell me, do you really like
what you've shot this time?

431
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,369
You don't, right?

432
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:32,789
There's no way you've lost your touch.

433
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:33,957
Right?

434
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,626
No way.

435
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,587
We were all having a good time.

436
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:40,755
Why are you making him uncomfortable?

437
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,217
Hey, Intern. Let's go.

438
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:45,886
Oh, right. You quit.

439
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,929
Finish your talk before the food arrives.

440
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:50,849
And stop fighting in front of them.

441
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:53,685
We're not fighting.
You know how much I like Mr. Kim.

442
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,937
He doesn't like you though.

443
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,398
Why are you always so harsh?

444
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:01,735
I really can't understand her.

445
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:05,947
Did he have to
overreact like that and embarrass me?

446
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:11,661
Did I upset you?

447
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:14,456
Sorry.

448
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:19,711
Sometimes when I'm telling the truth,
my mouth moves faster than my head thinks.

449
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,089
You're still saying that
you were telling the truth.

450
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,761
You know it too though.

451
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,057
What is it?

452
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:34,267
What's the problem?

453
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:38,438
I saw your draft, but I still don't get
what you're trying to say.

454
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:44,319
You like Kook Yeon-su, don't you?

455
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:54,287
What? No way.

456
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:58,416
You really do. Was it because of that?

457
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,544
This is finally getting interesting.

458
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:04,673
Did you have to say that in front of her?

459
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,051
-You knew too, right?
-Forget it.

460
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:11,388
You just had to find out and embarrass me.

461
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,976
That's the thing about cameras.

462
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:20,522
They pretend to be objective observers,
but they're actually the most personal.

463
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,440
The reason why I like you

464
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:25,110
is because you pretend to be objective.

465
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:28,196
But your works always
portray emotions very well.

466
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:30,615
-You said it's boring.
-So I'm saying

467
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:35,453
you should go and watch your footage
and edit it all again.

468
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:40,959
I get that this is because
you're confused about your emotions,

469
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,044
but come on.

470
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,381
Why don't you follow
the gazes of the cast?

471
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,750
MUSEUM OF AVANT-GARDE
PARIS, FRANCE

472
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:26,546
CONCERNING VARIABILITY AND INVARIABILITY

473
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,943
Hello. Nice to see you again.

474
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,695
Oh. Right.

475
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:58,954
Darn it.

476
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,164
What?

477
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:52,298
Congratulations on your scandal

478
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:54,217
Don't drink the wine. Keep it for later.

479
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,844
Half of it is mine.

480
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:58,430
P.S. Don't stay out so late.

481
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,611
I've always wanted to ask you this.

482
00:35:57,739 --> 00:36:01,242
Am I getting between the two of you?

483
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:03,828
-I don't want that.
-No.

484
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,791
Nothing's going on between us right now.

485
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,710
I see. "Right now"?

486
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:16,341
The two of you…

487
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:22,013
Never mind.

488
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:26,101
As you've read in the articles,

489
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,894
we're seeing each other.

490
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:36,194
That's what I was thinking of saying,

491
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,112
but that's just too cringy.

492
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:41,908
There's no point
in the two of us talking about this.

493
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:44,702
Mr. Choi would be so proud
if he sees this.

494
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:46,830
He'll brag about it
for the rest of his life.

495
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:50,250
I don't want to see him do that,

496
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,918
so let's not fight.

497
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:56,089
If I'm not getting in the way,
then it's fine.

498
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,674
I'll figure it out.

499
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:12,647
But…

500
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:15,567
you won't stop

501
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:17,610
if I ask you to.

502
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:26,619
I know.

503
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,310
What am I even doing?

504
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,261
Did you drink again?

505
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:33,645
I guess you enjoy drinking these days.
It's not like you.

506
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:42,153
You should've gone home if you're drunk.
Why did you come here?

507
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,658
Thanks for the food last time.

508
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:50,620
Thank my mom, not me. Why are you here?

509
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:51,913
Did you come to say that?

510
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:54,207
I heard you came by the office.

511
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,584
Yes, well…

512
00:38:56,668 --> 00:39:00,088
You always say you're busy
but you weren't at your desk.

513
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,011
Just go to sleep.

514
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,430
I'm going to work a bit more.

515
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:12,016
Someone told me

516
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:16,980
that everything I shoot
is full of emotions.

517
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:22,235
And that it shows

518
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,487
even when I try to hide it.

519
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,282
Do you think so too?

520
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:32,412
I don't get what you're saying.

521
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:41,170
You saw everything.

522
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:46,342
Didn't you?

523
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,184
Well…

524
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:00,732
I'm not sure.

525
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,108
Wait.

526
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:05,445
You're telling me not to mention it.

527
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,071
Right?

528
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:10,700
You're drunk. Just go to sleep.

529
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,705
You're telling me to shut up

530
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:18,249
because you don't want to know.

531
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:20,168
Right?

532
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,767
I knew this would happen,

533
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:40,313
but I do feel pretty upset.

534
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:04,921
Today won't be any special
even if it's our last shoot.

535
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,100
Isn't it today?

536
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:21,813
SEAFOOD SOUP WITH UNG

537
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,773
Did you stay up or did you just wake up?

538
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:27,944
Anyway, today's the last day of the shoot,

539
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:29,695
I'll head over soon, okay?

540
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:30,780
Okay.

541
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,245
CLOSED TODAY

542
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:43,709
Why isn't he picking up?

543
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:51,134
Ji-ung, isn't Mr. Choi
doing whatever he wants

544
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:53,594
because you're his friend?

545
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:56,389
He went AWOL on the last day of the shoot.

546
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:59,767
Why did he even agree to this
if he was going to take this so lightly?

547
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:01,978
I'm so sorry.

548
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:04,105
I even talked to him this morning.

549
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:06,107
This isn't the first time.

550
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,900
You should've checked properly.

551
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:10,611
It seems like
he's not taking us seriously.

552
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:12,697
I'm really sorry.

553
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:16,242
I'll go wherever he could've gone
and bring him back.

554
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:17,827
Forget it.

555
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:22,039
Ji-ung. This is why
he's acting so selfishly.

556
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,961
Let me apologize in his place.

557
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,713
-Let's just call it a day here.
-Ms. Kook.

558
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,341
Do you really not know?
Did something happen again?

559
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:35,595
-Chae-ran!
-I'm sorry about last time.

560
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:39,932
But nothing happened between us
this time. I haven't seen him in a while.

561
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:46,981
Isn't it today?

562
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:53,196
I'll bring him back.

563
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:55,031
Do you know something?

564
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:57,325
No, I'll look for him here and there.

565
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,786
I'll look for him too.

566
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:08,211
Ji-ung, you're going too easy on Mr. Choi.

567
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,172
Even if he's your friend,
this is going too far.

568
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:13,549
Well…

569
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:17,720
I kind of feel like
maybe I chased him away.

570
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:19,180
What?

571
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:39,033
Hey, Ung!

572
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:40,660
Hello.

573
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,328
It's been such a long time.

574
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:44,789
You haven't visited
ever since you graduated.

575
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:48,501
It's so nice to see you again.
You should come more often.

576
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:52,922
I don't see Jjongjjong.

577
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,799
Oh, Jjongjjong?

578
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,217
He went far away.

579
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:02,431
Oh, I see. I'm sorry, I was just…

580
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:05,142
Oh, there he is.

581
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:09,814
He must have had an amazing walk.

582
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:11,357
You should take a bath today.

583
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:16,946
-Thanks.
-I'll take care of Jjongjjong's walks.

584
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,032
He's so cute.

585
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:21,367
-Bye.
-Bye.

586
00:44:23,536 --> 00:44:27,290
Didn't Jjongjjong hate going outside?

587
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:30,042
That was a long time ago.

588
00:44:30,126 --> 00:44:32,295
He hates staying inside now.

589
00:44:33,546 --> 00:44:36,090
I see. Since when?

590
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:37,842
How did you do it?

591
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:40,511
I didn't do anything.

592
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:43,347
It was all him.

593
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:45,725
Right, Jjongjjong?

594
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,691
You traitor.

595
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:12,710
EDITING ROOM

596
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:24,513
I get that this is because

597
00:45:25,014 --> 00:45:26,223
but come on.

598
00:45:27,183 --> 00:45:29,393
Why don't you follow
the gazes of the cast?

599
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:56,629
Hey. I still haven't found him.
What about you?

600
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:58,631
I couldn't reach his parents either,

601
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:01,675
so I asked the hardware store owner.
They went to the countryside.

602
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:05,930
He's not at the bookstore or the library.

603
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:07,431
He's determined to stay hidden.

604
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:11,185
He won't be where he goes often.
He's probably at an unexpected place.

605
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,604
Anyway, call me if you find him.

606
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:21,362
Oh, my goodness!

607
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:25,491
You scumbag! Watch where you're going!

608
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:28,911
I almost had a heartattack.

609
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:35,126
Let me carry that for you.

610
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:37,586
No, it's fine.

611
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:41,048
It looks heavy.
I'll carry it to your home.

612
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:43,259
I told you, it's fine.

613
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:46,053
-Then until the bus station…
-I said, it's fine!

614
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:47,888
Why are you doing this?

615
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,184
Oh, no…

616
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,458
Leave it there.

617
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:21,714
You're drying a lot of jujubes.

618
00:47:25,718 --> 00:47:26,969
Who knows what they're for?

619
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:30,764
Yeon-su bought so much and put them there.

620
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:34,894
She keeps making jujube tea.
I don't know who it's for.

621
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:44,570
This is jujube tea. I know you have
a hard time falling asleep…

622
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:46,447
I mean, they told me to give it to you.

623
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:57,374
My goodness…

624
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:05,591
If Yeon-su did anything bad to you,

625
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:07,801
it's all my fault.

626
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,387
So don't hate her too much.

627
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:12,890
We were poor,

628
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:16,268
so I made her grow up to be selfish.

629
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:24,276
It's my fault that she talks so harshly.

630
00:48:25,194 --> 00:48:28,072
And has a nasty temper too.

631
00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:33,077
So if you're upset at her about something,

632
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:36,080
blame me for it

633
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:39,625
and don't hate her.

634
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:47,883
Yeon-su's not like that.

635
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:53,514
That's not who she is.

636
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:55,516
She's…

637
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:58,561
a good person.

638
00:49:01,564 --> 00:49:03,857
She's so brilliant
I feel like I don't deserve her.

639
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:08,821
If you know that,

640
00:49:09,697 --> 00:49:11,073
then what are you two doing?

641
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:15,119
You're right.

642
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:18,872
I knew I was pathetic,

643
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:23,627
but I guess I've hit rock bottom today.

644
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:42,313
Choi Ung.

645
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,526
Stop this and come out already.

646
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:00,623
Ji-ung, should I order dinner?

647
00:50:04,293 --> 00:50:05,252
Ji-ung…

648
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:22,978
EDITING ROOM

649
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:32,696
I think it's better to do something

650
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:35,741
than something you like.

651
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:39,244
That way, you'll be more efficient
and get what you want.

652
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:32,589
I had a hard time finding you this time.

653
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:41,682
How did you find me?

654
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:44,601
I just looked everywhere.

655
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:54,570
Yes, it was this time of the year

656
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,363
when you would disappear without a word.

657
00:51:57,156 --> 00:51:59,616
And your parents would disappear too.

658
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:04,204
I forgot about it,
and I just remembered today.

659
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:09,376
This is great. I wanted to do this.

660
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:14,923
Drinking with you face to face, I mean.

661
00:52:52,753 --> 00:52:54,338
You're not avoiding me now?

662
00:52:56,924 --> 00:52:58,592
You're not even telling me to leave.

663
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:02,888
I never avoided you.

664
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:06,266
Then did I just imagine things?

665
00:53:33,085 --> 00:53:34,211
You're quiet.

666
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:43,637
What should I say?

667
00:53:47,808 --> 00:53:50,978
Anything besides beating around the bush,

668
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:53,146
avoiding the topic

669
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:55,941
or something that'd hurt me.

670
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:08,287
You must have decided to keep quiet again.

671
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:12,958
I'll do the talking this time then.

672
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:34,771
Well…

673
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:39,651
I…

674
00:54:42,321 --> 00:54:45,699
About how you wanted us to be friends…

675
00:54:50,579 --> 00:54:52,581
I gave it some thought.

676
00:54:55,876 --> 00:54:57,169
I don't think I can do that.

677
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:02,090
So…

678
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:05,469
I don't mean
that I don't want to be friends.

679
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:09,681
I…

680
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:14,144
I just…

681
00:55:16,605 --> 00:55:17,856
I missed you.

682
00:55:18,899 --> 00:55:19,983
Yeon-su.

683
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:29,034
I've always missed you.

684
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,125
I…

685
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:39,836
missed you.

686
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:49,554
When I saw you again,

687
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:55,936
I kept feeling angry for some reason
even though you were back.

688
00:55:58,814 --> 00:56:00,399
And I resented you.

689
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:06,488
But I think I know why now.

690
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:11,159
I guess…

691
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:14,871
I wanted to see you love me.

692
00:56:21,003 --> 00:56:22,170
I wanted…

693
00:56:27,259 --> 00:56:29,636
to see you love only me.

694
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:46,737
Yeon-su.

695
00:56:51,033 --> 00:56:52,159
Yes?

696
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:56,246
Please keep loving me.

697
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:01,835
Don't let go…

698
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:04,838
and keep…

699
00:57:06,715 --> 00:57:07,799
loving me.

700
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:17,517
Please.

701
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:50,300
OUR NIGHTS ARE MORE BEAUTIFUL
THAN YOUR DAYS

702
00:58:08,777 --> 00:58:11,738
EPILOGUE

703
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:16,576
-Yeon-su.
-Yes?

704
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:20,747
Do you know how to see
the top of that building?

705
00:58:21,373 --> 00:58:23,792
You can go up to a different building.

706
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:25,252
No, you got it wrong.

707
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:31,883
Hey, are you that drunk?

708
00:58:35,095 --> 00:58:36,638
I heard this is how you do it.

709
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:39,516
What simpleton said that?

710
00:58:40,142 --> 00:58:41,226
My dad.

711
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,396
I knew it. He's so wise.

712
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:58,326
I can't see it though.

713
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:00,996
Right? That's what I told him.

714
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:03,165
When was that?

715
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:08,837
When I was about five? Six?

716
00:59:11,006 --> 00:59:13,049
He was just teasing you then.

717
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:21,850
Not my current dad.

718
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:26,188
What?

719
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:28,148
My real dad.

720
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:33,695
Of course he was teasing me.

721
00:59:34,196 --> 00:59:36,865
He told a little kid to lie down

722
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:40,035
and count to the top floor.

723
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:43,788
I didn't even know how to count then.

724
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:46,708
I kept repeating

725
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:49,794
one and two

726
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:52,631
then I eventually got back up.

727
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:57,886
When I did,

728
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:02,307
my dad was gone.

729
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:12,567
Ung.

730
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,445
Isn't that funny?

731
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:18,740
How could he…

732
01:00:21,368 --> 01:00:23,370
abandon me like that?

733
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:32,355
