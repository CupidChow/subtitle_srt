1
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:55,221
They say the more you try
to ignore the past,

2
00:00:56,055 --> 00:00:58,850
the more you become trapped in it.

3
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:11,071
Yeon-su doesn't have parents,
so her grandma picks her up.

4
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:13,281
Why don't you have parents?

5
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,700
Then you can't play house with us.

6
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,914
I don't want to anyway.

7
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,460
That's how I am.

8
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,463
Hey, you should stop caring about her.

9
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:31,549
She doesn't care about us.
She's so self-centered.

10
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:35,512
She's right.
Yeon-su never treated us to anything.

11
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,013
We always bought her stuff.

12
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:40,058
But still, it wasn't like
she asked us to buy her those things.

13
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:43,186
But she's shameless
for accepting them every single time.

14
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,771
Even though time passed…

15
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:48,066
I wish…

16
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,655
I could only be poor to the point

17
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,366
where I could handle it.

18
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,409
…and I became an adult…

19
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:10,255
I was still that same little girl
who was at that playground.

20
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,847
That's how my life has always been.

21
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,403
Let's…

22
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,657
Let's break up.

23
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,464
To avoid getting hurt…

24
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:54,424
I…

25
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,139
…I hurt the people I loved.

26
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,433
I don't see the point

27
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,477
in continuing this relationship anymore.

28
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,689
I disguised my low self-esteem
with a breakup.

29
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,449
Enjoy your food.

30
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,909
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

31
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,744
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

32
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,752
I pretended like everything was fine

33
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:34,923
and hung onto the hope
that I would get used to it.

34
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,466
That was when it happened.

35
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,141
INCOMING CALL
CHOI UNG

36
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,143
The day

37
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,479
that Ung doesn't remember.

38
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,279
The day Ung called me
for the first time after our breakup.

39
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:01,115
Just tell me why we have to break up.

40
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,992
Tell me why, Yeon-su.

41
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,918
If you don't tell me why,

42
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:17,006
I'll have no choice
but to hate everything about myself.

43
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:24,305
I'll come to think of myself
as someone who deserves to be abandoned.

44
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:52,166
I'm going through…

45
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,211
a rough patch right now.

46
00:04:56,754 --> 00:05:00,425
My family is going
through a financial crisis.

47
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,137
I can't afford to be dating anyone.

48
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,265
And…

49
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:13,104
there's no reason for you
to share this misery I'm in.

50
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,357
That's why.

51
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,032
Is that it?

52
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:32,957
I would rather have you tell me
that you didn't like me anymore.

53
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,169
If that's why…

54
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,632
you're abandoning me…

55
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,970
that's just ridiculous.

56
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,956
Back then, why did we break up?

57
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:17,877
That's what the past does to you.

58
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,255
The more you try to run away from it,

59
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:24,967
the more it traps you in,

60
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:33,601
so that you make the same mistakes again.

61
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:38,773
EPISODE 14
LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL

62
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,071
Why all of a sudden?

63
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:48,366
I've always been curious.

64
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:54,455
We'd repeatedly argue,
break up, and get back together.

65
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,290
But I was always confident…

66
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:01,671
that we'd never break up for good.

67
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,174
But on that day,

68
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,844
I was so confused.

69
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:12,807
You seemed so desperate to break up.

70
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:20,022
Why was it that you wanted to break up?

71
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:30,825
I was

72
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,286
very exhausted.

73
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,040
You know how busy I was
part-timing and job hunting.

74
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,590
What's the point in bringing up the past?

75
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,675
Let's forget about things like that.

76
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:49,635
What matters is that we're back together.

77
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,721
Okay.

78
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,061
It's late. I should go home.

79
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,356
Grandma's been upset lately
because I've been coming home late.

80
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,193
-I'll drop you off.
-It's okay. I can take a cab.

81
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,653
You only just got home. You should rest.

82
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,364
Yeon-su.

83
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,287
Get home safe.

84
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:17,997
Okay.

85
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,116
You're home.

86
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:40,079
What about dinner? Did you eat already?

87
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,668
What's wrong? Did something happen?

88
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:50,715
No. It's nothing.

89
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:57,930
Well…

90
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,184
That boy came by today.

91
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,065
I know.

92
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,152
I swear I didn't call him over.

93
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,779
He came on his own.

94
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,616
So what did you say to him?

95
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,868
Did you scold him again?

96
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,120
No, I didn't.

97
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,956
Do you think that's all I ever do?

98
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,967
By the way, Yeon-su.

99
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,011
Yes?

100
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:40,222
Did you break up with him back then

101
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:46,062
because we were going through a hard time?

102
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:56,989
What?

103
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:01,494
Did you

104
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,122
break up with him because you had to carry

105
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,583
all the burden yourself?

106
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,838
No, Grandma. Why would you think that?

107
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:18,677
We just fought and broke up.

108
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:22,264
You know I have
a nasty temper just like you.

109
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,482
That's such a silly thought.

110
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,323
This is where it's the warmest.

111
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:44,787
Grandma,
can I sleep here with you tonight?

112
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:24,160
If you have something to say,
please go ahead.

113
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,704
Well…

114
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,792
Yeon-su told me
not to say anything to you.

115
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,421
I'm only saying this
because you came here on your own.

116
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,131
Okay.

117
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,093
You like her, don't you?

118
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:45,181
I'm sure I like her
much more than you think I do.

119
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:50,060
Good. Then that's all that matters.

120
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,355
Please stay by her side.

121
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,859
-You don't need to worry--
-What I mean is,

122
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:02,323
make sure you stay by her side
for a very long time.

123
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,201
Don't leave her anytime soon.

124
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,708
Ever since she was little,

125
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,753
I was the only person she could rely on.

126
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:21,509
She didn't have any friends or family.

127
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:26,138
Whatever it was,
she always carried the burden herself.

128
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,808
When our family fell apart
and we had no money,

129
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:33,062
that young girl strived
to make ends meet on her own.

130
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:42,905
Anyway, I think she has always

131
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,450
had feelings for you.

132
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,539
So please don't make her feel lonely

133
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:54,083
and stay by her side.

134
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,004
Okay. Don't worry.

135
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,718
I know

136
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:08,264
that my words might put pressure on you.

137
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,807
But I have no choice.

138
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:15,479
I can't be by her side forever.

139
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:18,107
That's why I'm asking for your help.

140
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:33,497
Ma'am.

141
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:40,337
Did something happen to your family?

142
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,089
What?

143
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,878
Let's see.

144
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:24,506
WITH UNG

145
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:35,434
Gosh, you almost gave me a heart attack.

146
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:38,103
Stop shooting. You shouldn't be
filming something like this.

147
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,606
It's been a while.
I must capture every little detail.

148
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:43,525
Let's be honest.
You know you shouldn't film this.

149
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:44,902
Turn that off.

150
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:48,113
-Honey, what's that?
-What do you mean?

151
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,615
Were you going to pocket that?

152
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:52,868
I wasn't pocketing anything.
I was just doing some bookkeeping.

153
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,162
I told you, no more fishing rods.

154
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,122
-Of course.
-We have no room at home.

155
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,874
-Exactly.
-Okay. Give me that.

156
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,834
I wasn't going to take this.

157
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:03,545
-Give that back.
-I was going to buy some ingredients.

158
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:07,132
Ji-ung, let me check your camera
and see how much he pocketed.

159
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,468
-Ji-ung, turn this off.
-Let's see. Stop.

160
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:10,970
-How do you do it?
-Let's see.

161
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,680
-Let me see.
-Ho! When are we going?

162
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,807
I'm all set to go.

163
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,768
-Chang-sik, come here!
-Honey! Are you going fishing again?

164
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,311
-We need to talk!
-Unbelievable!

165
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,771
-Hold on!
-Hey!

166
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:21,939
-Come here!
-Ho!

167
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,983
-Just come here.
-Let's go fishing.

168
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,068
Fishing? What a lunatic.

169
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,196
Hey.

170
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,281
No, I was about to leave.

171
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,452
Why does he want to see me
so early in the morning?

172
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,705
All right. Fine.

173
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,460
-Your rating was pretty high.
-Yes. I saw.

174
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,129
People seem to love it.

175
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,923
-Yes. I heard.
-Gosh, you're annoying.

176
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,135
Hand Chae-ran over. Let me use her now.

177
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:56,015
I guess your shows always flop
because you lack common sense.

178
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,851
She's not an object.
She's not something you can use.

179
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:00,894
Kim Ji-ung!

180
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,733
Hello.

181
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,152
What took you so long?

182
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:09,903
I've been waiting for you.

183
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:14,324
I only left the office
just a few hours ago.

184
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:18,203
Ji-ung, aren't you
extremely grateful to me?

185
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:23,417
Don't you feel like repaying me
for my kindness and respecting me?

186
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,336
I told you this would be successful.

187
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,798
It's been 54 weeks since we've had
ratings like this on the first episode.

188
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:34,970
What's with the long face?
Did our program get shut down?

189
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,889
Are you not happy with the results?

190
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,141
I guess I am.

191
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,062
What's with you?

192
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,065
Chae-ran, what's going on with him?

193
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,026
He hasn't slept much,
so he must be exhausted.

194
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,611
He's protesting.

195
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,405
Fine, then.

196
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:56,742
I'll let you do that
environmental documentary next.

197
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,702
So just bask in the glory.

198
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:01,830
-I'm eating with the director today, so--
-I'm okay.

199
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,374
Forget it, you punk.

200
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,168
What a rude, little scumbag.

201
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,170
He became even more annoying.

202
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:11,882
By the way, what do they think?
Ung and Yeon-su I mean.

203
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:13,801
I'm not sure. I didn't ask.

204
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:16,512
They're going to be even more famous now.

205
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,640
That's the power of the media.

206
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,350
More people will recognize them.

207
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:24,144
What if the other TV stations
invite them to their shows?

208
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,562
I doubt it.

209
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,940
When you get famous,

210
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,818
people end up flocking to you.

211
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:34,071
That's what the media does.
It attracts unnecessary attention.

212
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,615
Tell them to ignore anyone
they've lost touch with.

213
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:39,409
They're only reaching out
to ask for a favor. Understand?

214
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,703
-Make sure they're aware of this.
-Dong-il.

215
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,498
-Yes?
-I know you're excited about the ratings,

216
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,250
but we're not at that level yet.

217
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,544
-What do you mean?
-It was only the first episode.

218
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:49,670
Still.

219
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,840
When is Ms. Lee arriving?

220
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,050
In 20 minutes. There's a traffic jam.

221
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,970
-Let's have the meeting once she comes.
-Okay.

222
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:10,858
Gosh.

223
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,693
He's annoying but good at his job.

224
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:15,237
He's so adorable that I want to bite him.

225
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,698
Should I try that next time?
He'd have a fit.

226
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,539
What are you looking at?

227
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:28,458
What? Oh, it's nothing.

228
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,298
Will you be working today?

229
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:37,009
Of course. The exhibition
is just around the corner.

230
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,595
I don't think
you're sleeping well these days.

231
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,432
But I also know
that you're preparing for your exhibition.

232
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,935
Don't worry.
I'll sleep here and there when I can.

233
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,272
What will you do next
once the exhibition is over?

234
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,773
Do you have any plans?

235
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,735
Well, I didn't really think about it.

236
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,195
I see.

237
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,949
Maybe I'll just take a break

238
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,619
and just pick you up to and from work.

239
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,626
How's your new project going?

240
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,836
Well, I guess it's going all right.

241
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,254
Is it not fun?

242
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:17,966
I just do it because it's work.

243
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,134
I see.

244
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,555
-Yeon-su.
-Yes?

245
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:24,848
When you get off work--

246
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,975
No way. It's Ung! See?

247
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,644
I told you they lived around here.

248
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,354
It's true. You're Ung and Yeon-su, right?

249
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:32,981
Hey, where are your manners?
They're 29 years old.

250
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,692
Hello. We watched your documentary.
We're fans of yours.

251
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:36,985
Why are you together?

252
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,029
Don't you dislike each other? Was I wrong?

253
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:40,113
Was it all scripted?

254
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,032
Hey, they could've grown on each other.

255
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:44,409
Gosh, you look more
good-looking in person.

256
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:47,037
Are you close to NJ?
I see your name when I search hers.

257
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:48,664
Can we take a photo?

258
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,707
-Well… Sure.
-Awesome!

259
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,715
There. That's me, right?

260
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,134
I look good.

261
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:04,346
I look better from the left,
but they only shot me from the right.

262
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:07,391
Gosh. Ms. Kook looks charismatic.

263
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:10,227
Ung is the one who's the most surprising.

264
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,021
-Compared to ten years ago…
-Right.

265
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,816
You never know
what the future has in store for you.

266
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,734
His studio was huge too.

267
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:20,237
They're still bickering so much.

268
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,740
I never knew this side of her.

269
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,909
-Right? She's surprisingly cute.
-Yes.

270
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,160
Starting today,

271
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:31,915
you're not allowed to watch
that documentary at work.

272
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,126
You can't talk about it either.

273
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:35,585
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

274
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,587
Ms. Kook, what's going on?

275
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,132
Where's my interview? Was it edited out?

276
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:42,426
I told you to tell them not to--

277
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,261
We can't talk about that here.

278
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:47,431
-I talked for an hour--
-We can't seem to focus on work lately.

279
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:51,184
The Soen project should have been
our stepping stone to something greater.

280
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:54,980
You're aware that our current project
isn't going to turn any heads, right?

281
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:02,612
Right. Do you guys have plans
this evening?

282
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:06,992
Of course not.
We should be working since we're so busy.

283
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:09,619
That's right. I'm ready to work overtime.

284
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,663
I came prepared
and wore comfortable pants.

285
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,791
I'll also stay behind and assist you all.

286
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,793
-Mr. Bang.
-What?

287
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:19,212
Right. I should stay behind too.

288
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:22,507
It's not that. I was thinking
about treating you to a meal

289
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:25,177
if you were all free tonight.

290
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:27,846
What do you say?

291
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:31,349
Well…

292
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:34,311
Filming at work
must have been an inconvenience.

293
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:38,023
-If you're free--
-I'd love that, Ms. Kook.

294
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:40,358
Does that mean you'll be joining us today?

295
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:42,194
Or I could just pay and--

296
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:44,321
-No.
-No. That's okay.

297
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:47,699
I don't think you've ever joined us
at our get-togethers.

298
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,785
I'd love that. What do you guys think?

299
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,244
-I love it.
-Me too.

300
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:52,621
I must be dreaming.

301
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,498
Where should we go? What should we eat?

302
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,875
-Ji-un, pick out something delicious.
-Okay. I'll look.

303
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:59,920
Let's get ready to clock out.

304
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:02,589
-Let's be quick, guys.
-Yes, sir.

305
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:03,965
What should I do?

306
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,635
-Can you find a nice chicken place?
-Chicken?

307
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:09,638
What bread would you like?

308
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,139
Anything will do.

309
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,517
We'll both have white bread
and American cheese.

310
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,643
Please heat it up.

311
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,187
Any vegetables you don't like?

312
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:18,730
Why do you ask?

313
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,816
We'll have all of them in one
and the other without olives.

314
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,693
What about the sauce?

315
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:27,489
-Anything tasty will do.
-Ranch and onion. Thank you.

316
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:29,324
Jeez.

317
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:33,662
-Hey.
-You can pay for this.

318
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,330
What will you do without me?

319
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:44,339
You're often awake at this hour.
Did you give up on sleeping entirely?

320
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:48,218
No. I sleep a bit at night
thanks to Yeon-su.

321
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:50,512
That's what I've been telling you to do.

322
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,764
But now you listen because it's Yeon-su.

323
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,474
What a hopeless romantic you are.

324
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:58,228
Ung, I'm rejecting
all interviews and magazine offers

325
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:00,730
so you can focus on the exhibition.

326
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:03,024
I guess people
really loved the documentary.

327
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,193
You're even getting offers from TV shows.

328
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:06,903
Reject them all.

329
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:09,364
Some of them want both you and Yeon-su.

330
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:11,116
I should reject them too, right?

331
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:12,701
I'll ask her first.

332
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,912
This is exactly why I refuse to date.

333
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:19,207
You don't get to decide on anything.
It only ties you down.

334
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:22,627
Are you planning to do
everything she tells you from now on?

335
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,760
Hey.

336
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:34,472
-What kind of person do I come off as?
-What?

337
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:39,186
Do I look lost and aimless?

338
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:41,229
You've always been like that though.

339
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,819
Was that a serious question?

340
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,615
-Did Yeon-su nag you?
-No.

341
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:55,076
Maybe she's just given up on me.

342
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,245
What do you mean?

343
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,123
I can't help but admit
that I'm quite irresponsible.

344
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,500
I'm not all that reliable either.

345
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,170
Maybe that's why she doesn't
rely on me when things get tough.

346
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:12,052
Ung. It was five years ago
that you swore to be successful.

347
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:13,595
And look how far you've come.

348
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,388
Can you call that irresponsible?

349
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:17,724
No. Plus, I have high standards.

350
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:20,101
Can't you see
that I'm devoting my twenties to you?

351
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:22,354
Don't be ridiculous.

352
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,565
You didn't have to flatter me like that.

353
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,651
I don't know why you're thinking that,

354
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:31,404
but it's true you're weird
and awfully childish.

355
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:32,697
What now?

356
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,075
But you're a pretty cool guy.
At least in my eyes.

357
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,869
It doesn't matter what you think.

358
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,955
And can't you see how much
I'm relying on you?

359
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:43,041
You give me a monthly salary,
pay for my food, and my house.

360
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:58,265
Hey, Ji-ung.
I heard your documentary was a success.

361
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,684
I envy you, you punk.

362
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,603
-Would you like a cup?
-That'd be great.

363
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,233
How's your project going?

364
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:12,570
Well, I think it's going well,
but I'm not sure either.

365
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,197
What's wrong?

366
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,949
Do you know NJ?

367
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:19,786
I must have gotten
the wrong impression of her.

368
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:23,748
-Why?
-I mean, she's a bit…

369
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,710
strange.

370
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:30,005
It's the tenth anniversary of her debut,

371
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,882
but she sounds like an aged singer
who's about to retire soon.

372
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,426
She seems pretty out of it.

373
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,763
I've seen many people like her.

374
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:42,058
They end up causing trouble
when they're like that.

375
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:45,478
-Really?
-We'll keep shooting,

376
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:49,649
but I hope she won't cause
any trouble until we're done.

377
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:55,113
Hey, I should get going.
I need to record a narration.

378
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:58,283
Anyway, you better treat me
to a nice meal sometime soon.

379
00:26:58,366 --> 00:26:59,326
Okay.

380
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:00,493
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

381
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:19,054
"After driving down an empty road,
I arrived here."

382
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:23,141
"I spend my free time
doing what I want to do."

383
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,644
"I haven't been able to relax like this
in a long time."

384
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,157
NJ?

385
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:44,537
Oh, I'm sorry.

386
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,748
That's fine. Let's do a retake.

387
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,297
"Spending some alone time is great."

388
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:05,392
"But whenever I go
to nice places or have delicious food,

389
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:09,521
I want to share
those moments with a friend."

390
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,108
Is there a problem?

391
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,153
Something's wrong with the script.

392
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,322
Which part?

393
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:21,157
I don't have any friends.

394
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:26,162
Sorry?

395
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,207
Do people think about their friends
in such situations?

396
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,625
I see.

397
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:34,963
Then should we change that to "family"?

398
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,812
We're not open yet.

399
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:54,190
Please come by 5 p.m…

400
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,698
Have you been well?

401
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,286
My dear Sol.

402
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:22,051
How dare you come here, Jin-seob?

403
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:25,138
I know you're happy to see me again,

404
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:27,599
-so don't pretend like you're not.
-Me?

405
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,143
Why would I be happy to see you?

406
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:31,686
I know you missed me.

407
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,646
You must be insane.

408
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:44,115
Do you think that asshole is
watching right now?

409
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,867
Jin-seob.

410
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,411
Are you watching? Do you see this?

411
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:52,582
Look at me. A group of ten people
made a reservation today.

412
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:55,668
I'm doing just fine.
I hope you're doing fine too.

413
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:57,837
What about it?

414
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:01,508
You're not over me either.

415
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:04,719
Exactly which part
gave you that impression?

416
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:07,430
I can tell by looking at your face.

417
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:10,642
But I had no idea
you'd reach out to me through video.

418
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:14,813
You're still so adorable.

419
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:16,272
Get lost.

420
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:22,862
Sol-i.

421
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,782
You have a customer.

422
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,536
Someone scribbled over your sign.

423
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,162
-Do you have some acetone?
-Sure.

424
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,121
Does he work here?

425
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:35,458
No, I don't.

426
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:42,131
I guess he's not just a customer
but a friend of yours.

427
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,803
Hey. I said, get lost.

428
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:48,847
I knew it.

429
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:53,309
You have a way with guys, don't you?

430
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:56,020
-Her new boyfriend?
-Don't be ridiculous.

431
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,564
You have no right to--

432
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,899
I'm her ex-boyfriend. And you?

433
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,067
I…

434
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,695
Hey, Kim Jin-seob. Get lost.

435
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:05,405
You're kicking me out
after calling me over?

436
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:08,950
Are you crazy? I never wanted to see you.

437
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,996
Then let's talk
after you close down today.

438
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,289
I'll be waiting nearby.

439
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:17,375
Cut this nonsense and just leave.

440
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,253
Beat it before I throw something at you.

441
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:27,260
Sol.

442
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,679
I really missed you.

443
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:33,683
I'll call you later.

444
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:36,102
Goodbye.

445
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:01,586
Why are you here?

446
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:07,300
Hey. If you keep coming here,

447
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:10,136
I might really treat you
like a part-timer.

448
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,641
Why did your ex come here?

449
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,727
Who knows?

450
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:20,313
Whatever. He has a few screws loose.

451
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:33,284
-What is it?
-Acetone. Hurry up.

452
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:35,745
Right. Acetone.

453
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:39,165
Gosh. Where did I put it?

454
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:45,088
Isn't it over there?

455
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:48,466
Right. You know this place
better than I do.

456
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:52,679
POTATO SOUP WITH UNG

457
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,307
-Dad.
-My goodness.

458
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,393
Gosh, you startled me.

459
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:01,187
I heard Mom caught you
pocketing some money.

460
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:04,691
Is she still upset?

461
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:07,485
Do you want her
to kick you out of the house?

462
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:10,613
Stop buying more fishing rods.
You already have so many at home.

463
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:15,284
That's rich, coming from you
when you broke so many of them.

464
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:19,205
And they all feel different.

465
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:22,583
I really wanted
to catch a big fish this time around.

466
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,252
If only I had that fishing rod…

467
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,006
Gosh. Forget it.

468
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:30,717
You always side with your mom.
That's not fair.

469
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,719
Don't you have any money saved up?

470
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:36,472
Gosh. I pity you, Mr. Choi.

471
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:39,976
What are you doing?
Did you come here to tease me?

472
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,644
Jeez.

473
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,648
Why are you getting so close?

474
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,942
Come on. Open your pocket.

475
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,068
Why? Hey.

476
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:50,695
What is that? Hey.

477
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:52,864
Don't tell Mom.

478
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:55,324
Buy that rod and keep it well hidden.

479
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,744
Don't let her find it
and have her scold me as well.

480
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:02,248
-My dear son!
-Dad, she's going to find out.

481
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:08,129
But it's pretty expensive.

482
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,506
Gosh. I know, so I gave you enough.

483
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,176
My son…

484
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:17,805
Gosh. You really didn't need to do this.

485
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,182
I'm really fine though.

486
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:21,225
-You don't have any money.
-What?

487
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:24,020
Dad, your son earns quite a bit.

488
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:25,563
Gosh.

489
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:27,940
You stayed up for days
to earn this. How could I…

490
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,194
You've grown up so much.

491
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:32,695
Hey, get on my back.

492
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,197
-Stop that.
-Gosh.

493
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,782
-Gosh.
-Goodness.

494
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:37,909
What? Hey, Chang-sik.

495
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:40,578
Chang-sik.

496
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:45,291
Ung just gave me pocket money.

497
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:48,669
Yeon-ok!

498
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:51,672
Hey, what are you doing? Hey!

499
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,424
Right.

500
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,356
Mr. Kim?

501
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:12,443
It was you back there, right?

502
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:16,364
Yes. Are you done recording?

503
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:20,827
No, not yet. I'm waiting for them
to revise a few things,

504
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,954
so I came to say hi.

505
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,709
You never seem to have a proper dinner.

506
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:32,797
Right. Did you have dinner yet?

507
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,715
No, I can't eat. I'm on a diet.

508
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:38,678
If you're eating alone,
should I sit with you?

509
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:40,638
People who eat alone break my heart.

510
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,767
Sure. I won't stop you.

511
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:47,478
I'm a bit busy,
so I was going to eat alone anyway.

512
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,948
What do you think about
when you're eating alone?

513
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:03,578
I think about how much
rice and side dishes I have left

514
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,622
because I can't have
one without the other.

515
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,332
I agree.

516
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:12,086
Did you hear my narration about friends?

517
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:16,090
Who thinks about their friends
while they eat? You just eat.

518
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:21,721
By the way,
why don't you have any friends?

519
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,892
Because my situation doesn't allow it.

520
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:28,352
I've been working since I was young,

521
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:31,647
so there are things I can't have
that are normal to most people.

522
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:34,984
It's not easy to befriend someone
you've met through work.

523
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:37,612
But I also have no time
to meet new people.

524
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,864
That's why I just gave up making friends.

525
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:04,347
You know what?

526
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:08,017
If you want to live
an ordinary life like the others,

527
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,436
just pretend that you are.

528
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:17,902
It may seem difficult,
but it's all about your state of mind.

529
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,321
And if you keep doing that,

530
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,698
you don't even have to pretend anymore.

531
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,953
We can't just blame our surroundings.

532
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:30,164
After all,
it's our life we're talking about.

533
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,125
It's our loss to think like that.

534
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:34,669
So you should give it a shot

535
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:38,256
before you give up entirely.

536
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:40,383
That's all.

537
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,394
Lately…

538
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:54,105
you've been comforting me unexpectedly.

539
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:55,564
Really?

540
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:59,360
Do you think we're in the same situation?

541
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:07,368
You collect monthly rent,
while I collect a monthly check.

542
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,044
What is Mr. Choi up to nowadays?

543
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,297
I knew you'd ask.

544
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,507
I'm dying to know,

545
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:24,302
but I acted all tough
and said I'd never call or visit him.

546
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:28,889
See? He never calls me before I do.

547
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,475
If I stopped trying,
he wouldn't have cared.

548
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:37,982
So tell me. What is he up to?

549
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,776
I'm not sure. We haven't met in a while.

550
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,987
Why not? Did you two fight?

551
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,740
We're too old for that.

552
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:47,700
Then what?

553
00:38:56,959 --> 00:39:01,047
I should get going.
Thank you for keeping me company.

554
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,673
Goodbye then.

555
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:05,009
He's just leaving?

556
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,678
Would it have hurt to answer me?

557
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,685
Hey, Ung.

558
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:17,438
I have a company get-together today.

559
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:21,275
I know. I never attend these.

560
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:25,279
I felt bad for filming at work.

561
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:29,408
I shouldn't have shot the documentary.

562
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,202
This is so bothersome.

563
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,414
-Yes, chicken.
-Chicken.

564
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:36,749
-Yes.
-Thank you.

565
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:40,127
Are you sure
Ms. Ji couldn't come because she was sick?

566
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,963
Yes, she's really sick.
She loves get-togethers.

567
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,007
She was crying on her way home.

568
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:47,885
We need to take good care
of ourselves in this day and age.

569
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,637
Well, that's too bad.

570
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,014
-Let's still enjoy the meal, okay?
-Okay.

571
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,682
By the way, this is unbelievable.

572
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:55,267
I never knew this day would come.

573
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,395
I didn't propose this get-together, right?

574
00:39:57,478 --> 00:40:01,148
Ms. Kook made
the suggestion herself, right?

575
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,150
Dig in guys.

576
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:06,570
Why are you so ecstatic
when she's the one who's buying?

577
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,989
Ms. Kook and I are one.

578
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,825
We're one team and one body.

579
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:12,159
She represents our company.

580
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:15,830
So you also knew that she's the boss.

581
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:19,333
-Another round. Cheers.
-Cheers.

582
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,964
The beer here tastes amazing.

583
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:29,343
By the way,
how did get Ms. Kook to work with you?

584
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:30,928
What? What do you mean?

585
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:33,431
We all know how competent she is.

586
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:35,391
I'm sure a lot of companies wanted her.

587
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:38,102
Oh, that? I was her senior back in school.

588
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:40,980
-Really? University?
-Didn't I tell you?

589
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:42,523
We were in the same club.

590
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,525
I was the chairman of the club.

591
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,945
She was deeply moved by my leadership

592
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:51,907
and my creative
and innovative way of thinking.

593
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:53,742
That's why she's working with me.

594
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:58,956
But how did you go to school together

595
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:01,333
-if your age gap is--
-It's smaller than you think.

596
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:02,585
I see.

597
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:07,006
Anyway, Ms. Kook was impressive
even in university.

598
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:11,802
I've never seen anyone
work as hard in life as she does.

599
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:15,890
You shouldn't talk about someone
while they're away.

600
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,184
I know. So don't go anywhere from now on.

601
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:21,187
Since she's here,
let's all drink together.

602
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:24,523
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

603
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:28,444
Ms. Kook.

604
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:31,697
I saved you your favorite piece
since you're treating us.

605
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,073
Thank you.

606
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:36,577
I'm so moved

607
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:40,206
that we're finally having
our first get-together with Ms. Kook.

608
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:42,458
Promise me that you won't go home tonight.

609
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:43,876
Promise me.

610
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:47,129
I can see that you're happy,
but we should still go home.

611
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:50,257
-Have a drink.
-Since Ms. Kook is here as well,

612
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,551
everyone seems more excited than usual.

613
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:55,971
It's true. I love it.
We should do this more.

614
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,556
-Yes.
-I'd like to make a toast.

615
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,724
-Sure.
-Okay.

616
00:41:58,807 --> 00:41:59,892
This is youth--

617
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:01,894
That's enough.
Our youngest member can make a toast.

618
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:04,021
Sure. Don't walk! Run!

619
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:11,904
-Gosh, that's refreshing.
-It's really tasty.

620
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:12,988
Have some of this.

621
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:15,366
It's okay. Like I said before,
our university…

622
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,753
Are you waiting for someone?

623
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:30,464
Me? For who? No way.

624
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:31,840
I think you were.

625
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:34,301
You must have been waiting for your ex.

626
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,929
Me? You're wrong.

627
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,354
As you saw earlier,

628
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:47,690
he came here
because he couldn't get over me.

629
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:48,732
But not me.

630
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:52,319
I do admit that guys
find it difficult to get over me.

631
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,364
That's why they all have a tough time.

632
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:57,324
But that's not my fault.

633
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,034
I never asked.

634
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:02,496
But frankly, it does bother me

635
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,374
that he said he'd wait.

636
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:07,876
I have no intention
of getting back together with him,

637
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,921
but I'm sure he's suffering inside.

638
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:14,592
So I was going to comfort him
and send him home if he came.

639
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:16,135
I didn't ask.

640
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,179
Darn it.

641
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,682
Right. I'm glad you're here.

642
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:24,977
I have to give something
to the shop next door, so stay here.

643
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:27,521
Why? I need to go.

644
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:28,772
Wait. It won't take long.

645
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,608
-You better hurry.
-Okay.

646
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,276
Thanks.

647
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,822
From blind date to an ex-boyfriend…

648
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:40,117
She should focus on her job.
Why are there so many guys around her?

649
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:44,079
Gosh, she didn't empty
the trash again. Gosh.

650
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:46,665
She's such a handful.

651
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:49,668
Why does everyone around me

652
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:53,297
always need my help at all times?

653
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,841
LEEZAKAYA

654
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:58,469
Gosh.

655
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:15,319
I'm telling you. I think I can borrow
at least five million won.

656
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:16,945
Business seems to be doing well.

657
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:19,990
I can get the money right away.

658
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:24,036
It's Sol-i. She's never said no to me.

659
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:27,956
When I saw her earlier,
I could tell that she was swayed.

660
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:31,418
If I coax her just right,
she'll give in to me.

661
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:34,672
She may look nonchalant on the outside,

662
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:37,508
but she can be quite pitiful.

663
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:44,264
Hold on.

664
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:51,021
We met earlier.

665
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,023
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

666
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,151
Who told you that?

667
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:58,570
What do you mean?

668
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,036
About Sol-i.

669
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:10,332
Who said her business was doing well?

670
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:12,626
I'm late.

671
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:14,461
I feel bad.

672
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,464
I should feed Eun-ho before he leaves.

673
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:21,677
So…

674
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:24,721
What is he doing?

675
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:26,932
Sol-i isn't yours anymore.

676
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:30,519
Is he crazy?

677
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:37,151
She belongs

678
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,903
to the bank. Understand?

679
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:43,449
Is it that bad?
Did she take out a lot of loans?

680
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:45,742
It's really bad.
She took out a maximum loan.

681
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:49,121
I doubt she'll ever be
able to pay it back.

682
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:50,497
I thought business was going well.

683
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:51,915
Don't get me started.

684
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:55,669
We have more shrimp than the number
of customers we had last month.

685
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:01,884
I shouldn't have come here.

686
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:03,510
That's right.

687
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:09,558
Anyway, thank you for the tip-off.

688
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,980
Aren't you going to wait for her?

689
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:17,232
What for? It'll only break our hearts.

690
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:22,154
Please take good care of my dear Sol.

691
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:40,964
What took you so long?
You said you'd be quick.

692
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:42,299
So?

693
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:44,718
Any customers?

694
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:49,264
No, as usual. It's nothing new.

695
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:54,394
What? What is it?

696
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,856
What are you doing?

697
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:00,067
Nothing.

698
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:11,620
Perfect timing. We just parted ways.

699
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:13,580
Did you drink a lot?

700
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:16,500
No, not that much.

701
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:17,876
Are you going home?

702
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:19,670
Yes.

703
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:23,048
I wanted to pick you up,
but I knew you wouldn't like that.

704
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:26,134
Me? Did I?

705
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:28,762
Yes. You used to say you'd be embarrassed

706
00:47:28,845 --> 00:47:31,598
if I came to pick you up
when you could've just walked home.

707
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,183
You wanted to be independent.

708
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:36,645
I can't believe
you still remember all that.

709
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:40,607
Of course. I remember all sorts of things.

710
00:47:46,863 --> 00:47:48,323
But back then,

711
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:52,619
I only said that because
I didn't want to take up your time.

712
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:57,874
And you would have spent
a lot of money on cab fare.

713
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:03,005
Back then, it seemed like a lot of money.

714
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:04,756
It was intimidating.

715
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:08,093
So you actually wanted me
to come pick you up.

716
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:10,262
Yes.

717
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:13,056
Okay. Then look behind you.

718
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:14,683
What?

719
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:23,275
From now on,
tell me these things in advance.

720
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:39,916
If you don't tell me,

721
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,252
I won't know since I'm an idiot.

722
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:52,888
I still don't know why we broke up.

723
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,765
So…

724
00:48:56,933 --> 00:48:59,186
promise that you'll tell me everything.

725
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:05,150
I will.

726
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:08,111
I'm sure she'll tell me one day.

727
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:11,865
Waiting is what I do best after all.

728
00:49:11,948 --> 00:49:16,495
I listen to and remember
everything you tell me.

729
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:18,455
So keep telling me.

730
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,670
Okay.

731
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:29,633
And once I find out why…

732
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:40,602
I'll make sure to prevent it
from happening again.

733
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:45,691
Let's go.

734
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:51,863
That will be my only goal in life
from now on.

735
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:53,824
There are so many stars.

736
00:49:54,991 --> 00:49:56,201
- Is It cold?
- Yes.

737
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,872
I will spend
the rest of my life with Yeon-su.

738
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:21,703

MEDICAL SERVICE
SPECIALTIES

742
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:43,702
You've prepared a feast for breakfast.

743
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:45,412
Goodness.

744
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:49,457
What? You even grilled fish?

745
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:52,210
Good grief.

746
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:57,424
Gosh, that's great.

747
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:01,094
-This is good.
-Grandma.

748
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,014
Is it good?

749
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:08,894
Of course it is.

750
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:17,777
Have some of this.

751
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:21,031
You have it. I can eat on my own.

752
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:32,542
Should we go on a trip?

753
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:36,838
What? A trip out of the blue?

754
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:38,673
My legs will ache too much to walk.

755
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:41,551
Come on. We can drive.

756
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:43,428
It's getting colder now.

757
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:45,931
Let's go to a hot spring and relax.

758
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:52,354
I'll take a few days off from work.
Let's go sightseeing

759
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:54,147
and eat lots of good food.

760
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:59,110
What's gotten into you?

761
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:01,988
I'll often grill your favorite fish.

762
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:04,574
We'll go on many trips.

763
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:07,911
And I'll buy you many pretty clothes.

764
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:09,955
You can go to the community center
and brag about it.

765
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:19,130
So let's live together forever.

766
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:30,308
Don't go anywhere.
Stay by my side for a very long time.

767
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:32,060
Okay?

768
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:52,038
Yeon-su.

769
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:59,254
Do you not like living with me?

770
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:02,549
What are you talking about?

771
00:55:03,925 --> 00:55:05,093
You do, right?

772
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:07,303
You like it, right?

773
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:11,725
I know you like me.

774
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:15,103
Everyone else may dislike me,

775
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:19,107
but I know you don't. Right?

776
00:55:20,316 --> 00:55:23,570
Why in the world would I ever dislike you?

777
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:26,406
Exactly.

778
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:29,909
So…

779
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:33,705
don't go anywhere.

780
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:35,832
Stay by my side.

781
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:42,756
I…

782
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:49,262
don't ever want to be alone again.

783
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:21,836
LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL

784
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:48,113
EPILOGUE

785
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:05,713
You're home.

786
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:10,051
You're back sooner
than I expected this time.

787
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:13,680
I thought it'd be at least a few months.

788
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:15,932
We need to talk.

789
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:19,477
I'm tired. Maybe next time.

790
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,188
About your work…

791
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:27,569
You know, filming…

792
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:31,448
How did you know?

793
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:35,243
I didn't know you cared about what I did.

794
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:41,458
Just be as you always were.

795
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:43,293
-You don't need to--
-I heard

796
00:57:44,335 --> 00:57:46,796
that you can film anyone.

797
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:51,259
That you don't have to be special.

798
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:54,179
You film ordinary people.

799
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:56,347
What are you talking about?

800
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:58,892
I want you to film me.

801
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:02,937
Film what now?

802
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:05,106
Me.

803
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:07,817
Can you film me?

804
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,115
Rest up. I'm going to bed.

805
00:58:15,783 --> 00:58:16,868
They say

806
