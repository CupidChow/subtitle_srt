1
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:43,668
Where do I begin?

2
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:47,505
First, I'll tell you about myself.

3
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:49,382
We have no time. Let's hurry.

4
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,343
Here.

5
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:53,511
What's next?

6
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,805
I live a very professional life.

7
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,265
-Pose for us.
-You're pretty.

8
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:58,308
-Over here.
-Good.

9
00:00:58,391 --> 00:00:59,684
Pose for us.

10
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:01,352
-Over here.
-You're amazing.

11
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:02,479
Look over here.

12
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:03,688
Look up, please.

13
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,231
My life is glamorous

14
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,318
and way too passionate.

15
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,362
But enough about that.

16
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:14,157
I'll tell you about my true self.

17
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:21,706
SHINE LIKE MAGIC

18
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,801
There's this character in my story.

19
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,724
He appeared out of nowhere one day

20
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:43,186
But not really.

21
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,401
NJ

22
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:52,987
NJ PURCHASES A FIVE-STORY BUILDING

23
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:55,907
News like this travels fast.

24
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,991
Celebrities make easy money.

25
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,827
I hear she became an idol

26
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:02,080
Is it an article about you?
Whatever it is, don't look at it for now.

27
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:04,874
That's easier said than done.

28
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,253
There are so many ads
in news articles nowadays.

29
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:09,796
Gosh.

30
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,923
Darn it.

31
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,802
I guess we were scientifically matched

32
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,054
These drawings are a bit…

33
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,765
GO-OH

34
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,017
…strange.

35
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:23,935
GO-OH'S ILLUSTRATIONS

36
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:27,021
After purchasing a building,

37
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:30,400
I ended up going to an exhibition

38
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:34,028
And that's where we met.

39
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:39,492
It may be crinkled, but it's clean.

40
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:42,954
What's this for?

41
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:44,414
You're crying.

42
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:54,048
This place might be confusing to navigate.

43
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,009
You can start over there.

44
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,228
Thank you.

45
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:10,815
Don't I look silly?

46
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:15,028
I'm crying while
looking at a drawing of a building.

47
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:17,739
It's understandable.

48
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,074
Did this drawing make you cry too?

49
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,160
Well…

50
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,495
I knew it.

51
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,498
I'm the only one who's a mess.

52
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:31,085
Well…

53
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,882
Feel free to come here and cry
whenever you want.

54
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,636
If you're too embarrassed,
I'll cry with you.

55
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,644
That was such a cheesy pick-up line.

56
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,771
I was trying to comfort you.

57
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:52,190
Why would you comfort a stranger?

58
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:56,527
You don't feel like a stranger to me
since I've seen you often on TV.

59
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,738
I feel like I know you.

60
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,156
I'm a fan of yours, NJ.

61
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,284
Hey!

62
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:09,290
Hey…

63
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,877
Hey, where are you?

64
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,337
Hey.

65
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,131
When I find something suspicious,

66
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:18,257
Do you work here?

67
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,344
No. I'm a visitor.

68
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,304
Do you know the artist?

69
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,014
No. I'm just a visitor.

70
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,392
I'd like to buy this one. How much is it?

71
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:28,601
It's ten million…

72
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,106
Since I'm a mere visitor, I'm not sure.

73
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,691
But you can go ask over there.

74
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,776
The drawings aren't the only things
that are strange.

75
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,361
-Sorry?
-Sorry?

76
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,698
Never mind. Where do I need to go again?

77
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:45,159
Please don't damage it.
Please be careful with it.

78
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:48,496
GO-OH'S SOLO EXHIBITION

79
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:51,666
So I wanted to find out.

80
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,209
Give me your phone.

81
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,295
-I am a busy woman, but…
-What for?

82
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:58,089
If I get bored of that drawing,
I want to buy another one of yours.

83
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,008
I'm not the artist.

84
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,092
Really?

85
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:04,012
-Then I should just return that drawing.
-Wait.

86
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,433
Please keep it a secret.

87
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,769
Well, it's fun.

88
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:17,734
This is my number.
Not many people know this number.

89
00:05:18,317 --> 00:05:21,070
Not many know my number either.
I don't have many friends.

90
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,908
And just to be clear…

91
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,786
Anyway, I'll give you a call later.

92
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,205
ARTIST GO-OH

93
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,833
…this is something that I do

94
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,293
-Again?
-to all guys.

95
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:38,671
-How long will this one last?
-There's no information about him.

96
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:41,466
I wonder what your deal is.

97
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,886
I'm just a romantic girl.

98
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,637
Don't be ridiculous.

99
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:49,307
Your interest in men lasts
no longer than two months.

100
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,934
We all have our own ways.

101
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:56,064
That's how it all began,

102
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,941
but it turned out

103
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,694
than I had first thought.

104
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,910
And that caused some problems.

105
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,040
Mr. Choi, what are you up to?

106
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,333
I'm preparing beansprouts.

107
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:19,003
Gosh, it's scorching hot today.

108
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,339
I'm weeding.

109
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,841
I gave a terrific live performance today.

110
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,052
Why aren't you watching?

111
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:29,514
I'm eating. I can pay to watch the rerun.

112
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:37,355
Mr. Choi, I know it's late,

113
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:39,816
What are you doing right now?

114
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,693
I thought he'd just be someone

115
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,821
To that person?

116
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,287
Mr. Choi!

117
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,622
So I wanted to find out

118
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:58,459
if this will be

119
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,837
-or if it will end differently this time.
-Darn it.

120
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,631
But I don't think

121
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,425
it'll take too long to find out.

122
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:13,516
EPISODE 10
HELLO, MY SOUL MATE

123
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,358
What are you two doing?

124
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:35,163
We started a new chapter
in our lives yesterday.

125
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,584
We decided to be friends.

126
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,627
It just happened.

127
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,256
Are we shooting
a documentary or a comedy skit?

128
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:51,053
Why are you here at this hour?
You didn't even call.

129
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,430
You didn't pick up.

130
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,852
Seeing you together
at this hour is very unexpected.

131
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:00,730
Sure, I get that
you could take this the wrong way.

132
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,440
-But it's definitely not--
-I'm not.

133
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,984
You probably got tired of arguing
and reconciled.

134
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:07,778
-Yes. Exactly that.
-Yes.

135
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,589
-I'm going to sleep over.
-What?

136
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,966
Hey. My house isn't an inn.

137
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,885
Why does everyone do that?

138
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:32,887
Did someone else sleep over?

139
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:37,183
Eun-ho. That punk.

140
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,184
Darn it.

141
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,567
Are you guys going to just stand there?

142
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:50,071
I was just about to leave since it's late.

143
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:51,739
Wait. What about the chicken?

144
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:54,450
-What? Are you sad to see me go?
-Not really.

145
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:56,035
Late-night snacks are unhealthy.

146
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,870
You're the one who ordered it.

147
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,580
Bye. Have fun.

148
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,749
Yeon-su, call a cab. It's dark.

149
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,125
It's okay. I'll just walk.

150
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,711
-I ordered some chicken--
-Hey. Just go already.

151
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,552
You didn't need to kick me out.

152
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,136
You can still catch a bus.

153
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,597
Take the number four bus. Don't walk home.

154
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:42,915
What is it?

155
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,085
It's nothing.

156
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,426
Finally, some peace.

157
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,929
It'd be great
if someone else would leave too.

158
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,849
I can hear you.

159
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,059
-Did you eat?
-Yes.

160
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,729
The chicken will be here soon.

161
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,524
Did you order beer too?

162
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:12,570
I did.

163
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,349
You startled me.

164
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,643
I almost had a heart attack.

165
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,604
You brat. Do you know what time it is?

166
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:49,607
What's the matter?
I always come home around this time.

167
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,442
You didn't come home last night.

168
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:54,653
I told you
I'd be sleeping over at my friend's.

169
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,739
I'm no longer a kid, you know?

170
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,991
Is that why you've been up until now?

171
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,452
You don't have any friends.

172
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:04,872
What? You shouldn't ridicule
your granddaughter like that.

173
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,499
Where did you sleep? Where?

174
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:11,420
-I slept at Sol-i's.
-I'm here, Yeon-su.

175
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,880
Hi.

176
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,050
Why are you here?

177
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,511
You wench. How dare you lie?

178
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:21,222
Tell me the truth. Where did you sleep?

179
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:23,933
Grandma, I'll interrogate her.

180
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,893
It's getting late. Go to bed.

181
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,813
I'm certain she has a guy.

182
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,564
-That's good news.
-Of course.

183
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,734
-Then why did you slap her?
-Because I'm curious who it is.

184
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,277
Find out about him.

185
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,946
I can hear you guys.

186
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:40,533
Really? Go in, Grandma.

187
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,578
You have the right to remain silent.

188
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,168
Why did you come to my house?

189
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:53,295
I met your grandma in the alley.

190
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,757
She thought you were sleeping over
at my place.

191
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,468
You should have told me about it
before lying.

192
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,720
I wasn't lying.

193
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,473
How brazen of you.

194
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,059
-What friend do you--
-Choi Ung.

195
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,727
I slept over at his place.

196
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,438
I knew it.

197
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,982
He wants us to be friends.

198
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,066
What?

199
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,611
Friends. That's what he wants us to be.

200
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:21,115
There you guys go again.

201
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,536
Right? This is weird, right?

202
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,913
That weirdo doesn't deserve
to be with someone like you.

203
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,290
What's his deal?

204
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:35,212
So? What did you say?

205
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,255
Did you say yes?

206
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,383
Yes, for now.

207
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,427
For now?

208
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,181
So? What's your plan?

209
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:50,728
I'm going to find out
how he really feels while being friends.

210
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,272
I'm going to make him admit it.

211
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,858
Admit what? How he feels about you?

212
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,447
Yeon-su, this isn't a crime movie.
It's romance.

213
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,657
You're not after some criminal.

214
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,993
You have a crush on him.

215
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,454
A crush?

216
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:12,750
That's not true. Don't be absurd.

217
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:14,502
Then what is it?

218
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:20,049
I just want to know what's on his mind.

219
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,010
You're curious about his thoughts

220
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,679
because you want him to feel the same way.

221
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:28,599
That's what people call a crush.

222
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,312
Go to bed. Stop thinking about him.

223
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,898
I never said I was thinking about him.

224
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,024
You have a crush.

225
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,692
I've had plenty too.

226
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,986
Ask me if you want to know anything.

227
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,571
I don't have a crush on him.

228
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,784
I didn't know you could be so devoted.

229
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:49,662
-Do you still like him that much?
-It's not like that.

230
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,790
What a terrible temper you have.

231
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,502
You must like him a lot to be--

232
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,087
That's not true.

233
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,058
Ji-ung, hurry.

234
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:15,646
-It's here?
-Yes.

235
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,136
How many more shoots do we have?

236
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,014
Three. We'll be done next week.

237
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:53,559
How is it going?
I doubt it's going according to plan.

238
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:58,647
If you're aware of that,
I'd like you to take more initiative.

239
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,107
Stop running away.

240
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,163
You've been giving me
that look often these days.

241
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,749
Just say what's on your mind.

242
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:19,835
If it's nonsense,
I'll filter it out myself.

243
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,547
I did have a question.

244
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,342
But never mind.

245
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,052
Whatever.

246
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,054
I'm just going to think however I want.

247
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,975
Gosh. Now this is a creative way
of being annoying.

248
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,152
What is it? Is something going on?

249
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,031
I mean…

250
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:52,451
You're not a drinker,
but you wanted to drink.

251
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,204
And you haven't stayed over in ages.

252
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,667
I just don't want to go home.

253
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:05,422
What is it?

254
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,092
Are you feeling butterflies
since I'm staying over?

255
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,303
Are you drunk? Wash up and go to bed.

256
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,388
By the way,

257
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:16,141
hasn't it been years
since we had some alone time?

258
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,602
Ung, should we sleep together?

259
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:24,066
Gosh. This is why
I don't drink with lightweights.

260
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,526
Are you going to bed already?

261
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:27,903
I'm going to work a bit. You go ahead.

262
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:29,989
But you've been drinking.

263
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:31,448
Shut up.

264
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:34,326
Don't go. I'm not sleepy.

265
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:37,996
Hey.

266
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,041
Go to sleep before I change my mind.

267
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,419
I'm this close to kicking you out.
Good night.

268
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,930
The camera is ready. Are you good?

269
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,433
You're here early.

270
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:43,103
-How's the scenery?
-Good.

271
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,813
You can sit over there.

272
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,400
-We'll begin whenever you're ready.
-Okay.

273
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,201
You left it there on purpose, right?

274
00:17:57,284 --> 00:18:00,204
No, I really forgot about it.

275
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:04,958
Your excuse for going back there is that
you left a pouch behind.

276
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,252
You know it's pathetic, right?

277
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:11,089
It's not an excuse. It's precious to me.

278
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,966
Of course. Sure.

279
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,178
I begged you to have lunch with me.

280
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:20,474
But you just had to get that pouch
right now, so you declined.

281
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,936
Why is that? Can I take a guess?

282
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,147
You want to use that as an excuse

283
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:30,692
to go back there
and have a lovely meal with Ung.

284
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,486
Come on.

285
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:33,737
Am I wrong?

286
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:40,035
How did someone like Ung
get you under his thumb?

287
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,371
I'm genuinely curious.

288
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:46,458
Everyone! This girl fell
head over heels for her crush

289
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:50,587
and has left me to starve all by myself!

290
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:53,590
Can you stop saying
that I have a crush on him?

291
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:54,883
I'll be off then.

292
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,637
I'll have a tasty and blissful meal

293
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,930
all by myself.

294
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,391
Be happy, Yeon-su.

295
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,560
Good luck, Yeon-su.

296
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,460
Hello. I'm Choi Ung's friend, NJ…

297
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:34,756
Can I use a fake name?
The company doesn't know I'm doing this.

298
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,969
Can you blur my face? No, wait.
Will that make me look like a criminal?

299
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:41,597
Let's just start filming.

300
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,182
Hey.

301
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,272
What do you want to know?

302
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,065
Should I talk about Choi Ung?

303
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:56,904
Your side dishes…

304
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,327
-I remember now!
-My gosh!

305
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:05,746
What are you doing here?

306
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:08,707
You visited that bar over there
to steal their recipe, right?

307
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,375
-What?
-Gosh.

308
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:13,003
What are you doing here? Do you work here?

309
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:14,922
Yes, I help out when they're busy.

310
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,467
I knew you looked familiar.

311
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,011
Are you doing market research again?

312
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,387
No, I'm not.

313
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,515
Are you close with the owner?

314
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,726
What? Don't you know?

315
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:29,186
-Know what?
-The name of this place.

316
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,981
-It's With Ung.
-Yes. So?

317
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,860
My gosh. No way.

318
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:40,364
Unbelievable. How did you not know
when your own a shop nearby?

319
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,741
Ji-ung's parents run this restaurant?

320
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,618
I can't believe it.

321
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:46,370
His family is wealthy.

322
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:47,621
No wonder.

323
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:51,333
Why didn't you even bother
to consider Ung?

324
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,794
Come on. Ji-ung looks more--

325
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:57,381
They're Ung's parents.
They own all the restaurants here.

326
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:02,552
I do admit that Ung doesn't look like
he's from a wealthy family.

327
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,972
But he is, and you better believe it.

328
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,515
I got goosebumps.

329
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,352
I finally found out one of his charms.

330
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:14,314
Yeon-su, you're one cunning girl.

331
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,818
-What about her?
-What? Nothing.

332
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,444
Are you sure that's enough?

333
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,989
-I have so much more to say.
-This is more than enough.

334
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:25,492
-I didn't know they were filming today.
-Let me know if you need me again.

335
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:27,369
Me neither. I was taken aback.

336
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,580
Why are you here?

337
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:34,584
Oh, I left something at your place.

338
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:35,627
Mr. Choi.

339
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,297
Were you watching the whole time?

340
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,091
You shouldn't have.
It was supposed to be a surprise.

341
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:43,760
Then why would you do it at my place?

342
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:47,055
For convenience, of course.
We're going on a date today.

343
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,642
I'm sorry? It's not a date.

344
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,520
You must be Ms. Kook Yeon-su.
We've met once.

345
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:54,980
Right.

346
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,481
I enjoyed your documentary.

347
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:00,944
-Mr. Kim, may I leave now?
-Sure.

348
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,280
I'm famished.
You haven't eaten yet, right?

349
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:04,823
-Let's go.
-Well…

350
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:07,034
Hey, Ung!

351
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,536
I left something at your place.

352
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,246
I need to get it right now.

353
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,832
Right now? What is it?

354
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:16,376
It's something super precious to me.

355
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,378
You can go inside and look for yourself.

356
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,130
But it's your house.

357
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:22,674
What's wrong? That's unlike you.

358
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,176
But still…

359
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,303
See you next time.

360
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,014
Let's go.

361
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:30,474
Okay.

362
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,267
What should we have?

363
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,519
Can I film your face right now?

364
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:37,522
What face am I making?

365
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,650
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

366
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,112
Why was NJ being filmed?

367
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:47,491
Beats me. She wanted
to be interviewed as Ung's friend.

368
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:48,825
As his friend?

369
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,662
He's suddenly made a new friend.

370
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,460
Don't just stand there. Let's eat.

371
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,213
We could've had something fancier.

372
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:03,465
This was my treat
as a way of saying thank you.

373
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,674
I like this place.

374
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,219
I come here whenever I have free time.

375
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:09,846
This must be a famous restaurant.

376
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,474
-I have a great view from here.
-Of what?

377
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,601
Of my building. Over there.

378
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:22,901
-How much is that?
-When I first got it or now?

379
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:24,861
How does it feel to own one?

380
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,239
When I first got it or now?

381
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:30,492
Gosh, you look very impressive right now.

382
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,244
I know.

383
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,206
How does it feel
to see the building I asked you to draw?

384
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,417
Right. Well, you see…

385
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:43,964
I don't think this is the right way
to go about drawing something.

386
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:46,675
I'm afraid
it'll taint your reputation and--

387
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,051
And?

388
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:53,306
To be honest,
I'm not really motivated to draw.

389
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:58,895
Oh, no. Even my building got rejected.

390
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,315
That really hurt.

391
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,943
That wasn't my intention.

392
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,820
I'm just playing. I understand.

393
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,281
Then let's forget about that favor.

394
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,245
I told you. NJ comes here all the time.

395
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:16,746
You're right.

396
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,665
By the way, who's that guy?

397
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,125
It's probably her manager.

398
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,586
She's not as pretty as I thought.

399
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:25,297
-She's too skinny.
-I agree.

400
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:28,216
I think she recently had plastic surgery.

401
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,926
Don't you think so?

402
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,553
I'm certain. Let's take a photo.

403
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:34,723
I'll take it. I have a better angle.

404
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,853
I'm sorry,
but please don't take any photos.

405
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:44,065
Well, we weren't taking a photo of you.

406
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,151
We were taking a selfie.

407
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:47,569
How ridiculous.

408
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:53,408
This must happen a lot.
You seem to be used to it.

409
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:57,162
I can never get used to it.
I just pretend I am.

410
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:02,250
Soon, they'll post it online
and leave a comment.

411
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,545
"I saw NJ today,
and she wasn't that pretty."

412
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,297
"She didn't let me take a photo."

413
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,132
"She had a nasty temper."

414
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,469
They're strangers to me

415
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:16,264
but they think they know me
and judge me so easily.

416
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,018
Isn't that funny?

417
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:24,231
I should've checked their phone.

418
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,899
How rude of them.

419
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:28,443
Why can't people understand me?

420
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,446
And why are they so quick to judge?

421
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,456
You don't need their understanding.

422
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,586
There's no need for you to do that.

423
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:50,006
Who cares? Let them see

424
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,591
and believe what they want.

425
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,178
It's fine as long as
you understand yourself.

426
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:57,722
That's already hard enough.

427
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,188
Do you know what your charm is?

428
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,564
That was sudden.

429
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:09,818
You're quite easygoing and humorous,

430
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:12,153
so I can go on all day
about the most ridiculous things.

431
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,407
-Is that a compliment?
-But you also have

432
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:18,910
a serious and sincere side to you.

433
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,371
So you tell me
what I need to hear at times.

434
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,875
You're quite charming.
You have many layers.

435
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:31,172
I'm not asking you out,
so why are you embarrassed?

436
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,759
I'm not good with compliments.

437
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,929
Look at that. You're also adorable.

438
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,348
What should we do next?

439
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,810
I haven't had a free day in ages.
What should we do?

440
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:46,563
Let's see. First…

441
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,274
Let's see…

442
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:52,027
He's not the type
who easily befriends people.

443
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:55,155
He's not naturally sociable.

444
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:57,824
He's only interested in himself.

445
00:26:57,907 --> 00:27:01,202
He's just interested in her
because she's a celebrity.

446
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:04,914
Since he's become famous,
he's enjoying himself.

447
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:08,501
He shouldn't have revealed himself.
Why did he have to do that?

448
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:11,046
Deep down, he sought attention.

449
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:13,423
You're the one
who persuaded him to do that.

450
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:15,800
Why did he have to be persuaded?

451
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,056
What is it?

452
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:24,184
You've been talking incessantly
about him for five blocks.

453
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,772
What should we have?
Are you craving anything?

454
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:31,024
That wasn't a smooth transition.
How suspicious.

455
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,734
How about Korean food?

456
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,530
-What? Hello.
-Mr. Choi.

457
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:38,615
Hey, guys.

458
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:41,409
What did you order so much?
It's double the usual.

459
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,495
We've had a lot more customers lately.

460
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,997
-Let me.
-It's fine.

461
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,583
Mr. Choi, your back will give out.

462
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:50,251
My back is just fine.

463
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:54,589
Where is Ung? He hasn't been picking up.

464
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:56,257
Should I call him over?

465
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,343
-It's fine.
-Hey, Yeon-su.

466
00:27:58,426 --> 00:27:59,761
-Hello.
-Gosh.

467
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,388
Why did you call Ji-ung for help?

468
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:04,140
Gosh. Did I call you guys?

469
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,725
We were just passing by.
It won't take long.

470
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,811
Ji-ung, you're so wonderful.

471
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,313
-Thank you.
-Let me help.

472
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:11,481
-No.
-It's okay.

473
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:12,857
-They're really heavy.
-Go.

474
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,275
Did you eat?

475
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,069
Not yet. We were about to eat.

476
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:17,320
Then eat here.

477
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:21,699
Goodness. Aren't you Ji-ung's mom?
It's been ages.

478
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:24,285
I haven't seen you in so long.

479
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,829
Goodness. Hello.

480
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:28,206
I hadn't seen you in ages,
so I was worried.

481
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:30,166
-Have you been well?
-Of course.

482
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,460
You must have been grocery shopping.

483
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,963
-Come inside if you haven't eaten yet.
-Come in.

484
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,589
-Yeon-su.
-Yes?

485
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:39,050
I'm sorry, but I don't think
I can eat with you.

486
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,135
You should eat here.

487
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,972
Wait.

488
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:47,434
Goodness. Ji-ung, aren't you going to eat?

489
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:48,852
All right.

490
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:50,520
Goodbye.

491
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:51,688
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

492
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:54,065
-He should have just eaten here.
-Bye.

493
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,198
Is there something you want to say?

494
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,369
You should come home.

495
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,872
Don't sleep elsewhere.

496
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,418
Or do I need to leave?

497
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,712
You're going to leave anyway.

498
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,845
I have a favor.

499
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:28,516
I really care about those people,

500
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:32,353
so I don't want to show them
this side of me.

501
00:29:35,773 --> 00:29:37,192
Be your usual self.

502
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,695
Ignore them and go on your way.

503
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,466
This is a side of you I've never seen.

504
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:06,054
-Sorry?
-I didn't expect you to know how to drive.

505
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:10,308
-I like it.
-What? You startled me.

506
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:11,851
You should choose your words carefully.

507
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:14,187
Gosh.

508
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:17,565
I see. That's not what I meant.

509
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,275
I like driving.

510
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:22,570
It's just that Eun-ho usually drives,

511
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:26,241
and I rarely have to travel far.

512
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:30,161
I wanted to have a blast today.

513
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,705
I'm sorry we keep being chased around
because of me.

514
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:35,250
Everyone seems to recognize you.

515
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,919
What do you do when you're alone?

516
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,630
Let's see…
Do I need to do be doing something?

517
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,757
I enjoy doing nothing.

518
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:44,884
Then what did you do yesterday?

519
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:47,679
Well…

520
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:49,764
I…

521
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,480
I really don't want to have to do this

522
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:00,233
but can I ask you something?

523
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:04,946
What's going on between you and Ms. Kook?

524
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:11,327
Do you mean in the past or now?

525
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:13,496
Both.

526
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,708
In the past,

527
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:19,419
I really liked her.

528
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:23,298
I didn't know I could be
that madly in love with someone.

529
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,177
And now…

530
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,056
we've decided to be friends.

531
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:36,311
How does it feel
to love someone that much?

532
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,146
I'm curious.

533
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:42,775
How could you still talk like that
even when you've broken up?

534
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,405
No. Never mind.

535
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:49,782
Don't answer that.
I'm not curious anymore.

536
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,537
I think we're here.

537
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,956
Yes. Turn left over there.

538
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,890
Thank you for dropping me off.

539
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:16,184
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

540
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,769
Wait.

541
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:21,564
Don't take to heart what happened today.

542
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,274
Rest up.

543
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:27,737
Wait.

544
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:31,574
It'd be a shame
to end my free day like this.

545
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:35,328
-But there's nowhere we can--
-Do you want to come up?

546
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:58,017
I'm not saying this because it bothers me.

547
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,978
I'm just curious.

548
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:03,064
What are they up to?

549
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,192
Friends?

550
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:08,820
It's not like they went to school together
or worked together.

551
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:11,656
How can they be friends
when they share no memories?

552
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:17,495
They can't still be together, right?

553
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,164
If he had lunch outside,

554
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:22,583
shouldn't he have dinner at home?

555
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:27,255
Gosh, that's cold!

556
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:29,382
-Gosh.
-You wench!

557
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:30,550
Oh, dear.

558
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:33,136
What are you trying to do to me?

559
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:35,722
It's okay. It wasn't much.

560
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,265
What do you mean?

561
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,684
It feels as if I've been drenched.

562
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:42,645
-You're not.
-Where has your mind wandered off to?

563
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:44,856
It's because you were dozing off.

564
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:47,191
Lift your head up. Okay?

565
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:53,865
That really hurt my pride.

566
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,242
Look, NJ.

567
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,120
I think I should just go home.

568
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:04,333
Why are you being so serious
about declining my offer?

569
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:06,961
Because you had asked so politely.

570
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,629
I wasn't polite at all.

571
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,758
It was just a thought
that crossed my mind.

572
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:15,261
You taking it so seriously
is making me feel embarrassed.

573
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,388
Anyway, I'm sorry.

574
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:20,057
I said that wasn't necessary.

575
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,560
You know you're being ridiculous, right?

576
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:24,562
Was I asking you to date me or something?

577
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:28,858
I didn't want to say goodbye yet,
so I thought we could go up and chat.

578
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:30,443
This is just how I am.

579
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:32,361
It takes me time to warm up to people.

580
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:33,905
I mean,

581
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:36,866
it's already been a month.
How much slower do we need to go?

582
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:40,328
He's going to stay
as my crush forever at this rate.

583
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:47,543
Well…

584
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,714
Having a crush doesn't sound too bad.

585
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:57,136
I'll take my time.

586
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:58,930

548 LIKES

588
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:02,809
I saw the famous NJ.

589
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:05,436
I asked her for a photo,

590
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,896
She does have an awful temper.

591
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:09,315
And is she really that pretty?

592
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:11,192
So the rumors are true.

593
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,860
-It's just a lousy photo.

594
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,904
-It's all plastic surgery.

595
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:16,197
She should know

596
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,038
I left something at your place.

597
00:35:24,121 --> 00:35:26,123
I need to get it right now.

598
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,253
It's something super precious to me.

599
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:51,691
As a friend, I can ask him
what he's up to.

600
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:58,656
You have a crush on him.

601
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:01,993
That's not true.

602
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:03,494
Are you almost done?

603
00:36:11,168 --> 00:36:14,881
This isn't…

604
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:18,301
What is this?

605
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:22,013
What is all this?

606
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:27,977
Who puts a zucchini this big
in their soup?

607
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,313
What is the matter with you today?

608
00:36:31,188 --> 00:36:34,275
What in the world have you done?

609
00:37:09,226 --> 00:37:10,478
This is bad.

610
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,233
I guess I was wrong.

611
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:20,404
I do have a crush on him.

612
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:34,585
Is this yours?

613
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,047
Yes, it is.

614
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,052
Was this
the super precious pouch of yours?

615
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,013
Is this why you came?

616
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:51,519
Well, you said
it was really precious to you.

617
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:55,648
Is that it?

618
00:37:58,484 --> 00:37:59,777
So…

619
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:04,949
I don't think…

620
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,662
he's ever left my mind, not even once.

621
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:22,591
You know what?

622
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:28,097
I…

623
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,391
I think…

624
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,226
Who is that?

625
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,715
I haven't seen you in years.

626
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,009
So why did you suddenly show up?

627
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:07,344
Grandma.

628
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:09,805
You're the one who invited him inside.

629
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:13,059
He said he hadn't eaten yet.
I should feed him.

630
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:17,188
What are you doing? Eat up.

631
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:23,611
So? Are you two dating again?

632
00:39:25,362 --> 00:39:29,158
Grandma. Just let him eat in peace.

633
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:31,577
And we're just friends.

634
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,162
Friends, my foot.

635
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:35,748
Were you that desperate for a friend?

636
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:40,252
Eat up, will you?

637
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:41,378
Yes, ma'am.

638
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,881
Look at him nibbling on the food.

639
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:46,634
-Is it not good?
-It's delicious.

640
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,136
Hey. Slow down.

641
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:53,432
How desperate are you
to be friends with your ex?

642
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:56,393
That boy is much better. Ji-ung.

643
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:01,607
He's well-behaved and cute.

644
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:06,070
On the other hand, look at him.
He's useless.

645
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,447
Hey, I'm sorry.

646
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,909
You know she likes to
bad-mouth people openly.

647
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:17,039
Isn't anyone feeding you at home?

648
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:19,542
You seem to be skinnier now.

649
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:24,713
So tell me. Do you have a decent job?

650
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:26,674
Well…

651
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,970
Answer me, will you?

652
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:34,098
I can see that you're still so bashful.

653
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:37,434
Grandma, stop scolding him.

654
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:40,604
Why are you being so harsh to him?

655
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:43,065
How can I be nice
to someone who made you cry?

656
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:45,276
I'd love to give him a good beating.

657
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:06,380
Hey. This won't do. You should just go.

658
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:10,176
It must be uncomfortable for you.
You should go.

659
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:12,011
I apologize for her behavior.

660
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:15,097
I should still eat.

661
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:34,408
Make sure you have the side dishes too.

662
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:35,743
Yes, ma'am.

663
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:50,883
Gosh, look at this belly.

664
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:52,718
It might burst.

665
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:56,013
You shouldn't have eaten so much.
You had two bowls of rice.

666
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:58,140
She gave me more soup if I had rice left

667
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,267
and vice versa. I had no choice.

668
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,811
This is the most I've eaten this year.

669
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:05,648
She's still the same.

670
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,692
She still scares me straight.

671
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,287
Bye.

672
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,623
Bye.

673
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:27,920
Hey, Ung.

674
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:31,590
I…

675
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:34,635
Thanks.

676
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:37,721
For what?

677
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:41,809
Well…

678
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:46,689
For bringing my pouch back.

679
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,025
See?

680
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:53,862
We can be friends.

681
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:18,762
Grandma, let me do it.

682
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:20,514
Okay.

683
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:24,018
Did he leave?

684
00:43:24,601 --> 00:43:25,519
Yes.

685
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:29,440
Gosh. He should have stayed longer.

686
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:31,025
Why didn't he?

687
00:43:31,608 --> 00:43:33,819
How could he
when you were giving him an earful?

688
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:36,447
I thought you wanted him gone.

689
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:38,782
That's not true.

690
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,411
But it's true
that he gave you a hard time.

691
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:47,041
I didn't know you saw me crying.

692
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:50,544
You were secretly crying for days on end.

693
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,338
How could I have not noticed that?

694
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:56,050
Thinking about it again
makes my blood boil.

695
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:59,970
That scumbag. I should have been harsher.

696
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:33,087
I was the one who dumped him.

697
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,549
I abandoned him.

698
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,220
What?

699
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:47,267
It was my fault.

700
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:50,854
I was selfish.

701
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:54,274
Yeon-su.

702
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:57,194
Grandma.

703
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:01,740
I still have feelings for him.

704
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:07,204
Although I abandoned him…

705
00:45:07,704 --> 00:45:09,331
I was the one who let him go,

706
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:11,583
but I…

707
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:14,878
I still like him.

708
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:19,133
So…

709
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:22,386
scold me instead.

710
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:27,182
Tell me I was stupid and cruel.

711
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:29,518
Scold me.

712
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:33,480
Ask me why I did something I would regret.

713
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:37,151
Please…

714
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:39,361
Please scold me.

715
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:42,156
Yeon-su…

716
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:45,742
What should I do?

717
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:53,000
I don't want to be friends with Ung.

718
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:55,544
I can't.

719
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:00,340
But I guess he can.

720
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:04,761
What should I do?

721
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:18,025
My poor puppy.

722
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:28,428
Ms. Kook's eyes are still swollen.

723
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:33,517
Speaking from experience, she probably
cried for at least five hours.

724
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:39,314
I'm so exhausted.
I really am. I want to go home.

725
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:42,442
It's such a lazy afternoon.

726
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:45,279
Let's have some coffee
to help us stay awake.

727
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:46,905
-Nice.
-Right?

728
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:48,490
Let's do a draw
to see who will pay for it.

729
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:49,825
-Yes?
-All right.

730
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:51,743
Let's go. Get it ready.

731
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:56,206
Ms. Kook.

732
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:02,212
Did you see her eyes?

733
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:04,548
What's wrong with her?

734
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,842
Did you see her eyes?

735
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:11,388
You look so different.

736
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:13,724
A carp. She looks like a carp.

737
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:17,686
Did you cry last night or something?

738
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:20,188
If that's not it,
how could she look like this?

739
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:21,440
I didn't cry.

740
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:25,068
It's a sty.

741
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:27,654
-What?
-A sty.

742
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:31,491
It's a sty, sir.

743
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:37,914
It's a sty.

744
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:40,751
-It's a sty.
-I knew it.

745
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:42,711
It's a sty. I told you so.

746
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:44,504
Since she has a sty,

747
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,840
let's all focus and do a good job.

748
00:48:46,923 --> 00:48:48,383
-Yes, sir.
-You can do it.

749
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:49,968
-What about the draw?
-Skip it.

750
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:52,304
-Yes, sir.
-It's a sty.

751
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:16,244
Goodness. What brings you
all the way here to relax?

752
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:19,206
No reason. It just felt weird
to be home alone.

753
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:21,249
You were always alone in that house.

754
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:25,337
So why did you even move out?
I told you to move back in.

755
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:29,049
Gosh. I'm not coming back
no matter what you say to me.

756
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:31,510
What if I ask you to?

757
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:33,512
I could be a little swayed.

758
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:36,932
Gosh, what a traitor.

759
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:39,059
You don't deserve to sit on my bench. Go.

760
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:40,769
No, you go.

761
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:42,604
Fine. What a traitor.

762
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:45,107
-Ung.
-Yes?

763
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:47,901
Ask Ji-ung if he's having dinner outside.

764
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:50,570
If not, tell him to come over
since I've made him a delicious meal.

765
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:53,240
We spoke earlier,
and he'll be working late.

766
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:56,118
He always pretends
to be busy when he's not.

767
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:57,994
Really? That's not good.

768
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:00,080
He needs to have a proper meal today.

769
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:04,042
Then I'll pack his dinner.
Can you drop it off?

770
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:08,213
Come on.
Just call a delivery man. I'll pay for it.

771
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:11,383
Don't be ridiculous.
You're not doing anything anyway.

772
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:13,343
Gosh, I can't be bothered.

773
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:15,053
Tell him to come late and eat.

774
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:17,764
Not today. Hurry and get ready.

775
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:20,308
Gosh.

776
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:32,487
You should go home tonight.

777
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:34,614
I've left the house.

778
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:42,748
Ji-ung, are you going to the editing room?

779
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,334
Ji-ung.

780
00:50:48,044 --> 00:50:49,921
-Yes?
-Are you going to the editing room?

781
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:52,674
Yes.

782
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:55,761
What? Right. Can you leave this there?

783
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:58,472
I'm going to go home, wash up,
and change my clothes.

784
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:00,307
Did you spend the night here again?

785
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:01,516
Yes.

786
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:04,728
Please do that for me. I'll be back.

787
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:31,106
Look who's here!

788
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:33,900
-Ung!
-Hello, Mr. Park.

789
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:36,236
Gosh. Look at you.

790
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,989
You haven't changed one bit!

791
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:41,825
I saw the footage,
and you really hadn't changed.

792
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:43,535
You still look like you're in high school.

793
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:46,705
You still look like
you're in your thirties.

794
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:48,582
I am in my thirties.

795
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:52,377
Exactly. You look like it.

796
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:53,670
I see.

797
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:57,507
Why are you here?
Are you here to see Ji-ung?

798
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:59,009
Where is he?

799
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:01,887
He and Chae-ran are practically living
in the editing room.

800
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,930
-Follow me. I'll take you there.
-Okay.

801
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:07,225
Gosh. I see that you've really made it.

802
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:09,853
Even though you had
the lowest grades in school,

803
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:13,106
I saw your potential
when I saw your drawings.

804
00:53:13,189 --> 00:53:15,901
-Gosh. How are your parents doing?
-They're doing well.

805
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:19,237
Chae-ran. Where's Ji-ung?

806
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:22,824
He just left to stop by his house.

807
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:24,576
I see. Is he coming back?

808
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,746
He said it won't take long.
He'll be back soon.

809
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:29,581
Is that so?

810
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:32,918
Ung, wait here. Ji-ung will be back soon.

811
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:34,377
-Okay.
-Good.

812
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:36,296
Chae-ran, come out for a minute.

813
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:37,839
-I have something to say.
-Okay.

814
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:44,471
Gosh.

815
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,266
What?

816
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:56,608
What do I need to press?

817
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:12,791
Exactly how slow do I need to be?

818
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:14,334
MR. CHOI UNG

819
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:17,128
Should I call or not?

820
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:25,971
Hello?

821
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:28,348
What?

822
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,227
Okay. I'll check.

823
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:38,775
Please pick up this time around.

824
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:45,198
Gosh. I can't believe
my eyes are still red.

825
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:48,410
I'm never going to cry again.

826
00:54:58,086 --> 00:55:00,547
-What is it?
-Are you still working?

827
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:03,550
No, I clocked out on the dot.

828
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,927
Well… Are you okay?

829
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:07,470
What do you mean?

830
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:09,639
Did you not read the news?

831
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:12,017
About what?

832
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:15,270
It's about NJ's dating rumor.

833
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:16,688
Ji-ung?

834
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:17,981
The thing is…

835
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:19,649
-Hold on.
-Ung--

836
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:22,152
It is you.

837
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:24,738
Are you headed home?

838
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:28,450
You must have left work early.

839
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:37,250
I'm in a hurry,
so I should get going. Goodbye.

840
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:48,428
Did something happen?

841
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:53,349
Yeon-su.

842
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:56,019
Yes?

843
00:55:57,228 --> 00:55:58,438
Today's my birthday.

844
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:01,858
Oh, really?

845
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:05,862
Happy birthday. Had I known sooner,
I would have treated you to a meal.

846
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:10,492
My mom came by
and prepared a birthday meal.

847
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,703
She's the woman I saw before, right?

848
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:17,749
That was my first time seeing her.
She's really beautiful.

849
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,462
She still doesn't know…

850
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:28,134
that I'm allergic to peaches.

851
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:35,141
One time…

852
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:39,187
I almost died…

853
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:44,567
in front of her after eating a peach.

854
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:48,279
But I guess she still doesn't know.

855
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:52,492
Hey. Ji-ung…

856
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:01,417
Are you okay?

857
00:57:04,045 --> 00:57:05,922
Or is it that she doesn't want to know?

858
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:35,994

EPILOGUE
NOVEMBER, 2010

860
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:56,055
Why are you standing here?

861
00:57:57,932 --> 00:58:00,059
Can I sleep over at your house today?

862
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:02,187
Sure, you can.

863
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:25,084
Isn't it much warmer now?

864
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:30,715
How can he do that?

865
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:33,092
-Unbelievable.
-I know, right?

866
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:36,346
-Are you sleepy?
-No.

867
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:52,362
THE PREVIOUS NIGHT

868
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:55,865
Shouldn't you be working?

869
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:57,951
Gosh.

870
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:03,790
Tell me.

871
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:05,625
About what?

872
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,752
I'm all ears, so spill.

873
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:14,968
My mom came by.

874
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:24,978
She came unannounced again.

875
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:31,818
Judging by the size of her suitcase,
I think she'll be here for a week.

876
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:35,947
She'll act as if
she'll be staying with me.

877
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:39,033
Then she'll vanish again.

878
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:43,746
Gosh. How many times has she done this?

879
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:48,459
She even made breakfast this morning.

880
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:49,836
I can't believe her.

881
00:59:55,550 --> 01:00:02,557
HELLO, MY SOUL MATE

882
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:27,999
She's pretty, but she's not Ung's type.

883
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:31,794
What's the probability of your ex

884
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:33,171
in your lifetime?

885
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:35,256
Someone told me

886
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,842
that everything I shoot
is full of emotions.

887
01:00:38,926 --> 01:00:42,096
About how you wanted us to be friends…

888
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:44,015
I don't think I can do that.

889
01:00:44,098 --> 01:00:45,475
You're drunk.

890
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:49,312
I don't think I can ever face

891
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:52,190
The two of you…

892
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:54,942
As you've read in the articles,

893
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:57,236
we're seeing each other.

894
01:00:59,113 --> 01:01:04,118
