1
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:52,260
Dating is like

2
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:54,679
living in a different world.

3
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,141
Dating Yeon-su

4
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,477
is especially

5
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:03,313
a completely different world for me.

6
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:08,026
Ung!

7
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:08,943
What?

8
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:10,820
What is it?

9
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,239
What's going on?

10
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:19,245
-Why did you call me?
-It's bedtime.

11
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,413
What?

12
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,541
It's only 10 p.m. I can't sleep now.

13
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:29,964
I drank all the jujube tea.
Where did you get this?

14
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:33,468
-Is there a well of it in my house?
-Drink up and go to bed.

15
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:37,680
I can't sleep at this hour.
Even kids don't sleep this early.

16
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,766
Should I sleep over too?

17
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:49,567
We should sleep since it's dark.

18
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:52,278
It's dangerous
to be out and about at this hour.

19
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,449
Let's go to bed.

20
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:00,578
No!

21
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,163
-Wake up!
-Jeez.

22
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,791
Do you want me to sleep or not?
Make a choice.

23
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:07,460
You can't sleep at night
because you sleep in the morning.

24
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:10,338
You have to endure this
to get back a normal sleep cycle.

25
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:11,464
Run!

26
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:14,801
But as you know,

27
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:18,012
that world doesn't really suit me.

28
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:21,141
What can I do though?

29
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,268
The bus is here. See you.

30
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:24,727
Wait, Yeon-su!

31
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:29,691
Bye!

32
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,234
-Yeon-su.
-Yes?

33
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,154
Bye.

34
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:48,543
What are you doing?

35
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,379
I just came home after work.

36
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:53,673
You got off work late.
Did you have dinner?

37
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:57,051
Yes, I ate at the place you recommended
and it was really good.

38
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,137
-Let's go there next time.
-Okay.

39
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,931
Back then and even now…

40
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,858
I want to keep living in this world.

41
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,612
Forever,

42
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:17,572
without an end.

43
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:19,991
Let's break up.

44
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,743
You're the only thing

45
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:23,953
I can throw away.

46
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,538
Why are you doing this?

47
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,333
Why do we have to break up?

48
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,051
Those are useless thoughts.

49
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,014
LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE

50
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,435
I have to be more cautious
at a time like this.

51
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:48,603
THE LIKELIHOOD OF STAYING IN
A RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR EX

52
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:51,564
Because misfortune always comes
disguised as happiness.

53
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,905
"Couples who fight often have
a higher chance of dating again."

54
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:06,120
"But they think they will
still be the same after they do

55
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,123
and have lower expectations
of each other."

56
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:12,043
"To maintain your relationship,

57
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:16,130
you must show your partner
a new side of you

58
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:20,677
to break such expectations."

59
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:26,516
I shouldn't lower my guard because
it seems like everything's going okay.

60
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,646
So I believe I need to prepare myself
for possible risks.

61
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,482
"A new side…"

62
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,484
I went through so much to get here.

63
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,114
I can't repeat the same mistakes.

64
00:04:55,795 --> 00:05:00,967
EPISODE 13

65
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,600
I want to stay with you.

66
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:11,811
Come here.

67
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:24,574
What do we do about him?

68
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,368
I'll take care of it. Go to work.

69
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:28,703
What will you do?

70
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,872
Is there a brick anywhere?

71
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,916
Take care of this quietly
so there's no fuss.

72
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,252
-Bye.
-Bye.

73
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,804
What…

74
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:52,185
Hey, inhale through your nose
and exhale through your mouth.

75
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:57,523
That's right.

76
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,486
What was that?

77
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:03,196
It just happened.

78
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:04,739
"It just happened"?

79
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,365
Don't overreact.

80
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:10,620
Wait, since when? How long has it been?

81
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,998
So you didn't let me come
to your house because…

82
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,043
No, forget all that.

83
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:19,420
Who knows about this? Does Ji-ung know?

84
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,007
Then what about Sol-i?

85
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,134
She probably knows.

86
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:30,056
-What about your parents?
-They know.

87
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,476
-But is that important?
-I'm so disappointed.

88
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,355
I'm very disappointed.
How could you not tell only me?

89
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,023
How could you?

90
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,818
-Are you crying?
-How could you do this to me?

91
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:45,238
-No way!
-Is he crazy? Wait, Eun-ho!

92
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,366
Good morning.

93
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,909
-Hi, Ms. Kook.
-Good morning.

94
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:00,711
Failed to deal with Eun-ho.
I'll wait for my next chance.

95
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:10,513
Oh, Mr. Bang.

96
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,099
Do you have good news?

97
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,393
No, nothing.

98
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,728
It seems like there is.

99
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,690
Why are you whispering though?

100
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,902
There's a terrible rumor
going around these days.

101
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:28,156
What rumor?

102
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:31,325
That you're dating someone.

103
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,125
Says who?

104
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,921
It's all right. Don't get worked up.

105
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:48,426
This rumor is so terrible
that I told everyone it wasn't true.

106
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,136
"Ms. Kook would never do that."

107
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:53,431
"She doesn't have any love for humanity."

108
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,391
"She's not human." I told everyone that.

109
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,811
That's not why I'm here though.

110
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,732
I got a call from Soen
about the documentary you were shooting.

111
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:06,068
They asked if they could see
the footage you have before it airs.

112
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,029
And I'm curious too.

113
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:12,074
-We must be in quite a lot, right?
-All right. I'll ask.

114
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,744
When does it start airing again?
Isn't it soon?

115
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:19,123
Oh, and I was interviewed for it.

116
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,167
Tell them never to edit it out

117
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,920
and just air it as is, okay?

118
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:26,797
Cool.

119
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,020
KIM JI-UNG

120
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,568
The person you have called cannot…

121
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:54,075
HOW IS EDITING GOING?

122
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,371
I guess he's busy.

123
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,794
I've never seen him like that before.

124
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:05,878
It feels as if

125
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:07,630
he has changed.

126
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,507
I thought he'd never change.

127
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,426
END OF FIRST DRAFT
PREVIEW TO BE ADDED

128
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:18,724
Mr. Kim.

129
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,645
You've found your direction.

130
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,983
This is great for a first draft.

131
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,404
I knew you'd do well.

132
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,864
I'll fix the last narration part.
I don't like it.

133
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,032
All right.

134
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:39,203
But they haven't changed at all.
They still seem so young and lively.

135
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:42,999
There's some tension between them too.
I'm curious about the next episode.

136
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,834
I'm really satisfied with this.

137
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,252
That's a relief.

138
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,963
Stop asking to see it now.

139
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,172
Fine.

140
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,634
Is it normal for the team leader
to beg his team member to see his work?

141
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,219
Do you think that's normal?

142
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,014
It's ridiculous.

143
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,141
All right, what are you
all doing after work?

144
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:03,185
We should celebrate
since the first draft is finished.

145
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,520
I have to work.

146
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,773
What's so urgent? Let's go have some fun!

147
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,192
Should a team leader be
saying that? I'm off.

148
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,244
Is he okay?

149
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,413
What?

150
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,290
Did you see his eyes?

151
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,959
He seems to have lost his mind.

152
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:31,714
Make sure he eats his meals properly.

153
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:34,800
You should eat well
when you're in pain inside.

154
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,386
I'll make sure he eats well.

155
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:42,016
Hey, you should take care of me.
I feel lonely these days.

156
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,976
It's as if I'm a ghost
haunting this place.

157
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,647
And what do you mean?
He looks absolutely fine.

158
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,732
He's not the only one who's busy.
We all are!

159
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,192
EDITING ROOM

160
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:22,181
What's the new special documentary about?

161
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:24,642
Next year is
the tenth anniversary of my debut.

162
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:28,646
So I'm preparing
a special video for my fans.

163
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:30,815
So it's been ten years already.

164
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:34,151
You must feel so many emotions right now.

165
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,862
Yes, I do.

166
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,698
It gave me a lot to think about.

167
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:45,037
Lastly, I believe many people
are curious about this--

168
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,080
The scandal?

169
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,083
This may be a sensitive topic,

170
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:52,795
but could you reveal anything about that
to the viewers of Litte

171
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,964
who are watching this show live right now?

172
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,508
Sure. Why not?

173
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,762
Are you really dating him right now?

174
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,849
No, we're not dating.

175
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:07,435
But I like him.

176
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,897
-Pardon?
-Of course, as a fan.

177
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,901
At first, he said that he was my fan.

178
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,154
But now I'm a fan of his.

179
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,489
So I wanted to become his friend,

180
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:24,493
but I feel like we've grown distant
since the article was released.

181
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:30,291
So everyone, please don't make
wild speculations about us.

182
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:31,792
Please.

183
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,212
NJ is just a victim in all this.

184
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:37,256
It's because of that traitor.

185
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:38,966
Just pick a side, will you?

186
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:42,136
If you're going to be angry at me,
do it at home. Why are you here?

187
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:46,265
I have to work, so I'm putting up
with breathing the same air as you.

188
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,810
How are the preparations
for your exhibition going?

189
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,813
I got a lot done.
Have you ever see me behind schedule?

190
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,860
But where are you even looking?

191
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,821
-Who knows?
-What?

192
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,782
You could neglect your drawings
since you're dating now.

193
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,036
-Stop that.
-Can you even focus on work?

194
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,872
You neglect everything when you're dating.

195
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,540
-Eun-ho, are you--
-I just don't get why

196
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,460
you're seeing Yeon-su again.

197
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:15,377
What?

198
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,130
You were in so much pain.
Do you want to go through it again?

199
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:21,008
Did you forget how many times
you've been through this?

200
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:23,886
Should I remind you
how bad things got each time?

201
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,514
I don't want to see you
go through that again.

202
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:37,441
What?

203
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:39,527
What do you want?

204
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:46,450
Come on.

205
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:50,788
It wasn't that bad.
It's fine. I'll take care of myself.

206
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:54,542
You were just going to do whatever
without telling me.

207
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,001
I'm sorry about that.

208
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,462
But I…

209
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,175
I'm just in such a good mood these days.

210
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,679
I'm so happy right now.
What else can I do?

211
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,977
You disgust me.

212
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:16,897
Anyway, it's different this time.

213
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,607
I won't be like that again, okay?

214
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,782
I'm hungry.

215
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:28,701
Should we eat?

216
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,205
Do you want to talk about work?

217
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:40,170
Should we talk about that raise
you mentioned last time?

218
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:45,676
Raise?

219
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:56,520
Anyway, I'm going to be watching
the two of you.

220
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,609
-I want a 30 percent raise.
-What?

221
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,154
Then 25 percent.

222
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,409
Twenty.

223
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,513
Did you eat?

224
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,558
Yes. You should eat too.

225
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:38,604
UNG

226
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,064
-What are you doing?
-I'm in a meeting.

227
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,649
-I was about to eat.
-Okay.

228
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:42,650
Did you finish work?

229
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,276
Not yet. Leaving soon.

230
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,277
YES, OKAY, NOT TODAY

231
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,656
Were my replies too short?

232
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,908
YOUR NEW SIDE

233
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:55,204
I need to talk to more people
to find this new side of mine.

234
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:58,248
Dating? It's no big deal.

235
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,751
If a man and a woman like each other,
they date,

236
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:03,253
and then they kiss,

237
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,505
and then…

238
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:11,470
Make eye contact,

239
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:12,930
and say, "I love you."

240
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,475
No, that's not a good example.

241
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:21,105
Did you enjoy your lunch, Ms. Kook?

242
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:22,731
Oh, yes.

243
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:32,908
Ye-in.

244
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:33,993
Yes?

245
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,704
-Do you have a boyfriend?
-Me?

246
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:41,166
No, why? Is there someone
you want to introduce to me?

247
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,294
Then have you dated before?

248
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,631
Of course I have.

249
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,049
A lot.

250
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,593
Then…

251
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:56,181
were you good at dating?

252
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:01,520
It might seem weird to say so myself,

253
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:04,398
but if the company evaluated me
for my past relationships,

254
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:08,193
I'd be the CEO here.

255
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,946
-I see.
-But what's this about?

256
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,741
Well…

257
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,748
How exactly do you date?

258
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:27,296
You've come to the perfect person.

259
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:48,692
I'm getting off work soon.
Should we go on a date?

260
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,695
Okay. I'll pick you up. wait there.

261
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:24,895
Hi.

262
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:29,858
Oh, hi.

263
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,778
Your clothes have changed from earlier.

264
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:37,116
Oh, I accidentally spilled something
so I bought a new outfit.

265
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,952
You must have spilled a lot.

266
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,287
-Let's go.
-Okay.

267
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:57,094
First, visual stimulation
is very important.

268
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,680
You have to style yourself
differently every now and then

269
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:03,559
to create a tension
that isn't usually there.

270
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:22,786
It would have been more effective
to just hit Eun-ho with a brick.

271
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,247
It was so hard dealing with his sulking.

272
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:29,084
And this is very, very important.

273
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:33,505
Your reaction. Guys are crazy about
people who give great reactions.

274
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:36,258
I was able to date so many guys
just with my reactions.

275
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,844
React to whatever he does.
And smile a lot.

276
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:41,930
What reason does he have to sulk?

277
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,141
Sometimes he's so weird.

278
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,976
-He must like me so much--
-Oh!

279
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,146
-Really?
-What? Yes.

280
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,191
It's so funny.

281
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:53,859
What is?

282
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:56,612
What?

283
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,238
-What?
-What?

284
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,993
And compliment him
as many times as you can.

285
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,330
Hey, you're a really good driver…

286
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,498
Sorry about that.

287
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,418
What did you say? I missed that.

288
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,753
It's nothing.

289
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:19,176
They love being complimented,
even for the smallest things.

290
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,721
You have really large hands.

291
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,306
What? That's so random.

292
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,183
They're so big.

293
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,101
They're huge.

294
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:29,770
I see.

295
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:32,856
Right.

296
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:50,499
Are you sure about this?

297
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:51,917
You like Korean food better.

298
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,921
Well, sometimes I crave food like this.

299
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:00,634
I begged you for a month to go eat pasta
when we were in university.

300
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:03,387
-We never did in the end.
-Did I do that?

301
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,890
Well, people's tastes change.

302
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:08,642
Oh, right.

303
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,562
-Let me cut this for you.
-No, I'll do it. It's closer to me.

304
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,106
Let me do it.

305
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:25,617
And never nag him, Ms. Kook!

306
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:28,954
Men despise nagging.

307
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:32,916
I'm sorry.

308
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,502
Excuse me, can I get a wet towel?

309
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:38,672
No, it's fine. I'll wipe it off.

310
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:43,468
I'm really sorry.
Are you sure it'll come off?

311
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,345
It's fine. I'll get it dry cleaned.

312
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,347
How did this happen?

313
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,849
I told you I'd…

314
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:52,561
I mean, I should have put this here.

315
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,147
It was my bad.

316
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,653
-Ung.
-Yes?

317
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:04,323
-Eat up. Here.
-Okay.

318
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:07,909
-Is it good?
-Yes.

319
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:29,056
What are you thinking?

320
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:33,351
It's been a long time since we walked
like this instead of running.

321
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:35,145
What?

322
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:40,275
We always ran because you thought
walking without a purpose

323
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:42,527
was inefficient.

324
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,739
-Did I do that?
-Yes.

325
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,326
I bet we're the only ones
who ran around Deoksugung Palace.

326
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:53,830
I guess I really was obsessed
with efficiency back then.

327
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:55,373
I sound like a mess.

328
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,293
You were cool though.

329
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,047
And lastly…

330
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:05,217
Keep making things romantic.

331
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,010
Dating is all about

332
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:09,304
having butterflies.

333
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:19,940
This place is practically deserted.

334
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:23,652
You're right.
It's not even that late though.

335
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,530
How can this place be so empty?

336
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,619
What…

337
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,384
Why did you hit me?

338
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,638
-What are you doing, Yeon-su?
-What do you mean?

339
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:55,058
What has gotten into you today?
What's this character you're playing?

340
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:58,520
You've been acting weird all day.

341
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:00,856
What are you plotting?

342
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:03,316
I'm not plotting anything.

343
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,027
-I was making an effort.
-What effort?

344
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,614
I'm trying to make
this relationship work out.

345
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:10,657
What?

346
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:13,743
Can't you see I'm trying to change

347
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,829
so we'll stop fighting like before?

348
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:18,081
Why do you have to do that?

349
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,916
So that we don't break up.

350
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,836
They say couples who fight
and break up often have

351
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,671
a higher chance of breaking up again.

352
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:27,799
And that they know each other so well
that they have no expectations.

353
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:29,759
Who says?

354
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:33,722
Dr. Yoo Yeong, human relationship
psychologist from Hankook University.

355
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,473
That person doesn't know you.

356
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,267
What?

357
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:40,228
There are people like you
who are different each time.

358
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,399
It feels new. Seeing you always feels new.

359
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:46,610
It feels new even though
we met yesterday and again today.

360
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:49,905
That's not what I mean.

361
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,865
Look, you're different again.

362
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:54,409
-You're different from three seconds ago.
-Stop.

363
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,537
I've never thought
that you were predictable.

364
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:00,624
If that was possible,
I would be the one with a Ph. D.

365
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:04,044
But still,

366
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:07,214
it felt like I was always nagging you

367
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:10,258
and starting fights,

368
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,927
so I was trying to stop that.

369
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:16,640
I just like you for who you are.

370
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:21,102
I like that you always have
new things to nag about.

371
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,608
But I don't want you nagging
about the same thing twice.

372
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,903
Always come up
with new things to nag about.

373
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,905
You mean it?

374
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:38,203
I guess I ruined our date.

375
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:39,579
We can start over.

376
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,207
Then we can do what you want now.

377
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,043
All right. Let's go.

378
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,594
Guide me to Hwiyeong-dong.

379
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,680
GUIDE ME TO HWIYEONG-DONG

380
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:59,933
Are we heading back?
Isn't there anything else you want to do?

381
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:01,101
There is.

382
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:18,493
-Is this what you wanted to do?
-Yes, I love this the most.

383
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:22,122
Going to a cozy neighborhood pub
in the cold weather

384
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:25,000
and chatting all night over some hot stew.

385
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,252
Me too. I love this the most too.

386
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:31,589
You two are ridiculous.

387
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:34,426
If you're going to be here all night
with a single dish,

388
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:37,679
at least give the owner a glance.

389
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:41,182
Sol-i, this is kind of spicy.
Ung can't eat spicy food.

390
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,892
Ung is fine.

391
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:44,853
Ung can eat them now
since Yeon-su trained him.

392
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,772
-Should we get something that isn't spicy?
-Well, then…

393
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,316
Order whatever you want.

394
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,780
This is the first time
my customers made me want to puke.

395
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:59,117
You're doing a good job
holding it in, Sol-i.

396
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,201
You can do it.

397
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:03,330
Business isn't easy, you know.

398
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:04,539
You can do it, Sol-i.

399
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:17,177
-Do you want fish cakes?
-Yes.

400
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,386
Here you go.

401
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,390
-It's hot.
-It looks good.

402
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,309
Let's try this.

403
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,191
-Isn't it hot?
-Yes.

404
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,960
You startled me, Grandma.

405
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,879
What time did you come home last night?

406
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,423
I'm not sure.

407
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:56,716
You little brat!

408
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,722
Were you with Ung last night?

409
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:05,183
Well, yes.

410
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:08,269
But I didn't get home that late, Grandma.

411
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:11,398
Are you really going to go
to the finish line with him?

412
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:16,361
Go where? I'm staying right here with you.

413
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,780
Stop goofing around.

414
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:22,283
If you really like Ung that much,

415
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,077
bring him here.

416
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,913
You'll make him uncomfortable.

417
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:29,332
Last time, you totally bullied him.

418
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:33,628
I have to hear what he thinks
about your relationship.

419
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:35,964
Why are you so old-fashioned?

420
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,174
You're getting way ahead of yourself.

421
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:39,426
I'm taking a shower.

422
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:44,472
Oh, and don't even think
about going to see Ung.

423
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:47,225
I'll die of embarrassment if you do.

424
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:52,147
That brat.
How can she talk to me like that?

425
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:56,735
Right. You should head to work.
You'll be late.

426
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,945
Don't ever make me drink
on a weekday again.

427
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:02,699
Hey, you're the one who asked
to drink another bottle at the end.

428
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:04,826
Don't even mention last night.

429
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:08,788
-I should really get going now. Bye.
-Okay.

430
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:15,939
I saw the interview you did.

431
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,316
And the article that came out today.

432
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,487
I felt I should thank you
for being so considerate.

433
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,823
Thank you, NJ.

434
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:27,283
He's drawing a line between us again.

435
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:59,941
It took him days to text you,
and you're going to call him right away?

436
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,777
I'm better than that.

437
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:05,780
Let's just ignore it.

438
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,263
Darn it.

439
00:31:57,165 --> 00:32:00,126
Dad, why did you order so much cabbage?

440
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:02,629
Why do you think?

441
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:06,090
It's kimchi season.

442
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:09,636
Oh, right. I have a fever right now.

443
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:12,180
-I should go home and rest.
-Oh, all right.

444
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,598
Get some rest.

445
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:15,183
And come back tomorrow.

446
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:16,893
The cabbage arrives tomorrow.

447
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:20,605
Jeez. Are you making kimchi
for the entire neighborhood?

448
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,857
It's about time we stopped making so much.

449
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,525
And sell some of your restaurants.

450
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,570
If you keep going like this
you're bound to fail.

451
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:31,616
What are you talking about?
Business is thriving right now.

452
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:33,534
What will you do with all that money?

453
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,036
Will you take it all with you?

454
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,621
Like you told me to do,
I'll make a life for myself.

455
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,123
Don't worry, Ung.

456
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:42,794
I'll take every single cent with me.

457
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:45,672
Mom, do you agree with him?

458
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:48,132
Who do you think
should get the inheritance?

459
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:51,928
Well, I doubt it'll go to you.

460
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:56,349
What? I'm the only inheritor.
How can you not know?

461
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:59,727
I think we can trust Yeon-su
to take care of our fortune though.

462
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:04,065
Right. Yeon-su will do
a much better job than you.

463
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,608
That's right.

464
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:06,901
You're so harsh.

465
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,861
You mean you like Yeon-su more than me?

466
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:09,862
-Yes.
-Yes.

467
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:11,531
But that's too bad.

468
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,909
Yeon-su likes me.

469
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:19,872
I can't believe what I just heard.

470
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:22,542
I heard it too. That was close.

471
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:25,336
I nearly puked on my son's face.

472
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:30,967
Tell Yeon-su to come have dinner
when she gets off work.

473
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,051
No, wait.

474
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:34,387
She might feel pressured.

475
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:37,473
Right. She'll feel pressured
if we keep asking her over.

476
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,308
Should we pack her some side dishes?

477
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,519
She can have them with her grandmother.

478
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:43,604
No, we'll come together next time.

479
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,773
Yeon-su said
she wanted to eat your braised fish.

480
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,276
Really? Then tell me when you'll come.

481
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:51,112
I'll make sure it's fresh and delicious.

482
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,448
Should I go to the market tomorrow?

483
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:54,866
No, wait.

484
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:57,827
Should I bring her some side dishes?

485
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,918
Did she leave the lights on again?

486
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:10,214
LEEZAKAYA

487
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:15,178
Sol-i?

488
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:17,096
Are you here?

489
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:19,390
Who is it? Eun-ho?

490
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:21,225
Oh, you're here.

491
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:22,810
You said you'd be closed today.

492
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:26,481
Yes. I'm just here to organize some stuff.

493
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:27,690
What brings you here?

494
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:31,069
The lights were on
so I thought you forgot to turn them off.

495
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:33,446
Don't treat me like
I'm a forgetful grandma.

496
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:35,573
I don't forget things that often.

497
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:38,159
I turned off the lights for you
five times this month.

498
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:40,953
I appreciate that, but…

499
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:47,085
You're so rude.

500
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,253
How could you spit water
at the sight of me?

501
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:52,924
Why are you dressed like that, Sol-i?

502
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,593
No, repeat after me.

503
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:58,971
"Sol-i, why do you look
prettier than usual today?"

504
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:01,808
Are you going somewhere?

505
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:03,935
What's going on? You're scaring me.

506
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:07,688
I never thought my outfit
for the blind date would scare you.

507
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,732
A blind date? Why?

508
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,362
With who?

509
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,864
I don't know much. My dad's setting me up.

510
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,408
But he's handsome.

511
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:21,619
So it's fine.

512
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:26,457
If your dad's setting you up,
I guess he wants you to marry him.

513
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,543
It's nothing that serious.

514
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:34,215
It must be pretty awkward though.

515
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:37,677
Why? I think it'll be really fun.

516
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,263
Is it fun to eat with a stranger?

517
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:43,057
I love meeting strangers. It's so fun.

518
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,143
It'll be awkward.
You won't have much to talk about.

519
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:49,438
Well, this actually suits me perfectly.

520
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:52,233
I have such great conversations
with people I've just met.

521
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,986
The conversation flows naturally.

522
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,493
Your mouth again.

523
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:06,455
Why are you pouting this time?

524
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:10,042
You'll make me misunderstand you
if you keep acting like that.

525
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:13,546
I used to write romance dramas.
Don't mess with me.

526
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:17,341
What kind of misunderstanding?

527
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:20,678
Oh, come on. Drop the act.

528
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:23,139
I think I've told you about 35 times.

529
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,725
I don't date younger guys.

530
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:37,904
I know.
And this is my 35th time rejecting you.

531
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:46,037
Have fun then.

532
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,457
Okay.

533
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:55,546
How old is that guy though?

534
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:59,634
-He's much older than me.
-What's so good about an old guy?

535
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,348
That rude brat.

536
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,562
Yes?

537
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:15,900
It's lunchtime.
Should we order something for you?

538
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:17,693
It's fine. Eat without me.

539
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:21,155
-But still…
-It's fine. Go.

540
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:23,032
All right.

541
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,629
You should at least have dinner.

542
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:39,507
I don't want to eat.
Thanks for asking though.

543
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:41,342
But still--

544
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,803
I'll grab something later. Don't worry.

545
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:05,992
I said I don't need to eat.

546
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:08,869
You should still eat something, Mr. Kim.

547
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:18,879
I came to see if you really are that busy

548
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:21,549
or if you are just pretending to be busy.

549
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,552
I didn't know you'd be skipping meals.

550
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,638
-How did you get here?
-I took a cab.

551
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:29,265
I mean…

552
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:32,268
You should have answered my messages.

553
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,603
Are you too busy? Should I wait outside?

554
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:36,439
No, it's fine.

555
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,108
Let's go have dinner then.

556
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:42,486
Get up.

557
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:48,659
Can you wait outside for a second?

558
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,494
Okay.

559
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,383
I wish our company had a cafeteria.

560
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:05,843
Lucky you.

561
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,688
This is good.

562
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:21,192
Why aren't you eating all this
delicious food? It's such a waste.

563
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:24,028
If it were me,
I'd be eating every single meal here.

564
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:32,578
By the way, it looks like
you lost some weight.

565
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,663
Haven't you been eating?

566
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:38,584
Tae-hun told me you've been
practically living in the editing room.

567
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:41,629
Well, I'm busy these days.

568
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:45,091
I guess being a producer really is tough.

569
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:48,219
Still, you should eat. We should
take care of our health at our age.

570
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,141
But why did you come here?

571
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:59,313
Oh, I wanted to ask if we could
check the footage beforehand.

572
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:04,485
The footage about Soen and our project
should be checked with our client.

573
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:10,908
-Okay, I'll send it to you.
-Can't I see it while I'm here?

574
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,952
I'm a bit curious.

575
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,372
I don't have much to show you.

576
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:18,332
I heard the draft for episode one is out.

577
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:20,709
I haven't made the revisions yet.

578
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:28,384
-But Ji-ung.
-Yes?

579
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:30,511
Why aren't you looking at me?

580
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:46,152
Because I'm a mess right now.

581
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:50,489
Why are you worried about that?

582
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,032
Remember your birthday?

583
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,910
I hung out with you
even when my eyes were all swollen.

584
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:56,662
Don't forget that.

585
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:58,956
Right.

586
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,714
How have you been?

587
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:11,177
I've been okay.

588
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:16,307
Same as usual.

589
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,768
And you? Have you been well?

590
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:23,647
I've also been the same as usual.

591
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:40,039
If I just ignore his message,
I'll seem even more pathetic.

592
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:42,791
I should answer him casually

593
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,418
to look like I don't care.

594
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:46,378
Damn it.

595
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,007
How deep did I bury this?

596
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,594
Think before you do anything!

597
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:06,440
Darn it. I give up.

598
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,907
It's quite late already.

599
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:19,995
It's still early though.

600
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,289
It was so fun talking to you

601
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,999
that I didn't notice the time.

602
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,627
I never expected

603
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,838
that I'd have such fun on a blind date.

604
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,006
Right?

605
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:36,303
If it's okay with you,
I'd like to talk with you a little more.

606
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:40,516
I'd love that.

607
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,851
Where should we go?

608
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,605
-There's a place with clam stew--
-How about a cafe?

609
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:49,066
That would be great.

610
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:52,903
-Weren't you saying something though?
-No.

611
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:55,614
Clam stew…

612
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:01,203
The clams!

613
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,669
Did I leave the door unlocked again?

614
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,130
What's wrong with me?

615
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:13,632
Where are my clams?

616
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,843
Oh, my gosh!

617
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:18,304
Jeez, you startled me.

618
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:20,264
You gave me a fright.

619
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:23,309
Hey, what are you doing here?

620
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:26,270
See? You completely forgot.

621
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:28,063
Did you bring them inside?

622
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:32,026
I was going to ignore the package,
but I decided to be nice.

623
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:33,819
You almost killed all the clams

624
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:36,280
because you were preoccupied
with your date.

625
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:45,956
Why did you come back so early?

626
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,250
You were acting like
it was going to be so fun.

627
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:50,169
It wasn't that fun, right?

628
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:53,213
Isn't it awkward talking to someone
you've just met?

629
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,345
You're right. It was boring.

630
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:04,892
See? There's no way it'd be fun.

631
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:05,976
It's obvious.

632
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:09,021
Your conversations will keep
ending in silence.

633
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:10,481
Yes, you're right.

634
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:13,692
Sol-i, you should use that time
to get more customers.

635
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:15,778
You need to pay back your loan.

636
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:20,199
I told you it'd be boring.

637
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:25,120
I had so much fun today.
Can I see you again next time?

638
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:28,123
What is it?

639
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:30,542
A spam message for a loan.

640
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:34,254
I guess they have a knack
for finding people who need money.

641
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,382
But do they send
spam messages at this hour?

642
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,258
They're working hard.

643
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:44,890
Do you want some clam stew?

644
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:49,019
Sol-i!

645
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:51,647
Hey, why are you shouting at me?

646
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:54,400
Did you think you'd get to use
my labor for free?

647
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:56,276
That's outrageous.

648
00:44:57,069 --> 00:45:00,364
I put some clams in the fridge.

649
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:05,119
All right. I'll make you
an amazing clam stew.

650
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:10,124
Let's empty the fridge
of all the soju tonight.

651
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:12,960
Now you're starting to scare me.

652
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:15,379
Why would we do that?

653
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:18,549
Hello? Sol-i?

654
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,183
I was just about to ring the bell.

655
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:30,936
I wasn't just standing here,
so don't get the wrong idea.

656
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:33,105
What are you doing here?

657
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:36,692
I didn't say what I did
at the interview for you.

658
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:38,360
I didn't mean anything by it.

659
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:41,363
I'm not someone
who'd be so considerate of others.

660
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,616
Did you come here to say that?

661
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,118
You could have just texted me.

662
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:47,661
My phone is…

663
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:50,998
Anyway, it's not what you think. Okay?

664
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,292
Go inside, then.

665
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:54,793
I was on my way out.

666
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:56,086
All right.

667
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,463
Right.

668
00:46:00,757 --> 00:46:02,968
Oh, I guess I should leave.

669
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:06,638
No, you came all the way here.
Let me give you some warm tea.

670
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:09,892
No, wait.

671
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:11,518
Well…

672
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:14,897
Why don't I give you a ride…

673
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:16,899
No, that's not it either.

674
00:46:19,776 --> 00:46:21,278
So I guess

675
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:23,739
things are awkward between us now.

676
00:46:27,075 --> 00:46:29,661
I won't visit you randomly
like this anymore.

677
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:31,538
Or keep texting or calling you.

678
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:35,292
I wouldn't want to see my man
with another girl either.

679
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:37,419
Especially if it's someone like me,

680
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,379
it'd be quite stressful for her, right?

681
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:43,217
About being friends…

682
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:45,886
No, I'm not going to be friends with you.

683
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:48,305
I don't make friends with men.

684
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:50,098
I'm the one who's rejecting you.

685
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:53,143
I'll get going, then.
You don't have to see me off.

686
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:00,901
I didn't really like you that much.

687
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:02,027
Just a little bit.

688
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:05,072
In fact, I may have already
forgotten about it. That's how much.

689
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,826
But I'm telling you just in case.

690
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,788
Call me if you break up again.

691
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,431
This is so cool.

692
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,934
I've never seen stuff like this before.

693
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:39,189
There's really not much to see.
I still have a lot to work on.

694
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,774
It's fine, I understand.

695
00:47:40,857 --> 00:47:42,526
What should I press?

696
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:17,060
PACKED MEALS

697
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:28,071
Hello, my name is Choi Ung.

698
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:31,783
My name is…

699
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:35,120
Gosh, do we really have to do this?

700
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:38,332
Ung was actually smirking back then.

701
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:40,626
He's so sly.

702
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:43,795
I'm sure it's obvious.

703
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:47,716
-He liked me first.
-Honestly, I was a bit worried.

704
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:50,844
-Maybe it's your camera work…
-Is that what she said?

705
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:52,012
I look good in the video.

706
00:48:55,932 --> 00:48:57,184
Hey.

707
00:48:57,976 --> 00:48:59,227
When did you film this?

708
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:01,021
I didn't even know you were filming.

709
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:05,233
I'm impressed.

710
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:07,903
You're a great producer, I give you that.

711
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:09,655
You didn't miss a single moment.

712
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:18,997
Was I really
looking at Ung with that expression?

713
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,934
-Yeon-su. I'm sorry, but…
-Yes?

714
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:42,437
-I should…
-Oh, right. You must be busy.

715
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:45,941
Sorry. I took up too much of your time.

716
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:50,570
Thanks. I enjoyed the video.

717
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:53,949
I'll send you the file via email later.

718
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,119
Okay. And take good care of your health.

719
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:01,915
And let's have a meal together
with Ung next time.

720
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:05,252
I don't think I'll have time anytime soon.

721
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:07,003
Should we meet near your place?

722
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:08,964
-At Ung's restaurant, or--
-I…

723
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:12,843
I think I need some time.

724
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:14,428
What?

725
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:18,390
I need some time.

726
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:24,396
All right. We can meet when you're free.

727
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:25,939
I'll get going. Bye.

728
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:22,162
Yeon-su said she'll be late today.

729
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:25,248
Yes, I know.

730
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:27,834
Then…

731
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:31,546
you came when you knew I'd be here alone?

732
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:33,632
-Yes.
-Really?

733
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:38,303
You always used to just sit there
looking like a scared little puppy.

734
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:39,721
What's the occasion?

735
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:44,893
Well, did you have dinner?

736
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:48,730
-I brought some side dishes.
-I ate.

737
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:51,024
I see.

738
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:03,161
-Don't get up.
-Okay.

739
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:04,788
Let me get you some tea.

740
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:12,629
Do you like jujube tea?

741
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:15,423
I love it.

742
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:17,759
I hate it because it smells rotten.

743
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:20,470
Good. You can have what's left of it.

744
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:26,226
-Let's go…
-Okay. Let's go.

745
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:27,435
Let's go.

746
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:29,187
Yeon-su!

747
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:31,273
Did you just get off work?

748
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:34,401
Yes, I'm heading home now.
Did you just close?

749
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:36,903
Yes, we're about to head home too.

750
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:39,865
-What about dinner?
-I just ate with Ji-ung.

751
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:42,659
-Really?
-How is Ji-ung these days?

752
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:44,244
We haven't seen him for a while.

753
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:47,330
He seems pretty busy.
He's been stuck at the office.

754
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:50,375
We should get some side dishes
for Ji-ung too.

755
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:51,334
Right.

756
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:54,713
Right. Ung just took
some side dishes for you.

757
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:56,256
To where?

758
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:59,217
To your house, of course.

759
00:53:00,176 --> 00:53:02,470
My grandma's home right now…

760
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:05,390
Bring your grandma for a meal next time.

761
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:07,851
I heard you wanted some braised fish.

762
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:10,145
Yes. I will.

763
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:12,230
You must be tired.

764
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:19,029
You should hurry home and get some rest.

765
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:21,823
All right. Bye, then.

766
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:25,577
WITH UNG

767
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:29,372
Go on.

768
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:44,596
Where are you?

769
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:46,806
I heard you came to my house.

770
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:49,100
Yes. I'm back home now.

771
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:51,645
Didn't you run into my grandmother?

772
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:54,064
Did she say anything?
Did she scold you again?

773
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:56,858
No, wait. I'll go to your house. Hang on.

774
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:00,654
-I'll make you some tea.
-Okay.

775
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:04,824
But why did you go to my house
when I wasn't there?

776
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:06,993
Grandma must have given you an earful.

777
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:08,161
She didn't.

778
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:14,960
Do you read books like this these days?

779
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:19,714
I haven't been reading much lately.

780
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:21,174
I should read more too.

781
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:31,059

785
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:37,691
What's this?

786
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:39,693
It's nothing.

787
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:43,321
It seems like a brochure
for an architecture school.

788
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:45,448
Were you interested in architecture?

789
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:48,618
Well, do you remember the architect
I told you I liked?

790
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:51,871
He's a professor there,
so I was just looking at it.

791
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:54,165
I see.

792
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:57,836
You're always drawing buildings,
so of course you're interested.

793
00:54:58,336 --> 00:55:01,840
-I'm not.
-Why? It'll be nice to learn more.

794
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:03,883
Why would I do that?

795
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:06,720
It'll be such a bother.

796
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:09,431
Drawing is exhausting as it is.

797
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:10,932
You're right.

798
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:13,893
Having one university diploma
is more than enough.

799
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:18,023
-What?
-I didn't graduate.

800
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:20,358
What?

801
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:22,318
Why?

802
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:25,363
I didn't really need to.

803
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:28,199
Have you lost your mind?

804
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:31,286
You attended school for years
and paid all that tuition.

805
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:33,121
That all went to waste.

806
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:37,584
You know I never really wanted
to attend university in the first place.

807
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:39,085
I only attended because of you.

808
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:44,841
Why are you so shocked?

809
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:47,343
You knew I didn't like going to school.

810
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:53,808
But still, how could you quit so easily?

811
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:57,937
I didn't see the need for it personally.

812
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:01,107
That's your reason?

813
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:03,735
You can draw all the buildings you love

814
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:05,987
and learn much more if you go there.

815
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:08,573
Give this chance to someone
who needs it more than I do.

816
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:17,373
Right. Eun-ho bought cookies. Hang on.

817
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:24,881
By the way,
didn't Grandma say anything to you?

818
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:28,093
If she said anything harsh,
don't take it personally.

819
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:29,469
She always talks like that.

820
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:41,648
Yeon-su. Can I ask you something?

821
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:44,734
Yes. What is it?

822
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:47,987
Back then…

823
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:56,246
why did we break up?

824
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:18,935
EPILOGUE

825
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:26,109
I'm totally messed up.

826
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:31,614
Drink this.

827
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:33,741
Thanks.

828
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:39,747
I saw you two
in the editing room a while ago.

829
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:41,708
It reminded me of a movie.

830
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:42,959
A movie?

831
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:44,544
Love Actually.

832
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:47,672
The part where the guy likes
his best friend's wife.

833
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:50,633
Not Love and War?

834
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:56,222
In the movie, he ends up confessing
his feelings on a sketchbook.

835
00:57:57,265 --> 00:57:59,392
And that became the most famous scene.

836
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:03,730
What's going to be your ending?

837
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:07,525
I'm not sure.

838
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:09,319
I'm not in a movie.

839
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:13,364
I'm in a documentary.

840
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:52,403
That's what the media does.

841
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:55,448
-It's Ung!
-It attracts unnecessary attention.

842
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:56,533
Have you been well?

843
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:58,952
By the way,
why don't you have any friends?

844
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:01,913
Do you think we're in the same situation?

845
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:04,874
Sol-i isn't yours anymore.

846
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:07,126
What kind of person do I come off as?

847
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:10,088
Do I look lost and aimless?

848
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:12,590
That's what the past does to you.

849
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:16,344
It causes you to make the same mistakes.

850
00:59:16,427 --> 00:59:20,056
You seemed so desperate to break up.

851
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:26,145
