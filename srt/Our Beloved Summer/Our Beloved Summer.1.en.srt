1
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:48,381
Should I begin?

2
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:49,424
MAY, 2011

3
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:50,508
Well…

4
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:52,761
Hello.

5
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,308
My name is Choi Ung.

6
00:00:58,391 --> 00:00:59,893
CHOI UNG (19, MALE)

7
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:01,352
Let's look at the first one.

8
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,855
As limit x approaches one,

9
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:06,566
you can find the limiting value.

10
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:10,278
So we can think about
the case when it's smaller than one

11
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:14,866
and when it's bigger than one. Understand?

12
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:18,286
-Okay. When it's smaller than one…
-Don't look at the camera.

13
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:21,539
-But it bothers me.
-Just act like it's not here.

14
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:24,459
How can I? It's right in front of me.

15
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:27,128
For this case, it goes down like this.

16
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:29,506
-As you can see…
-So the answer is…

17
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,132
I'm being filmed.

18
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,801
You idiot. Look forward.

19
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,886
Should we look at the next one?

20
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:38,431
-The limiting value of this is one.
-But it's not just me.

21
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,767
What are you looking at?
Look at the teacher.

22
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,977
The limiting value of this is one as well.

23
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:46,940
The limiting values of these are the same…

24
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,150
This annoying brat as well.

25
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,360
Let's end it here.

26
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,613
Attention, bow.

27
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,907
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

28
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,660
Where are you going?

29
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:01,454
It's none of your business.

30
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:11,506
Sir, can we stop for a moment?
I can't keep working with that idiot.

31
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,884
-"Idiot"?
-We've been filming for days.

32
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,553
Why can't you sit still
when we're filming?

33
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,180
I can't focus at all with you next to me.

34
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,474
How can I
when there is a camera right next to me?

35
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:24,269
Just focus on the class.
Can't you even do that?

36
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:27,230
You can ignore me
and focus on class yourself.

37
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,189
Can't you even do that?

38
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:31,776
I guess you don't care because
your grades couldn't get any worse.

39
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,445
But I won't let you bring down my grades.

40
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:38,032
You heard her, right?

41
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:41,494
Whatever. It's your social skills
that couldn't get any worse.

42
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,747
Why did I agree to this?

43
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,584
I know, right? Why did you agree to this?

44
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,629
My name is Kook Yeon-su.

45
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:52,547
KOOK YEON-SU (19, FEMALE)

46
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:56,009
I think I first saw Choi Ung
in tenth grade.

47
00:02:58,177 --> 00:02:59,512
This much again?

48
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,806
I'm reading less
because I have exams soon.

49
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,018
You'll read all the books here
by the time you graduate.

50
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,144
Kook Yeon-su…

51
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:10,148
-Here. Enjoy.
-Thank you.

52
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,487
APRIL'S TOP BOOKWORMS

53
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,114
1ST: CHOI UNG
2ND: KOOK YEON-SU

54
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,160
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

55
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:23,703
Who is Choi Ung?

56
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,455
He's in first place this month, too?

57
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,248
Oh, Ung?

58
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,626
I think he was over there.

59
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,964
Hey.

60
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:39,010
I met him somewhere that didn't suit him.

61
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,470
I'm Kook Yeon-su from Class 5.

62
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,263
What's your rank?

63
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,057
-What rank?
-Your grades.

64
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:46,851
I'm 267th.

65
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:50,521
The total number of students here…

66
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,607
There are 267 students.

67
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,527
Back then, I just thought
that he was a strange kid.

68
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:04,285
No, wait. That was the second time we met.

69
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,121
The first time we met
was when we started high school.

70
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:10,625
The student who entered with
the highest grades is Kook Yeon-su.

71
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:15,338
Her name's Kook Yeon-su?

72
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,090
What a funny name.

73
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:21,177
I watched her because she walked
like she was entering a battlefield.

74
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,767
HWIYEONG HIGH SCHOOL ENTRANCE CEREMONY

75
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,645
Hey, look at her skirt.

76
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:33,356
-She's obviously a teacher's pet.
-She's a stereotype.

77
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,943
-They all have the same style.
-Hey, look at her shoes.

78
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,987
Even my mom wouldn't wear that.

79
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,948
-Spring is finally here.
-How tacky.

80
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,492
The weather is still pretty cold.

81
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,411
We met eyes for the first time,

82
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,454
so I was trying to be nice by smiling.

83
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:49,622
Hey.

84
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,291
What are you looking at?

85
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,129
But she seemed ill-tempered.

86
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:09,267
Anyway, I thought I'd never
be involved with him again.

87
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,561
You're here.

88
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,396
Did you think about that offer?

89
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,273
The producer's a friend of mine.

90
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:16,774
He won't trouble you too much.

91
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,068
You don't have to
if you think it will affect your grades.

92
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,238
-Will it be just me?
-No, with one more student.

93
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:26,284
It's a documentary where
they observe the best and worst students

94
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,369
for a month as they spend time together.

95
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,414
Anyway, just think about it.

96
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:40,131
Will I be paid if I agree to do it?

97
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:41,591
Of course.

98
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:50,349
He was the exact opposite of me.

99
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:54,771
Oh, you're here already.

100
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,022
-Hang on.
-All right.

101
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,900
Just a moment.

102
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:02,028
The ingredients must be here.
Check them thoroughly.

103
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,280
They were in a bad condition last time.

104
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:06,240
-Check them properly.
-All right.

105
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:10,787
SEAFOOD SOUP WITH UNG
POTATO SOUP WITH UNG

106
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,413
CHICKEN FEET WITH UNG

107
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,874
-Hello.
-Hello.

108
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:17,668
He's Ung's father.

109
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,670
-Hello.
-Hello.

110
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:21,380
Ung!

111
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,382
-Hey. Come over here.
-But things happened

112
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,927
regardless of my intentions.

113
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,012
Why didn't you tell us
about the documentary?

114
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,056
I said I wouldn't do it.

115
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:33,726
The producer came all the way here.
Why did you say no?

116
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,437
And it's with
the top student in your year.

117
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,772
Of course you should do it!

118
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:41,943
Of course! We don't know
what he's doing at school.

119
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:44,487
If you film that,
we'll be able to see what he does.

120
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,656
-That's right.
-Thank you.

121
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,616
-Thank you.
-I said I'm not doing it!

122
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,159
Why would you refuse?

123
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:53,162
Why would I do that?
I don't want everyone to know my face.

124
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,706
You'll be able
to build a great memory with this.

125
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,625
-Right.
-I'm a senior now, you know.

126
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,002
Don't you think it will affect my grades?

127
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,089
What's he on about?

128
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:05,967
They are letting you study
with the top student in your grade.

129
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,718
You should be grateful!

130
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:08,719
I mean…

131
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,597
It was as if it had to happen.

132
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,724
She's kind of weird!

133
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,478
Anyway, that's how it all started.

134
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:26,195
Choi Ung from Class 1
will be joining us for a month.

135
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,113
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

136
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:28,489
Be nice to him.

137
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:32,243
It may be distracting for you
since they'll be filming,

138
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:34,287
but it will be a fun experience.

139
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:38,958
And with that,
I hope you all have a great day.

140
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,001
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

141
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:06,402
It was more bothersome than I thought.

142
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,541
The worst students make the most fuss.

143
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,837
-Are you talking to me?
-Keep your stuff off my desk.

144
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:39,101
She was way more annoying than I thought.

145
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:49,153
At first, I tried
to become friends with her.

146
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,363
Hey…

147
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,018
Can we…

148
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,236
I said I was sorry.

149
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,531
I'm not sorry.

150
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,742
But what can I do?

151
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:38,786
We're just so different.

152
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:41,706
No! Not here!

153
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,584
Darn it.

154
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,419
Go!

155
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,255
Here.

156
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,969
-Hey.
-Over here!

157
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:58,848
Oh, my.

158
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,225
Darn it. Hey!

159
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:02,852
Oh, gosh!

160
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,862
Are you okay?

161
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,786
He's so childish.

162
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,622
Ma'am.

163
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:27,084
How can I solve that
with the L'Hôpital's rule?

164
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:29,837
Ma'am.

165
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:34,091
Can we solve this
by using the derived function?

166
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,217
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

167
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,762
-Ma'am.
-All right, kids. Enjoy your lunch.

168
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,096
Ma'am.

169
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:42,600
She's so selfish.

170
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:43,684
Ma'am.

171
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:45,770
THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING

172
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,523
I love lying in the shade.

173
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,443
The gentle breeze,

174
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,738
the sunlight shining through the trees…

175
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,160
You're so ridiculous.

176
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,205
Can you move?

177
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:07,416
Finish reading that
and return it to the library.

178
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,801
This is so nice.

179
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,137
He's so lazy.

180
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,117
Who was that?

181
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,703
Choi Ung! You again?

182
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,747
I told you to be quiet!

183
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,084
Things are already exhausting,

184
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,545
but she just makes it worse.

185
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:55,673
He's just so pathetic.

186
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,470
Sorry. What was the question?

187
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,514
Pay attention.

188
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,143
Oh, things I hate?

189
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,394
Kook Yeon-su.

190
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,692
I mean, I hate Kook Yeong-su.
She's some girl I know.

191
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:19,321
I hate pathetic beings.
I hate everyone who's pathetic.

192
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,365
Being selfish. I hate selfish people who--

193
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,200
People who cause trouble for others.

194
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:26,871
Why can't they just keep to themselves
and not drag others down with them?

195
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,164
Being harsh.

196
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,832
Some people talk without thinking.

197
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,500
They don't think at all.

198
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,127
Look who's talking.

199
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:36,505
He just doesn't think at all.

200
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,425
Wait. Are you talking about me?

201
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,760
You seemed to be talking about me too.

202
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,013
What? Are you kidding me?

203
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,431
No, I'm totally serious.

204
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,101
Why are you filming this again?

205
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:52,229
It's a show where the top student helps
the student at the bottom of the class.

206
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,106
-Right?
-I see.

207
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,191
Is this some kind of a test

208
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,526
to see how long you can withstand
someone who has no social skills?

209
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,905
Doing experiments like that
is pretty unethical.

210
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:04,992
The best student and the worst student.
Which is more anti-social?

211
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,994
When people like her enter society,

212
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:09,747
they will only tire out
the people around them.

213
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,958
Well, you wouldn't even
be able to participate in society.

214
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,752
How would you know?

215
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:21,759
What do you think
you'll be like in ten years?

216
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,057
In ten years, I'll be 29.

217
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:32,561
I'm sure I'd be good at
whatever I'm doing.

218
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:36,690
I want to live a peaceful life
without doing anything.

219
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:40,736
I'll be leading people around me,
living an active life.

220
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:41,779
A successful life.

221
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:44,740
I hope I'll live a quiet life.

222
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:47,034
-Anyway…
-One thing I know for sure is that--

223
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:49,578
…I won't have to see
this annoying face again.

224
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,248
That's what I wanted to say.

225
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,711

AMAZING CHEMISTRY
HILARIOUS

232
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,992
THIS IS A MUST WATCH
PLEASE LET THERE BE A SECOND SEASON

233
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,294
EPISODE 1
I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER

234
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,172
This isn't it.

235
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,090
THE PRESENT

236
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:44,508
Ms. Kook Yeon-su?

237
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:46,886
Yes.

238
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:50,598
I don't think you have
anything more to add. Will you continue?

239
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,767
This isn't the life I thought I'd live.

240
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:59,440
But still, please listen
until the end and give me your opinion.

241
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,026
All right, then. Continue.

242
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,486
I will explain
the online promotion methods.

243
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:08,032
We're planning on gaining
people's interest before the opening

244
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:11,535
through online campaigns
and participation events.

245
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,954
And through hashtag events--

246
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,080
Ms. Kook.

247
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,166
This is pretty disappointing.

248
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,209
This isn't what we asked for.

249
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,086
You should have
checked with us in advance.

250
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,214
Your ideas are too mediocre.

251
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:27,551
To attract people's interests
before the store opens,

252
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:30,596
-we should do online--
-Don't you think I know that?

253
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,223
-But we--
-Your company's name is Run, right?

254
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,433
You're a small company,

255
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:37,019
but you won quite a lot of awards,

256
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,396
and I heard you're
quite famous in the industry.

257
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:42,066
But your work is pathetic.

258
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:45,152
You've built up a great image
for your company, I'll give you that.

259
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:48,781
Ji-hyeon. The presentation this afternoon…

260
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,908
Can we reschedule it to 10 a.m.?

261
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:53,327
-Mr. Jang.
-Yes? You're done, right?

262
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,411
Is there anything else?

263
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:59,375
Getting looked down on like this
was never part of my plan.

264
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,503
-Yes. I'm not done yet.
-Hurry up, then.

265
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,931
Offline,
we'll be collaborating with an artist

266
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,891
for the opening of Soen Shop.

267
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,477
Isn't it cliché to use merch
to attract customers?

268
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,730
It isn't very effective
and is a waste of resources.

269
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,023
Consumers won't fall for--

270
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:27,611
Didn't you say you'd listen
until the end, Mr. Jang?

271
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,031
Go on.

272
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:35,077
This isn't just so that we could
lure in customers with the merchandise.

273
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,540
We'll be merchandising the shop itself
to promote the company.

274
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:45,462
These are the works of Ko-o,
the most popular illustrator these days.

275
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:49,800
Ko-o is known for drawing detailed
and trendy pieces based on buildings.

276
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:54,346
And recently, Ko-o received more attention
as the idol singer NJ bought one of them.

277
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,849
Through this collaboration,

278
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:59,935
we'll host a live drawing show
for the opening ceremony.

279
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:02,980
Go on.

280
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:06,942
The artist's image matches
the unique and innovative goods

281
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,112
that Soen Shop aims
to provide its customers.

282
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:13,574
Ko-o already has a large fanbase
because of his unique drawings

283
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:16,035
and his sincere attitude toward art.

284
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,871
If we promote the shop
with his drawing on the exterior wall,

285
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:23,500
I'm sure it will make Soen Shop
the hottest place to visit.

286
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,801
Can you get the artist on board?

287
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,137
Of course. It won't be a problem.

288
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,972
You'd better be right.

289
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,017
ARTIST KO-O

290
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,310
Not bad.

291
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:45,355
I don't know why you waited
until the last minute to show us that.

292
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,982
-The order--
-You can proceed.

293
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:06,085
Ms. Kook. That was great.
You were so cool today.

294
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:10,422
I heard Mr. Jang is very aggressive.
He sure was scary.

295
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,299
He's doing that on purpose.

296
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:15,344
He called us over this early
so he could have the upper hand.

297
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,096
He even kept cutting her off.

298
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,431
But still,
we have this project in the bag now.

299
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:23,393
But Ms. Kook. Can we really
get the artist to work with us?

300
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:26,772
I thought that wasn't confirmed yet.

301
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,608
That jerk…

302
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,618
When we get back to the office,
get me all the data on the artist.

303
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:42,079
Everything from his social media
to his interviews.

304
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:44,748
We have to do this project no matter what.

305
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:48,544
But the artist is known
for being a recluse.

306
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,672
Nobody's seen his face,
even at exhibitions.

307
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:55,217
I'm going to find him, no matter what.

308
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:01,098
How could he cut me off like that?

309
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:03,142
Did he never learn any manners?

310
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,561
Jeez, where is my car?

311
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,330
Mr. Jang.

312
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,333
Did you have something to say to me?

313
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,005
Are you opening my car door for me?

314
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:34,047
What?

315
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:44,975
I'm sorry. I haven't gotten used
to the company car yet.

316
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,101
I was mistaken.

317
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,564
-Ms. Kook.
-Yes?

318
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,274
I hate baseless courage.

319
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,861
I think irresponsible people
are the most pathetic.

320
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:59,031
-Right.
-I hope you weren't bluffing

321
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,366
when you said you could
get the artist on board.

322
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,619
You're not that pathetic, are you?

323
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,802
Ten years ago…

324
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,137
That jerk…

325
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,599
…I would have never imagined

326
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,559
that I'd be treated this way.

327
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,362
I had always known

328
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,740
that my life would be peaceful.

329
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,788
I've always dreamed of this.

330
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:52,292
We started a restaurant
for drivers passing by.

331
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:53,877
-Hang on.
-Why?

332
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,963
Wait. What's he doing?

333
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,548
Stop acting so weird back there.

334
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,926
I have to film Dad,
but you're being distracting.

335
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,720
You ruined the shot. It's your fault.

336
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:06,306
Stop bothering us and go inside.

337
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,225
But I was here first.

338
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:10,978
I thought I'd be fine talking
in front of the camera,

339
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,562
but it's quite nerve-racking.

340
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:16,149
-I want a little more peace though.
-Our franchise began

341
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:20,946
as a diner for drivers 25 years ago.

342
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:25,325
We specialized in
steamed fish and chicken feet.

343
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,953
-Then word got around--
-Stop it already!

344
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,246
You ruined the shot!

345
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,415
He's a busy man, you know.

346
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:33,417
Ung, you should go.
Aren't you late for work?

347
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,626
It's fine. I have time.

348
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,336
Then eat something before you go.

349
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:38,839
Don't you dare!

350
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:40,132
You little brat.

351
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:42,134
Stop loafing around and work on this.

352
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:45,095
Don't you think I'm busy too?

353
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:46,263
-Nonsense.
-Ridiculous.

354
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,266
You? Busy? You're not even working.

355
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,809
-Hey, put that away.
-Come on.

356
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,312
He's spending
his precious time helping us.

357
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,855
You should be thanking him.

358
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:56,356
You little brat.

359
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,692
Finish up and watch the counter.

360
00:21:58,775 --> 00:21:59,735
And don't run away.

361
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,737
-Honey, help me with something.
-Wait, I…

362
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,988
I can't do it by myself.

363
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:05,449
Jeez. I'd better go.

364
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,910
I told you to stop filming.

365
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:12,247
You'd better stop if you don't
want to lose your fingers or the camera.

366
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,624
What happened to your face?

367
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:19,129
-Even pork is marinated for eight hours.
-What do you mean?

368
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:21,298
I only slept
two and a half hours last night.

369
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,091
I got less rest than pork.

370
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:27,012
That's too bad. You sleep and poop
as much as a pig though.

371
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:28,805
Shut up. And stop filming!

372
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:32,517
But I was told to film you too
for the promotional video.

373
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,186
No way. Don't you dare.

374
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:35,604
Ung!

375
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:36,605
-Yes?
-Yes?

376
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:37,814
Ung.

377
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,150
Over here. Look at the camera.

378
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,236
That's right.

379
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,280
How cute.

380
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,245
-Look over here.
-Ung! Look at Mommy.

381
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,371
-Ung! Over here.
-That's right.

382
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:55,332
-Look at your teacher.
-How cute!

383
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:56,458
Hang on.

384
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,251
Look at your teacher. Yes, good.

385
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,045
-Look over there.
-He grew a lot.

386
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:02,089
-It must be because your husband is tall.
-Look at your teacher.

387
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:03,882
Is he listening to his teacher?

388
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:05,383
I bought this for today.

389
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,260
"Choi Ung"?

390
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:10,305
Yes. I'm Choi Ung. What's your name?

391
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:11,848
I'm not going to tell you.

392
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,228
KIM JI-UNG

393
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:17,521
Not you. Ji-ung.

394
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:18,772
Do you want some stew?

395
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:20,941
-Yes, I'd love that.
-What about me?

396
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:22,359
You can have some too.

397
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:26,488
Hey, I've been thinking…

398
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,865
I'll practice my lines properly,

399
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:32,202
so would it be okay
to do this again when you have time?

400
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:35,664
Anytime is fine with me.
So call me when you want to do it.

401
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:40,836
Thank you so much.
It's so nice having a producer help out.

402
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,796
When else would I be able to try this?

403
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,008
Dad. Don't look at me like that.

404
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,010
The cabbages are arriving later, okay?

405
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:52,055
Don't you dare think about running away
and move them inside.

406
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:55,600
I hope you're not forgetting
that I'm your son!

407
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,062
-Have two bowls, alright?
-Okay.

408
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:03,733
It seems like you'll be the one
inheriting the restaurant later.

409
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:06,403
My parents are acting
like you're their son these days.

410
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,239
But think about it.

411
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:11,491
I act more like their son than you.

412
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:12,617
Jeez.

413
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,077
Aren't you working these days?

414
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:17,080
Why do you keep lurking around here
and threatening my status?

415
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,916
I finally got a short vacation
after finishing a program.

416
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,128
I'll be busy again
when I start my next project.

417
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:25,630
I should have fun here before that.

418
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:28,592
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

419
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,969
-I'm having fun.
-You jerk!

420
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:33,972
Wait! Father, look at Ung
holding the bean sprouts like that!

421
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:35,807
-I wasn't--
-Put that down!

422
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,184
Put it down.

423
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:38,685
-Put it down!
-Don't play around with that!

424
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:39,978
You're dead, you jerk!

425
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:42,689
-How can you be so childish?
-My goodness.

426
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:44,191
You're a grown-up, you know!

427
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:48,695
I thought I'd have matured
a bit more than this though.

428
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:53,533
Ms. Kook and Mr. Jang
were clashing since they're so similar.

429
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:56,578
It's so fun watching them argue.

430
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:59,581
You saw how Ms. Kook reacted
when Mr. Jang cut her off

431
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,666
during her presentation, right?

432
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:05,754
"Didn't you say you'd listen
until the end, Mr. Jang?" Unbelievable.

433
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,465
But still, Ms. Kook was so cool.
Don't you think so?

434
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:09,925
She's cool.

435
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:13,011
It wasn't something a small company
like us can easily get.

436
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:15,138
But she's getting that opportunity for us.

437
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:17,682
She's almost like
the breadwinner of this family.

438
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,643
Our CEO's good luck charm.

439
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:22,270
But imagine if we get on her bad side.

440
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:25,857
She's so dependable
when she's fighting our clients,

441
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,734
but if she ever gets angry at us…

442
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:29,861
Polar bears tear people apart
with their paws,

443
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:32,906
but Ms. Kook tears people with her words…
How did it go, Ms. Kook?

444
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,284
The data I asked for on Ko-o.

445
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,994
Have them ready by 3 p.m.

446
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:39,329
-Yes, ma'am.
-Okay.

447
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:46,294
What's going on here? What is it?

448
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,296
Why are you guys so good?

449
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,423
I heard you were given the green light.

450
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,342
I was so shocked.

451
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:53,969
Good work.

452
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:58,265
And I can't believe Ms. Kook
succeeded again.

453
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,141
Today's a day to celebrate.

454
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,768
-We should--
-No gatherings.

455
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:03,395
I'm not suggesting a team dinner.

456
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:05,272
Why would we do such a thing?

457
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:08,441
We shouldn't be having
a company gathering at a time like this.

458
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:09,651
We all hate it.

459
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:11,820
Then how about

460
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,738
-dinner--
-How about lunch instead?

461
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,616
You don't want to waste
your dinnertime with me?

462
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,994
That's not what I mean.
It's going to be hard

463
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,870
to get off work on time.

464
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,747
Then should we go have lunch now?

465
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,292
We already had lunch, sir.

466
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:29,462
What do you mean?

467
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:30,630
I just remembered

468
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:34,050
that we all had lunch together
on the way back.

469
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:39,681
What about me? Why didn't you invite me?

470
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:44,019
You didn't attend the presentation
because you had a stomachache.

471
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:46,688
So we thought you'd skip lunch.

472
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,524
Right. That was smart thinking.

473
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:52,986
Then you don't want dinner,
and you already ate lunch.

474
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:54,237
What should I do, then?

475
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,948
Then how about some coffee?

476
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,450
-Yes.
-Coffee sounds great.

477
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:00,577
-You all have coffee.
-We have coffee.

478
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:02,454
You already have coffee.

479
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,414
You all have some.

480
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:05,999
-Yes.
-Fine.

481
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:08,710
-Why don't I get you some porridge, then?
-Don't worry.

482
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,005
I hate porridge.

483
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:14,674
He seems upset.

484
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:29,272
SOL-I

485
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:42,494
SEOUL HARDWARE STORE

486
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:12,519
What is it?

487
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,729
You wench! Why weren't you picking up?

488
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,193
Why weren't you picking up?

489
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:22,862
Jeez. Don't you see that I'm working?

490
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:25,114
But still, you should answer your phone.

491
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:26,950
Darn it…

492
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:28,117
What?

493
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,912
What are you doing? Hey!

494
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,205
Get up. Exercise time.

495
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:34,290
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

496
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,835
Get up. You said you're not sleeping well.

497
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,711
Stop it! Let go of me!

498
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:43,925
It's the manager's job
to take care of the artist's health too.

499
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:49,013
I'm already exhausted,
and he makes it worse.

500
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,683
Aren't I a great manager? I'm so kind.

501
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:52,934
You're fired.

502
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,602
That counts as wrongful dismissal.

503
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,063
We'll stop when we
make it over there. You can do it.

504
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:58,314
I can't.

505
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,858
You have to go. Come on.

506
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,317
-Jeez.
-One, two, three, four.

507
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:02,694
Two, two, three, four.

508
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:04,946
All right! We're here!

509
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,447
Over here. Hurry up.

510
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,949
Hey! What's that?

511
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,450
The flag. Make the goal.

512
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:13,204
-There you go.
-Yes, goal!

513
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:18,167
You guys are doing all kinds
of stupid things.

514
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,587
I heard you only slept
two and a half hours.

515
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:23,631
-You have such a big mouth.
-Me? Take this.

516
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:24,924
Gosh.

517
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:27,302
Aren't you supposed to be busy?
Did you get fired?

518
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,929
Hey, if you're skilled,
you can slack off all you want.

519
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:35,476
Right. Did you still not
tell your parents what you do?

520
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,437
They just know I'm drawing.

521
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,857
They called me a while ago
and asked if you make enough money

522
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,443
since they couldn't find anything
when they searched your name.

523
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:44,944
Didn't you tell them anything?

524
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:47,572
How much do you earn? Tell me.

525
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:49,741
You're not even telling your family?

526
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:51,826
You're being overly secretive.

527
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,245
-Darn it.
-Jeez!

528
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:57,540
-You shook it, didn't you?
-No. So how much does he earn?

529
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,918
Each drawing sells for…

530
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,837
-What? For real?
-Yes.

531
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:04,380
Son of a bitch.

532
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,843
Hey. You just
wanted to swear at me, right?

533
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:09,886
Of course not.

534
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:12,180
Son of a bitch. What?

535
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:16,434
Oh, right. I told Father
that you didn't move the cabbages.

536
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:18,061
He said he'll kill you tomorrow.

537
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:20,605
-Oh, my. What are you going to do?
-Darn it.

538
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:29,113
Why is the weather so nice today?

539
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,832
-Jeez!
-Jeez!

540
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,793
You idiots.

541
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:44,963
-You shook these, didn't you?
-Didn't you see what happened to mine?

542
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:48,007
Did I shake them? Did you?

543
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,050
No way.

544
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:53,179
You're ignoring me again, aren't you?

545
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:57,392
You asshole.

546
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:02,355
You really have no customers.
You might go out of business soon.

547
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:04,524
-Hey!
-Gosh, you startled me.

548
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:06,943
I can hear you
even if you whisper, you know.

549
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:10,488
Do you know how many times
you've stood that guy up?

550
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:13,700
-Three times?
-It's four.

551
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:16,285
Do you have
some kind of grudge against him?

552
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,579
How could I?
I've never even seen him before.

553
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:22,166
But you bailed on him when he said
he'd come to your office building?

554
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:26,546
He even went there during lunchtime
because you said you were so busy.

555
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:28,006
I totally forgot.

556
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:30,258
You're such a scumbag.

557
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:32,885
How can you be so arrogant?

558
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:35,680
How can you function as a member
of society like that?

559
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:38,933
People worse than me
are living normal lives in society.

560
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:42,353
Shut up. That guy you bailed on four times

561
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,188
must be totally smitten with you.

562
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,524
He says he really wants to meet you.

563
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:47,942
I pity him so much.

564
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:51,154
-Is that so?
-"Is that so?"

565
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:52,572
You have to see him this time.

566
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:55,950
If you bail on him again,
I'm going to cut ties with you.

567
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,535
All right. I'll go see him.

568
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,621
I'm sick of this.

569
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,165
I'm not telling you to date him.

570
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:05,376
Just meet some guys.
At least give it a go.

571
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,754
Office, home, and here.
You don't go anywhere else.

572
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:10,465
Your eyes look soulless and empty.

573
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,258
There's probably nothing under your skin.

574
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:14,427
Skin!

575
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:16,512
I want some pork skin. Cook me some.

576
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,598
My gosh. It's like talking to a wall.

577
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:21,684
Let's live soulful lives.

578
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:24,228
Is meeting guys
your idea of a soulful life?

579
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:25,897
Forget it. I'm just going to work.

580
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,608
-Meet someone at work then.
-That's horrible.

581
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:30,443
You're making me lose my appetite.

582
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:31,444
Then…

583
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:34,864
Could it be that
you still haven't got over--

584
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:37,492
Gosh. So this is how you
drive away your customers.

585
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,619
-I'm leaving.
-All right, I'll stop. I'm sorry.

586
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:42,163
Please sit down, ma'am. I'm sorry.

587
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:45,541
You have such a bad temper.

588
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,254
My gosh.

589
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:56,302
Let me take a break. Jeez.

590
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:57,970
Why are you so bad?

591
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,806
You try it then.

592
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:00,932
Goodness.

593
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,478
Ung. That live drawing show--

594
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:06,687
I'm not doing it.

595
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:07,855
Darn it.

596
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,942
Why are you so obsessed
with keeping your identity hidden?

597
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:14,320
You're living in the past.
It's all about communication these days.

598
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:17,573
He's not suited for that.
He can't even talk properly.

599
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,158
I really don't get it.

600
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,202
Five years ago, all you did was draw,

601
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:23,121
saying that you were going to succeed.

602
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:26,124
But now you're rejecting opportunities.
What are you thinking?

603
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:29,460
He's changed now that he's successful.
He's full of himself.

604
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,546
-Hey.
-You shouldn't be so arrogant.

605
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,840
I heard Nu-a is collaborating with SJ.

606
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:34,924
Who's Nu-a?

607
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:37,927
An artist who has the same style as him.

608
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,804
A rival of his.

609
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:43,182
"A rival"? You've got to be kidding.

610
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,643
Hey, Nu-a's just copying me.

611
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:49,313
At this rate, people will say
you're the one copying Nu-a.

612
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,774
Do you want to go back to being a bum
like five years ago?

613
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:55,278
-Why do you keep bringing up the past?
-So you'll be motivated!

614
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:57,321
Do you really want to live like that?

615
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,407
Jeez.

616
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:05,705
It wasn't that bad.

617
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:10,209
What are you on about?

618
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:17,967
Hey.

619
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,427
Let's make a bet.

620
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,928
If you score 15 points first,

621
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,556
I'll move
all the cabbages for you tomorrow.

622
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:25,641
Really?

623
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,353
-Come on.
-I'm game.

624
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,230
You won't score a single point.

625
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,502
Ja-gyeong!

626
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:59,175
You reek of alcohol.

627
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:02,053
Did you drink again?

628
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:05,389
I want to make a doll with your stomach.

629
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,975
Then I can squeeze it every day.

630
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,186
Get washed up and go to bed.

631
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:12,104
You have to go to work tomorrow.

632
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:15,149
Just sleep inside, even if I'm late.

633
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,568
Don't stay up waiting for me.

634
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,612
I was out here because it was hot.

635
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:21,697
Go and get washed up.

636
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:23,783
Can't you wash me?

637
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,870
-Wash me, Grandma.
-My goodness.

638
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:29,956
-Give me a kiss.
-What's with you?

639
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:31,749
-You've lost your mind!
-Come on.

640
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:33,334
What's gotten into you?

641
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:37,088
-Why?
-You stink! Go away.

642
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:40,758
My goodness. Unbelievable.

643
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:43,010
How much have you had to drink?

644
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,096
My gosh.

645
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:02,697
ARTIST KO-O

646
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:06,826
KO-O'S SOLO EXHIBITION

647
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,746
KO-O, THE ILLUSTRATOR
WHO PAINTS BUILDINGS WITH SOUL

648
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,300
WHAT EXCITES YOU THE MOST
ABOUT BUILDINGS?

649
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,305
YOU DRAW NATURE AS WELL AS BUILDINGS
WHAT ARE YOUR INTERESTS?

650
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,598
CAN YOU TELL US
ABOUT YOUR DRAWING PROCESS?

651
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:33,227
WHY AREN'T THERE PEOPLE IN YOUR DRAWINGS?

652
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:36,856
I LOVE THINGS THAT DON'T CHANGE
BUT PEOPLE CHANGE OR DISAPPEAR OVER TIME

653
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:40,901
THAT'S WHY THERE ARE NO PEOPLE
OR TIME IN MY WORKS

654
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,964
Ji-ung, our team leader
was looking for you.

655
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:04,342
I know. He's calling me every ten minutes.

656
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:05,760
Didn't you go home again?

657
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:06,844
Do I smell?

658
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:08,220
How many days has it been?

659
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:09,638
It's only my fourth day.

660
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:10,973
I told you to go home.

661
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:13,517
Don't make it a habit
of living in the editing room.

662
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:16,604
Mr. Park said he couldn't
go home at all when he was an assistant.

663
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:19,231
Hey, don't listen to anything he says.

664
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:21,734
There's nothing worth listening to.

665
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,613
-Oh, right. Chae-ran.
-Yes?

666
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,908
-Work with me on my next project.
-When I'm done with Mr. Park's.

667
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:31,077
It's fine. I'm going to steal you away.

668
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:37,917
Were you looking for me?

669
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:42,588
Do you know what time it is?

670
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,800
Let me get a proper break.

671
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:51,680
I'm guessing that you
need me to work my ass off for something.

672
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:53,599
You've gotten smart.

673
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:56,852
I'm telling you in advance.

674
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:59,230
I'm not doing documentaries
on people anymore.

675
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:01,065
Why not?

676
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:02,942
They're boring.

677
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:05,444
I want something related
to the environment. It will be perfect.

678
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:08,239
Environment? Don't you know
how tough that is?

679
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:10,074
But they're fun.

680
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:13,244
I heard Yun-jin doesn't want to do it.
Just give that to me.

681
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:18,791
Fine. Do it. I'll give you that one.

682
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:21,001
What?

683
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,629
What's going on?

684
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:26,340
What's gotten into you? Are you serious?

685
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,175
Do one on people first.

686
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,344
Then I'll let you do it. I swear!

687
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,012
Jeez. I knew it.

688
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,473
You'll never just let me
do something I want.

689
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:37,184
It's a simple one. It's not even a series.

690
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,563
Then you can get someone else to do it.
Like Mr. Han.

691
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,108
Hey. Look at this.

692
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,235
How about it?

693
00:40:56,871 --> 00:41:00,332
Someone who loves me deeply,
someone I can always be with--

694
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,793
-Ridiculous.
-My gosh!

695
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,503
What? What is it?

696
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:06,213
What is it? Tell me.

697
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,590
How could I not know?

698
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:09,049
Why? Did you find Ko-o?

699
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:12,803
Hey, isn't that Ms. Kook?

700
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:16,182
I saw these videos before.
Why didn't I realize it was her?

701
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:18,517
Hold on. Is that the view count?

702
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,102
That's crazy.

703
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:21,937
Ms. Kook was harsh back then too.

704
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:24,607
She talks exactly the same way
as Mr. Jang.

705
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,859
Totally. She seems
harsher in these videos.

706
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:28,652
This kid's name is Ung.

707
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,863
She was so mean to him.

708
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:33,449
But Ung keeps fighting back.

709
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:36,452
Those two fight like cats and dogs.

710
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:40,456
But from what I remember,
Yeon-su's the one who starts the fight.

711
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:42,124
-Unbelievable.
-Is that so?

712
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,792
Totally.

713
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:47,880
I have the feeling that Yeon-su
has a crush on Ung.

714
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:53,677
Ms. Kook.

715
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,387
Hello, Ms. Kook.

716
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:57,014
Ji-un, that thing I asked for…

717
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:58,432
Ms. Kook, when…

718
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:02,811
Am I that similar to Mr. Jang?

719
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:05,189
Who? You?

720
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:08,025
Of course not.
You're much better than him.

721
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:10,277
So I'm just as annoying as he is.

722
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:13,113
-Of course not! We didn't mean that.
-No way!

723
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:17,284
I think the producers
made you look mean in the video.

724
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:20,663
Right. Did you sue them for this?
You really should.

725
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:22,331
-Right!
-Yes, you should.

726
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:24,542
What is it? Why are you all gathered here?

727
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:25,793
Is there something fun?

728
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:28,629
Do any of you know
how to get stuff like that deleted?

729
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:31,674
Well, it's from a television network,
so you should talk to them.

730
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:34,843
-Television? What's this about?
-Should I file a complaint?

731
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:36,512
Are you gathering the data?

732
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:38,806
Of course, we're getting
everything on Ko-o.

733
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:41,559
What is it? Tell me what's going on.

734
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,978
We have to hand over the files
by next week.

735
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:46,230
I guess you have a lot of time
on your hands.

736
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,150
-And Ye-in.
-Yes?

737
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,319
It wasn't me. It was him.

738
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:56,240
-What do you mean?
-He picked the fights first.

739
00:42:56,323 --> 00:43:00,119
-Ung was always the one who started it.
-Oh, I see.

740
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:04,456
Right. What I meant was…

741
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,376
What is it? Tell me.

742
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:09,295
Come on. Tell me.

743
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:12,131
I won't tell anyone,
so tell me what this is about.

744
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,385
-No.
-Yes.

745
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:17,928
Why do you always say no?

746
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:20,514
Why would I shoot that again?

747
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:23,309
Don't you see the views?
Look at the comments.

748
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:26,145
This is the most popular documentary
on our channel.

749
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:28,022
It's just trending for a while.

750
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:30,482
Plus, it seems like
only kids are watching it.

751
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,818
Do you know
what our director's saying these days?

752
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:35,029
"We have to attract more young viewers."

753
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:38,782
Can you come up with a better idea
to attract young viewers than this?

754
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:42,286
Do we film anything that has
a lot of views and young viewers?

755
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:43,537
Can't you just do it?

756
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:48,626
Do you know why dating reality shows
are popular these days?

757
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:52,588
It's even more dramatic
than any of the TV series.

758
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:54,256
Look at this.

759
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,967
There aren't any TV series
that's this entertaining.

760
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:59,845
If we show how these kids
have changed after ten years,

761
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:03,057
it'll be epic. I guarantee you.

762
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:07,269
If we do a good job,
we'll get a totally popular documentary.

763
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:09,980
But why would I film that?
You're the one who made it.

764
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,233
I'm not young anymore.

765
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,110
I'm old now.

766
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,320
Plus…

767
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:21,659
SCHOOL LIFE PLAYBOOK

768
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:23,160
Hey, Ji-ung!

769
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:25,704
You must know them the best.

770
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:28,791
Do you still keep in touch with them?

771
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:32,002
How are they doing? I'm curious myself.

772
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:34,088
It's been ten years.

773
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:36,840
Have they changed a lot?

774
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:50,020
They all say he's cute.

775
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:51,689
This won't do.

776
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:54,858
"I'm an acquaintance of Choi Ung."

777
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:58,779
"He's still as weird as he is

778
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:01,031
in this video."

779
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:03,867
All right.

780
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:08,747
Ung! You have a call!

781
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:13,335
Ung!

782
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:15,963
Jeez.

783
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:27,599
Ung!

784
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:33,981
Ung!

785
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:35,774
Tell him I'll move the cabbages soon.

786
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:38,986
-No, it's not that.
-Do I have to do it now?

787
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:41,572
Look at it.

788
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:43,240
What's with you?

789
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:45,492
Come on. Get it. Hurry!

790
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:46,869
What?

791
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:48,704
Come on, answer it!

792
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,747
Hello?

793
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,916
It's hard to get in touch with you.

794
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,669
I heard you work late at night,
but you wouldn't pick up.

795
00:45:55,752 --> 00:45:58,589
And I called you in the morning,
but you still didn't pick up.

796
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:03,177
Oh, NJ. I didn't know I got a call. Hello.

797
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,387
You must be busier than idol singers.

798
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:08,348
I guess you must be busier
since the articles got out

799
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:10,225
about me buying your drawing.

800
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:15,314
Right. More people seem to
want to buy my drawings now. Thank you.

801
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:17,858
Is that it, though?

802
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:21,195
I want to see more of your work.

803
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:25,866
-What are you doing today?
-Oh, I'm moving cabbages--

804
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:27,743
What?

805
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:29,203
Jeez!

806
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:34,333
I'm actually moving cabbages--

807
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,462
Do you want to meet up later today?
I want to take a look around your studio.

808
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:40,964
Oh, today?

809
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:44,176
Yes, today. I think I can end early.

810
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:46,053
I see.

811
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:47,763
Tell her to come.

812
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:50,766
All right. Then let me know
when you're getting off work.

813
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,769
-I'll call you later then.
-Okay.

814
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:01,151
Oh, my god! This is crazy!

815
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:06,698
-Were you staying in touch with NJ?
-This is the first time.

816
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:09,535
When did you exchange numbers?

817
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:11,578
She asked for my number first.

818
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,539
She asked for your number? Why?

819
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:16,208
I don't know. Get away from me.
You're scaring me.

820
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:18,293
This is awesome! I can't believe it!

821
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:21,964
This must be a dream.
Choi Ung had a phone call with NJ.

822
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:23,298
-This is insane.
-But…

823
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:27,928
She called because she wants
a free drawing, right?

824
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:30,264
What?

825
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:31,765
I mean…

826
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:34,726
-"Is that it?" And then she said…
-Is that it?

827
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:37,563
-I want to see more of your work.
-"I want to see more of your work."

828
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:41,400
She wants a drawing for free, right?

829
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:46,446
Ung. NJ just bought a building
worth 15 billion won last week.

830
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:50,075
And just give her one if she asks.
Give her anything she wants.

831
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:53,829
Just give her everything you have!

832
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:56,039
Give her everything!

833
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:58,458
Is NJ really coming here?

834
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:00,586
I can't believe it!

835
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:04,172
-What should I wear?
-Hey, let me see your hands.

836
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,258
What for?

837
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:13,473
If you go through my stuff again,
you're dead.

838
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,892
I might die before that.
My heart's about to burst.

839
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:18,854
I've been a fan since her trainee days.
So let me off this time.

840
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:22,733
Do you think it makes sense
for you to be wearing that at home?

841
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:25,819
I guess you're right.

842
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,904
-Darn it. What do I wear?
-Jeez.

843
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:29,781
There's nothing to wear.

844
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:31,700
What?

845
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:33,702
Why are there two of these?

846
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:35,370
-Hey, that's--
-It's tacky.

847
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:38,915
No way.

848
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,293
Is that a matching couple's shirt?

849
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:43,670
What with the long face?

850
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:45,339
Shut up.

851
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:47,132
You wore matching t-shirts?

852
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:48,550
How cute.

853
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:51,345
A leather jacket.

854
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:53,513
Would it be too much?

855
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,490
Hello. Are you with someone?

856
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:12,616
Yes.

857
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,090
Mr. Jang?

858
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:38,517
This is pretty awkward.

859
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:40,686
What are you doing here alone?

860
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:42,979
Well, what does it look like?

861
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:45,273
Your reservation table is this way.

862
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:46,900
Oh, all right.

863
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:17,222
Ms. Kook Yeon-su?

864
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,727
You're Choi Ung, right?

865
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:24,938
You were in that documentary.
The worst student.

866
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:29,276
-No, I'm not.
-Come on. You are!

867
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,737
Hey, he said it's not him. Let's go.

868
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:37,576
I'm sure it's him!
He looks exactly the same.

869
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:39,035
Mr. Kang Min-su?

870
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:39,995
Yes. Please sit.

871
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:49,045
You finally came.

872
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:52,132
I'm sorry about last time.

873
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:56,344
-It's fine.
-Well, then shall we…

874
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:02,434
I still wanted to see you

875
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:05,228
even after being stood up four times

876
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:07,898
because I wanted to check something.

877
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,275
-What--
-We first set a date

878
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:12,736
to meet in Yeoido at 7 p.m.,
but you didn't come.

879
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:15,989
And then we set a date
to meet at Hongdae at eight.

880
00:51:16,072 --> 00:51:18,325
You stood me up both times
because of work.

881
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:20,827
Well, I--

882
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,329
The third was on a weekend.

883
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:23,830
We were to meet at three,

884
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:26,917
but you called at five-to
and canceled because of work.

885
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,251
The fourth was the lunch yesterday.

886
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:31,505
We were supposed to meet for 30 minutes
during lunch at your company building,

887
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:33,381
but you forgot that due to work.

888
00:51:33,965 --> 00:51:37,093
I guess you're doing all the work
at your company.

889
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:39,304
Mr. Kang…

890
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:43,266
So I told your friend for the fifth time
that I wanted to see you.

891
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:47,521
I just couldn't give up like that.

892
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:52,734
I was worried
that you wouldn't turn up again.

893
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:54,236
But thank you for coming.

894
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:58,365
I'm sorry about last time.

895
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:00,534
I was wondering

896
00:52:01,117 --> 00:52:04,871
if you were worth
all the time I was wasting,

897
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:07,916
but I see that you're not.

898
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:11,670
-What?
-This might seem petty…

899
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:16,675
That's right.
This is why I wanted to see you.

900
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:19,135
I hope you meet a nice man.

901
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:21,805
Wait…

902
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:25,350
I'm not sure you'll be able to though.

903
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:26,977
Bye, then.

904
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:11,104
Did you hear everything?

905
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:14,107
No.

906
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:23,033
You say that, but that smile
on your face bothers me.

907
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:24,576
I could hear everything.

908
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:27,203
I'd appreciate it
if you could pretend you didn't.

909
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:29,915
Do you mean about the blind date itself,

910
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:32,208
or about how you were rejected?

911
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:34,085
Which do you mean?

912
00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:39,507
Your food is ready, sir.

913
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:40,926
Thank you.

914
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:42,052
Enjoy.

915
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:47,724
Seems like you're eating alone.

916
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:49,935
Mind if I join you?

917
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:54,064
Wouldn't it be awkward
since we're wearing the same shirt?

918
00:53:54,856 --> 00:53:57,859
I think it'll be weirder to eat separately
with the same shirt on.

919
00:53:57,943 --> 00:54:01,237
I'll pay for my own food,

920
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:02,822
so just let me sit here.

921
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:07,452
Fine, then.

922
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:25,387
Stupid rain… My shoot isn't ending.

923
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:27,222
I'm so sorry.

924
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:29,808
Could I head over tomorrow morning?

925
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:49,035
Are you going to keep being such a bore?

926
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,621
I never considered myself boring.

927
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:57,168
Do you drink alone like this often?

928
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:59,421
Sometimes, after work.

929
00:54:59,504 --> 00:55:02,924
I see. I guess you
must be an empty shell too.

930
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:05,176
I don't understand.

931
00:55:06,302 --> 00:55:10,390
My teammates say that you and I are alike.

932
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:13,727
I'm not sure. Only our shirts are alike.

933
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:16,187
I was kind of startled when I heard that.

934
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:19,107
As I was looking at you,

935
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:23,403
I told myself that
I was much more human than you.

936
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:27,490
Are you drunk?
Or are you pretending to be?

937
00:55:28,324 --> 00:55:29,909
I don't get drunk.

938
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,704
The amount of liquor I can hold
has increased over time.

939
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:48,136
There really isn't anything to talk about.

940
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,598
I can talk endlessly about work,

941
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:53,141
but I don't want to right now.

942
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:55,477
I'm ready to hear anything work-related.

943
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,896
Well, what should I talk about?

944
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:04,778
That shirt.

945
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:06,154
How much was it?

946
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:09,282
I used a discount coupon
and got it really cheap.

947
00:56:09,365 --> 00:56:11,284
I'd be upset if I paid more for it.

948
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:12,660
I paid full price for it.

949
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:15,497
That's good to hear.

950
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,292
But isn't it kind of amazing?

951
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:21,711
Wearing the same shirt
and coming to the same place.

952
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:26,049
It's my first time wearing
the same clothes as someone else.

953
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:27,509
This is still quite awkward.

954
00:56:28,384 --> 00:56:30,136
You never wore matching t-shirts?

955
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,263
I hate pathetic stuff like that.

956
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:38,728
I used to hate pathetic things too.

957
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:44,400
But I guess you've

958
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:46,444
done it before.

959
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:50,073
Well, you know…

960
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:52,283
Sometimes you become someone else.

961
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:55,995
-Is that so?
-I knew it.

962
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:59,958
I really am more human than you.

963
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:01,709
That again?

964
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:05,130
I used to be so childish.

965
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:25,692
Can I have a glass of that wine too?

966
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:28,236
Wine and soju aren't a great match.

967
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,989
It's fine. I enjoy all kinds of alcohol.

968
00:57:44,752 --> 00:57:46,045
Darn it.

969
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:47,964
Gosh, Eun-ho.

970
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,688
Jeez.

971
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:19,287
So…

972
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,540
just like ten years ago…

973
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:38,181
Eun-ho!

974
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:40,558
Darn it!

975
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:50,568
Jeez!

976
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:52,612
What time is it?

977
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,114
Hey, Eun-ho!

978
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:57,158
Aren't you going to get the door?

979
00:58:57,242 --> 00:59:01,120
…it all happened
regardless of my intentions again.

980
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:03,414
Who…

981
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:09,712
As if it had to happen.

982
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:16,261
I thought I'd never
be involved with him again.

983
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,347
It's better to just give up.

984
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:22,976
Why? Are they still on bad terms?
Do they still fight all the time?

985
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:30,858
The thing about love and hate is that
there is a very thin line between them.

986
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:32,986
They're two sides of the same coin.

987
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:34,946
What are you on about?

988
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:36,781
They were together

989
00:59:36,864 --> 00:59:39,117
for about five years.

990
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:42,495
They actually dated?

991
00:59:54,048 --> 00:59:55,300
Darn it!

992
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:07,562
-Will you close the door again?
-And they broke up pretty badly.

993
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:11,190
They hurt each other so much

994
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:13,901
that they'll probably never
see each other again.

995
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:28,374
I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER

996
01:00:40,553 --> 01:00:42,096
-What did you say?
-Let's break up.

997
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:44,515
Do you really have to do this now?

998
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:46,100
Why shouldn't I?

999
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:47,477
This is the fifth time.

1000
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:48,686
Two of them were you.

1001
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:50,980
-Do you really mean it? Gosh.
-Yes.

1002
01:00:52,106 --> 01:00:52,982
You're at it again.

1003
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:55,068
You just need everything to go your way.

1004
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:56,569
What? What is it this time?

1005
01:00:56,653 --> 01:01:00,156
You always make conclusions
by yourself without talking to me.

1006
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:02,784
You always thought that
about me, didn't you?

1007
01:01:02,867 --> 01:01:05,828
-I'm the selfish bitch, aren't I?
-Stop that.

1008
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:08,373
You just don't want to be
the one to break up.

1009
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:11,250
-Yeon-su.
-I'll be a bitch, just like you wanted.

1010
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:13,086
So let's end this, okay?

1011
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:18,049
Yeon-su!

1012
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:22,762
I bought you that shirt.

1013
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:48,746
I wouldn't have come to see you
if it wasn't for this.

1014
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:49,706
Is that so?

1015
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,750
-What?
-So how was it to see her again?

1016
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:55,628
-I don't even remember what I said.
-Are you nuts?

1017
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:58,089
-Do you like me that much or not?
-Hey, don't.

1018
01:01:58,172 --> 01:01:59,132
Stop following me.

1019
01:02:00,007 --> 01:02:05,680
I think someone is
stealing your car right now.

1020
01:02:05,763 --> 01:02:08,057
They look like a couple
that they're together.

1021
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:09,100
You bastard.

1022
01:02:09,183 --> 01:02:10,810
It's been five years after all.

1023
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:13,146
What if I was serious
and didn't act childish?

1024
01:02:14,021 --> 01:02:15,648
Would you have managed?

1025
01:02:17,191 --> 01:02:21,654
