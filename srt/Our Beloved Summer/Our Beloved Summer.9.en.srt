1
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,714
Are you done? Where's Yeon-su?

2
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:52,010
We didn't know it would
suddenly rain so much.

3
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:53,595
I just came to get these.

4
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,722
Ms. Kook is still on standby.

5
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:56,848
I see.

6
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:59,893
We should just call it a day.
It's pouring.

7
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:03,230
I'll go get Ms. Kook then.
She probably doesn't have an umbrella.

8
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,066
I'll go.

9
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:10,987
What is it?

10
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,449
Did you decide to shoot this

11
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:17,953
because of Ms. Kook?

12
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:31,216
Where's Yeon-su?

13
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:33,593
Why is it raining so much?

14
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,180
I hate it when things

15
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,808
Where should we shoot the rest?

16
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,400
Anything I can't control

17
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:51,945
is just a risk.

18
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:55,949
Back then and even now,

19
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,119
Yeon-su is someone like that to me.

20
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,622
The first time I saw Yeon-su…

21
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,962
No, that's not important.

22
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:17,804
It doesn't matter who liked her first.

23
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:23,435
I was the jerk

24
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:29,274
So I had to keep making plans…

25
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,201
in order to not cross any lines.

26
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:51,797
Hey, Yeon-su and I are going to eat
at our restaurant. Join us.

27
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:54,549
I didn't want to be someone

28
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:57,177
who would childishly teeter

29
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,178
I'm busy.

30
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,972
What do you mean?
You're reading a comic book.

31
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:03,058
I just finished.

32
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,309
I have a report to write.

33
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:09,064
Hey, I get that Yeon-su is kind of weird.

34
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,775
But you're being so obvious
that you don't like her.

35
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,109
She's my girlfriend.

36
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,736
It's nothing like that.

37
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,822
But why do I feel like
you're avoiding her?

38
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,156
I'm not.

39
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,492
Stop the nonsense and just go.

40
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,786
She'll yell at you for being late. Go.

41
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,414
At first, it was hard.

42
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:28,083
By the way,

43
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,960
you're weirder than she is.

44
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:38,009
But I got used to it after a while.

45
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,097
My plan was simple.

46
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,311
Ji-ung, can you give me a ride…

47
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,315
Don't get involved

48
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,441
Darn it.

49
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:00,198
We broke up.

50
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:07,330
Don't get fooled by words like that.

51
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,919
Just go and apologize.

52
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:15,672
Should we try out
the newteokbokkiplace today?

53
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,090
-It seems pretty good.
-Okay.

54
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:18,592
Try to meet new people.

55
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:31,188
It looks as if it's over
for real this time, right?

56
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:46,036
KOOK YEON-SU

57
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:46,953
DELETE, SYNC CONTACT, SHARE CONTACT

58
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:53,168
I promised myself not to be shaken

59
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,046
Yeon-su!

60
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:57,672
And…

61
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,388
to slowly forget her.

62
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:14,731
But just when I had thought

63
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,192
How have you been, Ji-ung?

64
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,238
…Yeon-su appeared in front of me again.

65
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,744
As a risk that's out of my control.

66
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,372
Just like now.

67
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,084
But…

68
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,962
now I'm thinking,

69
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,090
if things won't go according to plan,

70
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:44,886
do I even need a plan anymore?

71
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,598
EPISODE 9
JUST FRIENDS

72
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:54,200
Ung! I called you so many times!

73
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,327
You're still sleeping?

74
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:00,165
Ung.

75
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,125
Ung?

76
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,296
Are you okay?

77
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,550
Oh, gosh.

78
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,385
Get up.

79
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:14,345
You're burning up!

80
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:15,555
Are you okay?

81
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,456
CULTURE-COMPLEX, BEAUTY, FASHION

82
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,291
Thanks to our past projects,

83
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:47,086
we have a lot of marketing requests
for culture-complex centers.

84
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:50,840
The ones we can work on…

85
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,885
Ms. Kook.

86
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,180
Ms. Kook!

87
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,141
Oh, right.

88
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,352
Are you okay?

89
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,146
Are you not feeling well?

90
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,398
You look a bit pale.

91
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,943
You should have gotten more rest.
Are you really okay?

92
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:13,530
I'm sorry. Let's take a short break.

93
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:15,782
All right.

94
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,538
She's been like that for days.

95
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,748
Five days to be exact.

96
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:27,293
She's been out of it
since she came back from her leave.

97
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,587
Did something happen?

98
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,467
What's wrong with me?

99
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:49,607
This isn't right.

100
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,449
SOL-I

101
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,872
-Yes?
-What?

102
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:07,083
It's not like you to answer right away.

103
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,459
What's up?

104
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:10,545
Come over after work.

105
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:11,754
I have a new dish.

106
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,673
Next time. I'm busy.

107
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,801
Again? But your last project just ended.

108
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,344
I need to test out my dish.

109
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,096
Call someone else.

110
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:26,311
Why don't you try calling Gu Eun-ho?

111
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,104
He's trying it right now.

112
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:31,941
But he says everything tastes bad.
I can't trust him.

113
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,401
What?

114
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,987
Why's he over there? Isn't he working?

115
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:36,988
Is he not busy?

116
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,199
-Hey, aren't you busy?
-No.

117
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:42,493
Why are you always free?
Don't you have work?

118
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,957
It seems like he's unemployed.

119
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,876
He's resting since Ung's taking a break.

120
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:51,502
He's taking a break?

121
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:53,963
Anyway, come over after you get off work.

122
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:03,014
What is Ung thinking?

123
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,460
How long have I been like this?

124
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:34,522
Mom.

125
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,084
Mom!

126
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,044
You're up.

127
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:59,380
Come here.
Let me see if your fever's down.

128
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,473
Your fever's all gone.

129
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:12,560
You get a bad fever when you catch a cold.

130
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:16,439
Have you been taking the medicine
I sent you last time?

131
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,274
-Yes.
-Really?

132
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,193
You only took some and stopped, right?

133
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:23,362
I heard you got drenched
in the rain during the trip.

134
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:27,533
I should rip Eun-ho's mouth out.

135
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,250
But what were you doing here?

136
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:39,712
I think this is the first time
seeing your drawings

137
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,005
up close like this.

138
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:45,259
You left early when I drew at that event.

139
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:53,476
When did my son grow up so much?

140
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,437
What?

141
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:00,024
I've been a grown man for quite a while.

142
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,280
Why did you grow up all alone?

143
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,536
It must have been difficult for you.

144
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:16,415
Don't try to carry
all the burden yourself.

145
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:17,583
You don't have to.

146
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:23,381
I guess me and Dad
are still quite lacking

147
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,466
for you to depend on us.

148
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:28,719
It's not that, so don't worry.

149
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,806
I'm just more comfortable alone.

150
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:35,518
Ung, but still…

151
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,437
Mom, it's okay.
I like the way things are right now.

152
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,068
It's okay to be alone from the start.

153
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,070
You'd be used to it.

154
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,740
But being alone after being with someone

155
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,286
isn't something

156
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:08,050
We just had instant noodles
for lunch the first day.

157
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:11,137
And we grilled meat
and made stew for dinner.

158
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,222
One of them was a really good cook.

159
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,266
And then the next day…

160
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,769
What did we have again?

161
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,982
Right, the cast slept in,
so the rest of us ate out.

162
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,150
And then for lunch--

163
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,861
Hey, I wasn't asking what you ate there.

164
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:28,988
I see.

165
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:33,117
Ji-ung filmed Ms. Kook on the first day,

166
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,286
and Chae-ran filmed Mr. Choi.

167
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,413
I stayed back and set up the lights.

168
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,624
And we filmed at the house in the evening.

169
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,167
-And then--
-No, not that.

170
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,295
Didn't anything interesting happen?

171
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,549
Right. The casts' friends were really fun.

172
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:51,510
They showed me around the village.

173
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:55,097
Hey. Eat up.

174
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:56,390
Drink up.

175
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:57,642
Just shut up and drink.

176
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,353
Jeez.

177
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,317
Oh, right.

178
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:08,653
There was heavy rain all of a sudden

179
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,197
so we had to stop filming for a whole day.

180
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:12,698
And?

181
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:16,243
Chae-ran was with Ms. Kook,
but she came back alone.

182
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:20,206
And then Ji-ung arrived
with Ms. Kook a while later.

183
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:25,670
And Mr. Choi was gone for a long time
then came back all drenched.

184
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,089
Is that so?

185
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,216
So what happened?

186
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,676
We canceled the shoot.

187
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,261
We were going to film more the next day,

188
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:37,139
but we couldn't because the cast
went back to Seoul in the morning.

189
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,100
I see…

190
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,852
But why didn't you tell me earlier?

191
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:44,605
You should have told me
when I asked if anything happened!

192
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,943
But why did the cast leave so early?

193
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,655
Well, it seemed like urgent business.

194
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:56,909
But it did seem like
something was going on.

195
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,037
It felt like the cast might have fought…

196
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:03,249
No, it felt different than a fight.

197
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,584
But what's even more strange

198
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:08,379
is that Ji-ung and Chae-ran
were acting weird too.

199
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:09,922
They were quiet.

200
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,757
-Why?
-Well…

201
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,635
I'm not sure why.

202
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:18,431
But the two of them went out to talk
that night for a long time.

203
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,058
Just the two of them?

204
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,771
Really? Is that so?

205
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,752
Ji-ung, I ordered dinner.

206
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:49,628
Come and have some later.

207
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:02,558
Did you get off work?

208
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:06,979
Did you have dinner yet?

209
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,403
Did you get a good…

210
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,117
I want to make it seem like

211
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,287
nothing's happened between us, but…

212
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,889
KIM JI-UNG

213
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,614
Where are you? Give me the address.

214
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,116
Are you coming for me?

215
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,701
I can find you easily. Delete the video.

216
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,370
I'm the producer.

217
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:07,039
Not if you end up dead. Delete it.

218
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:09,834
You make that face all the time anyway.

219
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,710
That's the best I can get out of you.

220
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,505
It's the producer that's the problem.

221
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,885
LEEZAKAYA

222
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:22,930
Fine, I'll delete it.

223
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,056
Did you have dinner?

224
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,167
WITH UNG

225
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,712
-You're back.
-Hey.

226
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,547
How is he? Is his fever down?

227
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,631
Yes.

228
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:01,510
His fever's down,
and I gave him some food.

229
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:08,350
-But why do you look so down?
-What?

230
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:11,562
-Is he not feeling well?
-It's not that.

231
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:14,148
I looked around his studio,

232
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,233
and it seemed
he still has trouble sleeping.

233
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,444
He has a lot more pills now.

234
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,739
He must be spending all his time there.

235
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:25,284
When I looked around,

236
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,453
it seemed so lonely there.

237
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,788
-Is that so?
-Yes.

238
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:35,336
Do you think he will be okay like this?

239
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:40,174
Ung isn't that weak.

240
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:42,384
He'll be all right.

241
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:55,147
UNG'S DRAWINGS ORGANIZED BY EUN-HO

242
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,696
DRAWINGS FROM UNG'S DARK TIMES

243
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,409
I like that you're an amazing artist

244
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:51,161
but I hope you never experience

245
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,747
-Did you sleep with him?
-Are you crazy?

246
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:38,584
So that means you're ruining my new dish

247
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:41,253
over something as trivial as a kiss?

248
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:42,337
"Trivial"?

249
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:45,257
Is that why you two ran away the next day?

250
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,926
That's so boring!

251
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,595
Isn't there anything interesting?

252
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:55,434
Honestly, it's more surprising
that nothing has happened until now.

253
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:57,686
If I were with my ex,

254
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,522
I'd be overwhelmed with regret

255
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:02,024
and become all sentimental.

256
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,193
I'd get wasted and jump at him.

257
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:08,572
I really must be crazy
to come here and tell you all this.

258
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:10,741
Hey, you're adults.

259
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,826
Plus, you two used to date.

260
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:16,330
Things like that can happen
when the mood is right.

261
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,290
Everyone does that. What's the problem?

262
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:20,167
Not everyone is like you.

263
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,044
Not everyone is like you, either.

264
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:28,634
Just say, "Oh, it was a mistake"
and forget about it.

265
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,427
It's not that simple.

266
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:34,348
You always seem to complicate things.

267
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:39,645
Why are you sulking? What's the problem?

268
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,980
He hasn't called me since then

269
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:44,233
after he did something like that.

270
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,987
Hey, what are your fingers for?
You call him.

271
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:53,909
Or maybe he's already made up his mind.

272
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:57,996
He's decided to go,
"Sorry. It was a mistake."

273
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,707
He's not the type to do that.

274
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:02,167
What are you on about?

275
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:05,963
Do you still think he's your boyfriend?
You don't know anything.

276
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:08,799
He might seem dim-witted on the outside,

277
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:11,176
but he's actually much more
prudent than I am.

278
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,971
Jeez. Don't you get it?

279
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:16,765
If he wanted to get back together,
he would have come to you already.

280
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,142
But he…

281
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:31,405
Do you…

282
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:37,369
want to get back with him?

283
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,337
Are you worried that Ung might say

284
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:49,965
that it was all a mistake?

285
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:54,928
Don't tell me you still…

286
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:05,731
Yeon-su.

287
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,319
Since when?

288
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:15,782
From when you met him again?

289
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:25,209
Even on that day when I went to

290
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:28,170
since I had brutally dumped him…

291
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:30,756
Who…

292
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:33,759
…I was confident.

293
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,939
I just had to keep a hold of myself.

294
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:50,234
How have you been?

295
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:54,238
Answer me.

296
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,658
How have you been?

297
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:01,828
I just had to hide my feelings.

298
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:17,803
But…

299
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,726
What do I do, Sol-i?

300
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,482
I'm not confident anymore.

301
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,822
Yes. I'm eating something disgusting.

302
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,957
Why are you just standing there
with the lights off?

303
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,004
Your other room was squeaky clean too.

304
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,257
At least you seem to be cleaning properly.

305
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,474
I'll be staying here for a while.

306
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:48,769
Do whatever you want.

307
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,395
Like you always have.

308
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:06,495
I was in a good mood today.

309
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:12,209
Enjoy.

310
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,377
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

311
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:29,768
This is a disaster.

312
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,570
I'm done thinking.

313
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:44,074
I've reached a conclusion.

314
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,641
What are you doing?

315
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:15,939
Yeon-su.

316
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:22,195
Have you been drinking?

317
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,118
-Are you a douchebag?
-What?

318
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:31,997
You've really changed.

319
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:35,459
I don't care what you've been up to

320
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:39,171
or how free you had been all this time.

321
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:43,383
-But…
-Do you want some water?

322
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:50,307
After what you've done,

323
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,851
how can you pretend
as if nothing's happened?

324
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:56,146
Is that what people do these days?

325
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:58,565
Do they just kiss
and hold hands with anyone

326
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,066
and pretend it didn't happen?

327
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:02,152
You don't have to yell.

328
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:04,362
Since when did that become acceptable?

329
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:06,239
That's just being a douchebag.

330
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:24,925
Are you done?

331
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,980
How are you acting
as if nothing's happened?

332
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:45,820
Did you really have
nothing to say to me this whole time?

333
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:50,450
Really?

334
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,121
Should I apologize…

335
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,250
and say it was a mistake?

336
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:00,335
What?

337
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:03,171
Is that what you want?

338
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:11,888
But I don't want to.

339
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:15,725
Then what?

340
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,228
Then what do you want to do?

341
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,612
I'm not dating you again.

342
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:35,036
This is the conclusion I came to.

343
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:39,457
I see.

344
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:46,172
So you don't want to say that
it was a mistake and apologize

345
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:50,093
or start dating me again.

346
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:54,639
You just want me to get lost.

347
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:00,562
You should have told me faster
instead of dragging this out.

348
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:08,153
Despite what happened,

349
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:09,404
-Yeon-su.
-Don't call me.

350
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,823
I'm never going to
see you again, you jerk.

351
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,199
Should we be friends?

352
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,593
Let's be friends.

353
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:35,221
What?

354
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:39,476
You want us to be what?

355
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,144
Friends.

356
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:42,646
Why?

357
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:46,358
We've never tried being friends before.

358
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:56,159
Who knows?

359
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:59,120
We could be good friends.

360
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:01,289
Have you been drinking?

361
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:02,624
It's you who's been drinking.

362
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:07,003
-Or are you on your medication?
-Not yet. I'm taking them later.

363
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,092
Can you really be friends with me?

364
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:15,971
Yes.

365
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:30,443
Fine.

366
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,113
Let's be friends, then.

367
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:36,908
This is going to be fun.

368
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:51,172
Do you have anything else…

369
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,094
Can I stay over?

370
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:58,179
What?

371
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:01,182
We're friends, so that's okay, right?

372
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,088
Is this because you're drunk?

373
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:34,507
I'm doing this because we're friends.

374
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:37,135
-Hey.
-Where's your blanket?

375
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,804
You're not making a friend
sleep without a blanket, right?

376
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:40,972
Yeon-su!

377
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:43,183
You don't have to yell.

378
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:44,225
Jeez.

379
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:47,312
As you can see, I drank quite a lot.

380
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:50,440
I'm really tired, so can you be quiet?

381
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:54,736
Just go sleep on the bed then.
I'm going to be working downstairs.

382
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,947
No way. We're just friends,
so let's keep it that way.

383
00:35:58,031 --> 00:35:59,449
And get me a blanket.

384
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:57,090
What is she thinking?

385
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,594
KIM JI-UNG

386
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:15,108
The person you have called…

387
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:45,740
That's an enthusiastic greeting.

388
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,992
What are you still doing here?

389
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:49,994
I took a shower.
Can I borrow your clothes?

390
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:51,412
I need some fresh clothes.

391
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:53,414
Just go home then.

392
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,917
-Why? Can't I stay?
-Why would you?

393
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,128
Because I want to hang out with my friend.
What's the problem?

394
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:01,422
Come on. Why are you doing this?

395
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,341
You know I don't have friends.

396
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:06,302
I'm excited that I've made a new friend
for the first time in 29 years.

397
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:09,681
Feel free to tell me
if you want to stop being friends.

398
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:17,647
I'll take some clothes from your closet.

399
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,983
Why aren't you sleeping?
Are you going to sleep now?

400
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:20,942
I'm going to.

401
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,403
Go to bed then. I'll just hang out here.

402
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:28,199
I hope you're gone by the time I'm up.

403
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:31,202
I'll decide that for myself, friend.
Get some sleep.

404
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:32,537
Unbelievable.

405
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,252
Jeez, what's wrong with her?

406
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:43,339
Wait.

407
00:39:46,676 --> 00:39:48,678
How did she know I didn't get any sleep?

408
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:17,081
Good work.
Did you get some sleep on the plane?

409
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,460
What day is it today?

410
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:23,087
-It's Sunday, right?
-It's Saturday.

411
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,840
What? It isn't Sunday?

412
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:28,551
What are you doing on Sunday?
Why do you keep asking?

413
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:31,012
My schedule's empty on Sunday, right?

414
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,056
Yes, I told you.

415
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:37,310
-I'm going on a date.
-You don't mean…

416
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:39,270
-That artist?
-Yes.

417
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:41,564
Are you sure it's a date?

418
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:45,360
It's a date
if a man and a woman meet alone.

419
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,487
And we set up a date properly this time.

420
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:51,282
All right.
Just please don't cause any trouble.

421
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:52,992
Be careful.

422
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:56,120
I haven't caused any trouble these days.
Don't worry.

423
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,417
Wait, he'll be asleep.

424
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:04,754
-I'll call him later.
-Hang on.

425
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:09,175
Were you actually
being considerate just now?

426
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:13,638
Hey, you're right.

427
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:15,890
I didn't know I could do that.

428
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,851
I've changed.

429
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,071
Eat up before you go.

430
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,991
Ung.

431
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:39,914
How can your repertoire
be exactly the same every time?

432
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,291
That's actually incredible.

433
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:46,546
At least have one bite.

434
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:49,715
We can talk while you eat.

435
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,427
You always come and go whenever you want.

436
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:56,681
You don't have to try to act
like a mother to me in between.

437
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:41,726
You're still here?

438
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:43,769
Hey, you're up.

439
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:47,565
You slept less than expected.

440
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,442
You could die early at this rate.

441
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:50,776
Hey, that shirt…

442
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:54,197
Oh, this? I found it in your closet.

443
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,489
You didn't throw it away.

444
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:58,242
I didn't know it was there.

445
00:42:58,326 --> 00:43:00,328
Really? It was folded up neatly though.

446
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:05,666
Do you feel awkward that I'm wearing
the matching shirt we wore as a couple

447
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,001
when we're friends now?

448
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:09,754
Gosh. Not at all. Do whatever you want.

449
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:10,713
Fine.

450
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:14,467
There were a lot of side dishes
in the fridge, so I made some stew.

451
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:15,760
-Do you want some?
-Hey.

452
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:18,471
This is my house,
and that's my food you're eating.

453
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:20,431
What should we do after we eat?

454
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:23,226
Do you want to play video games?

455
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:24,685
Aren't you going to go home?

456
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,563
Why? Can't I stay longer? We're friends--

457
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:30,608
You keep emphasizing the word "friend."
Why is that?

458
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:33,819
But you really want us
to be friends, right?

459
00:43:33,903 --> 00:43:36,239
-Yes.
-Right. That's why.

460
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:39,242
So let me hang out here today.
That's okay, right?

461
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:42,787
All right, fine. Let's hang out all day.

462
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:14,277
What is it?

463
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,153
You have an interview today, remember?

464
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:18,864
-I'll pick you up at two.
-Right.

465
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:22,243
Cancel the interview for me.

466
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:23,869
What? Why?

467
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:28,708
I'm still not feeling that good.

468
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:30,084
Are you still sick?

469
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:31,752
I heard your fever went down.

470
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:33,462
Then I'll come over later.

471
00:44:33,546 --> 00:44:37,550
No, don't come. I'm going to sleep. Bye.

472
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:48,853
Listen.

473
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:54,525
Luckily, I don't have any plans today.
So I'll hang out with you.

474
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:56,068
Okay, friend.

475
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:05,036
Do you want some?

476
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:08,581
I'll get it myself.

477
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:21,594
Ji-ung. Didn't you go home yesterday?

478
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:23,471
Why are you here on a weekend?

479
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:26,640
I was helping Mr. Park with a program.

480
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:29,310
Why would they do that
without asking me first?

481
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:30,853
Don't. I'll go talk to him.

482
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:32,897
It's nothing. I'll be done soon.

483
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,816
By the way, I notified everyone
that we're filming on Monday.

484
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:40,237
And I got a strange call a while ago.

485
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:41,822
What do you mean?

486
00:45:42,365 --> 00:45:44,825
I don't know if it's true, but…

487
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:46,202
What is it?

488
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:49,080
NJ wants to appear on our program.

489
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:50,498
What? Who told you that?

490
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,166
NJ herself.

491
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:55,044
Appear as what?

492
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:56,670
As Choi Ung's friend.

493
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:10,559
This is so stressful.

494
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:13,687
Is this my third or my fourth win?

495
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,773
Why are you so good at this game?

496
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:18,359
Well, it'll be harder to find
something I'm not good at.

497
00:46:18,943 --> 00:46:20,111
You're so annoying.

498
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:23,739
You should be reflecting on why you lost
instead of blaming others.

499
00:46:23,823 --> 00:46:25,741
Video games require brains too.

500
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:28,285
Let's play just one more game.

501
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:30,454
Let's make a bet then.

502
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:32,915
If I keep going,
I'll just be doing you a favor.

503
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:34,333
What should we bet then?

504
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:36,627
One of your drawings.

505
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:39,880
Do you even know how much they cost?

506
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:42,425
-You can try to beat me then.
-Jeez.

507
00:46:43,092 --> 00:46:45,719
All right, hang on. Let me get more juice.

508
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:49,014
Aren't you going to answer your phone?

509
00:46:49,098 --> 00:46:50,266
I bet it's Eun-ho.

510
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:56,480
NJ

511
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:08,200
I guess you're quite close to her.

512
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:11,203
-Who?
-That famous singer.

513
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:14,415
NJ.

514
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:16,792
Just a bit.

515
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:20,588
It seems you keep in touch with her,

516
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:24,175
and she visits you often
despite her busy schedule.

517
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:29,138
Is there something going on
between you two?

518
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:30,681
What?

519
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:32,641
Why are you startled? Is there?

520
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:36,312
I mean, I was startled you asked that.

521
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:38,606
Friends can ask things like that.

522
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:43,319
I guess you can since we're friends.

523
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:47,907
Then let me ask you this.

524
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:50,576
What was going on
between you and Mr. Jang?

525
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:54,371
-What?
-I can ask that since we're friends.

526
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:57,625
We just know each other through work.

527
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:00,169
The others didn't seem to think that.

528
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:01,420
What do you mean?

529
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:05,966
And since we're on the topic,

530
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:08,844
since when were you so close to Ji-ung?

531
00:48:09,345 --> 00:48:10,179
Really?

532
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:12,139
You two were never that close.

533
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:14,934
Are you being jealous right now?

534
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:16,685
-Yes.
-What?

535
00:48:16,769 --> 00:48:18,145
What?

536
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:27,112
What I'm saying is

537
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,075
don't steal Ji-ung away from me.
He's my friend.

538
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:38,707
NJ

539
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,044
NJ

540
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:11,073
Sol-i.

541
00:49:12,241 --> 00:49:15,160
If you take another step,
I won't let you leave.

542
00:49:15,244 --> 00:49:17,288
You have to help me with this.

543
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:21,959
-I was just passing by.
-You come here every day.

544
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:24,795
I know, right?
This place is pretty charming.

545
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:27,089
The owner here is even more charming.

546
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:29,341
Don't like me.
I don't date younger guys.

547
00:49:29,425 --> 00:49:32,595
Really? Thank you.
You have to keep your word!

548
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:35,306
Hey, why don't you come in for a minute?

549
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:36,807
No, I'm not going to help you.

550
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:39,685
That's not why I want you inside.
Come on in.

551
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:42,354
-No, I have to go.
-Where are you going?

552
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:45,274
Hey. Stop bumming around and work.

553
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:47,109
I had work today,

554
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:49,069
but Ung suddenly canceled.

555
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,113
He said he's still sick,

556
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:52,656
so I'm going to check in on him.

557
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:55,701
He's sick?

558
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:59,288
Yes. I'm I heard he was all better,
but he says he's sick again.

559
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,624
And he told me not to come.

560
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:04,251
But, as his manager,
I should go check in on him.

561
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:06,128
No, you shouldn't go.

562
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:07,463
Why?

563
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:11,258
-I'm sure he has a guest.
-A guest? Who?

564
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:13,886
Never mind. Anyway, you shouldn't go.

565
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:15,137
Just come here.

566
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,097
-Come on.
-No.

567
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:19,350
You promised not to do that.

568
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:20,976
I'm off-limits.

569
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:24,521
You're such a little brat.

570
00:50:24,605 --> 00:50:27,024
Come over here
before I shower you with scallions.

571
00:50:32,488 --> 00:50:35,074
-Are you leaving?
-Yes. Aren't you?

572
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:36,950
I'm going to work a little more. Go on.

573
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:38,035
All right.

574
00:50:43,332 --> 00:50:45,084
Do you have something to say?

575
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:48,253
Ji-ung, well…

576
00:50:50,923 --> 00:50:52,883
Do you want to join me for dinner?

577
00:50:56,387 --> 00:50:59,348
You have to eat
if you're going to keep working,

578
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:02,518
and I don't have much to eat at home.

579
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:03,644
Sure.

580
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:06,271
Why are you explaining yourself?
Let's go eat.

581
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:11,235
We could have eaten out.

582
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:13,779
It's fine. You have to get back to work.

583
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:15,531
Fine, then.

584
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,914
Stop staring at me and spit it out.

585
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:27,751
Well, it's…

586
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:31,296
Are you having a rough time?

587
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:34,550
Do you want to be transferred
to a different team? Or quit?

588
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:37,511
I won't let you quit before I do.
You'd better get in line.

589
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:40,639
It's not that.

590
00:51:40,723 --> 00:51:42,391
Then what is it?

591
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:44,768
Why do you keep staring at me?

592
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:47,980
Do you like Ms. Kook, Ji-ung?

593
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:54,486
Oh, I'm sorry.

594
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:57,197
That was too personal.

595
00:51:57,281 --> 00:51:59,158
It just slipped out.

596
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:00,993
I'm sorry.

597
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:03,328
If you're sorry…

598
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:07,082
keep this a secret.

599
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:09,752
I haven't told anyone yet.

600
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,553
Was I that obvious?
I don't want anyone to know.

601
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:23,390
No, I only noticed
because I watched you carefully.

602
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:26,101
You should be focused on work.

603
00:52:26,185 --> 00:52:27,561
That won't do.

604
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:37,613
-It's pretty low, right?
-What?

605
00:52:38,197 --> 00:52:39,907
I'm deceiving my friend

606
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,117
and liking her in secret.

607
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:45,621
You can't control how you feel.

608
00:52:46,205 --> 00:52:47,456
Are you taking my side?

609
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:49,958
I guess it's nice to have a junior.

610
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:54,546
Don't worry.

611
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:57,883
I'll finish this project without
getting my personal feelings involved.

612
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:06,141
-I'm ordering chicken!
-What?

613
00:53:06,225 --> 00:53:07,810
I'm going to order chicken.

614
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:08,977
You're leaving?

615
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:30,123
I shouldn't spy on other people's phones.

616
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:51,061
But…

617
00:53:52,104 --> 00:53:54,398
I can't help it
if I accidentally end up seeing it.

618
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,483
It's not like I'm blind.

619
00:53:57,943 --> 00:53:58,944
GU EUN-HO

620
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:03,866
Ung, I rescheduled

621
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:06,201
Are you still feeling sick?

622
00:54:06,285 --> 00:54:08,161
And are you sure I don't have to come?

623
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,794
He said he had no plans.

624
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:18,839
What in the world is he thinking?

625
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,900
Did she really leave?

626
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:55,375
I don't want to go home.

627
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:22,653
I never said
you could snoop around my house.

628
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:57,521
You can't do whatever you want
because we're friends.

629
00:56:03,235 --> 00:56:04,611
What's your plan?

630
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:06,697
What?

631
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,490
You were waiting for me to come back

632
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:10,575
so you could spray salt and water on me.

633
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:12,577
You agreed to do the documentary

634
00:56:12,661 --> 00:56:15,455
just so that you can bully me,
hide from me, and reappear.

635
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:17,457
Then you kissed me.

636
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:20,335
And now you want to be friends?

637
00:56:22,421 --> 00:56:24,631
I have no idea what you're thinking

638
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:26,633
so I want to find out.

639
00:56:27,968 --> 00:56:29,136
I don't have any plans.

640
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:34,182
I just want us to get along as friends.
What's the problem?

641
00:56:35,434 --> 00:56:36,560
But…

642
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:43,358
why do I feel like you're lying?

643
00:56:50,574 --> 00:56:52,159
You're so conceited.

644
00:56:53,285 --> 00:56:54,870
I have something I want to hear from you.

645
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:58,331
Come to think of it,
you never said it to me.

646
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:01,668
So I want to hear you say it now.

647
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:03,795
You can keep pretending we're friends.

648
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:06,673
I'm going to make plans of my own.

649
00:57:08,717 --> 00:57:10,093
Oh, and…

650
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:13,597
I'm taking this since I won the bet.

651
00:57:15,474 --> 00:57:19,269
Isn't this the amusement park
where we broke up for the fourth time?

652
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:22,397
I can have this, right?

653
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:26,735
Just leave.
I'm not letting you stay over tonight.

654
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:29,029
"Tonight"? Then can I come again
some other night?

655
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:31,281
You're being so weird. Do you know that?

656
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:32,657
I was about to go anyway.

657
00:57:35,077 --> 00:57:36,286
After I eat the chicken.

658
00:57:46,338 --> 00:57:47,506
Is it fried chicken?

659
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:49,091
Hang on!

660
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:07,692
What are you doing here at this hour?

661
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:11,530
What are you two doing?

662
00:58:21,665 --> 00:58:24,000
Hello. I'm Choi Ung's friend, NJ…

663
00:58:24,084 --> 00:58:25,502
EPILOGUE

664
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:27,963
Can I use a fake name?
The company doesn't know I'm doing this.

665
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:31,383
Can you blur my face? No, wait.
Will that make me look like a criminal?

666
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:33,969
Let's just start filming.

667
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:37,180
What do you want to know?

668
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:39,433
Should I talk about Choi Ung?

669
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:41,726
This is going to be fun.

670
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:51,319
But what's going on between you three?

671
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:55,073
It looks like you three got into a fight.

672
00:58:58,326 --> 00:59:05,333
JUST FRIENDS

673
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:29,232
What are they up to?

674
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,902
-I like it.
-What?

675
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:35,197
You're not after some criminal.

676
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,698
Hey, Ung!

677
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:41,411
Yeon-su.

678
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:44,748
Wait. Do you want to come up?

679
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:47,667
I don't want to be friends with Ung.

680
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:49,336
This is bad.

681
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,004
I guess I was wrong.

682
00:59:52,631 --> 00:59:53,882
I do have a crush on him.

683
00:59:55,926 --> 01:00:00,931
