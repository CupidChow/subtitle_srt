1
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,464
Do you want to sleep over?

2
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:54,137
This is why we had to break up.

3
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,847
NOVEMBER, 2008

4
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,516
Yeon-su, let's go to the cafeteria.

5
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,269
Sorry. I'm not hungry right now.

6
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:05,315
-Come on. I'll buy you banana milk.
-No, I'm really fine.

7
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,275
-You can go with the others.
-Okay.

8
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:09,360
Ji-yeon, hurry up. Let's go.

9
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:11,529
Bye.

10
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,156
Hurry up.

11
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,116
She said no again, right? Why bother?

12
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,576
Stop asking. She can hear you.

13
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:18,787
Hey, you should stop caring about her.

14
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,915
She doesn't care about us.

15
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:25,835
She's right.
Yeon-su never treated us to anything.

16
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,295
We always bought her stuff.

17
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:30,590
But still, it wasn't like
she asked us to buy her those things.

18
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:34,010
But she's shameless
for accepting them every single time.

19
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:38,014
Remember last time?
You always gave her a birthday gift.

20
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:40,058
I hate being poor

21
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:43,228
because I can't be generous to others.

22
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:48,983
Our family's been poor since I was born.

23
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,151
I didn't do it.

24
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,694
I didn't do it either.

25
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,613
Whatever. Don't worry about it.

26
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:58,076
It made hanging out with my friends

27
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:04,874
As a young girl, I was quite hurt.

28
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,336
But it was okay.

29
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:11,131
Grandma.

30
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:16,928
You're here again. I told you not to come.

31
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:19,514
It was boring being home alone.

32
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:20,640
Good grief.

33
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:23,810
It was okay because I had

34
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:26,396
-Your hands are freezing.
-What about dinner?

35
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,147
Were you busy today?

36
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,233
No, not at all.

37
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,359
Hey, look at her skirt.

38
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,820
-She's obviously a teacher's pet.
-Hey, look at her shoes.

39
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:35,405
Even my mom wouldn't wear that.

40
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,699
That's why I decided to act nonchalantly

41
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,242
and be self-centered.

42
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,952
Spring is finally here.

43
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:45,039
-That made things much easier.
-The weather is pretty cold.

44
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:48,418
I'd like to extend my gratitude
to all those who gathered

45
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:51,129
to congratulate
and encourage the freshmen.

46
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,007
Hey. What are you looking at?

47
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,426
Thirty-four years ago,

48
00:02:57,176 --> 00:03:01,264
-I was standing where you were…
-That is, until I met Choi Ung.

49
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:03,683
I'm going to…

50
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,605
I'm going to kill you
if you tell the others that we're dating.

51
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,275
And you better not bother me either.

52
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,068
Studying always come first.

53
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:17,572
And you need to study hard too
and get into university.

54
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:26,247
Is there anything you'd like to say?

55
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,504
What are you doing tomorrow?

56
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:44,807
The only person who has allowed me

57
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,434
to escape from reality

58
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,228
was Ung.

59
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,734
-Did you sleep well?
-Yes.

60
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:58,112
-Were you waiting long?
-No. I just came.

61
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:04,035
-So they're both symbolic.
-Okay.

62
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:06,454
The difference is…

63
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:09,123
And thus, the population…

64
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,336
Gosh, why am I so sleepy today?

65
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,092
"Since the 1960s…"

66
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:22,679
-"The rapid industrialization…"
-"Caused…"

67
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,598
2012 ADMISSION RESULT

68
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,985
CONGRATULATIONS

69
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,820
NAME: CHOI UNG
MAJOR: ART AND DESIGN

70
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:51,749
LET'S GO OUTSIDE

71
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,647
LET'S GO OUTSIDE

72
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,201
Yeon-su.

73
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,746
What?

74
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,998
-Are you already eating something?
-Gimbap.

75
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:34,500
Darn it. I brought some food for you.

76
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:39,380
This is kimchi fried rice,
and these are tomatoes.

77
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,631
Did you really make this?

78
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,217
You bet. It's not that hard.

79
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:52,560
-Is it not good?
-It is.

80
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:54,979
I agree.

81
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,110
What are you talking about?

82
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,698
When did I act all excited?

83
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:09,077
You were so excited
that the girls were being flirty with you.

84
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,329
Tell them to treat you like a senior.

85
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,915
Wait…

86
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:16,626
I'm actually upset
because you were wasting your time.

87
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:17,627
I'm sorry.

88
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:22,632
At times, I was desperate

89
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,217
COVER LETTER

90
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,512
And that made me forget about reality.

91
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,643
-Are you done?
-No. I still have a few left.

92
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,228
Do you have to get a job right away?

93
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,396
What do you mean?

94
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,066
I mean, instead of getting
a regular 9-to-5 job,

95
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:42,568
you could study more
and land a better job.

96
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,779
I have no time for that.

97
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:47,782
I need to get a job
and become a full-time employee.

98
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:49,992
And then?

99
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:56,749
Well, I'm going to save up enough money

100
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,043
so that my grandma
won't have to work anymore.

101
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,586
-That's it?
-What?

102
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:05,550
I know how you worked part-time,
received scholarships,

103
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,927
and studied diligently.

104
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:11,848
So I thought you'd eye
for a bigger success than that.

105
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,898
I've always thought that my dream was

106
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,860
to live an average, normal life.

107
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,573
I consider that a success.

108
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:32,451
Maybe this wasn't what I wanted.

109
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,620
What about you? What'll you do?

110
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:39,834
Me? I don't really have a plan.

111
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:44,088
You're good at drawing and enjoy doing it.
You could do that for a living.

112
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,591
Drawing is just going to be a hobby.

113
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,009
You know my dream.

114
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:51,888
It's to bask in the sun during the day
and to lie underneath a lamp at night.

115
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,307
A stressful life is not for me.

116
00:07:56,017 --> 00:08:00,188
Maybe I never had a choice to begin with.

117
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,398
I like my life as it is.

118
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,774
Next to you and my family.

119
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:13,534
But when I opened my eyes again…

120
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:23,794
reality struck me harder than ever before…

121
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,129
Why?

122
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,633
Why do we need to pay the debt instead?

123
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,886
I've never even met

124
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:36,515
this man who's supposedly my uncle.

125
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,893
Yeon-su…

126
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,480
My puppy.

127
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,233
I wish…

128
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:51,489
I could only be poor to the point

129
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,200
where I could handle it.

130
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,934
…as if to mock me

131
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:23,646
Hello?

132
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,318
Yeon-su!

133
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,195
Before I knew it…

134
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:42,957
reality had me in its grasp.

135
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:50,590
I won't go.

136
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,885
You know this is
every student's dream, right?

137
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,014
Don't you know that you're talented?

138
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,182
Your skills had improved greatly

139
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,810
when you were gone there for six months.

140
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,478
That's because it was six months.

141
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,732
Living there for a few years is different.

142
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:10,276
And I don't want to go there
all by myself.

143
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,485
That's your reason?

144
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,072
You can draw all the buildings you love

145
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,325
and learn much more if you go there.

146
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,329
Do you have no ambitions?

147
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:26,876
No. I'm not interested
in striving for success.

148
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:30,546
Give this chance to someone
who needs it more than I do.

149
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:32,006
My gosh.

150
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:43,559
SEO-YEON UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
INPATIENT BILL

151
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,285
What? When did you get here?

152
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,288
It's not like you to wait for me.

153
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,084
Should we have lunch? What do you want?

154
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,044
Should we go out?

155
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:20,971
So…

156
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,183
the reason why we had to break up was…

157
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,936
Why would we break up?

158
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,817
Because we live in

159
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,945
I'm always the first thing
you abandon when things get tough.

160
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:40,241
Rather, it was because

161
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:43,035
Am I the easiest thing you have

162
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,162
that you can throw away?

163
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:49,834
No.

164
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,004
You're the only thing

165
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,090
I can throw away.

166
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,431
Why are you doing this?

167
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,307
Actually…

168
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:11,605
it's because life alone

169
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,065
What reason do you have?

170
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,317
To be honest…

171
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,654
Why do we have to break up?

172
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:23,617
To be completely honest,

173
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:28,831
I was afraid you'd eventually notice

174
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:36,964
EPISODE 6
PRIDE AND PREJUDICE

175
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:55,441
I'm pretty sure

176
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:34,730
God, you scared me to death!

177
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:36,482
Don't sneak up on me like that.

178
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,651
-When did you get here?
-Just now.

179
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,903
I thought you'd have trouble
sleeping again.

180
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,448
Go back to sleep.
You probably didn't get enough.

181
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,408
Hey, what time did I go to bed?

182
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,285
How would I know?

183
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,621
My gosh.

184
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:52,706
How did I sleep so soundly?

185
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,708
I slept so well.

186
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:57,670
Your stopwatch was stopped
a little after 10 p.m.

187
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,589
-You must have fallen asleep right away.
-Did I?

188
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,967
-Did you take sleeping pills?
-Yes.

189
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:06,512
Geez. Why did you sleep
on the sofa and not your bed?

190
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,392
What is that?

191
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,778
Ung, you've managed to work for 95 hours.

192
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,364
You must be in your element.

193
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:26,574
I'm impressed.

194
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,826
Hey. What time did you get here again?

195
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,870
Me? About 7:30 a.m.

196
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,162
Was I alone then?

197
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,455
-No.
-Then?

198
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,915
You've always been alone.

199
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,333
Come on.

200
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:40,212
Right. Ji-ung is going to stop by
and edit the footage of you working.

201
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:43,757
Also, he's going to film
the live drawing show.

202
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:47,344
Let's show him
how awesome you are when you're drawing.

203
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,346
Forget the loser you used to be…

204
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,391
Are you listening?

205
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,269
How long has it been
since I slept this well?

206
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:58,063
You did? Did you not wake up at all?

207
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,190
-No.
-That's great.

208
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,484
Good. You'll be in great condition today.

209
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,490
Then what is this unsettling feeling?

210
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:15,164
Why are you up so early on the weekend?

211
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:18,709
Today's the day of the opening event
that I've been working hard on.

212
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:20,878
Really? It's today?

213
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:21,962
-Sit down.
-Okay.

214
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,965
Gosh, time sure does fly.

215
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,635
If you have time later,
drop by later with your friend.

216
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:30,471
That's okay. I don't want to distract you.

217
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,598
You worked so hard on that project.

218
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,017
I'm sure you did a fantastic job.

219
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,227
You're the only one who appreciates me.

220
00:15:39,938 --> 00:15:42,232
You know what?

221
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,278
The welfare center

222
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:49,198
is accepting job application forms.

223
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,533
I'm thinking of applying.

224
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:55,537
What? Don't be ridiculous.

225
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,915
No. You're still unwell.

226
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,709
I'm just bored. That's all.

227
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:05,047
Staying in this house all day
is really suffocating.

228
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,342
You should hang out
at the senior citizen center.

229
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:12,012
No, thanks.
There's nothing to do there. It's boring.

230
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:14,682
They're just a bunch of sick, old people.

231
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:17,059
You have no friends
because of your temper.

232
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:20,020
What? You say that
as if I'm the neighborhood bully.

233
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,107
Anyway, I'm just letting you know.

234
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,694
Come on. What if you collapse?

235
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:27,736
Then I'll…

236
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:33,117
I'm afraid staying home all day
will make me forgetful.

237
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:37,705
What's that disease old people get?
Dementia, I think it's called.

238
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:42,793
I'm just saying. I don't actually have it.

239
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:46,380
I'm extremely clearheaded for my age.

240
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:48,882
No one can hold a candle to me.

241
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,844
So don't you worry about a thing.

242
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,096
Eat up.

243
00:16:56,014 --> 00:16:57,391
I'm not worried.

244
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:02,312
Then why are you staring at me like that
and making me feel embarrassed?

245
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,773
I'm just upset and heartbroken.

246
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:08,235
You've been working all your life.

247
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,446
Can't you just take it easy?

248
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:13,699
It doesn't get easier than this.

249
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:16,118
You cook and prepare my meals.

250
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,203
I'm eating and sleeping well.

251
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:23,500
Goodness. I am blessed indeed.

252
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:26,045
Gosh, cut that nonsense and eat up.

253
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,882
Then…

254
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,552
don't do anything too demanding.

255
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:38,390
If it's just for a few hours a day,
I'll think about it.

256
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,101
You're so ridiculous.

257
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:45,773
Who do you think you are? My mother?

258
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:49,651
Of course. I'm your guardian.

259
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,821
You better not cross me.

260
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,117
Look at you.

261
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,494
-Honey, wait.
-Why?

262
00:17:58,577 --> 00:17:59,453
-Ho.
-What?

263
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:00,871
What are you wearing?

264
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,790
Chang-sik, look. How do I look?

265
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,792
This won't do. Put on the other necktie.

266
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,752
-Why?
-The red one's better.

267
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,629
Have you seen the restaurant owners?

268
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,172
-Ji-ung!
-They're kind-hearted.

269
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,299
I'm glad you're here. Look at us.

270
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:14,384
How do we look?

271
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:18,764
You look like you're a couple
from a wealthy neighborhood.

272
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:20,349
I can barely recognize you guys.

273
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:25,562
Ung is going to put on a show today.

274
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:28,607
He's always putting on a show,

275
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,943
so why would you get
all dressed up for that?

276
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:34,238
Not like that, you fool.
An actual performance.

277
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:37,741
Ung is going to draw
in front of an audience.

278
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:41,662
Eun-ho came by last time
and said we had to come.

279
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:44,164
He never invited us to those things.

280
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,999
But isn't it too early right now?

281
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:49,086
-Not at all.
-We'll be in the front row.

282
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:52,172
Oh, dear! Honey, we need
to pick up the rice cakes.

283
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:55,259
You're right. We need to go early
and give them rice cakes.

284
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:58,637
Wait. You should hand them out
to just your neighbors

285
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,055
unless you want Ung to faint.

286
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:03,016
-Still, we should show our courtesy.
-That's right.

287
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,519
-They're going all the way there for him.
-Exactly.

288
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:09,815
Those people begged him to draw.

289
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:12,442
It'll all be ready,
and he'll be treated like a king.

290
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:15,946
Is that true? My goodness! Honey!

291
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,823
Goodness!

292
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,324
Did you hear that?

293
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:22,369
They begged my son to draw for them.

294
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,371
Is that really why he's drawing?

295
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:26,498
That's how big he's become.

296
00:19:27,165 --> 00:19:28,709
-I can't believe this.
-Gosh.

297
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:31,545
Anyway, you don't have to rush.
So take your time.

298
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:44,308
It's the final day
of our long-term project.

299
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,184
Right.

300
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,353
We should grab something to eat

301
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:52,733
-before they let the audience in.
-We don't have time.

302
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,735
No. Today will be hectic.

303
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:56,820
Let's have our last meeting over lunch.

304
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,697
Okay. I'll make the order.

305
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,366
Let me. Do sandwiches sound okay?

306
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,534
-Yes.
-Great.

307
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:08,081
Well, should I get
the same menu for all of us?

308
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,875
You see, I'm on a diet.

309
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,377
I'd like wheat bread, roast chicken,
olive oil, and pepper.

310
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:15,923
I'd like steak with no pickles.
I can't eat them.

311
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:18,550
And for me…
What was that sauce from last time?

312
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:19,927
I wrote it down somewhere.

313
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,514
-Let me order instead.
-Okay.

314
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,892
You'll have what you normally have, right?

315
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,018
Sure.

316
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:40,030
Ms. Kook, are you okay?
You look quite tired.

317
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,114
I'm all right.

318
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,200
As you've asked,

319
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:46,203
we've set two separate press conferences
for Nu-a and Go-oh.

320
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,789
Jean Ferrat will arrive from the airport

321
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:51,041
around the time the drawing show ends.

322
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:52,501
Okay. Thank you.

323
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,797
Do you know when Go-oh will arrive?

324
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,800
Do you want to sleep over?

325
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,692
Ms. Kook?

326
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:20,278
It's okay. I'll ask.

327
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:21,905
Okay.

328
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:25,409
Also, Mr. Jang just arrived.
He's on the first floor.

329
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:26,368
I see.

330
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,328
Aren't you going to see him?

331
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:29,913
I'll see him once it begins.

332
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:34,668
Enjoy your meal, and we'll meet
at the front gate in 30 minutes.

333
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,670
I'll take a look around the second floor.

334
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:37,838
-Okay.
-Okay.

335
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,552
Today's interview will be
about you as an artist.

336
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,554
Feel free to talk about your occupation.

337
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:46,930
Like what?

338
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:49,224
Your thoughts about your work,

339
00:21:49,307 --> 00:21:53,478
your life as an artist,
or your future plans and goals.

340
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:56,857
I don't have any.

341
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:59,943
Can you ask me a different question?

342
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:05,324
Then tell me how you began drawing.

343
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:13,915
There's no story to tell.

344
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,544
Fine. Say that then.

345
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,671
It'll make him look like an airhead.

346
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,673
But that's the truth.

347
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,425
Don't try to sugarcoat anything.

348
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:25,719
I'll start now.

349
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,309
We're almost there.

350
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,352
Are you not nervous?

351
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:38,190
-What?
-In a way, this is your debut.

352
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,985
It's your first public appearance.
Are you not nervous?

353
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,862
If I say yes, will you cancel it?

354
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:45,489
Of course not. Hang in there.

355
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:49,076
This song has always made you relax.

356
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,079
Play "Island" by NJ.

357
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,668
I'm happy that
you're finally out of your cave.

358
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:00,462
I was never in one.

359
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,798
You practically were.

360
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:07,636
To be honest, I was worried sick
that you'd have trouble sleeping

361
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:11,932
and become anxious since Yeon-su appeared.

362
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:15,936
But in the end, this is all thanks to her.

363
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,730
You would have never done this
had I asked you to.

364
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:24,319
Anyway, I hope you'll continue working
with others out in the open.

365
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:28,281
Then you'll become
even more famous, get a lot of work,

366
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:29,783
and make lots of money.

367
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:36,498
That being said, what's your take
on giving your manager a raise?

368
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:37,707
I'm against it.

369
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:42,170
I see. Then let's take our time and
discuss that topic further in the future.

370
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,047
-What?
-We're here.

371
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,720
Go to the second floor first.

372
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,890
Your green room will be there.
I'll park and bring your stuff over.

373
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,101
Do you know
how much your welfare expense--

374
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:59,312
They're honking back there. Go on, now.

375
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:02,315
-See you later.
-See you soon.

376
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,559
GO-OH, NU-A

377
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:52,657
GO-OH

378
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:03,293
We should run it by Ms. Kook.

379
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,463
Mr. Kang, have you seen Ms. Kook?

380
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:08,632
I saw her heading to the second floor.

381
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:11,218
I see. Let's check the showroom.

382
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:52,926
She always looked mad in front of me.

383
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:58,515
I think

384
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,810
I finally appreciate Yeon-su

385
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:19,202
We already interviewed Ung.
We just need Yeon-su's now.

386
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,996
Let's get a rough footage first,

387
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,331
then focus on Ung when the show begins.

388
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,625
Intern, stay with her.

389
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,085
Yes, sir. I will.

390
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:29,045
Should I go interview her?

391
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,506
No, I'll do it.

392
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:34,718
We have a meeting
back at the office, so let's hurry.

393
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:35,719
Yes, sir.

394
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:56,364
Is this the green room?

395
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:58,408
It's Ung.

396
00:26:58,491 --> 00:26:59,659
Yes.

397
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:00,994
When did he get here?

398
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,803
What should I say

399
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:21,598
if he brings up last night?

400
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:22,849
About yesterday…

401
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:27,937
Did you visit me?

402
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,690
I knew it.

403
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:33,443
He doesn't remember.

404
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:39,491
Yes. I had something to give you
so I went over to your place.

405
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:41,201
I see.

406
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,830
Then did I--

407
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:48,958
Sorry. I need to get ready.

408
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:52,712
The staff will tell you the details
regarding the live show.

409
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:01,596
But still,

410
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,265
Hey.

411
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:07,352
Good luck.

412
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:09,437
Thanks.

413
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,744
So you didn't run away.

414
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,996
Take a rest, and we'll rehearse later.

415
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,665
Here's the layout and the program.

416
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:37,340
GO-OH

417
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,094
-Ms. Kook.
-Did you check Go-oh's video?

418
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:44,389
-Yes, I did. Everything's fine.
-Then play it right now

419
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:47,142
-with the playlist he's given us.
-Yes, ma'am.

420
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,677
I've never seen

421
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,805
that side of him before.

422
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:28,767
Ms. Kook.

423
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,435
Ms. Kook.

424
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:32,562
Ms. Kook.

425
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:37,859
Ms. Kook.

426
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,328
Ung, we need to head out now.

427
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:51,664
Are you sleeping?

428
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,669
Are you nervous?
Do you want some more calming pills?

429
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:58,379
Why did I…

430
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:01,883
sleep well last night?

431
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:05,136
How is that a problem?
Are you still hung up on that?

432
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,472
For the caption,

433
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:11,100
can you write,
"Pondering about what to draw"?

434
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:13,811
What? Hurry up.

435
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,146
-Not that one.
-Go on.

436
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,065
-No, it's the other one.
-This one? Okay.

437
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,066
Geez.

438
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:32,455
-I can't see from here.
-Sit down.

439
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,374
Let's go over there.

440
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,251
Nu-a is here.

441
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,424
Hello. It's nice to meet you all.

442
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:46,845
It's truly an honor to draw the building

443
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:49,722
designed by my role model, Jean Ferrat.

444
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:54,143
As you all know, another artist will be
drawing in the next room.

445
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,728
If you're curious, go ahead.

446
00:30:56,938 --> 00:31:01,192
However, I guarantee that
you'll be too captivated to go there.

447
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:05,405
I'll do my utmost best to win your hearts.
My name is Nu-a,

448
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:07,699
and I'm an illustrator.

449
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:13,830
-He's here.
-Hi, Ung.

450
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:20,503
That's my son.

451
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:07,735
You've never seen him working, right?

452
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:09,988
Yes.

453
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,907
I've never seen this side of him before.

454
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:14,784
I barely recognize him.

455
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:18,955
He looked like a total stranger
the first time I saw him drawing.

456
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:20,707
You're right.

457
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:23,710
Good job, by the way.

458
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:27,380
This seems like a big event.
It must've been hell preparing for this.

459
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:29,090
No, it was just part of my job.

460
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:32,635
But shouldn't you be working
instead of chatting with me?

461
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:35,638
Exactly. I'm here to pick you up.

462
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:40,184
You can never judge a book by its cover.

463
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:43,980
Who knew I'd be working side by side
with the kid who had the lowest grade?

464
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,941
Of course, everything was a nuisance.

465
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:50,445
As you know,
he and I are very different people.

466
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,780
He's kind of slow.

467
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,450
He should have
shared his progress during the project

468
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,618
to make things more efficient.

469
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,454
But he'd never talk about it.

470
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:00,830
He always keeps his thoughts to himself.

471
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:04,000
He was always like that.
I'd ask what was on his mind.

472
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:06,002
"I don't know. I'm not sure. Nothing."

473
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:07,587
It was one of these three.

474
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,381
I'm getting annoyed
just thinking about it.

475
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:12,717
No.

476
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:14,510
Well…

477
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,054
NOT EVEN ONE?

478
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:19,056
Seeing him draw like that
for the first time

479
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:22,226
made me discover a new side to him.

480
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,980
He used to draw back then too,

481
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:28,733
but he never looked that serious.

482
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:33,863
I don't know what's gotten into him,
but he's completely focused.

483
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:35,531
He seems different.

484
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:41,037
But you know what?
He was always serious about drawing.

485
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,247
I think it was in episode five.

486
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,333
I ruined his drawing once,

487
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,502
and he threw a huge fit.

488
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,463
Honestly, I felt bad about that.

489
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:54,759
But seeing him
all worked up was entertaining.

490
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:57,720
He rarely gets upset.

491
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:01,557
I admit that I teased him
a few more times for fun.

492
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,396
He was so hilarious.

493
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:16,656
Well…

494
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:20,076
I've never seen him like that before.

495
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:24,288
It feels as if he has changed.

496
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:29,126
I thought he'd never change.

497
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:38,386
I rambled on, didn't I?
Let's edit that out.

498
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:41,806
-Next question then.
-Okay.

499
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:06,622
Shouldn't he take a break?

500
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:09,584
That is how he always works.

501
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:12,795
But since there's an audience,
he must feel extremely tense.

502
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,424
Let me check on him.

503
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,428
Honey, let's go.

504
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:31,480
Goodness. Is that you, Yeon-su?

505
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:33,065
Hello.

506
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:35,693
Gosh, it's been ages.

507
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:37,862
I heard you were
filming the documentary with Ung.

508
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:40,489
I am. How have you been?

509
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,825
Well, it's always the same for us.

510
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:47,496
Goodness. You haven't changed at all.

511
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,165
The same goes for you both.

512
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:51,083
It's because of our outfits.

513
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,377
Are you here to see Ung today?

514
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:54,670
Yes.

515
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:56,380
Then why are you leaving already?

516
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,716
It's dragging on, isn't it?

517
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:00,384
-No.
-Not at all.

518
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:04,847
Seeing him draw all alone
makes us feel sad.

519
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,807
It reminds me of when he was young.

520
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,936
To think that he's been
doing that since he was little--

521
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,687
-That's enough. Let's go.
-Okay.

522
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:16,192
I told you to come over for a meal.
What's stopping you?

523
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:18,319
Don't think too much about it
and just come over.

524
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,279
We won't charge you.

525
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:22,865
He's right. You should come.

526
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,367
-Come on.
-I'll cook you a delicious meal.

527
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,661
-Okay.
-All right.

528
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:40,633
Ung…

529
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:43,427
didn't take the breakup too well.

530
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,223
It must have been hard for you too.

531
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:56,732
We really want you to visit.

532
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,526
Please do. Okay?

533
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,277
Okay. I will.

534
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:01,862
All right. Bye.

535
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,742
-Hurry up.
-Coming.

536
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:07,743
Bye.

537
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,286
Hurry up.

538
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,535
Ji-ung.

539
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:51,829
Did you do the interview?

540
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:53,664
Yes. What about the shoot?

541
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,083
There's nothing to film.

542
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,544
He's been sitting there
going at it for hours.

543
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:02,089
Head back to the office with the intern
and prepare for the meeting.

544
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,799
I'll wrap things up here.

545
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:12,016
Ung didn't take the breakup too well.

546
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,691
Do you want to sleep over?

547
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,992
Are you sick?

548
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,761
How many pills did you take?

549
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:50,805
Do you take them often?

550
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:53,182
Do you? Since when?

551
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:56,102
Since when did you have trouble sleeping?
Why didn't you tell me?

552
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,094
Yes?

553
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:33,055
Here you are.

554
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,432
Nu-a is almost done.

555
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:39,562
Escort him to the first floor
for the press conference when he's done.

556
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:41,689
I'll escort Go-oh.

557
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,190
Yes, ma'am.

558
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:01,959
I still have some time left.

559
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:05,254
Hello.

560
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:07,131
I'm Go-oh.

561
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,660
Congratulations.

562
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,414
This is a side of you I haven't seen.

563
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:44,793
Gosh. Is that NJ?

564
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:57,848
Wait. Excuse me.

565
00:41:58,516 --> 00:41:59,767
Seriously?

566
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:01,560
NJ!

567
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,647
Gosh.

568
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,084
GO-OH, NU-A

569
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:26,669
Hello, Ms. Kook.

570
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:28,462
It must have been a long day.

571
00:42:28,545 --> 00:42:30,422
Thank you so much for your work today.

572
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:33,801
There's an after-party later,
so feel free to attend.

573
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:36,345
I'll wrap it up here. You can go first.

574
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:39,431
Are you sure? We can help.

575
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:42,685
It's okay.
You had to work on the weekend. Go on.

576
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:44,728
Are you coming to the after-party?

577
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:46,897
I'll have to see. Go on.

578
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,899
Goodbye, then.

579
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,901
-See you later.
-You have to come.

580
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:16,176
Why the hell isn't he picking up?

581
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:18,304
Ung, over here!

582
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:20,055
Hey, why weren't you picking up?

583
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:22,516
Hey, are you done
with the press conference?

584
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:24,143
Why are you still here?

585
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:26,228
Well, that was hurtful.

586
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:28,856
Watch what you say, you ingrate.

587
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:31,233
She made time to come see you.

588
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:33,485
Thank you so much for coming.

589
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:35,237
I didn't expect you to come.

590
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:37,823
I didn't think I'd come uninvited either.

591
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:41,493
I arrived late
due to my schedule and took a peek.

592
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:42,828
You looked different.

593
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:45,789
I'll make sure to invite you next time.

594
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:48,500
Right. Let me tell you this

595
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:51,712
in case you're flustered by your name
being on the trending searches.

596
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:53,672
I told the reporters that

597
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:56,925
we're just good friends rooting
for each other, so don't worry.

598
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:59,595
-Friends?
-Aren't we?

599
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:02,473
Well, we are.

600
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:05,726
I'm just flattered
that you considered me a friend.

601
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:09,271
I've never seen a man
who was happy to be just friends with me.

602
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:12,358
-Sorry?
-Never mind.

603
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,443
Are you going home? Need a ride?

604
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:16,070
It's okay. We brought our car--

605
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:17,488
Okay. Goodbye.

606
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:20,366
Sorry? Hold on.
Is that why you were waiting for me?

607
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:23,661
I told you. I'm very busy, but I'm not.

608
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:25,371
-Goodbye.
-Go home safely.

609
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:30,000
Goodbye.

610
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:36,382
Ung, how could you decline her offer?

611
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:37,925
Shut up. I'm exhausted.

612
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:40,177
Anyway, you're in trouble now.

613
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,345
What do you mean?

614
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:43,639
Today, you've finally revealed yourself

615
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:45,849
and won everyone's hearts.

616
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:48,310
That's enough. Go get the car.

617
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:51,772
This means that you've agreed
to give me a raise.

618
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,899
Come on. I said, go.

619
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:56,944
This was from NJ, right?

620
00:44:58,362 --> 00:44:59,738
It smells different.

621
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:04,576
Go-oh has finally debuted!

622
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:20,259
It's sweet.

623
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:22,803
You're so pathetic.

624
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:26,723
Why are you **tching around here
on such a good day?

625
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:29,351
What do you mean?
I came in case you were bored.

626
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:33,230
You must be the reason why
my business is failing.

627
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:36,316
You should be at the party

628
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,612
celebrating the end of the project
instead of throwing a pity party here.

629
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:42,948
-I like this more.
-This is being pathetic.

630
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:45,826
Aren't you ecstatic
that your hard work paid off?

631
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:49,830
Not really. It's just work.

632
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:52,708
Now that we're done,
we'll begin another project.

633
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:56,587
Is work very tough?

634
00:45:57,254 --> 00:46:00,299
No. Compared to my previous job,
it's actually easier.

635
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:03,427
It's fine.

636
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,139
Then what's the problem?

637
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:14,313
It's neither demanding

638
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:16,899
nor fun.

639
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:21,361
It's just work.

640
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:25,782
Have a drink.

641
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:36,710
Remember what you said?

642
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:42,132
You said my eyes
looked empty and soulless.

643
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,760
Yes, and it still is.

644
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:48,305
The fish I have back there
has livelier eyes than you do.

645
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:54,686
I saw Ung's eyes as he was drawing today.

646
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:58,982
They seemed so soulful.

647
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:03,362
He did?

648
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:04,863
Yes.

649
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:08,825
He was so focused on his drawing.

650
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,579
To be honest, I was jealous.

651
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:15,832
Why would you be
jealous of someone like him?

652
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,293
Aren't I pathetic?

653
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:21,672
I hated pathetic people the most.

654
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:24,800
While he was changing,

655
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:30,013
I was busy making ends meet
and haven't changed at all.

656
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:33,350
Even I think I'm pathetic.

657
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:35,686
Geez. You're ridiculous.

658
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:39,815
You weren't stagnant.
Think of the debt you paid off.

659
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:42,067
I know how hard you worked.

660
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:45,779
You've succeeded
by coming this far, you wench.

661
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,535
I'm going to celebrate
the ending of the project.

662
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:53,996
I'll be your VIP customer.
Line up the soju bottles.

663
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,707
-I already put nine on your tab.
-Really?

664
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:58,208
I'll be ripping you off too.

665
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:02,838
-Goodness. Hello.
-Hello.

666
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:04,673
-Hello.
-Over here.

667
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:05,674
Okay.

668
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:14,391
-Here's the menu.
-What's today's special?

669
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:15,934
-It'sjjamppongrice.
-I see.

670
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:17,019
No, it'sjjamppongstew.

671
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:20,939
Ung, good work today.

672
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,443
I'm going home. Rest up.

673
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:26,445
Okay.

674
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:30,616
Hey. Turn off that light on your way out.

675
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:32,868
All right. Bye.

676
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:34,036
Bye.

677
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:04,399
-Here's your food.
-That looks good.

678
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:06,276
-I'll take the empty bottles.
-Okay.

679
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:09,696
Hey, you're here.
Sorry for calling out of the blue.

680
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,324
As you know, I'm the only friend she has.

681
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:15,577
But I'm too busy tonight
to get rid of her myself.

682
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:18,038
I can't hand her over
to the police either.

683
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:21,458
She'll be upset when she wakes up,
but what can I do? Please help me out.

684
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:22,542
Take her away.

685
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:25,545
Coming. One minute.

686
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:44,106
Ung?

687
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:59,830
God, that's cold.

688
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:04,876
Are you awake?

689
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:06,878
Yes.

690
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:12,801
Didn't you get any sleep?

691
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:13,969
Yes.

692
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:17,139
On top of that, I drank.

693
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:18,598
I think I'm drunk.

694
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:19,725
Drink this.

695
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:21,768
How considerate of you.

696
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:32,154
Sorry you had to come here at this hour.
It must have been a hassle.

697
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:35,323
Not really.
I was at a boring get-together.

698
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:38,034
-Did you drink too?
-A bit.

699
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:39,745
But you're a lightweight.

700
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:42,873
-You remember that?
-Of course.

701
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:45,167
It surprised me
how little you could drink.

702
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:47,544
That was harsh.

703
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:58,847
By the way, how is the documentary going?

704
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:00,974
It's going okay.

705
00:51:01,057 --> 00:51:04,144
I don't think
I should have agreed to do it.

706
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:07,731
Back in high school,
we were at least young and cute.

707
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:09,983
But all you can film now is me working.

708
00:51:10,066 --> 00:51:11,485
Of course, it'll be boring.

709
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:14,780
I'm afraid this documentary
is going to be a flop.

710
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:16,239
Maybe you want it to fail.

711
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:18,533
I actually do.
I'll make sure no one watches it.

712
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:20,577
You know I'm good at PR.

713
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:21,995
I'm going to spread a rumor.

714
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:30,086
But I'll think twice
if you agree to let me watch it first.

715
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:34,299
-Watch it first?
-I may have looked ugly

716
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:36,927
or blurted out obscenities accidentally.

717
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:40,180
And I'm certain Ung bad-mouthed me.

718
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:44,184
Anyway, I am curious.

719
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:53,735
By the way, what did Ung say about me?

720
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:02,202
I mean…

721
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:04,830
-Did he bad-mouth--
-Do you…

722
00:52:07,582 --> 00:52:09,167
still like Ung?

723
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:26,393
Do you still like Ung?

724
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:29,688
That's impossible.

725
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:45,579
There's no way that can be true.

726
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:46,746
Ung?

727
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:54,087
Why are you here?

728
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,091
I heard that you moved back here.

729
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:01,428
Is that why
we ran into each other so often?

730
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,680
Oh, did you?

731
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:07,642
Have you been drinking?

732
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:09,895
What? Well…

733
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:12,397
I did.

734
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:15,901
By the way,
what brings you here at this hour?

735
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:18,278
I don't know.

736
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:21,364
I've only realized
how late it was after I got here

737
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:23,742
so I was thinking of just going home.

738
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:28,330
If it's not urgent, can we talk next time?

739
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:30,957
I'm really tired right now.

740
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,652
It's you again.

741
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:47,283
I must be dreaming again.

742
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:57,252
I won't fall for it.

743
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:04,134
Yeon-su.

744
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:15,770
I'm in so much pain.

745
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:32,620
I remembered it again.

746
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:35,832
Are you okay? You seem pretty drunk.

747
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:38,835
No, I'm fine.

748
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:43,673
You see…

749
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:46,259
About last night…

750
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:52,557
Well, I saw a Thermos bottle at my house.

751
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,933
Is that yours?

752
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:58,104
I'm relieved he doesn't remember.

753
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:03,401
Yes. You seemed out of it,
so I left it there.

754
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:06,446
Really?

755
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:09,949
Yes. You had taken some pills.
You were in a daze.

756
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:13,495
Did I fall asleep after you left?

757
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:15,789
I think so.

758
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:20,627
Oh, I see.

759
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,379
Did you come here to ask me that?

760
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:26,174
You could've just called.

761
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:32,597
I'll keep that memory to myself.

762
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:35,266
I should head inside.

763
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:37,102
Bye.

764
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:39,395
That's how it should be.

765
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:43,191
Then you can pretend
like you don't remember tomorrow.

766
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:47,529
It wasn't a dream.

767
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,535
Why are you acting as if it was?

768
00:56:58,331 --> 00:56:59,541
Why are you lying?

769
00:57:01,626 --> 00:57:02,710
Yeon-su.

770
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:10,969
Yeon-su.

771
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:29,445
Is this right?

772
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:35,410
Is it right for us to be like this?

773
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:49,382
It's us of all people.

774
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:55,138
Our love wasn't just lukewarm…

775
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:00,643
and neither was our breakup.

776
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:04,105
Now that we've reunited,

777
00:58:06,107 --> 00:58:07,734
we can say, "Have you been well?"

778
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:11,988
"How have you been?"

779
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:14,991
"Was it tough for you?"

780
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:19,621
"It was tough for me."
Can't we tell each other these things?

781
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:24,751
The reason why we broke up…

782
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:29,756
How have you been?

783
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:32,217
was because of my pride.

784
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,052
Answer me.

785
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:36,971
How have you been?

786
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:39,974
It was my pride that told me

787
00:58:42,518 --> 00:58:44,354
that I could live without you.

788
00:58:57,116 --> 00:59:04,123
PRIDE AND PREJUDICE

789
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:25,812
EPILOGUE

790
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:27,563
Drawing is just going to be a hobby.

791
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:29,107
You know my dream.

792
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:32,860
It's to bask in the sun during the day
and to lie underneath a lamp at night.

793
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:35,280
A stressful life is not for me.

794
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:36,990
One minute.

795
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:43,496
Did I sound too pathetic?

796
00:59:49,794 --> 00:59:53,131
JOBS FOR DESIGN MAJORS

797
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:56,718
HOW EASY IS IT TO GET A JOB?

798
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:58,594
MAKING MONEY THROUGH DRAWING

799
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:02,890
4 MONTHS AFTER THE BREAKUP

800
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:55,735
