1
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:59,350
There's this phrase inThe Art of War.

2
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:02,145
"Attack is the secret of defense."

3
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:05,356
But I'm not sure about that.
I don't exactly agree.

4
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:09,110
It's hard enough defending yourself.
You won't have the strength to attack.

5
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,946
So I believe the best defense

6
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,115
is running away.

7
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:15,867
UNG IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

8
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,870
I have a long history of running away.

9
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:22,999
In our next class, we'll make
a presentation about our families.

10
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,001
Choi Ung, you can start.

11
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:26,711
Ung, are you ready?

12
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:31,508
Let's begin after a short break.

13
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,468
-Okay!
-Okay!

14
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,345
Hey, look.

15
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,889
Let's play with this!

16
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,683
What should we do today?

17
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,227
-Hey!
-Yes! I won!

18
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:46,898
Ung, come down. Ung!

19
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,066
Come down!

20
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,400
-It's dangerous.
-Come down.

21
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,944
At quite a young age…

22
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,487
-Ung, come down.
-Come on, Ung.

23
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,323
-You'll get hurt!
-It's dangerous. Come on.

24
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:56,449
-You could get hurt.
-Come down.

25
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,660
-It's dangerous.
-I won't make you do it.

26
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:00,787
So come down. I mean it.

27
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,081
I promise. You don't have
to do the presentation.

28
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:05,959
-…I tasted how sweet it could be.
-Come down, all right?

29
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:11,548
UNG IN HIGH SCHOOL

30
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:14,843
Of course, I run away for my sake.

31
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:15,969
Choi Ung!

32
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,471
That brat completely broke this.

33
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,850
-Stop right there!
-But it's also for the other person.

34
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,434
You jerk!

35
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:25,979
It's to give them time

36
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:29,232
when they get too emotional

37
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:32,527
This cost 29,900 won!

38
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,865
UNG IN UNIVERSITY

39
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,700
I swear I won't hit you!

40
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,079
And I won't yell at you.

41
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,747
So come here.

42
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:49,752
I'm buying time for them

43
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:50,879
Do you mean it?

44
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:54,966
Come here.

45
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,096
Stop right there!

46
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:05,393
But that doesn't mean

47
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,813
-You're entering a marathon?
-Yes.

48
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,817
Yeon-su said if I do a half marathon,
she'll wear matching rings.

49
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,068
My gosh.

50
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,155
She really is amazing.

51
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,991
Is she dating or babysitting?

52
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,702
She still doesn't know me well enough.

53
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,203
I'm a man of my word.

54
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:30,293
Hey, I'm going to be tough with you,
so don't go back on your word.

55
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,086
We'll run for an hour every day.

56
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,421
Of course.

57
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:37,258
With a week of training, I'll even be
able to complete a full marathon.

58
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,093
I'll get going.

59
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,722
Jeez.

60
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,775
I can't do this anymore.

61
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,765
INCOMING CALL
KIM JI-UNG

62
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:31,813
I make objective judgments

63
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:33,356
INCOMING CALL
KIM JI-UNG

64
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:41,823
Right. I can just wear
friendship rings with Ji-ung.

65
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,032
Right.

66
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,545
So I'm not embarrassed about running away.

67
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:59,674
UNG IN THE PRESENT

68
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,349
Now that we've reunited,

69
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,186
we can say, "Have you been well?"

70
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,605
"How have you been?"

71
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,317
"Was it tough for you?"

72
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,488
"It was tough for me."
Can't we tell each other these things?

73
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:25,033
Darn it…

74
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,418
I asked you for a writer a long time ago.

75
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,045
You're finally sending me one?

76
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,756
Well, you know…

77
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:45,428
I did my best to find one for you,
so don't give me a hard time.

78
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,305
Everyone's working on something.

79
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:49,849
There wasn't anyone to send to you.

80
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,017
So…

81
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,145
Well, good luck.

82
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:57,565
What? Who is it?
Why are you making such excuses?

83
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,701
What are you waiting for?

84
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,912
Are you going to just stand there all day?

85
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:14,207
You know you're overqualified
to be working on this.

86
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,292
Why are you here?

87
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,336
This is just a simple project.

88
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,630
I'll just get the rookie writers to help.

89
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,965
Do you think I wanted to do this?

90
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:26,677
But Mr. Park desperately
asked for my help.

91
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,846
You said you were going to work
on dramas now.

92
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,390
-So just go and write--
-I am.

93
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,810
I hate it when people tell me to write
when I'm already writing.

94
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,521
I came here to clear my head a bit,

95
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:39,440
so don't stop making it so obvious
that you don't want me here.

96
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:43,736
-So you'll do whatever you want again?
-Things turn out great that way.

97
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,404
I don't like it when you do that.

98
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:48,324
-I…
-I saw the preview, and it was awful.

99
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,953
Who said you could show her?

100
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:55,414
What in the world
are you filming, Mr. Kim?

101
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:59,001
I don't get what you're trying to say
through these videos.

102
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,212
What has gotten into you?

103
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:05,174
-Have you lost your touch?
-I'll take care of this myself,

104
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,009
so go back to where you came from

105
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,846
or go and clear your head somewhere else.

106
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,139
Mr. Kim.

107
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:16,853
We're in a bad situation.
We really do need a writer.

108
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:20,982
Well, I do have something
I want to make up for too.

109
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,485
I won't be that stubborn this time.

110
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,206
So…

111
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,501
what is it that you want to say?

112
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:46,424
I heard the cast are your friends.
Is that why you were being lazy?

113
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:51,804
Honestly, I was thinking of refusing this
when I first saw the videos.

114
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:56,142
But then I found something interesting.

115
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,562
-So I watched the old documentary.
-And?

116
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:04,066
There seems to be something
going on between the two of them.

117
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:10,364
There's no way you didn't notice that.

118
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,994
If we use that, I think we can make
quite an interesting piece.

119
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,955
I don't want to force a scenario on them.

120
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,541
No, it actually felt like

121
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:24,462
the camera was purposely
trying to ignore that side of them.

122
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:25,546
But…

123
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:29,467
-Maybe that was just me.
-Why would I purposely do that?

124
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,594
I was trying to film them objectively--

125
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,679
Then why should people film things?

126
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,182
You can let machines do the shooting then.

127
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:40,228
My gosh. You really haven't
changed a bit, Mr. Kim.

128
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:46,484
Well, you made the scenes
look quite pretty.

129
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,861
I'll write up something

130
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,572
based on them.

131
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,249
-Hey, you're up.
-Hey.

132
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,792
Today's the party.

133
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,252
Look behind you.

134
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:08,965
I put in so much effort to prepare
for your debut anniversary party.

135
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:13,052
Right. And Yeon-su's coming too
because we're filming.

136
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,722
Is there anyone else we can invite?

137
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,891
Like NJ, you know.

138
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,101
Or NJ.

139
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,394
Or NJ.

140
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,274
Right, and Ji-ung said
he's coming early today.

141
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:27,817
I'll be needing these.

142
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:33,489
Ung! Ji-ung said he's coming over first
so get ready, okay?

143
00:09:33,572 --> 00:09:36,158
Running away isn't about avoiding things,

144
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,953
it's just a reasonable decision.

145
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,551
Running away?

146
00:09:56,762 --> 00:10:01,434
I've never done anything so cowardly

147
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:16,365
It's all just a pathetic excuse.

148
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,791
Sorry.

149
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,836
I'm quite drunk right now.

150
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:42,933
Running away is what cowards do.

151
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,526
So?

152
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,487
Did you all read it?

153
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,574
I guess you didn't.

154
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:02,745
I'm sure you wouldn't be making
such faces after reading my draft.

155
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,955
Sorry, but we can't film

156
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:06,832
your amazing story.

157
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,084
What? Why?

158
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:15,091
Don't you think it's a bit
too childish to reject my work like this?

159
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,802
-They ran away.
-Who?

160
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,970
-The cast.
-The cast?

161
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,263
Choi Ung.

162
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:24,558
Go get him then. It's no big deal.

163
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,060
And Kook Yeon-su too.

164
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,610
EPISODE 7
CATCH ME IF YOU CAN

165
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:40,366
CELEBRATION PARTY
CHOI UNG, KOOK YEON-SU

166
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:44,203
ONE HOUR EARLIER

167
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:56,424
I told you I tried calling him.
He's not picking up.

168
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,175
But you were with him this morning.

169
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:01,137
Yes. He was here, but he just disappeared.

170
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,432
Did you really not hear anything
from Yeon-su?

171
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:05,766
Me?

172
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,687
I'm the one who brought all this wine.

173
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:13,524
I even closed the bar today
to attend this party.

174
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:14,942
And now this?

175
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,403
Don't you think I'm a victim too?

176
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:21,574
I get that Choi Ung could do this,
but Yeon-su isn't this irresponsible.

177
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,870
You don't think something's
happened to them, do you?

178
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,913
Didn't you take her home last night?

179
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,665
Maybe she's hungover.

180
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,126
She rarely is, though.

181
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,670
I'll try calling her grandma.

182
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:39,884
I see.

183
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:43,804
-What? Is it Yeon-su?
-So she did go AWOL.

184
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:48,559
"I need time to think.
Don't tell my grandma."

185
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,188
Judging from her rude text,
she hasn't been kidnapped.

186
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,440
Yeon-su went AWOL?

187
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:57,151
-Why? Why would she do that?
-Where could Ung be?

188
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,612
You know how simple he is.

189
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:02,740
If we just look around the neighborhood,
we'll find him right away.

190
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,910
But why is he suddenly acting like this?

191
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:08,245
The drawing show went well yesterday.

192
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,997
I really don't get it.

193
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:14,710
But isn't it a bit strange for them
to do this at the same time?

194
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:17,838
Maybe something happened
between the two of them.

195
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,174
Don't you think so?

196
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,510
Is it just me?

197
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:25,262
I never saw them together
yesterday though.

198
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:29,642
Right. And Yeon-su came to my bar
after the event ended,

199
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:32,061
and she went home drunk.

200
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,563
Ung went to bed early last night too.

201
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,670
Was I drunk last night?

202
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,339
No.

203
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:03,300
Did I take pills yesterday?

204
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,263
No.

205
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:11,308
Did I cry in front of Yeon-su regardless?

206
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,033
But…

207
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,954
she might not remember either
since she was drunk.

208
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,628
GU EUN-HO

209
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,839
Where are you? Just tell us where you are.

210
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:44,300
Is this because I asked for a raise?

211
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,385
Are you with Yeon-su?

212
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:48,971
Why did you two suddenly go AWOL?

213
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:57,187
I'll avoid it for now

214
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,908
I did expect this, but…

215
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,453
I've got nowhere to go.

216
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,666
What do people usually do

217
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:28,844
Right.

218
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,307
I don't have any friends.

219
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,441
I'm not running away.

220
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:45,819
I'm just keeping a distance

221
00:15:49,948 --> 00:15:51,867
This is so intriguing.

222
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:53,911
Pardon?

223
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:57,831
So they both ran away? My goodness.

224
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:03,962
This is even better than I thought!
Isn't it strange that they both went AWOL?

225
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,048
It is.

226
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,049
Right?

227
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,677
This is going to be big.

228
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,303
There must be something going on!

229
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:14,306
I need to be able to film them first
for a chance at success.

230
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,642
What can I do when the cast is gone?

231
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,977
What has gotten into you?

232
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,772
-You don't seem enthusiastic about this.
-What?

233
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:24,733
When have you ever given up
just because the cast ran away?

234
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,276
Remember Jukdo?

235
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,653
Why bring that up?

236
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:31,323
You searched the whole island
when the cast went AWOL.

237
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,283
Plus, that snake farm.

238
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:36,203
You ran around the mountain
looking for the snake that escaped.

239
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,789
And you're saying you can't film
just because of this?

240
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,082
Even if I do find them,

241
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:43,752
would I be able to film anything good
by forcing them to stay on camera?

242
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,087
If you bring them back,

243
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,298
make sure they can never run away again.

244
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,552
Let's see…

245
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:55,014
Do you prefer mountains or islands?

246
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:56,849
Pardon?

247
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,227
Hey, Intern.

248
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,980
What are my works the most known for?

249
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:07,192
Bringing out people's primal emotions
in a confined environment.

250
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,069
Say that more simply.

251
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,072
Locking them up and filming?

252
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,451
The weather's nice these days.
Let's go on a trip.

253
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,829
Kidnap the cast,
take them somewhere secluded,

254
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,748
and film them for about three days.

255
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,670
All right, don't worry.

256
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,839
I'm doing my best to find him.

257
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:31,508
Yes. I'll call you when I find him.

258
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:34,011
Oh, there's my taxi. Taxi!

259
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,304
I'll call you later.

260
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,103
Thank you, Choi Ung.

261
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:46,440
Dobby is free.

262
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,280
Oh, my gosh!

263
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:57,034
-I was here the whole time though.
-What are you doing there?

264
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:58,619
I'm hungry.

265
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:01,663
There's a lot of food here,
but there's nothing to eat.

266
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,999
You didn't leave?

267
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,877
-Nobody told me to leave.
-Everyone left.

268
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,295
My alcohol's still here.

269
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:10,923
-I mean, aren't you looking for Yeon-su?
-What about you?

270
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:14,885
But why are you talking so casually to me?

271
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:19,556
I personally believe that people should be
respected according to their age.

272
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,849
And I'm older than you.

273
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,936
But do you really not know where Ung is?

274
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,687
Of course I do.

275
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,315
It's obvious where he'd be.

276
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,400
He doesn't have any friends or hobbies.

277
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,944
It's the same for Yeon-su.

278
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:34,113
Is that why they dated?

279
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,324
But he does have something like a hobby.

280
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,034
It's obvious.

281
00:18:39,117 --> 00:18:40,661
They must be together right now.

282
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,873
Isn't this your first time at this house?

283
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,668
You've made yourself at home here.

284
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:49,837
I even closed the bar today

285
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,713
and came to have fun.

286
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,882
I can't just sit around.

287
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,929
How about a party to celebrate Choi Ung
without Ung?

288
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,269
Sol-i.

289
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,271
You're a genius.

290
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,872
It feels like I've come back

291
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:27,583
only three hours after I've run away.

292
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:31,420
I ended up in front of Ung again.

293
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:37,384
Okay, that's the worst thing

294
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,473
Hey…

295
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,434
What are you doing here?

296
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,354
Right.

297
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,732
I thought…

298
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:56,153
you were having a celebration party today.

299
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,487
What about you?

300
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:00,490
I just wanted to get some rest.

301
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,378
You know this is really awkward, right?

302
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,839
Really? I feel fine though.

303
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:19,009
-Really?
-Yes. I'm totally fine.

304
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,511
Why would we be awkward?

305
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:25,307
I see. You must have decided
to pretend not to remember anything.

306
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:28,185
-I don't know what you're saying.
-Kook Yeon-su.

307
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,273
All right, fine. It's awkward.

308
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,192
I got drunk and cried in front of my ex.

309
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,152
So I feel really embarrassed. Happy?

310
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,746
Like I said, running away

311
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,167
But, at times,

312
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,212
the choice hasn't always been mine.

313
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,007
Let's go eat.

314
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,069
EXCESSIVE LIFE

315
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:29,913
VOLUNTEER WITH NJ
BRIQUETTE DELIVERY OF LOVE

316
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:34,793
Here.

317
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,756
I don't know what you're thinking.

318
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,467
If you don't want to do this,
you can say no.

319
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,593
It's volunteer work.

320
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:46,722
You're not that warm-hearted, are you?

321
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:49,099
This isn't helping you at all.

322
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:54,146
NJ, drink this. I got it for you.

323
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,148
Thank you.

324
00:21:56,231 --> 00:22:00,360
-You look much more pretty in person.
-Thanks.

325
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,242
Don't you have any pride?

326
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,039
VOLUNTEER WITH NJ
BRIQUETTE DELIVERY OF LOVE

327
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,540
You all came here

328
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:17,002
because NJ will drop the charges
if you did this, right?

329
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:20,964
Yes. I heard everyone
who came last year was let off.

330
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,382
Yes, she'll drop the charges.

331
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:23,550
How do you know?

332
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:27,220
Well, I actually came here last year too.

333
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,805
-Oh, gosh.
-Gosh.

334
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,682
Then you got caught again?

335
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,726
I was just unlucky.

336
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:35,979
Honestly, they say everything
is a malicious comment these days.

337
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:39,983
Right. And to be honest, don't you
think this is kind of ridiculous?

338
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:43,570
Volunteer work with people
who wrote bad comments about her?

339
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:46,990
I don't know if she has
really high self-esteem or is smart.

340
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,201
It's all for her image of course.

341
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:50,619
She's a tough one.

342
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:54,206
Anyway, just keep sucking up to her
and she'll let you off.

343
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:56,833
Let's all hang in there
until this is over.

344
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,753
Did you see those stickers of her face
on the lunch boxes?

345
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:05,175
Nobody here wants to see
her face while eating.

346
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:07,385
I tore it off already.

347
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:10,514
She's so young, but she's as sly as a fox.

348
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,933
But what kind of comment did you write?

349
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:15,811
I didn't even make up stories about her.

350
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:18,188
You know,

351
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:22,901
there was a rumor
about NJ and her sponsors.

352
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:24,820
And I just wrote about that a bit.

353
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,864
NJ even had sponsors?

354
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,783
I can't believe it! When?

355
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:33,120
Her agency is going after
innocent citizens like us

356
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:35,956
to keep it under wraps.

357
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,290
I know, right?

358
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:40,669
Remember when her first album
was a huge hit right after her debut?

359
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:44,381
I heard her sponsors got her
all those commercials back then.

360
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:47,592
That's how she bought
all those expensive buildings at her age.

361
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:48,844
That's so crazy.

362
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,399
Come on. What are you waiting for?

363
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,657
WITH UNG

364
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:15,579
Where have you been all day?

365
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:17,205
Hello.

366
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:20,458
Oh my, it's Yeon-su!

367
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:21,918
Yeon-su's here?

368
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,170
My goodness!

369
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,005
Yeon-su!

370
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:28,300
I'm so glad you're here.

371
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,552
-You came to eat, right?
-Yes.

372
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:32,304
Sit over there.

373
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:35,265
Did you get home safe yesterday?

374
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:37,392
Of course. Have a seat here.

375
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:39,102
It's as if I'm not even here.

376
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:43,148
-It's been such a long time.
-Yes.

377
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:45,066
What do you want?
Tell me anything you want.

378
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,945
Anything is fine.
Everything you make is so delicious.

379
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:52,324
But still. Is there anything
you wanted to eat?

380
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:56,620
Well, then, do you still make bean stew?

381
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:59,998
Right! You used to love that!

382
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,042
I'll make some right away.

383
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,710
-Thank you.
-Mom, I want--

384
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:06,630
I'll get you some meat and
other side dishes. Eat all you want, okay?

385
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:08,465
-Thank you.
-Hey, I'm here.

386
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:10,759
Weren't you here just a minute ago?

387
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,804
What? When did Ung get here?

388
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,056
Hang on.

389
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:18,308
Ji-ung…

390
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:22,270
Ji-ung asked me to call him if I saw Ung.

391
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,314
All right. But don't call him.

392
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:26,900
Ji-ung was looking for him everywhere.

393
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:28,735
Just go, will you?

394
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:40,413
Watching them again and again
won't get you anywhere.

395
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:44,000
I'm sure I told you I don't want
the smell of food in here.

396
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:46,086
I'm done eating.
Jeez, you're so sensitive.

397
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,421
Did you eat?

398
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:50,131
I did.

399
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,884
Outside the editing room.

400
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:56,680
Hey, I heard the cast ran away.

401
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:02,060
I did think that they'd run away by now.

402
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,981
-They haven't changed a single bit.
-You knew?

403
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:10,318
They ran away after about two weeks
when we filmed ten years ago.

404
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,403
Didn't you know?

405
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,614
The day Yeon-su went home early
and Ung was absent?

406
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,157
That's right.

407
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,994
They both disappeared,
so we looked for them everywhere.

408
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:21,705
-So where did you find them?
-We didn't.

409
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,958
But they seemed to have
reached an agreement.

410
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:27,377
They just returned as if nothing happened.

411
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:29,462
-What?
-It's obvious.

412
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,548
They'll return by themselves later,

413
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:33,425
so just wait quietly.

414
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:35,051
Don't worry.

415
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:39,472
Chae-ran was looking for some lodging.
Are you going somewhere?

416
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:40,765
Can I join you?

417
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,101
This trip isn't for fun.

418
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:46,021
Ms. Lee wanted to come too,
but don't even think about it.

419
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,981
Grow up, the both of you.

420
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:57,032
I made a list of places we can go to.

421
00:26:57,115 --> 00:27:00,410
-Should we decide after we find them?
-No, have things set in advance.

422
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:02,329
Otherwise, we won't have enough time.

423
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:06,249
I'll make sure to get them today,
no matter what.

424
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,296
Is he useful?

425
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:13,256
I told him to make a list of lodgings

426
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:17,052
and he gave me about 20 pages of places
where newlyweds would go.

427
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,637
He's really good at organizing stuff.

428
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,723
I already feel nauseous.

429
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,016
He's so different from me.

430
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,186
Mr. Kim!

431
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,271
Are you going out on business?
I can drive.

432
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:29,647
No, it's fine.

433
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,067
Hey, Intern. You can go--

434
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,234
It's Im Tae-hun, sir.

435
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,445
Okay, Intern. Why don't you--

436
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:36,738
It's Im Tae-hun.

437
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,411
All right.
I'll call you Imtern from now on.

438
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,623
Imtern, go home and pack. Okay?

439
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:48,041
Okay.

440
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:49,918
-And Chae-ran, wrap up here and go home.
-Okay.

441
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:53,797
-Imtern.
-Yes, sir.

442
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,528
Are you uncomfortable here?

443
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,573
No, I was thinking
of visiting soon anyway.

444
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:25,078
I'm glad your parents seem healthy.

445
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:29,541
They have aged quite a lot though.

446
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,169
How about your grandma? Is she doing okay?

447
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,755
Yes, she's good.

448
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:37,924
I see.

449
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,059
The radishes are really…

450
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,936
You didn't answer me yet.

451
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,863
How have you been?

452
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:05,452
Well, I just graduated
and started working.

453
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:07,537
Nothing much.

454
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:09,414
I've been okay.

455
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:12,792
Is that it?

456
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:16,004
Yes. Nothing special.

457
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,883
-Then yesterday--
-Yesterday,

458
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,801
I was really drunk.

459
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,929
It's embarrassing,
so just forget what happened.

460
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:29,934
You know how stressed I was
working on this project.

461
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:38,902
I enjoyed the food.

462
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:41,654
I should get going.

463
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:47,202
-Yeon-su, are you leaving already?
-My gosh.

464
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,662
I really enjoyed the food.

465
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:52,916
I didn't expect to come here,
so I didn't bring anything.

466
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,834
Gosh, there's no need.

467
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:58,046
You can visit us any time, all right?

468
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,047
Okay.

469
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,715
Oh, wait. Hang on.

470
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:02,592
I packed some side dishes.

471
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:04,093
No, it's fine.

472
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:06,262
Have these with your grandmother.

473
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,682
And bring her along next time.

474
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,976
You didn't have to.

475
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:15,522
But I'll enjoy these. Thank you.

476
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:16,731
Come back next time.

477
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,107
Take her home, Ung.

478
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,692
I can go by myself.

479
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:21,486
Of course not!

480
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:22,820
Jeez.

481
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,197
Come back next time, okay?

482
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,616
I'll see you next time. Bye.

483
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:27,992
Get home safe.

484
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,204
See you next time.

485
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:39,837
How do they seem to you?

486
00:30:40,838 --> 00:30:42,882
I have no clue.

487
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:53,268
I've always said this,

488
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:56,771
but you should be good to your parents.
They're so kind and nice.

489
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,067
Are you going home?

490
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:04,779
Ji-ung won't still
be waiting there, would he?

491
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:08,700
We both went AWOL without telling them,

492
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:11,494
so let's apologize tomorrow
and start filming again…

493
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:13,830
Right. This is how I felt.

494
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:17,959
This is how I felt while dating you.

495
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:21,337
I was just waiting like an idiot,

496
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:25,258
watching you walk away, step by step.

497
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:26,467
It was always like that.

498
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,305
What do you mean?

499
00:31:30,888 --> 00:31:33,850
When you said you were okay,
I had to just accept it.

500
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,436
When you said nothing was wrong,

501
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,063
I had to say I worried for no reason.

502
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,941
And when you wanted to break up,

503
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:45,528
I had to accept it
without knowing the reason.

504
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,573
And when I met you again,

505
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,784
I didn't know how you'd been

506
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:56,414
or what you were thinking…

507
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:02,712
but I had to just accept things
without knowing anything.

508
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:05,089
"Attack is the secret of defense."

509
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,509
It really feels like you're back, Yeon-su.

510
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:12,055
Choi Ung.

511
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:14,265
I'm really sick of this.

512
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:18,519
I guess that's what I'm doing right now.

513
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:25,234
But this wasn't my choice.

514
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,591
One, two, three!

515
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:51,594
-Good job.
-Good job.

516
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,846
-Good job.
-Good job.

517
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,848
-Good job.
-Thank you.

518
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,350
-Good job.
-NJ.

519
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:01,646
I had a really meaningful experience today
thanks to you.

520
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:02,855
Thank you.

521
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:08,277
We were able to
reflect on ourselves today thanks to you.

522
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:11,239
Thank you for giving us this opportunity.

523
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:14,784
-So you're going to let us off, right?
-Jeez.

524
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:18,246
We'll do our best
to make up for our mistakes.

525
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:22,959
And we'll tell everyone
about how cool you were today.

526
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,085
Okay?

527
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:29,132
All right.

528
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,220
-Director.
-Yes?

529
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:37,265
I'm sorry, but I can't come anymore.

530
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,892
-Why?
-I thought they'd stop eventually.

531
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:42,812
I didn't know people would
keep leaving malicious comments.

532
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:45,773
They're not my fans.

533
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,943
They're just malicious commenters I sued.

534
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,611
-Hey, NJ.
-What?

535
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,280
Who? Me?

536
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:56,034
You always seemed to call me bitch.

537
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:02,165
-I'm not dropping the charges.
-What?

538
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,583
Good work today.

539
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:08,463
Thank you for joining me when I asked
if you wanted to do volunteer work.

540
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,131
Goodbye then.

541
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:13,259
-But please…
-You can't do this!

542
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,012
You've conned us.

543
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:19,849
You said you'd drop the charges.
This is ridiculous.

544
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:26,397
I don't think I ever promised
to drop the charges.

545
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,942
You ate with me here last year, right?

546
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:32,361
Did you do it again because you missed me?

547
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:33,780
Well, that was…

548
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:38,034
It was constructive criticism.
Do you think everyone is out to get you?

549
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:44,624
Should I read the comments
you wrote about me then?

550
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:48,002
Let's see how constructive it is.

551
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:52,882
Hey, you're just abusing your power
against innocent citizens.

552
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:54,425
We're all busy people, you know.

553
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,636
You were just making us waste our time!

554
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,890
You'd better suck up to me
if you at least want a lower sentence.

555
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,725
Are you sure about this?

556
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,897
-Jeez.
-Excuse me.

557
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:09,690
NJ.

558
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:14,112
As you know,
I only made this mistake once.

559
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:17,615
If I get indicted,
I'll have a hard time getting a job.

560
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:22,203
Can you please let me off this time?
My life is at stake here.

561
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:28,835
All right. You only did it once.

562
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,754
So I'll sue you just once.

563
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,715
If you do it twice,
I'll sue you twice too.

564
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:40,263
Come on. People make mistakes.

565
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:41,848
Do you have to be so cruel?

566
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:45,434
What kind of a mistake led
you to sexually harass me online?

567
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,103
Your ID is Bibibik, right?

568
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:49,856
VOLUNTEER WITH NJ
BRIQUETTE DELIVERY OF LOVE

569
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:53,359
There were articles
about how this was a place

570
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:55,152
for reconciliation and forgiveness.

571
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,196
Go and tell people it isn't.

572
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,742
Tell everyone that I was a crazy bitch
who was bent on suing you.

573
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:04,120
And that I was acting unlike myself.

574
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,415
Go and tell people this

575
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:10,042
as you've always done.

576
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,879
-Wait, NJ!
-Drop the charges!

577
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:14,380
That's enough.

578
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,507
Do you even have a conscience?

579
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:24,765
Darn it.

580
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,518
What did I say now?

581
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:31,063
I just want to go home and rest.

582
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:39,030
WHY DID YOU TWO SUDDENLY GO AWOL?

583
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:43,826
-Choi Ung!

584
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,786
Congratulations!

585
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,331
You're far away right now,

586
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:49,999
but we're congratulating you.

587
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:51,667
Congratulations!

588
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:54,086
Ung here says that he's really happy.

589
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:57,340
Right, Ung? You're happy, aren't you?
Why don't you smile?

590
00:36:57,423 --> 00:37:00,635
Hey, I heard you're earning a fortune.

591
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,137
Can't you buy my bar? Please?

592
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:07,099
Ung, this is our success story!

593
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:10,061
I can't believe the dim-witted Ung

594
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:12,521
has succeeded this much.

595
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,190
I can't…

596
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:18,277
I can't believe

597
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:22,031
I saw my idiot Ung succeed…

598
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:25,201
Why are you crying?
You're making me cry too.

599
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:27,662
He didn't even get to eat properly…

600
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,288
Don't cry. You'll sober up.

601
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,666
He suffered so much…

602
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,417
Ung!

603
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:37,672
You have to be happy, all right?

604
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:43,177
It looks more like
they're holding my funeral.

605
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,180
Should I report them?

606
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:48,724
Eun-ho, that jerk.

607
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,559
What?

608
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:52,269
NJ

609
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:00,778
This is how I felt.

610
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,698
I was just waiting like an idiot,

611
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,825
watching you walk away, step by step.

612
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:08,327
It was always like that.

613
00:38:09,286 --> 00:38:10,913
I'm really sick of this.

614
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:12,456
Is that you, Yeon-su?

615
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,839
Why are you standing there like that?

616
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:22,133
-Did you just arrive?
-Yes.

617
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,094
What's that in your hand?

618
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,977
Grandma, I'll be back in a moment.

619
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,979
Didn't you just get home?

620
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:40,109
Good job.
You should have done that earlier.

621
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,986
It's not something
you can forgive that easily.

622
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:44,572
"The kindhearted NJ
who forgives everyone"?

623
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:45,990
That's nonsense.

624
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:47,366
We'll tell the boss

625
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:50,036
that you won't be dropping charges
for anyone anymore.

626
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:51,871
Those jerks.

627
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:54,457
But…

628
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,960
why did you want to
meet them in person every time?

629
00:38:59,336 --> 00:39:00,504
I just thought

630
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:04,925
that it'd be less scary
if I saw the people behind it.

631
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:08,763
Just avoid them. Run away.

632
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,182
It's okay to do that.

633
00:39:19,356 --> 00:39:21,484
That's why I'm running away today.

634
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:24,779
To that person?

635
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:30,868
Yes.

636
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:34,830
Mr. Choi!

637
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:37,166
My gosh.

638
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:39,168
Darn it.

639
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,170
Hey…

640
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:46,133
I guess I called at the perfect timing.

641
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:49,970
Were you wandering around
after running away from home?

642
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,098
Running away from home at this age?

643
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:53,349
I was just

644
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,519
trying to have some time to myself.

645
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:59,105
If you don't want
to do the documentary, just don't.

646
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:03,067
It'd be quite overwhelming for someone
who isn't a celebrity.

647
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:14,912
It's okay. Come here.

648
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,956
Bring your bags.

649
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:26,841
I can't believe this! Are you really NJ?

650
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:29,051
You're really NJ?

651
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,095
Yes. Do you have a pen?

652
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:43,566
Hey, kid. You should ask for permission
before taking photos of someone.

653
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:44,900
Can I take a photo?

654
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,360
No, you can't.

655
00:40:46,443 --> 00:40:49,155
There are lots of pretty photos online,
so look at those.

656
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:50,614
Here.

657
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:53,784
Do you know what scarcity is?

658
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:55,619
You know rare items, right?

659
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,121
-Yes.
-Yes.

660
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,332
If you want
your bags to become rare items,

661
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:04,378
you shouldn't tell anyone
that I'm here. Got that?

662
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:06,255
-Yes.
-Yes.

663
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:08,132
If you tell people I'm here,

664
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:11,135
I'll sign everyone's bags.

665
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,721
-So you shouldn't, right?
-Right.

666
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,848
Run along now.
I was talking with my friend.

667
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:17,850
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

668
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:25,649
Even little kids recognize you.

669
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:27,651
It must be tiring.

670
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:31,238
Ordinary people like you
won't ever know what it's like.

671
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:35,826
Wait. I think you'd understand a bit now.

672
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:40,122
Well, there were people who recognized me

673
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:42,625
because of that stupid documentary.

674
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:44,627
Then why are you filming it again?

675
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:47,254
It just happened.

676
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:50,674
I've fallen into my own trap, I guess.

677
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:53,344
That happens sometimes.

678
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,023
Did you just laugh at me?

679
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,692
Let's have lunch together.

680
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:11,987
Well, I just ate.

681
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:20,037
Mr. Choi. I really didn't want
to say this myself,

682
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:24,959
but I'm introverted and sensitive
even though I might not seem so.

683
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,336
My blood type is A and my MBTI is ISFP.

684
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:30,714
So I wrote some things in my heart diary.

685
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:32,925
What diary?

686
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:33,884
First.

687
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,971
"Mr. Choi got famous
because I bought one of his works,

688
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:39,598
but why doesn't he want to buy me a meal?"

689
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:40,724
Second.

690
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:45,145
"I commissioned him to draw my building,
but why doesn't he even contact me?"

691
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:47,356
And third.

692
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:49,733
"I made him even more popular

693
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:52,486
by going to his drawing show
when I wasn't even invited,

694
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:55,281
but why won't he still buy me a meal?"

695
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:59,243
-Well, I--
-Those are the three debts you have.

696
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:00,869
How will you repay me?

697
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:16,719
Does he think he's the only one
who can get upset?

698
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:19,680
When did he ever tell me anything?

699
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,682
Choi Ung was always the one…

700
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:25,185
Why isn't he picking up?

701
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:26,812
…who hid when he got upset.

702
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:36,113
But this…

703
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:41,744
I didn't expect

704
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:44,288
Excuse me.

705
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:48,959
Hey…

706
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:56,216
Why are you so clumsy?

707
00:43:57,718 --> 00:44:00,971
Anyway, I thought everyone
would pretend not to have eaten

708
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:02,723
if I asked to have a meal together.

709
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:04,933
You're so difficult.

710
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:08,937
NJ…

711
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:12,650
You keep contacting me

712
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,319
and finding me…

713
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:20,074
I've been pretty clueless, haven't I?

714
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:25,204
Weren't you pretending to be clueless?

715
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:26,747
I guess it's true…

716
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:31,377
I'm sorry.
I should have brought it up first.

717
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,128
I know, right?

718
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:36,048
It's embarrassing
to have to say it myself.

719
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:39,093
Well…

720
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:45,349
Since you bought three drawings,
I'll give you one for free.

721
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:48,060
I don't usually do this,
but since you're NJ,

722
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:50,145
-if there's anything--
-Mr. Choi.

723
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:52,398
I have a lot of money.

724
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:55,734
Do you think I'm doing this
just to get a free drawing?

725
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,113
What? Then why are you
being so nice to me?

726
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:02,408
So I don't have a reason.

727
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:04,868
No, that's not what I meant.

728
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:07,371
-Why would someone like you--
-Because I like you.

729
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:08,330
What?

730
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,999
-Oh my!
-My gosh!

731
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:14,169
Why do you keep dropping your ice cream?

732
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:16,296
What do you mean?

733
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:20,759
I had a really tough day today.

734
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:25,139
I don't want to whine about it
because it's normal for me.

735
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:27,808
But…

736
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:30,686
I feel better when I see you.

737
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:34,064
At first, I felt better
when I saw your drawings.

738
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:36,775
But now, I feel it with you too.

739
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:41,071
That's my reason for seeing you.

740
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:44,366
So stop getting so startled
whenever you see me.

741
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:46,702
And don't look so shocked.

742
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:49,037
I'm not saying I love you,

743
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:50,998
and I'm not asking you out.

744
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:52,708
I'm just saying that I like you.

745
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:57,796
Maybe it's just because
you look like Tofu.

746
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:00,716
"Tofu"?

747
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:02,384
Yes. My dog.

748
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:04,845
I see, your dog.

749
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:10,893
Are you going somewhere?

750
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:13,687
Some kids just don't listen.

751
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:16,648
I should get going. Let's hang out again.

752
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:19,359
You should go home too.

753
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:21,612
Let's go!

754
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:24,907
-Go!
-It's NJ!

755
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:26,283
Is it really NJ?

756
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:28,702
-They're back again.
-NJ! I want your autograph too!

757
00:46:28,785 --> 00:46:30,704
-NJ!
-There she is!

758
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:39,379
You're unbelievable.

759
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:40,964
Were you looking for me all day?

760
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:43,550
No, I just started looking for you.

761
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,719
I found you earlier than expected.

762
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:47,429
You didn't even go that far.

763
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:50,724
-What were you doing?
-Just taking a walk.

764
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:00,651
Really?

765
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:02,903
Then why did you run away today?

766
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:05,155
I needed a break.

767
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:07,032
You needed a break?

768
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:10,911
Yes. I wanted to experience some freedom.

769
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:14,081
Is that so? You should have told me.
You'll get to soon.

770
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:16,250
-What?
-Never mind.

771
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:19,002
Are you going to keep shooting?

772
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:24,007
-I'm just confirming. Don't answer that.
-Hey.

773
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:30,222
Did you fight with Ung again?

774
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:34,142
We didn't really fight.
He just got angry at me.

775
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:36,562
When did he become so short-tempered?

776
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:38,480
When do you think?

777
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:44,403
Fine. Everything's my fault.

778
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:47,990
Not everything. Maybe about half.

779
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:49,992
Half and half with Ung.

780
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:51,159
Half and half?

781
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:54,746
Breaking up
isn't usually just one person's fault.

782
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,415
It's the same for both sides.

783
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:03,297
What is it?

784
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:06,592
You seem to know a lot about dating.

785
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:08,468
What?

786
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,596
So, are you seeing someone?

787
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:13,432
My gosh.

788
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:17,394
You're not. Have you ever dated before?

789
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:20,063
Yeon-su. There are two kinds of men
in this world.

790
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:22,899
Men who can't date,
and men who don't date.

791
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:24,568
You're someone who can't.

792
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:28,363
You're so ridiculous.

793
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:31,867
You'd be shocked to find out
what kind of person I am.

794
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:33,619
Really? What kind of person are you?

795
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:36,955
I'm a bit of a bad boy.

796
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:40,208
You know what a homme fatale is, right?

797
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:43,587
It means I could be fatal to women.

798
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:47,007
I try to keep my attractiveness hidden
so I won't harm others.

799
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:51,637
Kim Ji-ung.
When did you become so shameless?

800
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:53,805
You're so funny.

801
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:57,100
That wasn't a joke. I'm serious.

802
00:48:57,184 --> 00:49:01,104
I guess you were a bit popular
when we were in high school.

803
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,564
You finally get me.

804
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:03,649
Why, though?

805
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:06,109
Hey, that's kind of mean.

806
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:08,695
I guess it helped that
you were the student president.

807
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,865
You just didn't know me much back then.

808
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,246
I'm so drunk right now.

809
00:49:20,957 --> 00:49:21,917
That idiot…

810
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:24,461
Is that Sol-i?

811
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:27,798
What a way to end a terrible day.

812
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:29,800
Sol-i!

813
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:30,884
Sol-i.

814
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:32,511
Sol-i!

815
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:34,930
Yeon-su!

816
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:40,102
What is this?

817
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:42,020
-I'm drunk.
-My gosh.

818
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:54,157
Eun-ho?

819
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:06,211
Have you finally croaked?

820
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:20,642
Maybe…

821
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:23,645
rather than a raise,
you're better off gone.

822
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:27,858
You made a total mess in here.

823
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:32,070
I think I'm going to puke.

824
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:35,866
-You're unbelievable.
-I'm going to puke.

825
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:39,327
You're such a pain.

826
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:43,039
Is it okay for her to sleep here?

827
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:44,291
Her dad's a minister.

828
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:46,710
Believe it or not,
her family's very religious.

829
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:48,378
They don't know she drinks.

830
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:49,838
I love you, God.

831
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:53,008
How can they not know
when she's running a bar?

832
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:54,926
You should see her act.

833
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:57,387
She should have been an actress,
not a writer.

834
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:00,682
-I love you.
-Just go to sleep.

835
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:03,560
I'm sorry you got dragged into this mess.

836
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:07,063
-What's going on here?
-Grandma!

837
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:10,859
Oh, my. Aren't you Ji-ung?

838
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:12,319
It's so nice to see you.

839
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:15,197
How have you been?
It looks like you got younger.

840
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,490
Come on.

841
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:19,868
Since when were you two so close?

842
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:23,497
Ji-ung's the sweetest boy I've ever seen.

843
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:25,707
Have you eaten?

844
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:27,751
-Why don't I give you something to eat?
-All right.

845
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:29,711
But what's this stench?

846
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:33,173
It's me, it's me

847
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:35,675
That little brat! Is she drunk again?

848
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:38,136
-Can you leave my room now?
-That wench.

849
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,555
What do we do with her?

850
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,393
Welcome!

851
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:02,285
Ung! My Ung who ran away.

852
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:05,288
I knew you'd become successful.

853
00:52:05,997 --> 00:52:08,416
I'm so proud of you.

854
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:11,044
I'm still not forgiving you.

855
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:14,089
Continued on the back.

856
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:18,468
You may be a loser who failed at love,

857
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:20,720
but you succeeded in your career.

858
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,472
Let's work hard!

859
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:25,433
It's me, Sol-i.

860
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:27,853
Can you lend me 20 million won?

861
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:30,647
You jerk!

862
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:49,958
So what are you doing these days?

863
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,336
-I'm filming Ung.
-The documentary?

864
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,839
Will it be on TV, then?

865
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:57,591
Yes, of course.

866
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:17,694
What are you doing here so early?

867
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:19,279
Get in. Let's go for a drive.

868
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,239
Are you half-asleep?

869
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:23,366
You said you wanted to experience freedom.

870
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:27,370
-Let's get some fresh air.
-No, I can't be bothered.

871
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:31,249
Hey!

872
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:34,586
What are you doing?
You'll wake the whole neighborhood.

873
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:37,631
-Why don't I?
-Hey, Ji-ung!

874
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:38,882
Get in.

875
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:46,431
In American horror films,

876
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:50,101
crime usually happens

877
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:55,774
What are you doing?

878
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:04,324
Where are you going?

879
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:09,996
What?

880
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:19,798
They strike when you have your guard down.

881
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:36,231
And the criminal usually ends up

882
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:39,025
being an acquaintance.

883
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:45,407
What…

884
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:47,367
What are you doing?

885
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:24,154
Choi Ung's surprise show!

886
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:26,031
How many fans will be here today?

887
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:28,199
All right. Get out.

888
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:30,910
-Take off your blindfold!
-Hey!

889
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:33,329
What do you think you're doing?

890
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:36,583
How could you not tell me anything
during the whole trip?

891
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:37,667
What…

892
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:39,794
Where's your boss?

893
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:41,171
I'm going to sue…

894
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:49,971
Hey, Ji-ung!

895
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:53,391
You're here.

896
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:56,770
Ji-ung. This isn't funny at all.

897
00:55:56,853 --> 00:56:00,148
I don't know what you're up to, but…

898
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:09,532
So the genre here isn't romance…

899
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:14,788
We're all here now.
We're staying here for three days.

900
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:18,917
-We have seven fans today!
-…it's horror.

901
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,210
Round of applause!

902
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:24,130
You might have noticed,
but you can't leave without a car.

903
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:27,258
If you want to leave,
you'll have to start walking now.

904
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:29,302
It'll take days though.

905
00:56:29,385 --> 00:56:30,845
Ji-ung!

906
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:37,060
A cliche horror-thriller film

907
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:39,062
that's always released

908
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:41,272
around this time of the year.

909
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:49,447
EPILOGUE

910
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:50,657
-Sir.
-Yes.

911
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,033
Choi Ung isn't here today.

912
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:54,911
What? He's not here?

913
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:55,995
No.

914
00:56:57,539 --> 00:57:00,750
No wonder. He wasn't picking up earlier.

915
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:11,261
Sir.

916
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:13,179
Yes?

917
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:16,683
Can I leave school early?

918
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:18,226
Why? Are you not well?

919
00:57:20,061 --> 00:57:20,979
No.

920
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:23,857
Right. You must have been
overworked these days.

921
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,400
Go and get some rest.

922
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:33,283
NO LONGER HUMAN
CHEKHOV SHORT STORIES

923
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:49,966
What are you doing here?

924
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:51,676
Getting a book.

925
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:54,137
You skipped school to come here?

926
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:56,306
No one would know I'm here.

927
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:58,766
What about you?

928
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:01,644
I got off school early.

929
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,775
Are you going to read that?

930
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:10,236
Yes.

931
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:16,034
Well, it might be a bit difficult for you.
Are you sure you can?

932
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:20,246
It won't be easy to understand
Nietzsche's philosophical ideology.

933
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:22,832
THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA

934
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:27,670
So just give it to me.
It'll be better if I read it.

935
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:29,839
Eternal return.

936
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:33,051
It's the concept that the universe
is recurring infinitely.

937
00:58:34,385 --> 00:58:37,096
And in its eternal recurrence,

938
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,724
our existence also recurs infinitely
and continues to do so.

939
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:43,144
I got curious about the eternity of time.

940
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:44,437
So I'm reading it again.

941
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:50,735
Okay.

942
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:52,737
Return if when you're done.

943
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:55,240
About yesterday…

944
00:58:56,157 --> 00:58:57,534
I guess

945
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:01,246
I was a bit harsh.

946
00:59:05,541 --> 00:59:06,876
Is that why you ran away?

947
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:09,879
Yes. I thought you'd be uncomfortable.

948
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:18,638
I'm hungry. Let's go eat.

949
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:28,940
CATCH ME IF YOU CAN

950
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:52,338
Which trip was the most memorable?

951
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:54,799
I think I love you.

952
00:59:54,882 --> 00:59:57,594
We really came on another trip.
And it's farther away.

953
00:59:57,677 --> 00:59:59,596
-I'm disappointed.
-NJ!

954
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:01,472
It confuses me the more I film you two.

955
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:04,559
whether it's because of

956
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:07,020
We're not going to break up.

957
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:08,896
Just come to me like you did today.

958
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:14,569
