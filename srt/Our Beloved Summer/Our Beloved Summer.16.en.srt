1
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:46,004
"His drawings that show his emotions

2
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:48,214
are just like doodles

3
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,592
of a child trapped in his own world."

4
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:55,263
My entire life was summed up

5
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:56,973
into a sentence by someone else.

6
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:58,683
It made me pity you.

7
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,438
It seemed like
your life was so meaningless

8
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:06,274
that you could abandon anything.

9
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,361
What would be left of your life
if you lived like that?

10
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:14,240
No one could have put it better than this.

11
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:17,702
WITH UNG

12
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:20,455
THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING

13
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:23,750
I want to live a peaceful life
without doing anything.

14
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:26,878
Ma'am.

15
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:28,129
What's your rank?

16
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,881
I'm 267th.

17
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:31,466
The total number of students here…

18
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:33,134
There are 267 students.

19
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:37,180
Drawing is just going to be a hobby.

20
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,681
You know my dream.

21
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:42,519
It's to bask in the sun during the day
and to lie underneath a lamp at night.

22
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,521
A stressful life is not for me.

23
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:48,858
I can draw a new one.

24
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,902
Do you have no ambitions?

25
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:54,697
Give this chance to someone
who needs it more than I do.

26
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,367
Your thoughts about your work,

27
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,203
your life as an artist,

28
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,871
or your future plans and goals.

29
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,458
I don't have any.

30
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:10,046
That was how I had lived all along.

31
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,552
You're one lucky kid, aren't you?

32
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,680
You have such successful parents.

33
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:20,098
What do you want to be when you grow up?

34
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:23,268
You can be anything you want
since money won't be an issue.

35
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:25,270
Gosh, lucky you.

36
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,940
That's it. Hold your spoon like this.

37
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:32,068
Get a good spoonful of rice.

38
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:35,113
All you have to do
is eat well and be healthy. Like this.

39
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,367
-That's it.
-He's right.

40
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,579
Don't you worry about a thing
and just do what you want in life.

41
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:46,583
-That's all we want from you, okay?
-There you go.

42
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,377
-Goodness.
-What a good boy.

43
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:53,715
At times, nothing is the best you can do…

44
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:01,639
when you're living a borrowed life.

45
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,061
Ung, can you draw me?

46
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,564
Ung, can you draw me first?

47
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:13,151
-No. Ung, draw me--
-Ung, can you draw me first?

48
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:16,738
-Ung, draw me first.
-No, draw me first.

49
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:18,156
-So it's best…
-Come on.

50
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,908
-…not to be greedy.
-Ung, draw me.

51
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:28,124
Ung, when will you draw me?

52
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,544
Ung, when will you draw me?

53
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,630
Can you please draw me?

54
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:34,881
I'll draw you.

55
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:38,801
-But you can't draw.
-Who do you think he takes after?

56
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:39,844
Me.

57
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:43,306
That's good. You look beautiful.
Good. Stay still.

58
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:46,476
Yes. You look great right now.

59
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:52,774
I wanted to be a son
who was worthy of this perfect family…

60
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,734
No, stop blinking.

61
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:02,533
…and not a son
who was abandoned by their parents.

62
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:06,204
It's so hectic around here
thanks to a group of customers.

63
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,748
-Here.
-It's way too hectic.

64
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:12,085
So if I didn't do anything,

65
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,544
no one would know.

66
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,255
A series of studies have claimed

67
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:18,049
that one's genes have more effect

68
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:23,429
on determining one's personality
than the environment.

69
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:27,016
To support this theory,
gene-mapping researchers in the US

70
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,104
are currently looking for the genes
that determine one's personality--

71
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,023
-Honestly, I don't know either.
-Me too.

72
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:41,197
Deep down, I was afraid
that I might be a worthless person.

73
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,201
That's why
I pretended not to know anything

74
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:48,413
and that I wasn't interested at all.

75
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:50,832
But in the end,

76
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,918
this is how things turned out.

77
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,505
So now

78
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,092
I've become a worthless person

79
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:06,222
who's trapped in his own empty life.

80
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:10,476
EPISODE 16
OUR BELOVED SUMMER

81
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:17,817
ENROLLMENT GUIDE SCHOOL OF ARCHITECTURE
ENSA, PARIS

82
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,532
I want to go with you.

83
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,544
I'm not taking this lightly.

84
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:40,089
I've thought this through for a while.

85
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:44,093
I do understand
that this may seem sudden to you,

86
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,099
but can you just trust me on this?

87
00:05:57,565 --> 00:06:01,694
So you were interested after all.

88
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,281
I know my life has seemed pathetic.

89
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,242
So…

90
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,662
I'm going to start afresh.

91
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,249
And…

92
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,418
I need you by my side.

93
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:21,130
I can't do this by myself.

94
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:27,178
But to go this far away--

95
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:28,763
I need you.

96
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:29,972
You know that.

97
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:37,313
Can you please come with me
and be with me?

98
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,779
Because, you see,

99
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,198
I'm a bit of a mess right now.

100
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,627
I'll think about it.

101
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:01,796
Give me some time.

102
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,677
I'll give it some thought.

103
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:09,929
Really?

104
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,390
Yes.

105
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:16,894
After all, this is the first time
you found something you wanted to do.

106
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,025
Did I seem too weak?

107
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,069
No.

108
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:28,239
And I never thought you were pathetic.

109
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:31,242
You've achieved more than I have.

110
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,094
Sorry? What did you just say?

111
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:55,391
I'd like you to work
at our headquarters in Paris.

112
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:59,770
I've been assigned there recently
and need to build a new team.

113
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,064
And you were the first one I thought of.

114
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,943
I looked through all your past projects,
and they were quite fascinating.

115
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,446
But why me?

116
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:10,907
You're someone I need, Ms. Kook.

117
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:15,411
So I'd like you to come with me.

118
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:25,588
The terms are quite favorable.
I'm actively trying to recruit you

119
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,591
because I know how competent you are.

120
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,094
Thank you.

121
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,264
I didn't expect you
of all people to make such an offer.

122
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,934
I don't know what to think.

123
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,019
Do I still seem like a sociopath?

124
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,356
I should get going.

125
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,275
I need to walk my dog.

126
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,152
Think about it and call me.

127
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,504
It's a good opportunity.

128
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:09,882
Mr. Jang came to me first
and told me about it.

129
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,177
He sure has a keen eye for talent.

130
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:17,390
Anyway, don't think about it too much
and just do it, okay?

131
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:19,892
-No. I--
-Yeon-su.

132
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:24,230
I'm saying this
as a colleague who truly cares about you.

133
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,524
I truly want you
to seize this opportunity.

134
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,695
I saw how hard you worked to get this far.

135
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:34,865
So this time around,
put yourself first before anyone else.

136
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:38,911
You should also live the life
you want, right?

137
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,557
How could he fire me like this?

138
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,685
I'm going to report him
to the Ministry of Employment and Labor.

139
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:08,190
I'm going to expose everything
he's done and sue him.

140
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,984
I know you won't do that.

141
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,028
Choi Ung, you scumbag.

142
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,614
He can't do anything without me.

143
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,157
Let's see how well he does.

144
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,826
What can you do? He wants to go.

145
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,246
Tag along with him
if you're that sad to say goodbye.

146
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,790
He didn't even bother to invite me.

147
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,001
Had he asked,

148
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:29,545
I would have pretended
it was a dilemma then gave in.

149
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,922
I can't believe him.

150
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,384
But what can you do in France?

151
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,178
Isn't he going there to study?

152
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:39,889
Then he must've made
that decision for your sake.

153
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,350
Look. He told me to live my life.

154
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:46,354
So is he saying I haven't been living
my life this whole time?

155
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:49,148
And does he think
I can't do anything without him?

156
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,151
What will you do without him?

157
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,278
Without him, I'll…

158
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,156
I'll…

159
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,911
I can't do anything without him…

160
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:08,834
DAEHAN BANK

161
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,253
What is this?

162
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,426
What's wrong?

163
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,637
What is it?

164
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,596
Come on.

165
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:26,060
-Are these tears or snot?
-My severance pay…

166
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:27,853
Your nose is running.

167
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,688
-My severance pay…
-What?

168
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,649
-My severance pay…
-What about it?

169
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,234
Is he not giving you any?

170
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,236
He gave me too much…

171
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:47,706
No way!

172
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:57,466
Eun-ho.

173
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,885
If you don't have any future plans,

174
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,931
how about we start a business together?

175
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,016
Don't be absurd.

176
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,394
I don't do business with others.

177
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,525
I already got a friend discount.

178
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,278
So how about a celebrity discount?

179
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,948
-I can give you a bigger discount.
-That's not right.

180
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,410
You should stop saying things
that lower the value of your work.

181
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,996
They're not that great to begin with.

182
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:34,378
What? Are you saying
that I have terrible taste in art?

183
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:36,630
No, that's not what I meant.

184
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:39,049
Do you know why I like your drawings?

185
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,428
The more I looked at them,
the more I realized

186
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,848
why your drawings comforted me.

187
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,517
The winding lines made me wonder

188
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:54,106
if you were just as anxious as I was.

189
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,776
Your stubbornness
to only draw things that didn't change

190
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:02,198
made me wonder
if you were just as lonely as I was.

191
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:07,244
But whenever I look at your finished work,

192
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,372
it warms my heart.

193
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:12,666
It puts me at ease.

194
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,587
You seem like someone

195
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,840
who's strong inside.

196
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:26,180
And, surprisingly,
they end up comforting me.

197
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:30,309
It's as if you're saying
that I can become like you.

198
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:38,734
This is my criticism of your work.

199
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:42,196
So don't mind the others
and just listen to me.

200
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,240
After all, I'm your biggest buyer.

201
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:46,617
Thank you.

202
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,745
Your words are surprisingly comforting.

203
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:55,584
We must've become really close,
seeing how we're comforting each other.

204
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:03,759
Anyway, I'm sad to hear you'll be leaving.

205
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,929
Studying abroad can be very lonely.

206
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,723
Yeon-su will be coming with me.

207
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,769
Really?

208
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,771
I can't live without her.

209
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,231
I see.

210
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,401
She must…

211
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,029
really love you

212
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:30,202
to choose your life over hers.

213
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,289
That's not easy to do.

214
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,467
Grandma.

215
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,678
Yes?

216
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:51,015
Will you really be okay without me?

217
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,475
Of course. I'll be just fine.

218
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,645
That was quick.

219
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,522
That hurt.

220
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:04,486
I can keep myself busy
by spending time with the old ladies.

221
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:08,240
But what if you collapse again?

222
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:12,912
They said I'd be fine as long as I take
my blood pressure medication regularly.

223
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,163
Goodness.

224
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,083
So stop worrying about me

225
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:22,296
and follow your heart.

226
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:29,053
That's a favor I'm asking of you. Got it?

227
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,058
Let's go.

228
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,851
Goodness. Let's go.

229
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:37,770
Let's go.

230
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:47,363
…To choose your life over hers.

231
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,408
After all, this is the first time
you found something you wanted to do.

232
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:32,074
You should also live the life
you want, right?

233
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:36,870
So stop worrying about me

234
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,580
and follow your heart.

235
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,543
Follow my heart?

236
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:04,440
DAILYBEER

237
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,616
Thank you. Enjoy.

238
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,208
Do it.

239
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,711
Why should I?

240
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,546
That's what we do.

241
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,507
Recording the moments of people's lives.

242
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:35,054
We explain how priceless
that is time after time to those we film,

243
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,890
so why won't you do it?

244
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,975
There isn't anything worth recording.

245
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:46,940
You know what?

246
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,526
I just don't get it.

247
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:54,281
She came back because she's dying
when she's ignored me all my life.

248
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,283
This is just absurd.

249
00:17:57,117 --> 00:18:00,037
What should I do?

250
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,290
Why should I…

251
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,169
do this for her?

252
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,548
I just don't get it.

253
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,134
Do it for yourself.

254
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,972
You're the one
who'll have to live with it.

255
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:22,851
The one who'll have
to live with those memories.

256
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,479
is you.

257
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,238
Hey.

258
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,783
Do you even have a portrait
you can use for her funeral?

259
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:42,412
Funny, right?

260
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:47,126
You run around with a camera all the time
yet you don't have one photo of your mom.

261
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:52,047
I only have one photo of my mom.

262
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,675
But it's a group photo.

263
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,930
She's surrounded by others
and smiling from ear to ear.

264
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,601
I'm grateful to have even that.

265
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,647
I look at it at times when I think of her.

266
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:19,158
I don't know your story.

267
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:23,787
Whether you decide to resent her
or forgive her, save that for later.

268
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:29,626
I just hope you won't
waste this moment by not doing anything.

269
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,297
That's all.

270
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,185
-Ung.
-Yes?

271
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,938
Do you want to…

272
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,483
meet up at Sol-i's later this evening?

273
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:37,986
Sure.

274
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,385
Okay. I understand.

275
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:03,845
I respect your decision.

276
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:19,319
Come on.

277
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:22,614
The owner here
sure makes her customers uncomfortable.

278
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,617
She needs to take
a close look at this one customer

279
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,995
since he rarely visits.

280
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:33,083
You must be busy dating,
so what brings you all the way here?

281
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,545
No particular reason.
I just missed your food.

282
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,761
Gosh. I'm not a kid anymore.

283
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:55,105
When you're going through a lot,
you should eat well.

284
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:57,107
I never said I was.

285
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,276
But as your mom, I can tell.

286
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,036
My son.

287
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,331
I can't believe you're all grown up.

288
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:36,188
You knew…

289
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,356
Yes.

290
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,692
I did.

291
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,613
…that I knew

292
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,333
Did anything change because of that?

293
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:58,960
Why would it?

294
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:02,714
You're my son no matter what.

295
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:11,681
You were always my son, Ung.

296
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,022
Thank you for being my son.

297
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:23,985
I'm truly grateful
that you grew up into a wonderful man.

298
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:34,663
I…

299
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,546
I was afraid…

300
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:47,259
that I wouldn't take after you and Dad.

301
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,980
I was afraid I wouldn't turn out
to be a good person like you.

302
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:07,320
That I might end up being a bad apple…

303
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:11,825
and fail to live up to your expectations.

304
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:15,203
I was afraid

305
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:17,789
that you might be disappointed in me.

306
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:21,042
That was my biggest fear.

307
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,755
What should I say?

308
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:30,677
Your dad and I
were never disappointed in you.

309
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:38,560
Since the moment we held you in our arms,

310
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,480
we've loved every part of you.

311
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,755
Mom.

312
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,006
Yes?

313
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:09,216
I want

314
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,344
to become a better version of myself.

315
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:14,930
I wish that you could…

316
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:19,726
sleep in peace now.

317
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:30,862
Eat up. You should have this
while it's still hot.

318
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:39,037
NJ, this is your last interview.

319
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,999
We've prepared the questions beforehand.

320
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,377
You can answer them comfortably.

321
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:49,005
First, we'd like you to explain

322
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:52,217
why you wanted to shoot here
for your last interview.

323
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,720
Sir, I have a favor to ask.

324
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:56,763
Sure.

325
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:58,515
What is it?

326
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,739
-Did you wait long?
-No, not really.

327
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:17,742
Isn't it really cold out?

328
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,494
Yes, it's freezing.

329
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,581
I told you to wear thicker clothes.

330
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,959
I warmed up my hands for you.

331
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:27,919
-Are they warm?
-Yes.

332
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:31,339
But I'm really fine.
Your hands will become cold again.

333
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:32,924
That's okay.

334
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,641
I guess you've made up

335
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:43,643
your mind.

336
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,521
Yes.

337
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:15,675
I knew it. She's always waiting for me.

338
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:44,954
Grandma.

339
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,294
Remember what you told me?

340
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,800
You told me
to stop enduring everything on my own.

341
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,720
And to make friends,

342
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:04,057
follow my heart,

343
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:06,476
and enjoy life.

344
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:11,272
So this time around,

345
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:14,692
I'm going to be bold

346
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,696
and follow my heart.

347
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,327
But you know what?

348
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:28,456
I realized I had been living
like that all along.

349
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:35,046
I always thought I was alone.

350
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:39,217
But…

351
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:44,389
there was never a time when I was alone.

352
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:07,412
Hey.

353
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,290
-Welcome…
-Hey.

354
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:16,004
Hey, I came up with a scenario.

355
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,756
Give me an objective review.

356
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,466
He asked for my number in public.

357
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:23,553
It's called Omniscient Psychopath's View…
…And he looked pretty sincere.

358
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:27,390
I have an offer to make.

359
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:30,226
Yi-hoon, I'm too busy to make time--

360
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,978
Would you like to work with me?

361
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:35,523
I'm sorry, but I'm too busy.

362
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,400
I'm not just asking for your help.

363
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:39,527
I'm recruiting you.

364
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:43,865
I started a company,
and the terms are not bad at all.

365
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:48,203
Right. There's also an advance payment.

366
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:55,084
I never asked for your help.

367
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:59,964
I know you'll land a job
at a big corporate company

368
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,925
if you take your time and prepare for it.

369
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:03,718
My company is small, I know.

370
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:08,181
But I'm going to give you a lot of work
and get my money's worth.

371
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:09,599
What I'm saying is

372
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:14,395
that I'm trying to make
the biggest investment of my life on you.

373
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,440
Read this through.

374
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:20,735
Call me if you change your mind.
Goodbye, then.

375
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,446
Right. Thanks for the coffee.

376
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:38,253
CONTRACT
RUN AND GOOK YEON-SU'S AGREEMENT

377
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,673
ON AND OFFLINE PR PLANS

378
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,432
-Yeon-su.
-Yes?

379
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,769
Can you include this part? It's important.

380
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,521
Got it? Okay?

381
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:59,148
We need to collaborate.

382
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,068
Ms. Kook!

383
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:04,195
-Ms. Kook!
-Ma'am, your presentation was awesome.

384
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,281
It was such a clean-cut presentation.

385
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:07,407
I think we'll succeed again.

386
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,867
You're the best!

387
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,910
Being surprised by you is getting old.

388
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:13,788
How do you keep getting better?

389
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:18,918
I'm right, aren't I?

390
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:21,504
-Get-together tonight?
-Sure thing!

391
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,258
I thought my life was pretty dull.

392
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:34,017
But, actually,

393
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,437
I've always had pretty good moments.

394
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:41,274
The only person
who made my life seem pathetic…

395
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,945
was just me.

396
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:49,157
Grandma.

397
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,096
I'm not going,

398
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,223
Ung.

399
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,439
For the first time,

400
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,943
I'm beginning to enjoy my life.

401
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,320
For the first time in my life,

402
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:30,406
I can clearly see the path I took.

403
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:35,286
So I want to live this life a bit longer.

404
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,124
I had always believed

405
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:45,588
that I had no choice
but to live this life.

406
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:49,342
But now…

407
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,638
I think this was the life
I had always wanted.

408
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:56,683
So…

409
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:01,521
I want to keep exploring
the life I have now and keep going.

410
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:11,948
Why aren't you saying anything?

411
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:17,036
I was thinking about how long it'd take.

412
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:20,665
What do you mean?

413
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,752
How long it'd take for me

414
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,047
to deserve you.

415
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,801
What do you mean?

416
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:36,931
You're an exceptional person
who exceeds my expectations.

417
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:39,976
But, on the other hand,

418
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,938
I've wasted too much time.

419
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,400
Yeon-su.

420
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:52,113
I've finally realized what I need to do.

421
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:55,283
What I wanted to do,

422
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,702
what I desire,

423
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,665
and what kind of a person I am.

424
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,590
So…

425
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,051
I think I will…

426
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:17,180
It's okay, Ung.

427
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:31,736
You can go.

428
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:34,489
We'll be fine.

429
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:45,333
It won't take too long.

430
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:48,127
I know.

431
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:50,797
And I won't change either.

432
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:54,842
I know.

433
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,721
I will come back.

434
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:03,142
I know.

435
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:06,729
So…

436
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:11,859
please wait for me.

437
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:56,737
Come in.

438
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,656
Why are you just standing there?

439
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:03,119
This was always the distance between us.

440
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:07,039
So why are you doing this now?

441
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:11,169
It's unfair for me…

442
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,882
to just die like this.

443
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:19,635
If I died like this…

444
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,139
without a trace,

445
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:25,016
that'd be too unfair.

446
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:29,312
You're selfish

447
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,273
as always.

448
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,651
Let me be…

449
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:42,074
a terrible mom until the day I die.

450
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:45,328
So don't mind me.

451
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:49,957
You can feel a bit sorry for me

452
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:51,751
and…

453
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:55,796
visit me from time to time.

454
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,132
Let's do that.

455
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,613
That doesn't make any sense.

456
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:24,033
Why would you come back
if that's what you wanted?

457
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,203
If you wanted things to remain the same,

458
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:29,538
you shouldn't have come back.

459
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,714
Say something…

460
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:42,927
will you?

461
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,472
Please.

462
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,023
Back then…

463
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:02,154
the sickness I had in my heart
was too much to handle.

464
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,864
I had no other choice.

465
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,785
I was afraid

466
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:13,374
you'd become as miserable as me
if you had stayed with me.

467
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,128
At times…

468
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:22,133
I'd see you outside…

469
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,594
and you'd look so bright.

470
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,683
I was afraid…

471
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,895
I'd drag you down with me.

472
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:38,774
I was so scared. That's why…

473
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:43,946
That's why I couldn't embrace you.

474
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,414
I won't forgive you.

475
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,125
No.

476
00:38:58,377 --> 00:38:59,545
I can't.

477
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:03,174
I understand.

478
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,344
Your suffering…

479
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,266
can't justify what you did to me.

480
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:15,936
I know.

481
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:18,314
Still…

482
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:21,942
you were the mother.

483
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,157
And…

484
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,744
I was just a little kid.

485
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,998
How could a mother do such a thing?

486
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:39,835
You're right.

487
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:43,756
How could you come back
and tell me that you're dying?

488
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:52,264
I won't forgive you.

489
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,434
Never.

490
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:58,813
Okay.

491
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:02,483
But…

492
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:06,153
maybe one day…

493
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:10,950
I might change my mind.

494
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,036
So…

495
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:19,333
fight to live.

496
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:25,214
Both you and I can start anew.

497
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,968
Let's not rely on others.

498
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:34,098
Let's live an ordinary life…

499
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,852
like everyone else does.

500
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:57,204
We were 29 years old.

501
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:00,166
That's when it all happened.

502
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:06,839
And I was preparing to leave soon.

503
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:11,844
I told my parents right away too.

504
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:13,929
I'm leaving at the end of the month.

505
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:15,806
Wait.

506
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:17,892
Honey.

507
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:23,272
Surprisingly, my dad got mad
and refused to see me for a while.

508
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:26,150
Even though he did nothing
but nag me all this time.

509
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,285
YOU'VE LEFT ME,
BUT I'M SENDING THIS FOR YOU

510
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:38,329
Gu Eun-ho, who was also mad at me,

511
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:41,540
sent me a 60-page document.

512
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,919
Right. Ji-ung was busy.

513
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:47,588
He said he was being filmed.

514
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,173
I'm…

515
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:51,133
So…

516
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:54,637
What was the question again?

517
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:59,642
What was the most memorable thing
you did with your mom, Mr. Kim?

518
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:01,810
All right.

519
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:04,813
Most memorable?

520
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:08,734
I know.
I think every last Saturday of the month…

521
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:13,572
we would go to the marketplace
and have tteokbokki together.

522
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:17,952
I think that was the only day she had off.

523
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:22,873
We'd hold hands and walk around.

524
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,501
It made me happy.

525
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:29,588
He always talked about being an observer.

526
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:32,299
But he's finally been put in our shoes.

527
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:37,805
I hope you won't forget

528
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:40,933
-that living a normal life…
-NJ caused her agency another headache.

529
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:44,019
I always wanted
to show you my cheerful side.

530
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:46,522
But that had been eating me up inside.

531
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:49,108
A 30-minute unedited video

532
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:52,319
-was broadcast out of the blue.
-Let's be friends like that.

533
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,657
The public seemed to be
outraged at her again,

534
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,659
but she received a lot of support too.

535
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,912
As for Yeon-su and I…

536
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:03,080
Ung.

537
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,089
-Weren't you cold?
-I'm fine.

538
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:14,216
-Did I keep you waiting?
-Not at all.

539
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,634
Let's go.

540
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:17,595
We made the best of our time.

541
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:35,112
We lived like that every day.

542
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:38,449
By the way, did you really rehearse
spraying me with water?

543
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:41,910
I was originally going to pour a bucket,
but I held myself back.

544
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,245
Don't you dare do that again.

545
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:46,290
You're making me curious.

546
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:49,793
I take that back.
Don't do that again. Ever.

547
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:51,086
No more what-ifs.

548
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:54,798
Can I ask you one last what-if question?

549
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:57,509
-There you go again.
-What if I…

550
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:00,137
-Every single day.
-What if…

551
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,263
-Hey.
-…you go abroad…

552
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:22,993
It was perfect.

553
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:27,998
-And I had to leave soon after.
-Ung.

554
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,541
We're in huge trouble!

555
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:32,628
-What is it?
-Hey, this is bad. It's terrible!

556
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:33,629
What is it?

557
00:44:34,546 --> 00:44:36,590
-What's wrong?
-We've run out of gas.

558
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:38,801
We'll be late if we stop for gas.

559
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:42,054
You can't be late for your flight,
so how about you just don't go?

560
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:45,474
Dad, I can see that the tank is full.

561
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:47,309
And we still have a lot of time.

562
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:53,148
Right. I have to stop by somewhere.

563
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:54,191
Wait for me outside.

564
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:58,070
Hey, Son. Then go wherever
you need to go and don't come back.

565
00:44:58,153 --> 00:45:01,907
Don't come back
so you can miss the flight, okay?

566
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:03,742
I won't be long.

567
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:11,208
There was one last thing I had to do
before starting my new journey.

568
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:18,173
Confronting my past…

569
00:45:19,716 --> 00:45:21,218
that had been haunting me.

570
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:34,523
I wanted to tell him once and for all…

571
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:38,235
that there was no need for him
to keep hurting because of me,

572
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:39,945
and that he didn't need to

573
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:42,239
avoid me or feel sorry for me.

574
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,247
That he had done enough,

575
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:54,209
and that we should let go of each other.

576
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:07,764
Like that, Ung left
around the end of winter.

577
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:14,855
I was okay.

578
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:18,150
You see, I like to be
in a mature relationship.

579
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:22,779
I miss Ung. My dear Ung.

580
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:25,199
Ung…

581
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:27,201
-No…
-Can you call the police?

582
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:30,996
I'm going to put her behind bars tonight.

583
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:34,541
Ung! My dear Ung!

584
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:37,085
-Of course, there were a few days…
-Find my dear Ung.

585
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:40,547
-…when I missed him a bit too much.
-What are we to do with her?

586
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:46,595
What if a foreign female student
who lives next door

587
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:50,516
knocks on your door
and asks for some butter?

588
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:53,519
I'm going to lock the door
and call the police.

589
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:54,728
That's it.

590
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:57,564
Then what if

591
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:00,067
a fellow female student

592
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:02,778
offers to teach you French?

593
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:04,029
What will you do?

594
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:05,864
I will show her my translating device.

595
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:08,450
Good. You're doing well, Ung.

596
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:11,245
Then what if you went to a coffee shop…

597
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:13,914
Things are going fairly smoothly.

598
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:19,253
Ms. Ji, can you share
the presentation materials with the team?

599
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:20,546
Yes, ma'am.

600
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:23,048
What's going on, you guys?

601
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:27,010
How are you all so great at your jobs?

602
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:30,556
I'm so happy.
I can't hold myself back anymore.

603
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:32,266
-Let's--
-No get-togethers.

604
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:34,726
I didn't say anything.

605
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,395
We had one yesterday.

606
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:38,730
Keep this up,
and I'll ban get-togethers again.

607
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:40,774
"I'll ban get-togethers again." Geez.

608
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:43,360
Then how about tomorrow evening?

609
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:44,611
Tomorrow is Saturday.

610
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,655
Then the coming Monday sounds good, right?

611
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:49,408
We have a meeting. Not you, though.

612
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:50,576
I see.

613
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:52,452
Without me?

614
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:54,705
You've planned a meeting.

615
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:57,165
Did you all know
that I wouldn't be attending it?

616
00:47:57,249 --> 00:48:03,380
We focused on our lives and did our best
and time flew by.

617
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:08,969
So why did you have
to drink so much in a foreign country?

618
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:11,221
Do you know
how dangerous it could have been?

619
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:12,681
-Of course…
-What then?

620
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:14,933
…there were times when we bickered.

621
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:19,104
So he's decided not to call me all day.

622
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,108
I won't pick up even if you call.

623
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:31,491
Hello? Ung?

624
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,702
Hey. Have you been waiting for me?

625
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:36,121
No, I wasn't waiting.

626
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:38,498
Me? For your call? No. Not at all.

627
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:41,627
Sorry. I was quite busy.

628
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:46,590
Hey, I told you communication was the core
of a long-distance relationship.

629
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:50,719
If this continues, I'll be really hurt
and it could cause a misunderstanding.

630
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:53,055
I understand. Are you going home?

631
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:56,016
Yes. What about you? Are you home?

632
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:59,978
What about sleep? Did you sleep yet?
Did you eat? Did you eat on time?

633
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:02,648
Aren't you tired of asking
the same thing every day?

634
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:05,692
Tired? Are you tired of me?

635
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,944
That's not what I meant.

636
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:12,324
Geez, Yeon-su.
You seem to get annoyed so often.

637
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:14,993
You're right. I've become petty.

638
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:18,080
Had I known I'd be like this,

639
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:20,999
I would've hidden
your passport when you flew in last time.

640
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:24,670
You've become cuter too.

641
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:28,799
I miss you, Ung.

642
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:34,721
What? Why aren't you saying anything?

643
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:35,972
Yeon-su.

644
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,018
Now that I think about it,
there was something I forgot to tell you.

645
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:41,728
What was it?

646
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:54,533
What did you say?

647
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:56,451
You heard me.

648
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:01,832
No, I couldn't hear you. Tell me again.

649
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,210
I love you.

650
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:10,799
Do you…

651
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:17,264
Do you even know
how long it took for you to say that?

652
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:22,894
Why didn't you ever tell me this before?

653
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:27,065
I love you, Yeon-su.

654
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:32,654
You're such an idiot.

655
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:37,409
You should say that face-to-face.
You're unbelievable.

656
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:38,994
Fine.

657
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:40,996
Then look behind you.

658
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:40,514
You…

659
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:42,557
Kook Yeon-su.

660
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:47,395
I love you.

661
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:02,285
What are you doing here?

662
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:05,455
I missed you too much,
so I couldn't help it.

663
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:08,375
But this is so sudden.

664
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,253
I had to tell you this right now.

665
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:22,472
Hey, long-distance relationships
are harder than I thought.

666
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:24,975
That's why you should hurry and come back.

667
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,435
Can you not skip a year?

668
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:29,396
I don't know.

669
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:33,400
You should study harder
and try to graduate early.

670
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:35,360
You can't keep doing this.

671
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:37,362
It'll take ages for you to graduate.

672
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:40,198
Yeon-su, do you seriously
want to nag me right now?

673
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:42,868
I'm only saying this for our sake.

674
00:52:57,173 --> 00:52:58,675
There were also times…

675
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:07,017
that were
unbelievably phenomenal like this.

676
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:35,128
That's why we could stay strong
during those years.

677
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:42,218
And just like he promised,

678
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:45,680
it didn't take him too long to come back.

679
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:57,859
2 YEARS LATER

680
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,242
Sol-i.

681
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:07,661
Sol-i.

682
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:11,873
-Hey, you.
-Look at you.

683
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:16,002
-Where are your manners?
-We need to hurry. We're late.

684
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:17,295
Did Ung's parents leave already?

685
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:20,173
Yes, they left already. We need to hurry.

686
00:54:20,256 --> 00:54:21,341
Move aside.

687
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:27,138
Have you been working out?

688
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:30,684
What? That was nothing.
Wrap it up and come out.

689
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,227
-I'll go start the car.
-Okay.

690
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:40,694
That kid is really toying with me.

691
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:43,905
He definitely has a crush on me,

692
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:45,740
so why won't he make his move? Why?

693
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:47,158
Come out already.

694
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:48,201
Darn it.

695
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:50,412
You're quite impudent.

696
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:54,040
I didn't know
Mr. Choi's parents were this admirable.

697
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:57,210
They must've spent a hefty sum
if they've been donating regularly.

698
00:54:57,877 --> 00:55:00,588
You're right.
I didn't know about this either,

699
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:02,757
so I'm in awe.

700
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:06,094
Will Ms. Kook be there too?

701
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:07,637
She will.

702
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:11,808
Will you be okay?
After all, she broke your heart.

703
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:15,520
You never fail to remind me of that.

704
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:18,106
Thank you. I'll never forget it.

705
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:23,737
People say you're becoming more like me,
but you don't need to do this. Okay?

706
00:55:26,322 --> 00:55:27,407
Ji-ung.

707
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:28,742
What is it this time?

708
00:55:29,325 --> 00:55:32,203
I'm only saying this
because you seem to be doing better now.

709
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,207
I like you.

710
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:40,712
I'm only saying this because people say
I'm becoming more like you.

711
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:43,882
But you never told her how you feel.

712
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:47,093
I don't want to be like that.

713
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:53,516
I'm just saying.

714
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:09,866
BOOK DONATION WITH UNG

715
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:11,701
TWOO TWIT
THE RED DOG OF THE DARK

716
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:14,871
WITH UNG

717
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:20,126
Guys, it's ready.

718
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:26,800
Sol-i, what are we having for dinner?

719
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:28,218
Why all of a sudden?

720
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:29,719
I'm asking you out on a date.

721
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:31,763
BOOK DONATION WITH UNG

722
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:33,473
I'm ready.

723
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:37,977
So that's why he's been working out.

724
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:43,483
Okay. It's nice to meet you.

725
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:46,069
I'm a bit embarrassed.
This is nothing grand.

726
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:49,948
As a member of society,

727
00:56:50,031 --> 00:56:52,992
I'm just doing what I should. Just a bit.

728
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:54,828
Goodness, I'm embarrassed.

729
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:57,205
Our son loved to read.

730
00:56:57,288 --> 00:56:59,624
As a boy, he'd always be reading.

731
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:02,335
I think he takes after me.

732
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:06,256
-I hope all kids can read as much as--
-Hey, Ung.

733
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:07,465
Come on.

734
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:10,051
You're late.
I told you to come early and help out.

735
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:12,595
I've been here since this morning,
moving these books.

736
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:13,930
-Really?
-Yes.

737
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:17,684
We always need to do a retake
whenever Ung is here.

738
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:19,769
Hey, did you stay up all night again?

739
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:21,229
How long do you marinate pork?

740
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:22,522
I don't know. Eight hours?

741
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:24,941
I slept for ten hours.
That's longer than marinated pork.

742
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:27,444
-What a good boy!
-Hello.

743
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:28,736
-Hey, Yeon-su.
-Yeon-su.

744
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,697
I told you not to come.

745
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,407
You should rest on the weekend.

746
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:34,826
I'm okay. I should help out.
Where do I put this?

747
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:36,119
Upstairs.

748
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:38,204
-Yeon-su, just make Ung carry that too.
-Go.

749
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:39,330
Hurry.

750
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:45,336
BOOK DONATION WITH UNG

751
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:58,224
Don't you think you're sleeping
too much these days?

752
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:01,060
Once the exhibition begins,
I won't be getting enough sleep.

753
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:02,937
I should sleep while I can.

754
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:05,940
Gosh, when will we put all these books in?

755
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:09,402
Don't put them in wherever.
Arrange them in order.

756
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:10,653
I'll be watching you.

757
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:29,464
Doesn't this remind you of high school?

758
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:31,841
Wasn't that so long ago?

759
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:36,513
No. It still feels like yesterday to me.

760
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:40,141
Frankly, I feel the same.

761
00:58:45,563 --> 00:58:46,731
Tell me the truth.

762
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:48,191
About what?

763
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:51,819
You had a crush on me
ever since we first met, right?

764
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:56,199
There you go, manipulating
your memory again.

765
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:58,117
What?

766
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:00,912
No, I could see it in your eyes.

767
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:03,540
Hey, don't make me laugh.

768
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:06,376
Are you sure you didn't fall in love
with me at first sight?

769
00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:08,670
That's why you followed me around.

770
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:11,297
When did I see you for the first time?

771
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:13,216
Was it the first day of filming?

772
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:15,635
-Hey.
-Or was it before that?

773
00:59:17,011 --> 00:59:19,973
I know you're pretending not to remember.

774
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:40,952
Hey, why haven't you been putting
the books in?

775
00:59:41,035 --> 00:59:42,787
Why would you doodle on that?

776
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:44,122
You're not a kid.

777
00:59:44,205 --> 00:59:45,540
I LOVE EARLY SUMMER
LEE NA-EUN

778
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:47,625
What did you draw?

779
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:57,677
Everyone has

780
00:59:58,678 --> 01:00:01,264
unforgettable memories
from a certain year of their life.

781
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:09,022
They cherish those memories so much

782
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:11,232
that it lasts a lifetime.

783
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:17,280
Yeon-su.

784
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:22,410
And our year…

785
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:39,927
hasn't ended yet.

786
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:45,391
Will you marry me?

787
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:53,399
EPILOGUE

788
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:01,991
Let's shoot a documentary.

789
01:01:04,535 --> 01:01:06,746
What? What did you just say?

790
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:08,706
You have to.

791
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:10,500
Are you crazy? Why would we?

792
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:14,253
Your last documentary is trending again.

793
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:15,963
Why did you have to get married?

794
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:17,924
People want to watch
your married life now.

795
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:20,802
Are we not allowed to have any privacy?

796
01:01:20,885 --> 01:01:23,721
Hey, do you think
we're a pair of pushovers or something?

797
01:01:24,722 --> 01:01:25,890
-Hello.
-Hello.

798
01:01:25,973 --> 01:01:27,308
I'm Choi Ung.

799
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:29,477
I'm Kook Yeon-su.

800
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:34,399
One, two, three.

801
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:36,234
-We're married.
-We're married.

802
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:48,913
OUR BELOVED SUMMER

803
01:02:36,669 --> 01:02:41,674
