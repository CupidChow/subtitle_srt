1
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,299
Every life is a work of art.

2
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:04,522
And it becomes complete
when all the pieces come together.

3
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,788
Why did you get up? Go back to bed.

4
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,380
Mom.

5
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:32,675
You know what? I made a new friend today,

6
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:33,968
and he has the same name.

7
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,762
I'm tired.

8
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,314
I told you to sleep first
since I come home late.

9
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,991
My life couldn't be complete

10
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:01,204
because of a piece I've never had before.

11
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,836
I couldn't see why though.

12
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,547
Listen to your teacher, okay?

13
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,215
Let's go!

14
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:56,634
Hey!

15
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,553
Mom, he's my friend Ji-ung.

16
00:02:58,636 --> 00:02:59,846
-I see.
-Hi.

17
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:02,473
Hi, are you Ji-ung?

18
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,684
I'm Ung's mom.

19
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,061
-A piece everyone has…
-Nice to meet you, ma'am.

20
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,314
You look so bright.

21
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,651
Thank you for being Ung's friend.

22
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,822
-…and isn't that hard to obtain.
-Hold hands with your friend on your way.

23
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:21,034
I didn't know why I was the only one
who didn't have that piece.

24
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:25,371
Here you go.

25
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,581
All right.

26
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:27,999
Let's see.

27
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,210
Here.

28
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,463
Are you eating alone again?

29
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,802
Here you go. Put the bowl outside
when you're done.

30
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:43,389
The memories I have of my childhood…

31
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,060
…are of being alone…

32
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,324
or being with a friend who was alone.

33
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:12,627
And she was also there a few times.

34
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,640
That was it.

35
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,560
And when time passed…

36
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:34,065
and I grew old enough
to remember everything,

37
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,456
I became numb to a lot of things.

38
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,795
But that doesn't mean

39
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:59,340
that I got used to everything.

40
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:02,677
And around that time…

41
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:05,638
You don't have a dad either?

42
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,057
No. You don't either?

43
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:11,644
Then do you live with your mom?

44
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:12,854
Yes.

45
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,273
It must have been tough for you.

46
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:18,943
Why would it be tough for me?
My mom's the one who suffered.

47
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,903
She had a fever last night,

48
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,114
so I told her not to go to work.

49
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:24,824
But she never listens to me.

50
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:27,452
She makes a huge fuss whenever
I get sick, though.

51
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,038
You two must be close.

52
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,707
How can we not be?
All we have is each other.

53
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:37,337
Anyway, I told our homeroom teacher
that I'm going home early,

54
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,005
so tell the other teachers for me.

55
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,175
We have exams tomorrow though.

56
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:45,887
My mom will yell if she hears
I came home because she was sick,

57
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,722
but she'll secretly be pleased.

58
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:49,557
She can't live without me.

59
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,310
-I'll get going, then.
-Okay.

60
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,605
So I got curious.

61
00:05:57,815 --> 00:06:00,151
I wanted to know the reason why I couldn't

62
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,653
have that piece.

63
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,775
Mom, can you…

64
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,784
Can you live without me?

65
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,592
Why are we living like this?

66
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:11,055
Why do we have to pretend like we hate--

67
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,849
Without you…

68
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,061
I wouldn't be living like this.

69
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,529
Without you…

70
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:30,575
I wouldn't be living…

71
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,745
such a pathetic life.

72
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,918
That's when I realized…

73
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:46,841
that I was a useless piece in her life.

74
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,969
The thing I wanted so desperately

75
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,681
was hell for her.

76
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:03,900
So I decided that
I would never have that piece.

77
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,737
My life wasn't a work of art.

78
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:11,073
It was just an episode

79
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:15,661
of a boring documentary series
that no one watches.

80
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:19,123
EPISODE 15
THREE IDIOTS

81
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,964
Yes, I went to the gallery
to check something.

82
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,466
I'm heading back now.

83
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,385
Go inside and get some rest.

84
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,179
I'll be home soon. It's cold outside.

85
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,180
All right.

86
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,363
Let's not give each other presents.

87
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,823
The culture of giving gifts
on anniversaries

88
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,325
just makes people spend money.

89
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:55,701
It's what's on the inside that counts.

90
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,246
I think spending money
on gifts is meaningless.

91
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,332
But back then,

92
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:05,419
I only said that because
I didn't want to take up your time.

93
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,798
So you actually wanted me
to come pick you up.

94
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:09,799
Yes.

95
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,560
May I help you?

96
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:21,602
Oh, yes.

97
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:24,021
Are you buying a gift for your girlfriend?

98
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:25,898
Yes.

99
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:29,443
What kind of style does she like?

100
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,863
Well, she's really pretty.

101
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,074
I see…

102
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:39,328
I mean, what style of clothes
or accessories does she wear?

103
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,372
Right…

104
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,584
Neat and tidy?

105
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,752
I see. Neat and tidy.

106
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:34,884
What are you doing?

107
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,304
Putting a bell on a cat.

108
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,531
The store was having a huge sale.

109
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:58,991
They said I should get one.

110
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:02,995
But I thought it would look better
on you than me.

111
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,456
It's pretty.

112
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,124
What?

113
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,460
Thanks.

114
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,423
I paid full price for it
and it took me an hour to pick.

115
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,260
I got you earrings too.

116
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:19,804
Try these on.

117
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,488
-Do you like them?
-Yes.

118
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,493
Should we

119
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:45,496
hang out at home all day
instead of going out?

120
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,206
Yes.

121
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,168
You know that's what I'm best at.

122
00:11:56,257 --> 00:12:00,010
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM

123
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,723
You're done reading already?

124
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:20,072
Why did you make so much?

125
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,616
Right. I made more than I thought.

126
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,827
How will we finish this?

127
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,454
We can.

128
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:27,913
It looks good, right?

129
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,416
It looks tasty.

130
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,418
I'm so full.

131
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,378
Me too. I'm so full.

132
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,463
Look.

133
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:36,672
Look at my stomach.

134
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,384
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

135
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,052
Let's decide who does the dishes.

136
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,179
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-Rock, paper, scissors.

137
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,769
I'm not done yet.

138
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,320
Are you done?

139
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:02,490
All right.

140
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,328
One, two, three.

141
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,416
Why are you laughing?

142
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:17,129
Jjongjjong looks so ugly!

143
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:20,966
No, he looks adorable!

144
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:25,012
Hey!

145
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,642
Hey!

146
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:30,851
I'm not doing this.

147
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,645
Hey, these are expensive!

148
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:35,773
Darn it.

149
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,322
Let's not watch a documentary.

150
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,783
Why? I wanted to watch this.

151
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,076
Aren't you sick of them?

152
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,999
-What do you want to watch?
-Let's see what's on.

153
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:56,961
That one!

157
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:26,740
I should get a scarf.

-What?

161
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:38,627
Nothing.

162
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:44,758
Come to think of it,
you took a shower here last time too.

163
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:46,927
This is still a guy's house.

164
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,679
So? It's your house.

165
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:50,306
We weren't even dating back then.

166
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,183
That's an enthusiastic greeting.

167
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:57,271
Oh, when we said we'd be friends?

168
00:14:57,354 --> 00:15:00,941
You're not doing that
at all of your friends' homes, are you?

169
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,694
Why aren't you answering?

170
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,280
I did that to seduce you.

171
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,702
You're such a cunning desert fox.

172
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:14,705
Hey, you're just supposed to say "fox."

173
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,332
That sounds worse for some reason.

174
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,500
You've changed, Yeon-su.

175
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:22,129
-Dry my hair for me.
-What?

176
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:23,881
Dry my hair.

177
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:27,635
Hey, can't you even dry your own hair?
How could you…

178
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,929
My goodness.

179
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:41,398
All dried, ma'am.

180
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:44,485
Thank you. My right ear is hot, though.

181
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:46,570
But your hair is perfectly dry.

182
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:49,990
You're not going to keep asking me
to do this for you, are you?

183
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,994
Keep doing it for me.

184
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:57,665
My gosh. How are you going
to live without me?

185
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,750
Jeez.

186
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:04,004
You're acting strange again.

187
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,882
What are you trying to do now?

188
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,761
It's so peaceful.

189
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,431
See? It's nice to not be fighting.

190
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:20,020
What goes through your mind
when things are like this?

191
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,814
Well…

192
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,984
Not much.

193
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,736
Just "This is nice." Stuff like that.

194
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,365
Whenever I feel this happy,

195
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,076
I get anxious.

196
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,537
Why?

197
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:40,457
I get worried
that I'll ruin everything again.

198
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:47,881
That won't happen. Don't worry.

199
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,594
Yeon-su.

200
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,101
No. I'll tell you next time.

201
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,115
ENROLLMENT GUIDE
SCHOOL OF ARCHITECTURE

202
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:22,082
Why did you order so much stuff?

203
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,502
But why are they all women's…
Are these all for Yeon-su?

204
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,421
I don't think I ordered that many.

205
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:30,132
You're trying so hard
to look like a sweet boyfriend.

206
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:33,886
Do you really think she'll be happy
when she receives all this?

207
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,596
She likes gifts more than I thought.

208
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,348
Too many gifts will be overwhelming.

209
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,350
You're so clueless, Ung.

210
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,227
There's one for you.

211
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,854
Where? What is it?

212
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,234
I see.

213
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,111
This?

214
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,281
It's a bit smaller than the others,

215
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,116
but thanks.

216
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:02,956
Right, Ung. We got the brochure. Ta-da!

217
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,419
It looks good, doesn't it?
It's finally tonight. Are you ready, Ung?

218
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,256
We'll be making history
with a night exhibition.

219
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,425
Is Yeon-su coming today?

220
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,595
-She's coming on the last day.
-Why?

221
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,430
There will be journalists,

222
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,974
and a lot of people will recognize us
because of the documentary.

223
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,977
I'm okay with it, but she said
she doesn't want to steal the spotlight.

224
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,230
Yeon-su is so mature.

225
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:28,107
She's so thoughtful.

226
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,401
What could this be?

227
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,114
Why won't it open?

228
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,494
-Eun-ho.
-Yes?

229
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,914
I need to tell you something
when the exhibit's over.

230
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,541
What is it? Just tell me now.

231
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,293
I'll tell you after the exhibit ends.

232
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:51,839
All right.
But why can't I get the tape off?

233
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,967
Do you have long nails?
Can you open this for me?

234
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,053
What is it though?

235
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,890
I don't remember.
There was a special sale or something.

236
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:06,687
Six, five, four, three, two…

237
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,273
Sol-i!

238
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:11,859
What do I do with you?

239
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,569
What are you doing after work?

240
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,739
Why? Why do you want to know…

241
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:21,201
what I'm doing?

242
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,620
What? Well, it's Ung's exhibit.

243
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,080
Come if you're not busy.

244
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,791
It'll be late at night,
so you can come after work.

245
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:28,876
Will you be there?

246
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,335
Of course. I'm his manager.

247
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,881
Right. Of course.

248
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:38,093
You're being so obvious, Eun-ho.

249
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,720
What?

250
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:42,014
Are you coming or not?
Do you want a ticket?

251
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:45,142
Sure. Leave it here.

252
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,605
Why are you acting so strange?

253
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:51,899
Are you sick?

254
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,444
No, why?

255
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,071
Why are your eyes like this?

256
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,618
Anyway, I should get going.

257
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:06,079
And tell me in advance if you're coming.
It'll run for three days.

258
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:07,915
Bye.

259
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,251
Bye.

260
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:12,920
See you.

261
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:22,888
Having a crush is terribly painful.

262
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,973
I know it so well.

263
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,269
You poor boy.

264
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,941
GO-OH'S EXHIBITION,
WHILE THE CITY SLEEPS, OPENS

265
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,150
IT WILL BE A NIGHT-TIME EXHIBIT

266
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,073
-I'm not going.
-What?

267
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:43,867
Where? Are you trying
to bail on another schedule?

268
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,744
No, it's not that.

269
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,120
Jeez, you startled me.

270
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:50,040
I'm always so anxious these days
because of you.

271
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:52,584
Right, you have the shoot
for the documentary this weekend.

272
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,586
It's taking longer than I thought.

273
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,296
It's the last episode.

274
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,923
I'll give you the script later.

275
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,303
-Chi-seong.
-Yes?

276
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:07,849
-I'm sorry.
-What? Why?

277
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,936
Sorry about what?
What are you thinking of doing?

278
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:14,106
No, it's not for what I'm going to do.

279
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:17,317
I'm sorry for what I did.
I acted impulsively.

280
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,237
Couldn't you say that first?

281
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,489
You startled me
by apologizing out of the blue.

282
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:24,449
I won't startle you anymore.

283
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:29,663
What's gotten into you?
This is making me more nervous.

284
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:34,251
I'm going to do my best
to live a normal life now.

285
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:37,838
Right.

286
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:40,924
I take back my promise not to startle you.

287
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:44,803
-I'll give you a couple more shocks.
-Can't you just tell me in advance?

288
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:46,555
So I can take some calming pills.

289
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,740
Hey.

290
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:07,159
What are you doing?

291
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:08,994
Is Mr. Kim inside?

292
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:13,749
Hasn't he said
anything about thanking me yet?

293
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,209
He must be grateful
after seeing the ratings.

294
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:19,504
I don't think he's in a situation
to do that right now.

295
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:22,049
Why? I'm sure he's not busy.

296
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:24,676
I heard he finished editing everything.

297
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:30,098
What's with him? Did someone die?

298
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:34,311
I don't know. He's not even
going home these days.

299
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:37,439
He acted like that before,
but it seems pretty serious this time.

300
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:43,320
He's becoming more and more like Dong-il.

301
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,280
Mr. Park?

302
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:48,033
Yes. He's acting exactly like him
when he's out of it.

303
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,869
Mr. Park isn't like that though.

304
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:56,291
Don't even get me started.
He's worse than him at times.

305
00:22:56,374 --> 00:23:01,004
He stays cooped up in the editing room
whenever something happens.

306
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,633
Let's go. Leave him be.

307
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,093
Why don't we get some coffee?

308
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,261
We should give him some alone time.

309
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:10,180
Come on.

310
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,142
Come on, let's go.

311
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,310
Okay.

312
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,070
They say

313
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:26,655
I'm going to die.

314
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:29,366
I'm going to die soon.

315
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:31,660
So…

316
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:35,038
please film me before I do.

317
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:36,706
Please do that.

318
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:53,306
-Thanks, Chae-ran.
-That's for Ji-ung.

319
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:56,143
Why would you give coffee
to someone who uses all our electricity?

320
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:59,771
Don't you feel sorry for him?
He's been in there for days.

321
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,315
I feel sorry for myself
for having him on my team.

322
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:03,608
See you. Thanks for this.

323
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:14,953
Mr. Park is definitely
not the kind of person you said.

324
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:19,749
Even if he doesn't act like it,
he cares about Mr. Kim dearly.

325
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:22,085
He cares about him a lot.

326
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,004
I've never seen him do that though.

327
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:28,091
Do you know why Mr. Kim never quit
when he was an assistant producer?

328
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:32,554

00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:36,141
FIGHT AGAINST FORCED DEMOLITION

330
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:37,517
WE'RE JOINING THE FIGHT

331
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:38,602
PROTECT OUR MARKET

332
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:39,936
THE FISH MARKET IS OUR HOME

333
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,399
Why did you bring such a useless kid here?

334
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:45,400
ASSISTANT PRODUCER KIM JI-UNG

335
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:50,280
Do I have to keep working
with this stupid kid?

336
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:53,283
-Mr. Park! Where are you?
-Yes?

337
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,161
What is it?

338
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,166
Don't take your anger out on him.
Come on, let's work together.

339
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:02,918
We've been waiting for hours.

340
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,587
He's the assistant producer,
but he's not doing anything.

341
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,922
Are we going to shoot all night?

342
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,882
Don't you see we're all working hard?

343
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:13,011
I told you I have to end early today!
It's my wedding anniversary!

344
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:17,015
I've never been able to go home
on my anniversaries.

345
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:20,185
My wife might divorce me.
What are you going to do about that?

346
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:22,479
I'll beg her to forgive you.

347
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:23,813
Let's take a break.

348
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:26,524
We should all eat something.

349
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,777
Go and buy some ramyeon.

350
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:32,322
If we had a smart assistant,
we would have ended early.

351
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:33,782
What's the matter with you?

352
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,075
We wasted the whole day!

353
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:39,120
-Let's go for a smoke. Come on.
-Jeez.

354
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:40,956
It's all my fault.

355
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,678
Jeez.

356
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:57,514
Is this a late-night snack or breakfast?

357
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:00,600
-Is it done?
-Yes, you can eat now.

358
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:01,893
Here you go.

359
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:05,188
-What's this?
-They gave me some.

360
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,690
It's clean, so it's okay.

361
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:10,068
You should have gotten some crab
or squid instead.

362
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:12,362
This is going to ruin the taste.

363
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:15,907
You should eat seaweed on your birthday.

364
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:17,867
Here you go.

365
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,327
Is it your birthday?

366
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,788
Hey, what's all this?

367
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:25,166
What lunatic would put seaweed in ramyeon?

368
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,710
-Just eat it.
-I'll pour it.

369
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:28,878
It's fine. Give me your bowl.

370
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:34,384
Eat up before it gets soggy.

371
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,344
-Here.
-Eat up.

372
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,345
Give me some too.

373
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:38,596
Hey, happy birthday.

374
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,181
Eat up.

375
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,059
Thank you.

376
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:44,811
Here.

377
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:46,104
Thank you.

378
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:56,197
They talk about the new market

379
00:26:57,032 --> 00:27:01,244
and how there are protests
on the news, but look.

380
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:04,998
People are still
just living their daily lives.

381
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:09,502
Our job is to record things like this.

382
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:12,505
Things that people miss
because it seems so ordinary.

383
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:15,216
People who live their ordinary lives

384
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,845
and our daily lives as well.

385
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:22,974
If we put them together,
they become stories about life.

386
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,686
Don't be fooled.

387
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,897
Run away while you're still young.

388
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:34,194
Don't mess this up.
I have to convince him to stay!

389
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:40,033
You're coming to work tomorrow, right?

390
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,788
Eat up.

391
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:56,466
What is it?

392
00:27:56,966 --> 00:28:00,136
-Putting seaweed in ramyeon…
-What about it?

393
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:04,099
Ji-ung did that for me
when I was an assistant too.

394
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,100
What?

395
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:10,730
Did you fall for that too?

396
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:13,858
Mr. Kim, that sly fox.
He used that to keep you here.

397
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:19,280
I knew it. The documentary team
is much more fun than the drama team.

398
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:22,784
WHILE THE CITY SLEEPS
GO-OH SOLO EXHIBIT

399
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,247
EXHIBITION HOURS

400
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,512
You may go in.

401
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:43,555
Welcome.

402
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:44,764
Enjoy the exhibit.

403
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:46,933
Thank you for coming.

404
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:48,101
Welcome.

405
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:49,769
Enjoy the exhibit.

406
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,521
Enjoy the exhibit.

407
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,944
LEADERSHIP TRAINING CO-OP SEMINAR

408
00:28:58,027 --> 00:28:58,903
GO-OH'S SOLO EXHIBITION A SUCCESS

409
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,488
You're very impressive, Ung.

410
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:02,490
UNG

411
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,077
Hey.

412
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,328
Did you get off work?

413
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,372
Yes, I'm heading home now.

414
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:12,083
I saw the article.
You look really nice today.

415
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:16,671
There are more people than I expected.
I'm a bit nervous.

416
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,507
You did well at the drawing show
despite the crowd.

417
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,926
You seemed to enjoy the attention.

418
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:25,472
Gosh, I just want to finish this quickly
and stay home with you.

419
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,348
Ung!

420
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:31,394
I should get going.
You're coming on the last day, right?

421
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:34,022
Yes. I'll give you
the most enthusiastic congratulations.

422
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:35,940
I miss you, Yeon-su.

423
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:37,942
Bye.

424
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:45,617
Do you have regular working hours?
How many hours do you work a day?

425
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,203
It differs depending
on the building's size and shape,

426
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,872
but I work
around 12 hours a day on average.

427
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:53,875
It's something
I can draw with a lot of detail.

428
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,336
The height I prefer the most is 35 feet.

429
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:16,981
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

430
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,240
-Hello.
-Hello.

431
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:28,535
I'm a little nervous.

432
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,203
Hello.

433
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:17,166
Please check the routes
the customers take.

434
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,127
-All right.
-If you come this way,

435
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,713
I'll show you
where they'll hold the book talk.

436
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:26,050
We'll do the book talk here.

437
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,760
Send me the seating arrangements.

438
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:30,763
And the author prefers communicating
with people close up,

439
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:33,182
-so I think a circle would be good.
-All right.

440
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:37,729
And I updated the location
for the drama shoot, so share that.

441
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:38,646
-Okay.
-Okay.

442
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,398
Let's do the seats in a circle.

443
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:44,611
You all know it's the last day
of Go-oh's exhibit, right?

444
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:47,906
-Did you all get tickets?
-I went last night with my girlfriend.

445
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,658
-It was so nice.
-Really?

446
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:51,784
Lucky you.

447
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:55,496
I would have gone
if I had a girlfriend too.

448
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,374
Is Ye-in busy? She probably
doesn't have anyone to go with.

449
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,626
I should go with her.

450
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,261
I thought you were a ghost!

451
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:28,613
Why are you looking at me like that?

452
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:33,326
Well, it seems like
you've changed a lot recently.

453
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:35,453
You seem a bit warmer,

454
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:37,580
not that you were cold or anything.

455
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,916
You even joined us
for the gathering last time.

456
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:42,460
You seem to be in a good mood these days.

457
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:44,212
-Right? She looks really happy.
-Yes.

458
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,297
-So…
-You're dating someone, right?

459
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,007
Who is it?

460
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,636
What are you trying to say?

461
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:56,933
We're just curious what kind of person
changed you like this.

462
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,810
And whether it's someone we know.

463
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:01,646
We were wondering if it's Mr. Jang.

464
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:07,485
We just wanted to know
how cool of a guy he is.

465
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:11,406
Well, this is about my private life.

466
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,282
Let's only talk about work.

467
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:14,450
-Right.
-Yes, of course.

468
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:17,745
I'll meet the staff and finish up here.

469
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:19,497
-Okay.
-Yes.

470
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,960
-And Myeong-ho.
-Yes?

471
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:26,421
-Come with Ye-in later.
-Where?

472
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,256
To my boyfriend's exhibit.

473
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:31,217
You'll regret it if you don't come
since it's the last day.

474
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:35,888
Boyfriend?

475
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:38,599
Go-oh?

476
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,943
Ji-ung. You've got to stop.

477
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,489
Should I stop eating?

478
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,743
That's not what I'm talking about.

479
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:57,869
Stop what, then?

480
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,538
Moping around like that.

481
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:04,959
Sit down.

482
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,757
And "moping"?

483
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,676
Is that a way to talk to your superior?

484
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:17,180
I was just going to leave you be,

485
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:18,848
but you're going too far.

486
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:23,019
I know you're having a hard time
because you're heartbroken,

487
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:26,230
but it's not something to brood over
for this long. You're a grown-up.

488
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:29,400
Right, I was rejected too.

489
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,402
Thanks for rubbing it in.

490
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:33,696
That really hurts.

491
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:39,035
Weren't you acting like this
because of Ms. Kook?

492
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,538
You shouldn't mention names like that.

493
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,584
Then why aren't you going home?

494
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,128
Because I don't want to go home.

495
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:50,880
Why?

496
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:52,715
Just because.

497
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,093
Did something happen?

498
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,553
Are you interrogating me?

499
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,347
You're Mr. Park's spy, aren't you?

500
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,516
You're making me worried.

501
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:05,228
I get that you tend to
push yourself when you work,

502
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:08,397
but you're doing work
that you don't even have to do.

503
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:12,235
You're the one who told me
not to make a habit of working overnight.

504
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:13,861
So why aren't you going home?

505
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:20,952
Thanks for worrying about me.

506
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,834
But don't get so upset.

507
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:31,420
People are saying
you're starting to act like me.

508
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:37,552
Then you should take care of yourself
so I won't worry.

509
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,303
All right, fine.

510
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:42,473
I can't even work late anymore
because of your nagging.

511
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,559
It's not that--

512
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,894
Just eat. It'll get cold.

513
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:09,625
Yes?

514
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:12,086
Yes. What is it?

515
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:42,283
The way you look at me
makes me pretty sad.

516
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:46,746
No, I was just startled.
I didn't expect you to come.

517
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:48,915
Thanks for coming.

518
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:52,043
Don't be ridiculous.
I got a formal invitation.

519
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,127
You asked me to come.

520
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:59,634
What? You didn't send this?

521
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:03,304
My gosh.
I didn't think I'd become so pathetic.

522
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:05,306
No, I did send it.

523
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:06,807
Right?

524
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:10,061
I was living a busy life
and I totally forgot about you.

525
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:11,729
But I came because you asked.

526
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,357
Were you

527
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:17,193
waiting for someone?

528
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,321
Oh, I guess she's a bit late.

529
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,198
Ms. Kook Yeon-su?

530
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:27,453
She's still not here?
Your girlfriend's totally neglecting you.

531
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:30,081
If you had dated me, this wouldn't happen…

532
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:34,460
Hey, that was a joke. You should smile.

533
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:40,591
These flowers are so pretty. Thank you.

534
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,010
I'm always the one giving you flowers.

535
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,721
I was used to accepting them all the time.

536
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,686
Your drawings are still really nice.

537
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,521
Were there a lot of people?

538
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,941
There were a lot before you came,

539
00:37:57,483 --> 00:38:01,070
but there aren't any now.
Maybe it's too late at night.

540
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:03,781
Oh, I bought the tickets for this hour.

541
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,033
What?

542
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:07,785
I bought all the tickets.

543
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:09,620
What?

544
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:13,124
They say there are two ways
to make friends.

545
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:16,127
Spend a lot of time with them,
or make an impression.

546
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:20,089
But for me, making an impression
is faster than spending time with them.

547
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:22,883
You were touched, right?

548
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,761
I know. Well, then…

549
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:29,557
Let's be friends. For real this time.

550
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:34,103
You're more unusual than I thought.

551
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,397
Someone told me that

552
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,233
if I want to live a normal life,
I can just pretend to.

553
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:42,194
So I'm going to make friends
like a normal person.

554
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,990
This isn't normal at all though.

555
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:46,991
Anyway…

556
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,952
are you going to leave me hanging?

557
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,370
Oh, sorry.

558
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,711
Do you…

559
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:02,048
give discounts to your friends?

560
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,133
Of course.

561
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:10,556
Our editing room ghost is finally leaving!
Round of applause!

562
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:11,974
Come on, clap.

563
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,478
Go home. I hope I never see you again.

564
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:17,688
I get treated so badly
even if I work so hard.

565
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:21,567
You don't have to work so hard,
so sleep at home, all right?

566
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,652
Your water and electricity
will get cut soon.

567
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,488
Don't exaggerate.

568
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:26,614
Ji-ung.

569
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:30,159
How about we go out for some drinks?

570
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:32,995
-No.
-I knew it. Get lost.

571
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:35,498
I'm sick of staying here with you.
I'll drink with…

572
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:37,541
Hey, where did he go?

573
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:38,584
Mr. Park.

574
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:39,835
You should go home too.

575
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:41,670
It's scary. Nobody's home.

576
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:44,298
-Bye.
-Ji-ung.

577
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:51,555
Is something up?

578
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,058
No.

579
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:16,497
Is Yeon-su still not here?
We have to close soon.

580
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,041
-No.
-Should I start wrapping up?

581
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:20,960
Okay.

582
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:41,063
You're so strange. How could you think
of doing an exhibit at this hour?

583
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:47,611
I enjoyed your exhibit.

584
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,363
They're still good,

585
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:51,824
but there's still no advancement.

586
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:55,161
Did you come here to say that?

587
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:56,579
Jeez.

588
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:58,622
Stop following me around.

589
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:02,251
Did you sell some drawings?

590
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:04,837
I have no time for you. Just go.

591
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:07,590
You can read it on the news
that you love so much.

592
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,093
You're so annoying.

593
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:19,560
You never said anything
about the plagiarism though.

594
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:22,146
Yes. I'm not interested.

595
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,317
I'll leave then.

596
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:29,904
What makes you think you're all that?

597
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:36,911
Do you feel like your life is
all elegant and special

598
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:38,746
if you ignore everything?

599
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:40,956
What?

600
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:45,586
I stole your drawing.

601
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:54,470
Hey, Tae-seon.

602
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:58,140
Did you decide what to hand in?
Are you finished?

603
00:41:58,807 --> 00:41:59,767
Yes, I did.

604
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:04,396
Hey, this is awesome.

605
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:11,111
But this seems
a bit similar to Ung's drawings.

606
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:17,117
Really?

607
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,289
Hey, Ung. Do you think so too?

608
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,544
Let me see yours. Wouldn't it be
bad if they're too similar?

609
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:31,131
I can draw a new one.

610
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:34,093
A new one? The deadline's tomorrow!

611
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,303
If I'm late, too bad.

612
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:48,399
What makes you think you're so special
even back then and now?

613
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,318
That's funny.

614
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,946
Is that really something
you should be asking me?

615
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:55,698
That face again.

616
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,741
That mocking look.

617
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,494
Why? Do you need more attention?

618
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,913
You pretend
not to be interested in anything.

619
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,208
Well…

620
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:10,713
things must have seemed easy
for you since you had everything.

621
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:14,300
But still, you shouldn't have been
so obvious about it.

622
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:18,804
That makes the people around you
trying their best lose their spirit.

623
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:22,099
It's really annoying.

624
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:26,604
So the best you could do
was copy my drawings?

625
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,651
I was curious

626
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:35,362
how you'd react
after getting something of yours stolen.

627
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:38,240
But…

628
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:42,119
seeing that you
still had that look on your face…

629
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:45,456
made me pity you.

630
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:53,714
What?

631
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:57,051
It seemed like
your life was so meaningless

632
00:43:57,676 --> 00:43:59,261
that you could abandon anything.

633
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:04,642
What would be left of your life
if you lived like that?

634
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:12,358
I really can't stand to hear this.

635
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:17,112
You don't have the right
to talk to him like that, you thief.

636
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:22,368
I knew it. You admitted it yourself
that you plagiarized him.

637
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:26,121
I'm going to tell all the reporters
about this. You just wait and see.

638
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:30,417
Your drawings are actually pretty boring.

639
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:34,755
They're all empty.

640
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:17,089
Why are you still here?

641
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:20,843
You should go see Ung.

642
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:26,515
Didn't you hear the doctor?

643
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:29,059
I'm fine.

644
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:31,478
Go on.

645
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:33,856
I'm going to get some more sleep.

646
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:38,068
My goodness.

647
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:42,406
You get hospitalized
once in a while at this age.

648
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:44,575
It's no big deal, so go on.

649
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:47,953
You're doing this on purpose.

650
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:51,498
Yeon-su.

651
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,251
You're going to leave me.

652
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,128
You're…

653
00:45:58,714 --> 00:45:59,965
getting ready to leave me.

654
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:05,679
Listen to me carefully, Yeon-su.

655
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:09,183
You know how tough I am.

656
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,977
I'm going to live a long life.

657
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:15,189
Even if the grim reaper comes for me,

658
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:18,066
I'm going to hold on and stay here.

659
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:21,945
I'm just…

660
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:27,284
scared…

661
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:30,871
that maybe, just maybe…

662
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:35,626
I might end up leaving you all alone.

663
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:38,837
Don't say that, Grandma.

664
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,507
I can't live without you.

665
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:43,342
You need to.

666
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:46,094
You have to live even without me.

667
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:50,307
You have to eat well
and do everything you want to do.

668
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,351
You must.

669
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:57,147
But do you know what I think

670
00:46:58,023 --> 00:47:00,359
when I look at you?

671
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:10,786
That I'm being punished

672
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:13,789
by having you live like me.

673
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:25,259
All I need is you, Grandma.

674
00:47:26,843 --> 00:47:29,054
And all you need is me.

675
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:32,849
-We've lived happily together--
-All I need is you.

676
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:37,646
Because all I have left is to grow older.

677
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:40,941
You're the only one I need.

678
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:43,318
But you…

679
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:47,906
Don't live like me.

680
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:53,412
Keep people close to you,

681
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:57,791
do things that you want to do,

682
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:01,795
and enjoy your life.

683
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:07,342
Don't live just for me, Yeon-su.

684
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:18,520
That way

685
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:22,649
I won't be ashamed to face
your parents when I leave.

686
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:48,842
Oh, hey! Gu Eun-ho!

687
00:48:48,925 --> 00:48:50,469
Hey, Sol-i.

688
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:51,553
Where are you going?

689
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:54,348
Is the exhibit over?

690
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:56,224
Yes. Did you close the bar?

691
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,101
Yes.

692
00:48:58,185 --> 00:48:59,353
Right.

693
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:01,229
What's with that face?

694
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:04,358
Shouldn't you be throwing a party
to celebrate the end of the exhibit?

695
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:07,319
-I'm not in the mood.
-Why?

696
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:11,073
But where's Ung? Why are you alone?

697
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:34,429
The person you have called…

698
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:47,275
Where are you?

699
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:18,682
I respect you for trying to drink
when you can't handle your alcohol.

700
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:26,022
How economical.

701
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:28,734
Are you drunk after drinking this little?

702
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:31,027
I'm fine.

703
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:35,323
You've picked up bad drinking habits.

704
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:48,170
Should I match your level of drunkenness?

705
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:50,922
I'll catch up if I drink all this.

706
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,551
-Don't act so tough.
-What? You don't believe me?

707
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:57,137
-I'll show you.
-No, don't.

708
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,514
I didn't call you so you'd get drunk.
This is mine.

709
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:03,143
Don't be so cheap.

710
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:18,992
Hey.

711
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:23,789
It's been quite a while
since we drank together like this.

712
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:27,542
Right.

713
00:51:31,129 --> 00:51:33,590
My exhibit was until today.
Why didn't you come?

714
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,053
I was busy.

715
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,431
That's a simple answer.

716
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:44,893
I'm actually pretty upset with you.

717
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:51,149
What about now?

718
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:53,443
Are you free?

719
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,739
I finished a week's worth of work
in advance.

720
00:51:58,323 --> 00:52:03,161
The people around you will hate you
if you work so much like that.

721
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:11,002
Hey.

722
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:17,425
My mom's going to die.

723
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:38,446
But…

724
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:43,410
I don't feel sad at all.

725
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,513
How pitiful.

726
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:06,725
Who?

727
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:12,439
Just… Everyone.

728
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:19,487
Us…

729
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:22,657
and everyone.

730
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:55,542
Excuse me.

731
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:57,669
Do you need any help?

732
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:01,881
Who are you here to see?

733
00:55:15,311 --> 00:55:16,312
Yeon-su!

734
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,616
What are you doing out here in the cold?

735
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:32,662
I…

736
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,290
I thought…

737
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:39,044
I ruined everything again.

738
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:42,130
What are you talking about?

739
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:43,965
How long have you been here?

740
00:55:44,966 --> 00:55:46,259
I thought

741
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:49,387
I ruined everything again.

742
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:53,475
I'm sorry, Ung.

743
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:56,519
I'm sorry.

744
00:55:57,812 --> 00:55:58,980
I'm sorry.

745
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:06,696
I told you that won't ever happen.

746
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,826
You're not going to ruin anything.

747
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:20,335
Ung.

748
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:22,003
Yes.

749
00:56:25,381 --> 00:56:26,966
I'm in so much pain.

750
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:40,230
I…

751
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:43,650
I'm in so much pain right now.

752
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:49,948
Okay.

753
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:07,465
Why are you looking so down?

754
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:10,969
Didn't the exhibit end well?

755
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:12,679
It was a disaster.

756
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:13,805
What?

757
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:17,433
A famous critic criticized him harshly.

758
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:19,144
Why?

759
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:21,062
The drawings seemed cool.

760
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:24,232
What did they say?

761
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:31,156
Ung is going to need
a lot of comforting today.

762
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:38,079
HOW LONG WILL GO-OH
STAY TRAPPED IN HIS OWN WORLD?

763
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:40,874
GO-OH HAS HELD
AN INNOVATIVE NIGHT-TIME EXHIBITION

764
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:42,834
GO-OH DRAWS DETAILED
ILLUSTRATIONS OF BUILDINGS…

765
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:47,046
BUT THERE IS IMMATURITY
HIDDEN BEHIND HIS TECHNICAL PROWESS

766
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,678
"His drawings that show his emotions

767
00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:56,139
are just like doodles

768
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,517
of a child trapped in his own world."

769
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:17,702
Let's go inside.

770
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:33,134
THREE IDIOTS

771
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:58,451
EPILOGUE

772
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:06,668
I want to go with you.

773
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:18,930
