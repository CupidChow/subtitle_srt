SEPTEMBER 08, 2011
50 DAYS OF DATING

2
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:50,258
Yeon-su asks strange questions
from time to time.

3
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:51,718
What if…

4
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:55,889
-What?
-I get into college, but you don't?

5
00:00:58,057 --> 00:01:00,518
-I will.
-At this rate, I doubt it.

6
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:02,937
Do you want me to fail?

7
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:05,565
No, it's just a what-if question.

8
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:08,359
What if I get in
but you have to resit the exam?

9
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:09,944
What will happen to us?

10
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,404
Well…

11
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,115
First, that won't be the case.

12
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,118
But if that happens,

13
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,871
I'll study somewhere near your school.

14
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:23,166
And I'll pack lunch
and study by your side.

15
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:29,047
Do you like me that much?

16
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,637
Hey. Why aren't you answering me?

17
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:37,764
Hey.

18
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:40,642
Just focus on sweeping, will you?

19
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:43,853
-You're slacking off.
-I said do you like me that much?

20
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:48,316
-What's the matter with you?
-Hey.

21
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,943
340 DAYS OF DATING

22
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:52,612
-What?
-What if…

23
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:54,155
She'd ask out of nowhere.

24
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,365
What is it this time?

25
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,325
What if you secretly go on a blind date?

26
00:01:57,408 --> 00:02:00,578
Don't be ridiculous. Why would I do that?

27
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,288
Then what if I do?

28
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,498
You're going on a blind date?

29
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:06,292
No.

30
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:10,797
-It's just a what-if question.
-Ji-ung will spy on you.

31
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,091
Ji-ung? As if.

32
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,344
I'll stay by your side
at all times to make sure you don't.

33
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,724
What? I'm serious.

34
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,811
I know you finish class at 5 p.m. today.
I'll see you soon.

35
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,312
But we met yesterday.

36
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:30,775
-Ung, you must really like me.
-Class is starting.

37
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,527
-Bye.
-Hey.

38
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:37,907
750 DAYS OF DATING

39
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:43,705
What if I never get better?

40
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,500
What? Don't exaggerate.
Your fever went down a lot.

41
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,753
No, it's just a what-if question.

42
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:54,841
What if I never get better and--

43
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:57,552
What? Don't be ridiculous.

44
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:04,434
I think Yeon-su enjoys watching me suffer.

45
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:07,437
You're all better.
Get up and have some porridge.

46
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:20,408
There was a specific answer
that I wanted to hear from him.

47
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,578
1,565 DAYS OF DATING

48
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,455
Ung was strange.

49
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:27,373
-Hey.
-What?

50
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,000
Are you done? Do you want to switch?

51
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,711
What if…

52
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,297
-Again?
-Yes. What if…

53
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,508
I don't care. Enough with your what-ifs.

54
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:40,470
What if I go abroad
as an exchange student?

55
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:41,846
Did you sign up for that?

56
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,973
No, it's just a what-if question.

57
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,099
That would be horrible.

58
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:48,144
All my friends broke up
after going abroad.

59
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,231
I could feel that he liked me a lot.

60
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:54,234
What if I get a job
and have to move to someplace far away?

61
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,195
Then I'll follow you and find a job there.

62
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,530
Or I'll just follow you.

63
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:02,992
Why? Why do you want to be
by my side at all times?

64
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,704
Aren't you tired of our long relationship?

65
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:07,830
Aren't you?

66
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:11,042
Do you like me that much or not?

67
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,757
How should I put it?
He never said the most important thing.

68
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,219
-You're annoying.
-How could you hit me?

69
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:23,721
-Whatever. I'm going home.
-No, wait.

70
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:27,100
Hey. Why are you suddenly so upset? Hey.

71
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:29,185
-Hey, don't.
-Don't follow me.

72
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:33,398
-Hey, what's the matter with you?
-I don't get why she keeps asking me that.

73
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,526
He can't be that dense, can he?

74
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:39,279
1,670 DAYS OF DATING

75
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:42,782
And it was when I asked him
that question for the last time…

76
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,285
How peaceful.

77
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,706
What if…

78
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:54,627
-I told you you have to stop.
-This is the last time. I promise.

79
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,879
I don't get why you do this.

80
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,591
What if we break up?

81
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:08,224
-We won't.
-It's possible though.

82
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,309
Not for me.

83
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,643
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

84
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,730
I could leave you.

85
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,858
What if I abandon you?

86
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:24,282
It's just a what-if question.
Then what will you do?

87
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,242
-I won't see you.
-What?

88
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,704
-I won't see you ever again.
-Ung. You're pretty heartless.

89
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,415
-You'll never see me again?
-Never.

90
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,666
What if I go see you again?

91
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,211
I'll spray water, throw salt,
and kick you out.

92
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,340
I'm not some demon
you need to drive out, you know?

93
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,635
So…

94
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,807
you better not leave me.

95
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,436
He had never looked at me that way.

96
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,816
But maybe

97
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,986
that wasn't a what-if question for her.

98
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,451
You…

99
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,387
What about the salt?

100
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,516
Seeing her here right now…

101
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,812
How did we cross paths again?

102
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:42,235
EPISODE 2
1792 DAYS OF SUMMER

103
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,403
-Hello.
-Hello. It's just us two today.

104
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:47,532
-I see. A group of two.
-Hello.

105
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:51,869
I always come outside
and greet our customers.

106
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:56,499
Many of them are regulars here.
They're pretty much family…

107
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,084
Hello.

108
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,962
Please go inside.

109
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,339
What is this?

110
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,884
We're filming right now. Be natural.

111
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,637
Don't look at the camera. Look at me.

112
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,848
-Am I being filmed too?
-Just act normal.

113
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,308
Go inside. Go on, sir.

114
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,561
Go inside. Don't look at the camera.

115
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:19,063
You must be a regular here.

116
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,815
-Ji-ung, what is this?
-Cut!

117
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:23,443
Chang-sik, please. Come on.

118
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,028
Consider him a producer.

119
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,739
Just be natural and answer his questions.

120
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,825
Stop calling him by his name.

121
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:34,662
-Okay. I'll watch you.
-Okay.

122
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:36,998
-Do what you need to do.
-Okay.

123
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:39,667
-Let's do it again. Action.
-How fascinating.

124
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,419
-Someone watch the counter.
-Excuse me.

125
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,004
What a hectic day.

126
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:46,299
Ji-ung, where in the world is Ung?

127
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,509
I told him to wake up early today

128
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,845
and help out as the cashier.
That little brat.

129
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:53,264
-Gosh.
-He has trouble sleeping these days.

130
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:54,849
Why is that?

131
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:57,727
He's still struggling?
I thought he had gotten better.

132
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:03,357
Is he pulling all-nighters
because of his drawings?

133
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:08,362
Unbelievable. It's all because
he never goes outside.

134
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,948
-Ji-ung, you should--
-No.

135
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,242
I should buy some tonic for my boy.

136
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,078
Honey, call Yong-tae and ask him
to concoct a tonic for him.

137
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,622
-Okay.
-Goodness.

138
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,041
He's not a little boy.

139
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:23,753
-He's a grown man. Don't exaggerate.
-Be quiet.

140
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:27,131
Ji-ung, what is Ung up to right now?

141
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,383
He must have just fallen asleep.

142
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,802
I'll visit him after filming today.

143
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,096
Thanks. That'd be great.

144
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,598
Thanks.

145
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,350
-Come here.
-Yes?

146
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:40,561
I'll visit Yong-tae later

147
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,856
and ask him for the best tonic…

148
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,168
-Have you--
-I'm sure

149
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:07,255
you didn't come here
to ask me how I've been doing.

150
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,430
-You look--
-I doubt you're here

151
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:17,932
to tell me that I seem to be doing good.

152
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:27,483
Seeing how you're not getting upset,
this must be something very important.

153
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,820
How has he become even more unlikeable?

154
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,157
You see…

155
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,492
Hold on.

156
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,288
Are you getting married?

157
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,374
No.

158
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,377
Fine. Keep talking then.

159
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,171
He seems to have changed too.

160
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,968
This is you, isn't it?

161
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:55,928
-No.
-You didn't even look at it.

162
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,265
I can tell that you're lying.

163
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,058
You're Ko-o.

164
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,478
-I said no.
-I didn't believe it at first.

165
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:07,440
Because there was no way
you would have worked this hard.

166
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:10,401
But the places you drew
looked quite familiar.

167
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,945
You don't go to many places.

168
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,993
-They're nothing special.
-And the interview.

169
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,163
You once told me
that you never draw people.

170
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,248
It's common for artists
not to draw people.

171
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,667
Fine. Let's say these are just suspicions.

172
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:27,835
And this…

173
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,505
is proof.

174
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,301
NJ's manager posted this
on his social media.

175
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,303
Do you see that blurry guy in the back?

176
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,890
That's you no matter how I look at it.

177
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:42,642
You recognized me?

178
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:47,229
Ko-o never shows up to his exhibitions
or even when he sells his paintings.

179
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,940
But he met NJ in person
when she bought one from him.

180
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:54,695
-I'm her fan.
-Okay. Sure, you are.

181
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:58,407
Anyway, I'm here to see Ko-o,
not Choi Ung.

182
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,034
I have a proposal.

183
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,370
Is that so?

184
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:05,289
All right.

185
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:07,958
Make your pitch.

186
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:11,212
I guess everyone changes
when they become successful.

187
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,297
He's so cocky now.

188
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:28,187
Sir, we'd like to do a collaboration
between Soen Shop,

189
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,357
a premium lifestyle boutique,

190
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,193
and your work.

191
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:37,571
We were thinking if you could draw live

192
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,616
on the opening day of Soen Shop.

193
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,910
What do you think?

194
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,079
I refuse.

195
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,665
-Sorry?
-I don't want to.

196
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,710
May I ask why?

197
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,337
I just don't want to.

198
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:54,839
But still,

199
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:58,759
if you tell us why you don't want to,
we could make--

200
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:02,138
No. There's no need for that. It's okay.

201
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,807
-Hey.
-Who are you speaking to?

202
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:05,766
The artist or Ung?

203
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,852
Are you going to keep being so childish?

204
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:11,021
I'm not. That's why I'm hearing you out.

205
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,858
Why won't you do it then?
It's because of me.

206
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,943
I don't like being in front of people.

207
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:18,904
You'd know if you did your research. And…

208
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,365
it's also because of you.

209
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,955
You've changed quite a bit.

210
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:31,876
I doubt it. I don't feel any different.

211
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:35,671
Can you please stop being so immature?

212
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,510
Anyway, read this again.
If you change your mind--

213
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,053
Who are you talking to now?

214
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,222
-Ko-o? Ung?
-Hey.

215
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:51,479
I shouldn't have visited him.

216
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,981
All he did was humiliate me.

217
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:58,027
-Why are you here, Yeon-su?
-What?

218
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,778
I told you I won't ever see you again.

219
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,699
I wouldn't have come to see you
if it wasn't for this.

220
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:05,242
So you're here for work?

221
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,077
This is very important to me.

222
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:10,498
Well, It doesn't seem important enough
to come find me after five years.

223
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,585
How are you still so upset
after five years?

224
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,879
How are you so indifferent
only after five years?

225
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:34,813
What are you doing?

226
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:36,565
Am I dreaming?

227
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:40,444
That woman looks very similar to Yeon-su.

228
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,279
He hasn't changed either.

229
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,698
She even sounds like her.

230
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:49,495
I can't believe I'm dreaming of you
meeting your ex-girlfriend.

231
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:53,290
I think we're done here,
so you should go home.

232
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:56,794
That annoying jerk.

233
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,839
What is it?
Is this not a dream? Is this real?

234
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,509
Why is Yeon-su here?

235
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,804
Come on. Open the door.

236
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:07,930
Okay.

237
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,196
Who is it?

238
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,826
Seeing how crazy everything is,
I must be dreaming.

239
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,536
-It must be.
-What are you on about?

240
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,162
This has to be a dream.

241
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,583
-What?
-Good morning.

242
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,670
It's okay. That's normal for me.

243
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,213
It's been a while.

244
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,049
Yes, it's been a while,
but you didn't even call.

245
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,260
You rarely pick up at this hour.

246
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,761
-Can I come in?
-Sure.

247
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:58,105
Who are these people?

248
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,941
-Your employees?
-Yes.

249
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:03,861
Bye.

250
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,246
Does he think he can look down on me
just because he's successful?

251
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,248
Since when was he so great?

252
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:18,500
What?

253
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,216
Bye.

254
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:37,478
I checked one thing off
my bucket list today.

255
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,522
How dare she come here?

256
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,445
What are you doing?
Don't keep her waiting.

257
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,447
You must have had a guest over.

258
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:51,116
Yes. I didn't expect you to come.

259
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,494
I tend to be welcomed
even when I'm not expected,

260
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:55,329
so I was a bit thoughtless. Sorry.

261
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:57,081
There's no need to apologize.

262
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,339
My name is Gu Eun-ho.

263
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:06,840
I'm Ung's manager.

264
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:11,637
You can ask me about his exhibitions,
purchasing his work,

265
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,972
and anything else.

266
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:17,101
Ung? Is that your name?

267
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,979
Yes. I'm Choi Ung.

268
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:20,938
I see.

269
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,857
Did I come too early today?

270
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:27,486
Not at all.
Feel free to come whenever you want.

271
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:30,614
That's why the studio
is open all year round.

272
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,950
-This is my studio--
-If you have any questions,

273
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:35,369
barge in whenever you wish.

274
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:38,664
We're honored someone as shabby
as you came to this precious… No.

275
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:42,292
You're precious. Someone as precious
as you came to this shabby place…

276
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,004
I'm sorry.

277
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,425
It's okay. People tend to stutter
when they talk to me.

278
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,010
Can I see your studio?

279
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,929
Of course, you can. Right?

280
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,725
It's okay, right?
Let me show you around. This way.

281
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:08,527
I'll never forget this gratifying day.

282
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,737
Sir?

283
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,238
Coming.

284
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:15,117
-Thank you for the food.
-Thank you.

285
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,578
Your food is always delicious.

286
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:20,539
Gosh, thank you so much.

287
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:21,957
I hope your business flourishes.

288
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,168
Thank you. Have a great day.

289
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,461
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

290
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,880
Keep walking. Just go.

291
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:30,007
-You gave me a free fried egg today.
-Gosh.

292
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,967
You never do that. Thank you.

293
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,762
Just leave. Go.

294
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,722
I own Seoul Hardware.

295
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:39,016
-and my name is…
-Kook Yeon-su?

296
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:47,983
How dare you let me look this ugly
in front of her?

297
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,610
You traitor.

298
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,111
This has to be

299
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,572
a gratifying moment, right?

300
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,532
Sir.

301
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,659
This was the moment I've been waiting for.

302
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,577
Sir?

303
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:01,705
She's calling you.

304
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,041
-Yes?
-Can you draw something for me?

305
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,710
-What is it?
-There's something I'd like you to draw.

306
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:10,297
I see. But I don't draw people.

307
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,842
I usually draw backgrounds
such as buildings or trees.

308
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,095
It's a building. My building.

309
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,223
-Sorry?
-Please draw the buildings I own.

310
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:22,184
-Make them look pretty.
-She's incredible.

311
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,354
I find no joy in my life these days.

312
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,815
I'm bored no matter what I do.

313
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:30,984
This isn't why I worked so hard
all throughout my life.

314
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:31,902
Oh, dear.

315
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:36,031
But when I look at my buildings…
How should I put it?

316
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,158
It feels refreshing.

317
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:42,329
I feel more lively, have an appetite,
and sleep well at night.

318
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:45,290
Looking at them gives me
a sense of reassurance.

319
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,750
I'm glad.

320
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:50,295
That's how I feel
when I look at your work too.

321
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,506
I see. Thank you.

322
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,974
I find peace and balance.

323
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:06,895
Buildings are the only things
that remain the same.

324
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,689
Do you own properties too?

325
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,817
Of course not.
He's paying monthly rent for this place.

326
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,695
So what do you say?
Can you draw one for me?

327
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:17,990
It'll benefit you if they find out
that I bought another work of yours.

328
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,826
Well, do you think it'll be okay?

329
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,369
You're an idol.

330
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:26,206
It may tarnish your reputation if people
find out that you own properties.

331
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,457
I don't care.

332
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,877
I couldn't find any joy in life

333
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,462
because I had to maintain
this image people had of me.

334
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:36,049
I'm going to do
whatever I want from now on.

335
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:37,926
I see.

336
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,053
Then let me think about--

337
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:41,930
I'm sure he can do it.

338
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,393
By the way,
didn't you say you were a fan of mine?

339
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,729
Yes, I did.

340
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,398
You don't seem like one today.

341
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,984
Are you already sick of me?

342
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:55,986
What do you mean?

343
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,741
It just seems like
you're distracted today.

344
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:05,329
I tend to notice things like this easily.

345
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,290
Oh, that's not why--

346
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,834
I should get going. See you next time.

347
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,129
Let me escort you.

348
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,937
Why does it keep bothering me?

349
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,485
How childish of him.

350
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,862
I don't need him to do me this favor.

351
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,948
I have my pride too.

352
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:43,659
I'll never let him humiliate me
like this ever again.

353
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,369
I hope you weren't bluffing

354
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,120
when you said you could
get the artist on board.

355
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,623
You're not that pathetic, are you?

356
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,793
I shouldn't have overreacted.

357
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:57,172
Should I beg him just this once?

358
00:20:58,757 --> 00:20:59,841
No.

359
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:01,843
He even threw salt at me.

360
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,769
Why were you so distracted?

361
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:12,813
Hey.

362
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,690
Be careful. It's a narrow alley.

363
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,234
It's been ages.

364
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,777
What brings you here?

365
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,946
I should ask you that question.

366
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:22,447
Why are you here?

367
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,324
Right. You live here too.

368
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,827
Don't tell me you're here to see Choi Ung.

369
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:30,539
Don't even get me started.
I came to see the great Ko-o,

370
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,292
-but he treated me like a doormat.
-What do you mean?

371
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,420
Will he never grow up?
He became even more immature.

372
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,798
Did he spray water and throw salt at you?

373
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,842
How did you know?

374
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:45,053
He practiced doing that
on Eun-ho more than 50 times.

375
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,096
What?

376
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:47,889
He's crazier than you think.

377
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:54,688
I had no idea
you'd actually come see him again.

378
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,815
I guess his practice paid off.

379
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,567
It's driving me nuts.

380
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:02,362
I can't believe I thought
I could talk with him.

381
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:05,198
-I must have been out of my mind.
-What's wrong?

382
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:08,035
I had to see him regarding work.

383
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,915
Forget it. What can I do
with that lost cause?

384
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,292
Bye.

385
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,923
Sorry. Look at me.

386
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,717
We haven't met in ages.

387
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,429
How have you been, Ji-ung?

388
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,445
Was I too harsh with the salt?

389
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:57,918
Grandma, let's eat.

390
00:22:58,001 --> 00:22:59,002
Okay.

391
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,337
My goodness.

392
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:02,964
Is it already dinner time?

393
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,925
Yes. Eat up and go to bed.

394
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,635
What time is it?

395
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,721
I need to stay up for the drama.

396
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,890
It hasn't started yet. Eat first.

397
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,937
How could someone be so beautiful
and have glowing skin?

398
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:22,234
Oh, come on.
I just washed my face. That's all.

399
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:24,444
I've seen her on TV often lately.

400
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:27,280
How could all her facial features

401
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,866
fit in that tiny face of hers?

402
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:33,578
Grandma, who's prettier? She or me?

403
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:34,830
What are you on about?

404
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,874
What? You're really hurting my feelings.

405
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,168
I'm your granddaughter,
and she's a stranger.

406
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,003
She must have a grandma too.

407
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:45,632
What?
What kind of ridiculous answer is that?

408
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:47,676
It's the perfect answer
to your absurd question.

409
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,803
Eat up. The food will get cold.

410
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:53,473
You're unbelievable.
I have your exact personality.

411
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:56,059
That's why I'm so hot-tempered.

412
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:58,311
Being hot-tempered
is a must if you're poor.

413
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,980
Don't let others look down on you. Okay?

414
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:04,067
I've been too kind these days, haven't I?

415
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,320
Maybe that's why
I feel so down these days.

416
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,948
What? Did someone look down on you?

417
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:13,160
Who was it? Who made you feel that way?

418
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:14,828
What a scumbag.

419
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:17,164
Let me have at those jerks.

420
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:19,958
I'll teach those brats a lesson.

421
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,668
You're definitely my grandma.

422
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:25,964
Grab this black part

423
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:27,757
and push it in. It's very simple.

424
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:29,050
Bring it outside.

425
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,510
-Okay.
-All right.

426
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,649
-Sir.
-Yes?

427
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,776
-Two dark beers for table five.
-Okay.

428
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,197
Hold on. Once you're done with that,
just go home.

429
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,074
Why do you keep coming here
and helping us out? I feel bad.

430
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:56,119
You give me an allowance.
I should do something in return.

431
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,871
You don't have to.

432
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,791
Sir, two more beers, please.

433
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,210
Sure.

434
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:07,923
Excuse me.

435
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,424
One minute.

436
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:14,221
Here are your dark beers. Enjoy.

437
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:15,680
Yes, what would you like?

438
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:18,558
-One half-and-half spicy chicken.
-Okay.

439
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:20,227
One chicken salad.

440
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:24,731
One tteokbokki
and one chicken feet fried rice.

441
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:28,026
Okay. But why aren't you drinking?

442
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,444
I will.

443
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:31,863
-I'll get the food ready.
-Thank you.

444
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,329
Your food is here.

445
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:43,083
Tteokbokki and chicken feet friend rice.

446
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,460
Are you sure you can finish them?

447
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,546
Sorry? Why would you ask me that?

448
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,382
I can, so don't worry.

449
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:51,591
That's not why.

450
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,551
This is on the house.

451
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:55,679
These are crispy tenders.

452
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:58,723
It's our new dish,
and it's the most popular one.

453
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,684
Really? Are you sure this is for free?

454
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:01,726
Of course.

455
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,896
Seeing how much you've ordered,
the dishes must be scrumptious.

456
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,773
Do you own a mukbang channel?

457
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:08,775
I think I've seen you before.

458
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:12,862
-You're mistaken. Thanks anyway.
-Opened a business nearby?

459
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,572
Yes. What?

460
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:18,285
It's okay. It's not bad
to size your rivals up.

461
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,787
Many of our customers are like you.

462
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,456
I saw you jotting something.
What did you write?

463
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:26,960
Where's your shop? What's it called?

464
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:30,505
-A restaurant? A bar?
-Gosh. I said you're mistaken.

465
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:34,467
You're making me feel
so uncomfortable that I can't eat.

466
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:37,095
You see, I'm very close with the owner.

467
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:39,848
-Should I ask him for the recipes?
-Can you really…

468
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,851
Goodness. Not at all.

469
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:46,229
You're wrong. What time is it?
Oh, dear. I should get going.

470
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:49,524
-The bill please.
-What about all this food?

471
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:51,192
Should I pack them to-go?

472
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:54,446
Yes. You can do that.

473
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:58,366
I hope you savor the food slowly
and find out what the recipes are.

474
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:59,951
Good luck.

475
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:02,954
Damn it.

476
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,581
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

477
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:14,215
"Super tasty, extremely tasty,
incredibly tasty."

478
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,634
Her business is going to go under.

479
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:31,608
Gosh.

480
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:34,903
Why are you sleeping so pitifully
when you look pitiful enough already.

481
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,032
-I couldn't sleep well this morning.
-I heard Yeon-su came by.

482
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:41,284
Get that away. It's blinding me.

483
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:44,329
-How did you know?
-I ran into her.

484
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,207
Before or after we met?

485
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:51,378
-After you threw salt at her.
-Gosh, did she tell you that?

486
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:54,214
She didn't have to.
I know you've been rehearsing that.

487
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:55,590
Have you gone insane?

488
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:59,219
I'm getting secondhand
embarrassment from what you did today.

489
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:04,265
I had no idea I'd see her again.

490
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,352
So how was it to see her again?

491
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,272
I don't know.
I don't even remember what I said.

492
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,441
You probably babbled on about nothing.

493
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,444
Come on. Are you here to pick a fight?

494
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:23,076
What? What is it that you want to know?

495
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:24,828
Let's see…

496
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:26,996
Your mental age, perhaps?

497
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,540
Stop that.

498
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,002
Hey. By the way,

499
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:35,296
what else did she say?

500
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:36,965
Not much.

501
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,261
I see.

502
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:47,934
Let's go inside. It's chilly.

503
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:51,271
I'm going home.

504
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,691
What? Then why did you come here?

505
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:56,401
Beats me.

506
00:28:58,027 --> 00:28:59,112
Bye.

507
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:14,502
Beats me.

508
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,799
Grandma, I'm off now.

509
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,259
Remember what I told you.

510
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:24,012
If anyone looks down on you, you ought to…

511
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,222
Okay. Don't you worry.

512
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:30,727
She made everything simpler.

513
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:34,105
-I should be more straightforward…
-Good morning.

514
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,523
-…and fix the issue.
-You too.

515
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:39,360
Ms. Kook, you look like
you're in a good mood today.

516
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:40,737
Really?

517
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,614
I'll tell him that I couldn't cast Ko-o

518
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:45,283
and propose an outstanding alternative.

519
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:48,578
I'll show him what I'm made of
so he won't look down on me anymore.

520
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:50,663
Oh, and Mr. Bang is with--

521
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,165
Hey, Ms. Kook.

522
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,753
Mr. Jang Do-yul visited us
early in the morning.

523
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:59,672
I heard the project is going well.

524
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,133
I thought I could do it.

525
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,093
You must clock in late, Ms. Kook.

526
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,472
No, you're mistaken.

527
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:11,434
For a more free and creative
work environment,

528
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,144
our employees clock in whenever.

529
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:16,231
Creativity stems from
great work environment after all.

530
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:20,151
I didn't expect to see you here
so early on a Monday morning.

531
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,070
We have some matters to discuss,

532
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:25,615
and I'd like to attend
Soen Shop's soft launch together.

533
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:27,951
All right. Come with me, sir.

534
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:31,120
I'll go with Ms. Kook.
Isn't she in charge of this project?

535
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:35,458
Exactly. Going there with a hands-on staff
would be the most efficient.

536
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:37,210
What are you doing? Go with him.

537
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:38,711
Yes, sir.

538
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:46,177
This was unprecedented.

539
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:54,269
Mr. Jang.

540
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,565
Did you get home safe that night?

541
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:04,487
Do you…

542
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:07,949
not remember what happened?

543
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:10,869
Sorry?

544
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:21,337
Ms. Kook.

545
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,299
I think you're quite drunk.

546
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:27,886
I told you. I don't get drunk.

547
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,597
So why would you think that?

548
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:34,350
Then I'd appreciate it
if you walked in a straight line.

549
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,978
And why aren't you using your umbrella?

550
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,438
Umbrella?

551
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:39,898
Umbrella…

552
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:41,941
I…

553
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,904
I don't have an umbrella.

554
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,991
Unfortunately, I don't have…

555
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:55,038
I don't have an umbrella…

556
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:58,541
My umbrella…

557
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:05,840
What is this flashback that I'm having?

558
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,893
Aren't you getting out?

559
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:19,312
Yes. I am.

560
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,360
We should take my car.

561
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:27,195
Okay.

562
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,428
Mr. Jang.

563
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:54,514
Yes, Ms. Kook.

564
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:56,933
I think

565
00:32:57,016 --> 00:33:00,728
someone is stealing your car right now.

566
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,401
He's not stealing it. He's driving it.

567
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:09,070
Don't you worry about a thing.

568
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,531
I'll keep a close eye on him.

569
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:14,742
Okay. Thank you.

570
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,911
Is she okay?

571
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,037
Sir!

572
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:21,040
Sir, please be careful.

573
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,292
Jang Do-yul has a nasty temper.

574
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,546
He won't show you any mercy.

575
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:28,756
You know I can hear you, right?

576
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,557
You're awfully quiet, Ms. Kook.

577
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:41,310
-Sorry?
-Do you remember now?

578
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:46,357
No. I'm afraid I don't know
what you're talking about.

579
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:48,151
You do.

580
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,820
I don't understand.

581
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:52,655
How much do you remember?

582
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:56,200
Do you remember calling me a sociopath?

583
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:57,869
What?

584
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:04,834
You think you're a sociopath.

585
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:05,835
Sorry?

586
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,506
You're a cold-hearted man

587
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,509
who won't hesitate
to walk all over someone

588
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:15,887
to achieve success.

589
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:19,098
Are you talking about me?

590
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:22,518
"I may not be able
to empathize with others,

591
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:25,188
but I'm a cold-hearted man

592
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:27,565
who's intelligent and good at his job."

593
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:29,650
Ms. Kook--

594
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,194
Unbelievable.

595
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:36,783
TVs really give off the wrong image.

596
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:40,244
My grandma and I watch this drama,

597
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:43,581
and there's also this character
who's just like you.

598
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:48,336
People think those bastards are amazing.

599
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:50,671
but they're just losers.

600
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:53,883
Ms. Kook.
Don't do something you'll regret--

601
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:58,179
Stop cutting me off. Will you?

602
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:03,309
Why do you keep cutting me off?

603
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:08,231
How would you like it
if I cut your neck off?

604
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:25,289
Mr. Jang, I'm truly sorry
for what I've done.

605
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,415
I'm really sorry.

606
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,876
So you remember that.

607
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,837
I'm extremely sorry.

608
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,214
I have no excuses.

609
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,674
I was drunk and made a huge--

610
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:37,218
I thought you never got drunk.
You were incredible.

611
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:43,766
What can I do for you to forgive me?

612
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:47,603
It's fine. Please just make sure
this upcoming project goes smoothly.

613
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:51,816
-Well, you see…
-We're here.

614
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:01,284
Ung. Hey!

615
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:06,747
-Ung.
-You startled me.

616
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,167
-I just fell asleep.
-What is this?

617
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,627
What about that?

618
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:15,047
What is this? Who gave this to you?

619
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,924
Oh, this? Yeon-su did.

620
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:20,761
Yeon-su? No way. This is what she does?

621
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,639
No. More importantly,
she wanted you to do this?

622
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:24,724
Unbelievable.

623
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:27,185
I see. So that's why she came to see you.

624
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:31,022
Right. She wouldn't have stooped so low
to just come and see you.

625
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:32,481
What are you talking about?

626
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:35,026
-You said you'd do it, right?
-I told her no.

627
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:37,612
Are you nuts? Why would you do that?

628
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:40,031
Did you even read it?

629
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:45,203
No. She talked about doing some live show,

630
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:48,497
so I refused right away.
You know I don't do those.

631
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:51,876
-You'll be drawing Soen Shop.
-What is that?

632
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:57,006
It's a new boutique that has launched
in Paris, London, and now, here.

633
00:36:57,089 --> 00:37:00,343
Is this news to you?
You should've said yes immediately.

634
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:03,471
-You of all people should have done so.
-Why?

635
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,266
Because Jean Ferrat designed it.

636
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,812
How do you not know this
about your favorite architect?

637
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:16,317
Go to Yeon-su this instant
and tell her you'll do it.

638
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,278
Why did you have to act all tough
and throw salt at her?

639
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:20,446
What a fool.

640
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,949
Go beg.

641
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:24,033
WORLD-FAMOUS ARCHITECT, JEAN FERRAT

642
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:28,704
Damn it. I won't do it.

643
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,083
You must be crazy.
You're opting out of this?

644
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:36,295
Wait right there. Let me show you.

645
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:39,548
SOEN SHOP

646
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:43,177
What? Today is their soft launch.

647
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:45,721
Today?

648
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:50,393
Go see for yourself
and decide whether you'll do it or not.

649
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,692
NJ. It's one hour before your rehearsal.

650
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:58,901
Please get ready.

651
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:00,361
-Okay.
-Okay.

652
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,446
-Let's get ready.
-He's not calling me.

653
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:04,657
Who?

654
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,783
That artist.

655
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,243
Did he say he'd call?

656
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:09,328
Yes. I asked him for a favor.

657
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:11,539
He said he'd think about it and call me.

658
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:13,416
How long has it been?

659
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:17,169
A day and three hours?

660
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:19,755
Come on. That's not a big deal.

661
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,132
To me, it is.

662
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,343
He's an artist.

663
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,345
A pretty famous one at that.

664
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:30,016
He must think you're a snob,
so he's taking his time.

665
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,601
That can't be.

666
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:34,770
Is he handsome?

667
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:38,190
No. He looks a bit…

668
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:41,610
like a fool.

669
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:44,947
Oh, dear. He's just your type.

670
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,283
Exactly.

671
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:50,494
But why would he not call me
when he's just my type?

672
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,250
Chi-seong. Is my schedule--

673
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:59,045
No, it's full. It's completely packed.

674
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:02,798
-Can I skip any of them?
-No, you can't.

675
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:05,801
You're making up for what you skipped
in the past two weeks,

676
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:07,553
so that's definitely not an option.

677
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:11,849
NJ. I can see
that you're racking your brain.

678
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:14,810
Can you please not do that? Please?

679
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:17,313
-For my sake.
-Should I call him first?

680
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,273
No.

681
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:23,235
I've reached out to him too often
when he's not even a celebrity.

682
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:27,823
No. Since he's an artist,
I guess he's kind of a celebrity.

683
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,826
Then I guess it's no big deal.

684
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:43,297
Are you going to do it?

685
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,885
-No, I'm not.
-Then why keep watching it?

686
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:51,138
-Just because.
-It looked fun to me.

687
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:55,393
Why do you say that?

688
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,728
They're so lively
as if they've been freshly caught.

689
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,106
Are they fish or something?

690
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:03,984
I liked their chemistry
and their characters.

691
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:07,279
It's perfect for the early summertime.
They're awkward and young.

692
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:10,908
It's a documentary
that's more exciting than most dramas.

693
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:15,579
It's childish, but it also deals with
the worries people their age have.

694
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,581
I could understand

695
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:20,167
why people love it so much
and want to see them again.

696
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,128
All they did was argue and fight.

697
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:26,257
Did you see the original?
Watch it, and you'll think otherwise.

698
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:29,093
The original? When did you watch that?

699
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,388
You're in it a lot too.

700
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:35,057
-You were rather cute when you were 19.
-Whatever.

701
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:37,643
Anyway, take a look at it.

702
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:40,896
No, thanks. I have no time for that.

703
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,315
I'm off to a shoot.

704
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:44,400
Bye.

705
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:53,284
EDITING ROOM

706
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,138
Gosh. Why am I doing this?

707
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,057
SBC SPECIAL

708
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:56,388
The barricades might take up
too much space on the opening day.

709
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:58,057
-We should remove them.
-Okay.

710
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,808
Hello. This way.

711
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:05,731
We should make it so
that the guests can tour…

712
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,067
I'll send you an email.

713
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:11,070
Should I put these items
where they're more visible?

714
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,324
Mr. Jang?

715
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,078
Okay.

716
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,664
That's good.

717
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:27,503
So? Do you still not want to do it?

718
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:31,090
Take a look inside.
You'll change your mind.

719
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,597
-Sir.
-Yes?

720
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:41,225
They're taking turns inspecting
the elevators.

721
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:42,601
It'll take about 15 minutes.

722
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:44,937
That's fine. We'll take the escalator.

723
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,105
Let's go.

724
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:51,902
Our key features
are furniture and lighting,

725
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:55,072
so put them at the top
of the product placement list.

726
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:56,574
Also, please utilize

727
00:42:56,657 --> 00:43:00,035
all the areas
within the shop for publicity.

728
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,997
And please make a list of products

729
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,833
that can be showcased in dramas,
variety shows, or documentaries.

730
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,001
Yes, sir.

731
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:10,004
-Also, about that collaboration--
-Yeon-su.

732
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:10,963
Yeon-su!

733
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:20,848
We'll go up. Stay there. Hold on.

734
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:23,642
I'm sorry.

735
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,271
That's fine.
Should I give you some privacy?

736
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:28,981
No, you can continue.

737
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:32,985
Over here.

738
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:34,445
Hey, Yeon-su.

739
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:36,238
Here you are.

740
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:38,532
I brought him here. Aren't you glad?

741
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,410
Hey, drag him out of here.

742
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:43,245
I didn't want to come here.

743
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:45,998
I heard you wanted to work with him.

744
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:48,834
You might as well tell everyone.

745
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:54,757
Eun-ho, I'm working right now.

746
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,593
Ms. Kook, I can give you
some privacy if you need it.

747
00:43:57,676 --> 00:43:58,844
No, that's okay.

748
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:03,807
Excuse me, but are you working with her?

749
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:07,144
Yes. He's the marketing team leader
of Soen Shop.

750
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:09,521
Really? No way.

751
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:12,149
We're very interested in this shop.

752
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:14,360
Ung, did you hear that?
He's the team leader.

753
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:16,028
Stop embarrassing me. Let's go.

754
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:19,073
This is only our soft launch,
so it's still a bit hectic.

755
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:21,950
But I hope you enjoy it.
And if there's any inconvenience

756
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:25,496
or if you have any suggestions,
please tell our employees on your way out.

757
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:26,664
Sure, we will.

758
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:28,874
You're very friendly.

759
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,670
Yeon-su, call me when you're done.
My number is…

760
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:35,214
Never mind. You can just call Ung.

761
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:36,632
Make sure you call--

762
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:38,592
Don't forget to call.

763
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:42,554
I'm sorry, sir.

764
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:45,140
It's okay. They're interesting people.

765
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:50,521
What's the matter?

766
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:55,067
I'm just surprised
that you weren't offended by--

767
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:57,277
Is it because
I didn't act like a sociopath?

768
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,571
No. That's not what I meant.

769
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:01,990
-Let's go.
-Okay.

770
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:12,126
Why is that team leader so good-looking?

771
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:17,214
They look like a couple and
not work partners that they're together.

772
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:18,382
You bastard.

773
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:22,094
How could you tell everyone
about my identity when you're my manager?

774
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:24,638
Come on. Are you Batman or what?

775
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:27,391
Why do you keep trying so hard
to hide your identity?

776
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:29,601
-Shut up.
-Hold up. Are you leaving already?

777
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:32,020
You're not going to talk with Yeon-su?

778
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:33,313
I'm going upstairs.

779
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:37,901
Look at you.
You're totally into this place.

780
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:42,364
NJ, take a deep breath
at the count of two.

781
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:44,950
Here we go. One, two.

782
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:48,912
Done. Okay. Good.

783
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,376
-Unzip me.
-What? Why?

784
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,503
-Hurry up.
-Why?

785
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,714
I did it. What's wrong?

786
00:45:58,797 --> 00:45:59,798
MR. CHOI UNG
READ

787
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:01,341
Is he crazy?

788
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,052
How could he ignore my text
when he's read it?

789
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:05,137
That artist?

790
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,806
You've met your match.

791
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:11,018
He must be writing his reply.

792
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:12,978
He's just being prudent, right?

793
00:46:13,061 --> 00:46:14,313
How long has it been?

794
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:16,148
Thirteen minutes?

795
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:18,692
I really don't get
young people these days.

796
00:46:18,775 --> 00:46:20,486
It's only been 13 minutes.

797
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:21,737
How childish.

798
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:25,532
He didn't strike me as the prudent type.

799
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,576
Why is he ignoring me?

800
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:32,956
Take this off.

801
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,166
-Chi-seong.
-Yes?

802
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:35,584
She's at it again.

803
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:37,127
What is it this time?

804
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:40,047
I can skip the rehearsal.

805
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:42,049
I need to go out for a bit.

806
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:57,648
Mr. Jang.

807
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,775
I have something to tell you.

808
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:01,318
Go ahead.

809
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,655
It's about the collaboration

810
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:07,282
-with that artist.
-Okay.

811
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,410
I don't think it'll pan out.

812
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,206
Why not?

813
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:16,750
I wasn't able to contact him.

814
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:18,710
And through my research,

815
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:22,631
I found out that he doesn't like
to be seen in public.

816
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,677
-Ms. Kook--
-I know you're disappointed.

817
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,136
I'm truly sorry.

818
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:32,140
However, I promise that I'll come up
with a better alternative.

819
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,604
You must not remember
what happened at the end.

820
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:40,482
-Sorry?
-You remember calling me a sociopath

821
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:43,777
but not what happened
in front of your house that night.

822
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,446
What do you mean?

823
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:57,040
I found Ko-o.

824
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:03,297
I didn't want you to look down on me.

825
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:06,216
That's great news.

826
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:09,261
I really hoped it wasn't him.

827
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:13,181
I really didn't expect it to be him.

828
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:15,350
Sorry?

829
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:16,893
But how…

830
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:20,564
How could I possibly see him again?

831
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,568
What do you mean?

832
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:27,362
How could I…

833
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:33,702
see that bastard, Choi Ung, again?

834
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:42,544
Do you personally know Ko-o?

835
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:47,090
It's been five years since we broke up.

836
00:48:49,926 --> 00:48:50,927
Hey.

837
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:53,680
Ms. Kook?

838
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:56,266
Of all the people…

839
00:48:58,226 --> 00:49:02,272
how could I face Ung again?

840
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:09,154
What in the world did I tell him?

841
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:18,872
-That man earlier was Ko-o, wasn't he?
-Well--

842
00:49:18,955 --> 00:49:20,999
He seems to know about this project.

843
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:23,710
If you're uncomfortable
about working with him,

844
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:27,839
we're willing to replace you
with someone else and proceed with it.

845
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:30,676
-Mr. Jang--
-Since you were in charge from the start,

846
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,928
it'd be great if you did it.

847
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:35,597
But we have no choice if you keep letting
your personal matters get in the way.

848
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:37,683
-Mr. Jang.
-One minute.

849
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,351
You can leave first.

850
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:41,561
Let me know if anything
new comes up. Goodbye.

851
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:43,355
Yes?

852
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,023
What is it?

853
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:47,818
It looks good.

854
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,613
What should I do?

855
00:49:56,702 --> 00:50:00,831
What am I supposed to do?

856
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,918
Aren't you getting in?

857
00:50:27,023 --> 00:50:28,191
Where is Eun-ho?

858
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:30,235
He's already downstairs.

859
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:35,991
What's going on?

860
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,787
Right. They said they were inspecting
the elevators.

861
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:43,707
EMERGENCY CALL

862
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:45,876
We're in elevator number nine.
Please check.

863
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:53,425
-It won't take long.
-Why aren't you surprised?

864
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:54,968
Why should I be?

865
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:07,147
You said you weren't interested.
Why are you here?

866
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:08,982
I read the proposal today.

867
00:51:09,065 --> 00:51:11,568
I knew it.
You didn't even read it that day.

868
00:51:13,945 --> 00:51:16,948
How are you still so immature?

869
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:19,534
I heard you rehearsed
spraying water and salt.

870
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:22,370
-Did Ji-ung tell you that?
-Grow up, will you?

871
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:23,914
Was that all you could think up?

872
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:28,752
What about you?

873
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:31,588
Was work the only excuse
for you to come see me?

874
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:41,598
Then what excuse did you expect
to hear when you saw me?

875
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:53,777
I didn't plan on
acting immature like you did.

876
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:55,946
It's been five years after all.

877
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:05,163
What if I was serious
and didn't act childish?

878
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,251
Would you have managed?

879
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:19,302
If you were sincere,

880
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:21,263
what would you have done?

881
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:40,866
I'm sorry. They must have made a mistake.

882
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:42,576
No, it's okay.

883
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:01,803
I am childish.

884
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:04,514
I just ran away.

885
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:15,317
Hi.

886
00:53:17,193 --> 00:53:18,153
What?

887
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:20,655
NJ, what brings you here?

888
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:24,701
-Where's your phone?
-My phone? It's right here.

889
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:27,537
I see. You didn't lose it.

890
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:30,165
Then why did you ignore me?

891
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:34,836
Oh, that. I put it off
because I wanted to think

892
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,796
-before replying.
-You put off my text?

893
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:41,593
-Then what were you doing in the meantime?
-I went out.

894
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:45,764
What are you doing here?
Why did you come here?

895
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:49,559
No particular reason.
I was wondering why you ignored me.

896
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:52,729
But aren't you busy?
Don't you have a packed schedule?

897
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:56,107
I was going to leave in five minutes.
I have a live stage scheduled.

898
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:58,443
I just had some free time.

899
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:02,030
-All the way here?
-I'm usually too busy to be bored,

900
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:03,782
but things have changed these days.

901
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:07,661
I wanted to see what you were doing
instead of replying to my text.

902
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:09,496
What?

903
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:12,207
You're very…

904
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,085
Well…

905
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,087
Unique.

906
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:21,424
-I'm running late. Goodbye.
-Is that really why you came here?

907
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:24,302
If you want to find out,
ignore my text again.

908
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:25,845
Let's go.

909
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:38,817
SBC SPECIAL
HWIYEONG HIGH SCHOOL

910
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:21,943
Hey.

911
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:25,613
I'll do it. I'm up for it.

912
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:15,890
SBC SPECIAL

913
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:32,532
What? What do you want me to do?

914
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:35,493
-What?
-You need to do it.

915
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:39,622
Gosh, don't annoy me.

916
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:42,959
I need to do it, so you have to do it too.

917
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:45,378
-Does Dad want to film me too?
-No, not that.

918
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:47,213
You and Yeon-su.

919
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:50,592
Let's film that documentary again.

920
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:00,310
Are you insane? Why would I?

921
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:03,271
Do you think I'm a doormat?

922
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:07,817
Hello, my name is Choi Ung.

923
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:10,195
EPILOGUE

924
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:11,905
My name is…

925
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:18,453
Gosh, do we really have to do this?

926
00:58:32,133 --> 00:58:39,140
1792 DAYS OF SUMMER

927
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:57,867
Why do you think people decide
to star in a documentary?

928
00:58:57,951 --> 00:58:59,827
My skin used to be so elastic.

929
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:03,039
Oh, things I hate?
It's still Kook Yeon-su.

930
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:06,084
To put Ung and Yeon-su together…

931
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:07,585
Wouldn't that be disastrous?

932
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:08,962
Wait. My crutch!

933
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:12,924
Why would I? You mean nothing to me.

934
00:59:13,007 --> 00:59:15,593
She's so selfish
and always so full of herself.

935
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:17,178
Let's see who wins.

936
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:20,932
How precious it is to be able to
capture and store a moment in your life.

937
00:59:21,015 --> 00:59:22,350
Be honest with me.

938
00:59:22,433 --> 00:59:24,269
Does that really mean nothing to you?

939
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:31,484
