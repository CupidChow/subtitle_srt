00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,949
♫  I can't help but feel a little happy  ♫

3
00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:23,430
♫  I can't help but feel a little nervous  ♫

4
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,929
♫  The earth is turning because of you  ♫

5
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:28,329
♫  Without you, the earth stops  ♫

6
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:34,270
♫  You are the rainbow that fills up the black and white  ♫

7
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:39,889
♫  I was once obsessed with the legend of the four-leaf clover  ♫

8
00:00:39,889 --> 00:00:44,589
♫  I dreamed of a white-horse carriage and 
you becoming my prince  ♫

9
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:48,689
♫  Your gaze is too seducing, please save me  ♫

10
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:53,150
♫  I'm turning into a moth, flying towards the fire  ♫

♫  Holding your hand, let's count down to happiness  ♫

15
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:19,630
♫  I can't help but be a little fragile  ♫

16
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:24,170
♫  I can't help but feel a little gloomy  ♫

17
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,530
♫  The sky is bright because of you  ♫

18
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,849
♫  Without you, the sky is grey  ♫

19
00:01:28,849 --> 00:01:33,389
♫  You are the angel who takes away all loneliness  ♫

20
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,110
   

21
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:41,110
   

22
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,909

00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:30,589
♫  So empty  ♫

30
00:02:30,589 --> 00:02:33,450
♫  People around  ♫

31
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:38,590
♫  So empty  ♫

32
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:41,730
♫  They feel   ♫ 
    

33
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,449

00:02:55,809 --> 00:03:00,150
♫  You are the most perfect when full of vitality  ♫

39
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,910
♫  One, two, three  ♫

40
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,350
♫  One, two, three  ♫

41
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,890
Boss!

42
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,090
You're still here.

43
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:33,210
The dimensions are off and the proportions are wrong.

44
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:36,450
No way! I measured everything just now.

45
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:39,488
Check this out yourself.

46
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,850
There's an extra 2mm.

47
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:51,970
Also, you used too much glue.

48
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:55,530
I don't like seeing something this sloppy.

49
00:03:56,346 --> 00:03:58,326
What should I do now?

50
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,410
What else can we do?

51
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,370
Let's eat first.

52
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,730
   

53
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:24,709
Boss, sorry about what just happened.

54
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:27,069
I thought I measured it very precisely.

55
00:04:27,069 --> 00:04:30,070
I didn't expect you to identify the problem with just a glance.

56
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,689
The construction industry is a matter closely tied to life safety.

57
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:36,690
There's no room for error in any aspect, including the models.

58
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:37,609
Got it.

59
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,850
I will make sure to learn from you, Boss.

60
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:40,849
Redo it tomorrow.

61
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,409
Show it to me after you're done.

62
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,950
Yes, sir.

63
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,849
Boss, let me drive you home.

64
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,350
Sure.

65
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:52,010
There's something on your face.

66
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,990
This side.

67
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,249
 No way. 

68
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,869
 I didn't touch the elevator. 

69
00:05:23,869 --> 00:05:26,609
 No way, not again! 

70
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:27,629
 Data is normal. 

71
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:29,289
 There shouldn't be any electric discharge. 

72
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,249
 Is the watch no longer accurate? 

73
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,509
 Bad luck having a go at me for the second time today. 

74
00:05:33,509 --> 00:05:37,010
 Another awkward scenario like this. 

75
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:41,490
Boss, I'm sorry.

76
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,390
Why are you apologizing?

77
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,530
I don't know.

78
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:49,809
I'm always out of luck and it seems like it's affecting you now.

79
00:05:49,809 --> 00:05:52,970
Don't apologize if you haven't done anything wrong.

80
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,370
What's wrong with the elevator?

81
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,229
 It's malfunctioning. 

82
00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:00,369
 It's locked. 

83
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:03,470
 But don't worry, we'll send someone now. 

84
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:07,270
♫  Pretend that you're happy  ♫

85
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,270
Scared?

86
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,390
A little.

87
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:28,310
Boss, are you all right?

88
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,489
I'm good.

89
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,870
I'm used to it.

90
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,490
The quality of this elevator is this bad?

91
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,049
It's not the elevator's problem.

92
00:06:37,049 --> 00:06:41,470
It's just I run into problems like this all the time.

93
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,009
For me, it's just Mercury retrograde.

94
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:46,529
Happens 365 days a year. I'm used to it.

95
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,409
It lasts super long.

96
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:51,710
I didn't know outstanding people like you would be out of luck, too.

97
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:57,370
Have you heard of Festinger's theory?

98
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,970
What theory?

99
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:04,209
Festinger is an American social psychologist.

100
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:08,230
He has a famous theory, called the Festinger theory.

101
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,929
It states that 10 percent of things that happen in life

102
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,509
are caused by what happened to you.

103
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:16,649
The other 90 percent depends on how you react

104
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:19,210
to the 10 percent of things that happened to you.

105
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:24,050
I'm afraid I don't follow you.

106
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:27,050
It's just saying that no matter how hard you try to avoid it or to prevent it,

107
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:29,169
bad things will always happen.

108
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:31,970
You have no control over that 10 percent.

109
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:37,290
The other 90 percent all depends on your mentality and actions.

110
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,070
So, bad things will always happen.

111
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:43,870
Don't think that your bad luck drags other people down.

112
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:50,210
I think I understand now.

113
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:54,009
Actually, I want to bring happiness to the people around me, too.

114
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,369
But I always seem to bring bad luck to them.

115
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,570
That's why I'm a little upset.

116
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:05,070
What's your definition of happiness?

117
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:07,030
Happiness...

118
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:10,890
When I was young, wearing pretty princess dresses was happiness.

119
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,729
But now, as long as I can earn enough money

120
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:15,049
to cover next month's living expenses, I'll be very happy.

121
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,589
My auntie had lots of plans.

122
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:20,890
However, after her back injury, she told me that good health

123
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:23,750
is happiness beyond what one could wish for.

124
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,850
Definitely.

125
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:31,650
Good health is happiness beyond what one could wish for.

126
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:36,810
Boss, what's your definition of happiness?

127
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,049
Maybe winning the Jin An Award.

128
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:42,489
I know that award!

129
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,089
Many architects dream of winning it.

130
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,609
Is it because winning that award will make you famous

131
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,889
and punch a ticket to the international market?

132
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:52,529
I'll retire after I win the award.

133
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:55,209
Maybe getting myself ready to leave the industry.

134
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:57,090
How can you do that!

135
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,329
You are so gifted and talented.

136
00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:02,790
Others can only dream of your gift and talent!

137
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:06,269
I appreciate you trying to flatter me, even in a moment like this.

138
00:09:06,269 --> 00:09:07,249
I don't care.

139
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,209
You can't retire.

140
00:09:08,209 --> 00:09:09,969
Who will I assist at work after you retire?

141
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:11,169
You're so talented.

142
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:14,389
If I don't absorb some of your talent from you, I'm not quitting.

143
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:16,290
Don't retire!

144
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,110
Fine.

145
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:24,950
Make sure to always be my assistant, no matter where I go.

146
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,050
 Anyone in there? 

147
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,850
Yes!

148
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:46,549
Come, you two. Quickly.

149
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:49,829
You can go first.

150
00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:51,089
Boss, you go first.

151
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,250
Just go, hurry.

152
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,890
It's okay. Just pull me out with a rope later.

153
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,069
Step on here.

154
00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:05,609
No, definitely not.

155
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,129
My conscience will feel condemned.

156
00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:08,569
How can an employee step on her boss?

157
00:10:08,569 --> 00:10:10,610
Hurry up.

158
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:25,130
Boss, give me your hand.

159
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,890
 Come on, 

160
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,610
 give me your hand. 

161
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:38,250
 Older brother, I wished for 

162
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:42,869
 Mom and Dad to wake up soon and for you to be safe and sound. 

163
00:10:42,869 --> 00:10:45,370
 We'll get out of here together. 

164
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:07,410
 You're Mr. Gu, right? 

165
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,630
   

166
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,209
 Weird. 

167
00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:43,490
 Why do I get this familiar feeling every time I hold her hand? 

168
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:53,230
Boss, are you okay?

169
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,030
I'm fine.

170
00:11:57,855 --> 00:12:01,695
What do you think is the significance of architectural design?

171
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:07,229
My dad used to be an architect.

172
00:12:07,229 --> 00:12:10,409
But he only designed residential buildings.

173
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:13,209
He used to always take me to the buildings that he designed

174
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:17,690
and tell me that he was the one who designed this and that.

175
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,549
After that, whenever I pass by those buildings

176
00:12:19,549 --> 00:12:23,310
and see the people inside, I'd think that my dad is really awesome.

177
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,849
Because the buildings he designed

178
00:12:24,849 --> 00:12:26,630
allowed so many people to own a home.

179
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:29,530
Maybe this is the meaning of doing architectural design.

180
00:12:30,662 --> 00:12:33,862
Is your dad still doing this?

181
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,170
He is no longer with us.

182
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:42,650
My mom and dad passed away when I was 14.

183
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:44,310
I'm sorry.

184
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:45,529
It's okay.

185
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:47,650
I don't mind bringing this up.

186
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,409
It has been many years.

187
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:52,010
I have fully accepted it.

188
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:56,630
The reason that I don't bring it up is because

189
00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:00,050
I don't want other people to feel sorry for me, to pity me.

190
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:05,430
Both for life and for work, I want to prove myself with my ability.

191
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,210
You did it.

192
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:12,150
A very good friend of mine said that too!

193
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:30,230
Boss, I'm going to leave now.

194
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:32,450
Be safe.

195
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,470
Boss,

196
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,510
thank you!

197
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,350
What for?

198
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,949
   

199
00:13:56,949 --> 00:13:58,069
 Boss, 

200
00:13:58,069 --> 00:13:59,509
  I wanted to say 

201
00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:00,529
  thank you 

202
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:02,449
 for what you said in the elevator. 

203
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,870
  This was the first time 

204
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:07,050
 that I felt like having bad luck isn't all that troublesome. 

205
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:11,130
 I'll follow what Fetinsger said and adjust my mindset. 

206
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:14,450
 But Boss, you can't retire! 

207
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:18,609
It's Festinger. 
    

208
00:14:28,207 --> 00:14:29,810
Hello, doctor.

209
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:31,770
I was just going to call you.

210
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:35,769
All of a sudden, I feel this chest pain and I'm having trouble breathing.

211
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:36,889
 What's wrong? 

212
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:39,930
 Is there anything I can do to help? 

213
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:43,850
Seems like the person at work today is a different doctor.

214
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,830
Are you talking about my alternate identity?

215
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:52,550
My doctor told me that geniuses are just like me.

216
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:55,310
 I'm a genius after all. 

217
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,090
Let's get down to business.

218
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:59,350
Ever since the last update,

219
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:03,650
I feel like my heart has become more unstable.

220
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:07,530
Did you run into a dangerous situation?

221
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:12,089
I experienced excessive discharge.

222
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:13,430
Really?

223
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:16,249
You finally have a crush on someone?

224
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:20,169
Your heart has been very stable for the past ten years,

225
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:24,529
 but the data has become strange very recently. 

226
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:28,610
Did you meet someone very special?

227
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,389
Why are you happy about it?

228
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:33,209
I remember you telling me to not have a person like that in my life.

229
00:15:33,209 --> 00:15:35,229
 Forget what that person said. 

230
00:15:35,229 --> 00:15:37,009
 Just listen to me now. 

231
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:43,050
If you've really met this special someone, make sure to tell me.

232
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,870
If, I'm saying if,

233
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:51,529
I really find this person,

234
00:15:51,529 --> 00:15:56,430
is there any way to stabilize my data?

235
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:58,330
 No. 

236
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,230
Then, why would I tell you?

237
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:04,909
I can change the color of the built-in light of your mechanical heart to pink.

238
00:16:04,909 --> 00:16:07,849
 This way it fits your mood better. 

239
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:10,970
Are you kidding me?

240
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,649
 Okay, okay, calm down. 

241
00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:15,729
I'll try to come up with ideas to help.

242
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:19,730
My ideas and the other person's ideas are different.

243
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:22,809
 Gu Chuan, life is short. 

244
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:26,129
 This heart is there for you to survive. 

245
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:30,349
But living and surviving are different.

246
00:16:30,349 --> 00:16:31,910
Do you understand?

247
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:36,089
 I don't want to give you false hope, but I'll try my best. 

248
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:37,389
 Improving your mechanical heart 

249
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:40,150
 is the most important thing in my life. 

250
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:43,070
Great, all right. Thank you, thank you.

251
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:46,129
You have to understand that I am not only a doctor,

252
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,030
I'm also a scientist.

253
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,089
I know.

254
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:52,069
The really crazy ones.

255
00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:54,129
Saving lives is my job.

256
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:56,209
I'm happy that you are alive.

257
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:59,650
But I don't want you to become handicapped too early.

258
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:02,450
You have to love and protect yourself.

259
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:07,630
There are some things that you really can't say for sure.

260
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:17,190
 Everyone wants me to live. 

261
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:19,850
 I'm the only one who doesn't. 

262
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:32,229
Xiaoning, sit down. Get some rest.

263
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,729
Everything has been painted.

264
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:40,569
It only cost me a few hundred yuan.

265
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:43,890
You're so good at saving money.

266
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:47,530
You're talking like a couple hundred yuan isn't money.

267
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:51,450
It's not money, it's my life.

268
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,690
Thank you for buying all this good food.

269
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,960
Come on. Cheers!

270
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:11,470
Is there anyone in your company called Xu Chengran?

271
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,370
He's a partner of my boss.

272
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:15,550
He's not an architect. He's an investor.

273
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,410
Do you know each other?

274
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:19,329
He's not a good person.

275
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:20,549
Stay away from him.

276
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:21,849
Really?

277
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,049
I think Director Xu is really nice.

278
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:27,370
He's always smiley and looks very easy-going.

279
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,089
Is he trying to ask you out on a date?

280
00:18:29,089 --> 00:18:30,910
Let's get tipsy.

281
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:34,049
Tell me about it. What exactly happened?

282
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:37,289
Kind of.

283
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:41,650
But trust me, he promised me that he wouldn't bother you.

284
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:44,689
Also, you know what, every time he comes near me,

285
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,530
my brain just goes...

286
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,130
You know what this is?

287
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,889
My playboy radar!

288
00:18:50,889 --> 00:18:54,030
My playboy radar is never wrong.

289
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,529
Your ex-boyfriend was a player.

290
00:18:55,529 --> 00:18:57,650
How did you not notice?

291
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,410
I got this radar because of him.

292
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,749
And this Xu Chengran just looks like one of those

293
00:19:03,749 --> 00:19:05,829
playboys playing around.

294
00:19:05,829 --> 00:19:07,950
He's also super greasy.

295
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,409
What you're saying makes sense to me.

296
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,289
I don't think Director Xu is greasy.

297
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:14,370
I think he's nice.

298
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:15,909
What's wrong with you, Jiang Xiaoning?

299
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:18,769
Why are you speaking for him? Whose side are you on?

300
00:19:18,769 --> 00:19:19,889
No, I'm definitely on your side.

301
00:19:19,889 --> 00:19:21,590
On your side.

302
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,509
But I think it's normal for him to like you.

303
00:19:25,509 --> 00:19:27,409
If I were a guy, I'd like you too.

304
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:29,169
You're gorgeous and have a fun personality.

305
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:31,370
And have a nice figure!

306
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:36,730
Why do I feel like you're hinting at something?

307
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:41,129
Maybe my body is nothing like yours, but I'm still a girl!

308
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,949
Do you want some papaya milk?

309
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:44,049
It stimulates growth.

310
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:44,969
I checked.

311
00:19:44,969 --> 00:19:47,009
It's a myth. It doesn't work.

312
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,689
You really looked it up?

313
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:50,690
Look at you!

314
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:55,109
But to be honest, I'm very interested in the relationship between you and your boss.

315
00:19:55,109 --> 00:19:58,030
Maybe let him stimulate your female hormones?

316
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,009
Stop.

317
00:19:59,009 --> 00:20:01,930
Don't think about my boss in your dirty way.

318
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:03,589
He's the swan.

319
00:20:03,589 --> 00:20:05,269
I'm at most a toad.

320
00:20:05,269 --> 00:20:06,709
I'm not dreaming about this.

321
00:20:06,709 --> 00:20:08,589
I don't think there's anything wrong with it.

322
00:20:08,589 --> 00:20:10,809
There's nothing wrong with having a crush on someone.

323
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,569
Falling in love with someone isn't wrong.

324
00:20:12,569 --> 00:20:14,969
There's also nothing wrong with trying to get someone to date you.

325
00:20:14,969 --> 00:20:18,689
What's wrong is, once we start giving and don't see results,

326
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,869
all we do is complain or blame ourselves.

327
00:20:21,869 --> 00:20:24,629
For someone like your boss, even if you get hurt

328
00:20:24,629 --> 00:20:26,969
and don't get anything in return, I think it's worth it.

329
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:29,170
Because he will change your life.

330
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:31,310
Change my life?

331
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:36,130
Go from being a girl to being a woman.

332
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:38,970
Cheers.

333
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:55,090
Boss.

334
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,590
Director Xu?

335
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,830
Director Xu, did you not sleep well?

336
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:04,209
Why didn't Yan Yan answer my call?

337
00:21:04,209 --> 00:21:06,549
She doesn't reply at all.

338
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:10,430
Sister Yan Yan is very passive.

339
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,749
I want to see her.

340
00:21:11,749 --> 00:21:14,309
Without seeing her, I can't eat and sleep.

341
00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:18,449
I'm getting thinner and weaker. I'm just not okay anymore!

342
00:21:18,449 --> 00:21:20,930
But this is between the two of you.

343
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,110
Ask her out!

344
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:25,230
- Me? 
 - Who else?

345
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:28,190
I can't, even if I want to!

346
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:31,310
But, Director Xu, as someone on her side,

347
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:33,970
I have to be responsible for her happiness.

348
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:35,890
Do you like her?

349
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:38,709
I've already become this sad, it can't be fake.

350
00:21:38,709 --> 00:21:40,090
Will you treat her well?

351
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:43,050
Yes! I certainly and definitely will!

352
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,550
Xiaoning, I beg you.

353
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:49,250
Help me out this one time. I just want to see her again.

354
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:52,930
Regardless of how it goes, I'll give up.

355
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:10,170
  Food stall tonight? 

356
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:12,810
  Okay, see you at our usual spot. 

357
00:22:13,689 --> 00:22:17,249
I sent you the location of the food stall. You must...

358
00:22:17,249 --> 00:22:23,430
Jiang Xiaoning, from now on, you are my best friend, one of my best friends.

359
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:26,590
If Gu Chuan ever bullies you, I'll be on your side. Tell me, okay.

360
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:33,049
Do you think how I was just now will move her?

361
00:22:33,049 --> 00:22:35,270
You moved me.

362
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:43,420
   

363
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:48,329
   

364
00:22:48,329 --> 00:22:49,669
- Brother Kai. 
 - Xiaoning.

365
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:51,269
What did Director Xu want from you?

366
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:53,670
Not me, he was looking for Director Gu.

367
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:55,590
- Where's Director Gu? 
 - I don't know.

368
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:58,449
He texted me this morning and told me I don't need to pick him up.

369
00:22:58,449 --> 00:23:01,410
He might be resting at home.

370
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:03,369
I called him more than 10 times. He never picked up.

371
00:23:03,369 --> 00:23:06,830
- How about you go and check on him? 
 - Me?

372
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,449
Definitely not me.

373
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:10,630
You're his assistant.

374
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,790
Sure, I'll go now.

375
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:16,629
Xiaoning, get him some food on the way there.

376
00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:18,769
Director Gu's fridge needs to be stocked.

377
00:23:18,769 --> 00:23:20,470
Sure!

378
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,870
Boss.

379
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:40,029
Did I not tell you to not come and pick me up today?

380
00:23:40,029 --> 00:23:42,389
Brother Kai said he called you a bunch of times and you never picked up.

381
00:23:42,389 --> 00:23:43,709
He wanted me to check whether you're home or not.

382
00:23:43,709 --> 00:23:47,030
He also said that your fridge needs to be stocked.

383
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:50,690
You seem to have a lot of free time.

384
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:53,470
Do you still remember that model from yesterday?

385
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,769
Auntie, I'm really sorry.

386
00:23:58,769 --> 00:24:00,909
Our company is currently busy with an exhibition center project.

387
00:24:00,909 --> 00:24:02,949
I wasn't able to find the time to spend with you.

388
00:24:02,949 --> 00:24:05,070
Doesn't matter. We don't need to see each other.

389
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,830
Gu!

390
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:10,050
Okay, go and do the check-in first.

391
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,650
Come, Manlin.

392
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:23,329
Is Uncle okay? Is he not happy?

393
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:27,250
He's okay. He's always like that.

394
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:32,930
I have no one else to talk to about this, except for you.

395
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:35,270
Auntie, just say it. it's fine.

396
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:38,289
Our Chuan has been living a lonely life these past years.

397
00:24:38,289 --> 00:24:39,729
He doesn't get along well with others.

398
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:43,670
He doesn't have any other friends besides you and Chengran.

399
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:45,950
I'm worried that this isn't a long-term solution.

400
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:50,010
As time passes, he will develop mental health problems.

401
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:51,950
I understand.

402
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:55,230
We'll spend more time with him.

403
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,189
That would be great.

404
00:24:56,189 --> 00:24:59,690
That way, we don't have to worry as much.

405
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:05,969
What I really want to say is that he finally found a girl that he likes.

406
00:25:05,969 --> 00:25:07,709
A girl that he likes?

407
00:25:07,709 --> 00:25:09,410
Yes.

408
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:12,930
He told us that she is his assistant.

409
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:15,289
He's my child.

410
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:16,970
I know him better than anyone.

411
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:20,750
Even Chuan himself probably isn't aware of how much he likes her.

412
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:25,590
Is her name Jiang Xiaoning?

413
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:28,510
Yes, that's the name.

414
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:32,229
Right, you guys work in the same company. Are you close with her?

415
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:35,890
We're okay.

416
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:40,189
To be honest, we don't expect anything from him.

417
00:25:40,189 --> 00:25:42,109
We just want him to be happy.

418
00:25:42,109 --> 00:25:46,170
Now that he has this girl by his side, we can stop worrying.

419
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:49,829
I hope that Chengran and you, as friends, can take good care of them.

420
00:25:49,829 --> 00:25:53,249
Just pretend that you don't know anything, and let him do his thing.

421
00:25:53,249 --> 00:25:58,229
As for what will happen in the future and whether they can be together, it just depends on them.

422
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:04,750
Manlin, is that okay?

423
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:07,009
Of course.

424
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:08,449
Aunty, don't worry.

425
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:12,410
Thank you so much, I'll see you the next time we come back.

426
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:14,090
Bye, Auntie.

427
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:16,090
Okay.

428
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:18,150
Just stay there.

429
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:33,190
   

430
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,530
All the dishes are ready!

431
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:52,989
Someone is already sitting here.

432
00:26:52,989 --> 00:26:54,430
Am I not a person?

433
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:55,749
Are you?

434
00:26:55,749 --> 00:26:57,529
Why so aggressive?

435
00:26:57,529 --> 00:26:59,009
I know you can beat me up.

436
00:26:59,009 --> 00:27:00,270
But you don't have to start it this early.

437
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,249
Then, why aren't you gone by now?

438
00:27:01,249 --> 00:27:02,450
Who will sit with you if I leave?

439
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:04,790
Jiang Xiaoning isn't coming anyway.

440
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,310
So you asked Jiang Xiaoning to ask me out.

441
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:12,790
I had no choice.

442
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:16,649
This is a public space. If someone calls the police, I can't resolve it this time.

443
00:27:16,649 --> 00:27:18,250
What did I tell you yesterday?

444
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:19,830
Jiang Xiaoning is my friend.

445
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:22,629
You cannot harass her. Are you deaf or just can't understand it?

446
00:27:22,629 --> 00:27:27,309
I did not harass her. I just begged her to ask you out for me.

447
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:35,950
Boss, it's all done.

448
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:42,390
Here, here, here

449
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:46,190
and over here are still a little rough.

450
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:51,290
Give me the ruler.

451
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:10,990
Since you lied to get me to come here, let's talk everything out.

452
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:16,129
What I'm about to say may be a little too straightforward.

453
00:28:16,129 --> 00:28:18,629
I have seen a lot of people like you.

454
00:28:18,629 --> 00:28:21,630
They disappear the day after we sleep together.

455
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:26,410
The word responsibility is nonexistent in your dictionary.

456
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:28,970
I'm serious about you.

457
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,950
What are you serious about? Do you actually know me?

458
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:33,170
I can start to get to know you.

459
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:35,489
No, I mean, you're experienced.

460
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:37,889
Why not go find those that you can pick up easily?

461
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:40,210
Do I look like I'm easily fooled?

462
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:45,510
I admit that I do have some...

463
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:48,230
past experience.

464
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:51,529
But those were all just a flash in the pan.

465
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:55,230
To me, guys like you are a flash in the pan.

466
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,849
But you're different.

467
00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:00,590
You're the most special flash.

468
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:01,990
Why do you say that?

469
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,390
Because you are a bastard.

470
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:06,630
You dared to harass my best friend Jiang Xiaoning. Do others dare?

471
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:08,290
Don't put our names together.

472
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:10,200
You are worse than them.

473
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:15,110
No other girls have talked to me like this.

474
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:20,570
Because I can see through you.

475
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:23,369
I can't even say that I know myself.

476
00:29:23,369 --> 00:29:25,891
Why do you say that you can see through me?

477
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:31,030
In my opinion, the reason that you're rejecting me this fast

478
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:33,570
is that you're scared.

479
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:35,750
Don't egg me on.

480
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,369
You're afraid of answering my calls. You're afraid to see me.

481
00:29:37,369 --> 00:29:39,370
It's because you're afraid that you'll fall for me.

482
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:41,489
You're afraid that you will fall in love with me.

483
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:43,070
Don't try to over-interpret things.

484
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:45,909
You are not capable of doing that, at least to me.

485
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:49,230
- Are you willing to try? 
 - Of course, but not with you.

486
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,990
Tell me where you work and where you live.

487
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:54,210
I'll use all my heart to move you.

488
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:59,410
Do you remember the guy at the hospital?

489
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,870
I'm not afraid of getting beaten up.

490
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,990
I'm just scared that I won't be able to see you.

491
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:22,290
Oh my gosh, I almost got fooled.

492
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:25,810
I'm being very genuine.

493
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:27,309
You don't have to tell me.

494
00:30:27,309 --> 00:30:28,469
I can go ask Jiang Xiaoning.

495
00:30:28,469 --> 00:30:29,649
How dare you.

496
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:32,350
I dare to do anything for you.

497
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:34,049
I will warn you one last time.

498
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:35,510
Jiang Xiaoning is my friend.

499
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,449
If you harass her again, I won't be okay with you.

500
00:30:37,449 --> 00:30:38,630
I won't harass her, I'll harass you.

501
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,770
No, I like you.

502
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:43,569
Thank you. I like myself too.

503
00:30:43,569 --> 00:30:45,409
What do you not like about me? Tell me! I can change.

504
00:30:45,409 --> 00:30:48,469
What do you like about me? I'll change.

505
00:30:48,469 --> 00:30:51,130
Everything.

506
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:53,050
Nice.

507
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:55,740
This meal is on you.

508
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:59,130
I won't give up on you, Yan Yan.

509
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:05,349
She's immune to my tactics.

510
00:31:05,349 --> 00:31:07,810
This girl is definitely my type.

511
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:09,810
Nice.

512
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:21,269
Although it's still rough, it's better than yesterday.

513
00:31:21,269 --> 00:31:23,370
Also, there aren't any errors.

514
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:28,350
I'll give you a 60 on this, a passing grade.

515
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:29,729
Thank you, Boss.

516
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:32,090
Thank you, Boss.

517
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:34,050
What are you going to do?

518
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:38,450
I... I was...

519
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:41,090
What was I going to do?

520
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:46,150
I wanted to say that you're right!

521
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:49,730
As long as you're focused, you can do better!

522
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:54,810
So you're saying that you weren't focused yesterday.

523
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:56,710
Right!

524
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,290
No.

525
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:02,790
I meant, I'm a little more focused today.

526
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:09,530
Phone, Boss.

527
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:22,090
 Jiang Xiaoning, you're dead to me. 

528
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:28,770
It's late, go home.

529
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:33,589
Thank you, Boss. I'll leave now.

530
00:32:33,589 --> 00:32:35,830
Thank you, Teacher.

531
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,330
No.

532
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,390
Boss, thank you for teaching me how to build models.

533
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:43,650
I'll leave now. See you tomorrow, Boss.

534
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:56,989
My dear sister, I'm sorry. I won't do that again.

535
00:32:56,989 --> 00:32:59,029
I was just blinded by profit.

536
00:32:59,029 --> 00:33:00,389
Forgive me, please.

537
00:33:00,389 --> 00:33:02,089
Traitor. I'm done with you from now on.

538
00:33:02,089 --> 00:33:03,309
Please don't.

539
00:33:03,309 --> 00:33:05,750
You're such a great person, please forgive me.

540
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,310
You can't punish yourself for other people's mistakes.

541
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,750
I guess you haven't eaten.

542
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,569
I bought your favorite barbeque and RIO.

543
00:33:11,569 --> 00:33:12,529
Eat something.

544
00:33:12,529 --> 00:33:15,250
Orange Oolong tea, the newest flavor.

545
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:17,029
I don't have an appetite when I'm angry.

546
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:18,329
Don't be like this.

547
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,669
There's nothing that can't be solved by drinks and barbeque.

548
00:33:20,669 --> 00:33:23,310
If one doesn't do it, then two.

549
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,790
I meant the drinks.

550
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:36,849
I'm telling you.

551
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:40,789
If it's not because I'm afraid that he'll give you a hard time at work, I would've...

552
00:33:40,789 --> 00:33:42,229
I know, I know.

553
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:43,870
Cool down, please.

554
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:45,609
I know you're doing this for me.

555
00:33:45,609 --> 00:33:49,489
But when Director Xu came to me for help, he was very sincere and genuine.

556
00:33:49,489 --> 00:33:51,509
I was moved by his genuineness.

557
00:33:51,509 --> 00:33:53,469
What genuineness?

558
00:33:53,469 --> 00:33:57,050
A person who doesn't even know me, tells me that he likes me.

559
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:59,990
I'm telling you, he must be a playboy.

560
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:02,950
Maybe he just likes your appearance and thinks that you're nice,

561
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,049
so he wants to get to know you.

562
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:05,729
There's nothing wrong with that.

563
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:08,170
Xiaoning, sober up.

564
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:12,470
Remember, if a man tells you he likes you

565
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:14,230
without even getting to know you, he will like someone else

566
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:16,610
under the same circumstances, immediately.

567
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:19,310
This is the playboy routine.

568
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:20,610
I don't think that's always the case.

569
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:22,588
I think you're too stubborn.

570
00:34:22,588 --> 00:34:24,888
You can't stay inside all the time because

571
00:34:24,888 --> 00:34:26,009
you're afraid of getting hit by a car.

572
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:28,029
I'm not afraid of getting hit by a car.

573
00:34:28,029 --> 00:34:30,229
I'm just refusing a complicated life with my deep understanding

574
00:34:30,229 --> 00:34:32,770
of what people are truly like.

575
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,089
I can do whatever I want by myself.

576
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:35,230
That's nice.

577
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:37,270
Two people are just too troublesome.

578
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:39,449
I don't think you're celibate.

579
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:41,990
You're just afraid of being disappointed after getting your hopes up.

580
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:47,688
Xiaoning, you haven't dated anyone.

581
00:34:47,689 --> 00:34:51,900
You don't know how exhausting it is to be in a relationship.

582
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:56,610
So I'm warning you, never fall for someone so easily

583
00:34:56,610 --> 00:35:00,450
and give him all you have, like a flying moth darting into the fire.

584
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:03,609
When times are good, it's really sweet.

585
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:07,409
But after that, it is also the same person

586
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:09,590
who will cause you all the torture and sadness.

587
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:15,370
Did you not say that loving a good person is worth the pain?

588
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:18,609
I... I was talking about your boss.

589
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:20,630
Was I talking about

590
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:21,770
- Xu...
 -  Xu Chengran.

591
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:25,410
Xu Chengran? You think I got drunk after one sip?

592
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:32,369
I want the sliced potato.

593
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:33,970
Of course.

594
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:34,769
Please.

595
00:35:34,769 --> 00:35:35,810
Where's your drink?

596
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:37,430
Here.

597
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:42,610
Eat more.

598
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:47,289
I'm telling you, I almost starved to death today.

599
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:48,869
I didn't take even one bite of any of the dishes on the table.

600
00:35:48,869 --> 00:35:50,370
I made him pay.

601
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:52,810
Brilliant!

602
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:09,790
Hey, Beauty!

603
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:11,550
Why are you so late?

604
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:13,269
I've been so bored. Can't take it any longer.

605
00:36:13,269 --> 00:36:15,569
You've been here for so long, but you can't wait just a little longer?

606
00:36:15,569 --> 00:36:16,830
No, I can't.

607
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:18,870
- Does it look nice? 
 - Yes!

608
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:20,469
- Guess who's here! 
 - Who?

609
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:22,349
Take a look for yourself.

610
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:25,290
Xiao Mai.

611
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:27,409
Mom! Why are you here?

612
00:36:27,409 --> 00:36:30,090
You should be resting at home.

613
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:33,969
Everything is still on there.

614
00:36:33,969 --> 00:36:35,910
Why did you have to come to live here when everything is good?

615
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:37,170
Such a waste of money.

616
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:40,250
Mom, am I your daughter or not?

617
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,830
Of course, you are!

618
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:45,170
You being my daughter is the reason I treat everyone the same way.

619
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:48,050
Your brother finally became an architect.

620
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:52,169
He just bought a house and now he has to

621
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:54,309
save up for Xiaoning's university tuition.

622
00:36:54,309 --> 00:36:56,029
Okay, okay, Mom.

623
00:36:56,029 --> 00:36:58,870
Let's go home, all right? Let's pack up and go home.

624
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:01,229
Let's go. We're going home in a car.

625
00:37:01,229 --> 00:37:02,530
Mom, what car?

626
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:04,989
Aren't you trying to save money? Let's take the bus.

627
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:09,270
Auntie, I borrowed a friend's car.

628
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:17,090
Auntie.

629
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:18,949
Thank you, Mister.

630
00:37:18,949 --> 00:37:20,249
Let's get in the car.

631
00:37:20,249 --> 00:37:22,069
- Let's get in the car. 
 - Let's go, Grandma.

632
00:37:22,069 --> 00:37:24,150
Let me help you.

633
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:29,690
Jiang Xiaoning, is this the friend you were referring to?

634
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:33,229
Auntie, Brother Xu knew you were being discharged today.

635
00:37:33,229 --> 00:37:35,689
He came to pick Grandma and me up very early in the morning.

636
00:37:35,689 --> 00:37:38,110
Besides, both Grandma and you aren't in great shape,

637
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,570
I'm afraid that I can't take good care of both of you.

638
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:42,850
Xiaoning, it's very fortunate that Auntie has recovered well.

639
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:44,710
- Let's go. 
 - Aunty.

640
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,769
Let's talk about it when we get home.

641
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:48,750
Let's go.

642
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:53,950
- Here. 
 - Thank you, Brother Xu.

643
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:57,910
Careful.

644
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:07,130
Chuan!

645
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:16,650
Getting this drunk this early in the morning.

646
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:19,370
It's dawn already.

647
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:23,730
I'm so pitiful.

648
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:25,630
Karma.

649
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:27,350
I've never hurt anyone.

650
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:30,150
I've only rejected the lascivious ones.

651
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:32,449
Don't use these expressions if you don't know the meaning.

652
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:34,170
You've only been rejected.

653
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:37,449
It's different.

654
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:38,449
I love Yan Yan.

655
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:40,570
Let go of me on the count of three.

656
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:43,550
Three.

657
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:47,450
After Yan Yan left last night,

658
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,529
I don't feel sleepy at all.

659
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:51,450
I haven't slept for 48 hours.

660
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:54,010
Do you think I'll become a fool if I continue like this?

661
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:55,989
No, no. You don't need to worry.

662
00:38:55,989 --> 00:38:57,750
You're already a fool.

663
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:59,069
You're right.

664
00:38:59,069 --> 00:39:02,850
I'm just a fool who has fallen in love.

665
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:07,329
How come I'm not sleepy at all?

666
00:39:07,329 --> 00:39:09,130
I'm finally enjoying a weekend off.

667
00:39:09,131 --> 00:39:10,889
Can't you just leave me alone?

668
00:39:10,889 --> 00:39:13,530
Even you're starting to dislike me.

669
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:16,490
Maybe I should start doing some self-reflection.

670
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:19,990
But I have to bring my phone with me.

671
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:22,850
What if Yan Yan contacts me?

672
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:29,390
Hey.

673
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,520
Hey!

674
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,540
Asleep already?

675
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,340
Stop.

676
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,639
- Grandma. 
 - It's okay, I got it. 
 - Come on.

677
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:51,040
We're here!

678
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,700
- My back. 
 - Here.

679
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,680
Here.

680
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,799
This way. Slowly, Grandma.

681
00:39:57,799 --> 00:39:59,960
Be careful.

682
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,520
Jiang Xiaoning, this is not our neighborhood.

683
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,340
Auntie, this is a temporary apartment.

684
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,620
Something happened while you were in the hospital.

685
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:07,980
What happened?

686
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,820
After we settle down, I'll tell you.

687
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,960
Let's go upstairs first.

688
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,679
This kid, so mysterious.

689
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:14,039
Let's go.

690
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:16,300
Mom, walk slowly.

691
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,580
Slowly, Grandma.

692
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,740
Go get some rest first.

693
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,980
I'll let you go.

694
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,280
Slowly.

695
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,640
Jiang Xiaoning, did you rent this place?

696
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,440
 Of course, I pay the rent every month. 

697
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,140
Everything seems neat and organized.

698
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:30,060
