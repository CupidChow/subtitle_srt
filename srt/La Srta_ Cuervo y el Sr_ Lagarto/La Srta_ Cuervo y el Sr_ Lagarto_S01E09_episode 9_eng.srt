20
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:37,540
   

21
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:41,160
   

22
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:51,430
- Are you Ms. Cheng Yu? 
 - You are?

23
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,030
Hello, I'm from Chuan Design Studios.

24
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,789
My name is Jiang Xiaoning. I spoke with you on the phone earlier.

25
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,590
Please come in.

26
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,109
What new ideas do you guys have?

27
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,589
Share them with me.

28
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,311
Ms. Cheng, the thing is that we have done many drafts.

29
00:02:10,311 --> 00:02:12,889
But no matter how hard we try, we couldn't integrate that wall into the design.

30
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:14,629
If it doesn't match the overall look,

31
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:17,630
what do you think of tearing it down?

32
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,930
I've already told you many times.

33
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,730
This is my bottom line.

34
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,650
Is there a special reason for that?

35
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,589
I don't need to explain anything to you.

36
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,770
If you're asking me, I only have one word for you.

37
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,570
No.

38
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:36,310
But it's not exactly feasible to leave that wall there.

39
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,910
This is a matter of your capabilities.

40
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,909
Ms. Cheng, please have faith in us.

41
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,950
You'll be surprised with what we can do after tearing down that wall.

42
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:50,090
Ms. Cheng?

43
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:54,610
I don't want to say the same thing twice.

44
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,069
Actually, we're in quite a difficult position

45
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:00,810
because your husband has already agreed to have that wall demolished.

46
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,689
If there are any difficulties, please let us know.

47
00:03:02,689 --> 00:03:04,429
We'll try our best to solve them for you,

48
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,610
as long as we can tear down that wall.

49
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,110
What did you say?

50
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,829
My husband agreed to have that wall torn down?

51
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:13,230
Yes, my colleague told me your husband had already agreed to it.

52
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,010
How could he agree?

53
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,809
You're way out of line!

54
00:03:20,809 --> 00:03:23,709
You guys couldn't persuade me, so you went directly to my husband.

55
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,849
I really don't understand. How could he agree?

56
00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:27,670
How could he?

57
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:31,509
No one knows why I want to keep that wall better than him.

58
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,949
He actually agreed?

59
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,330
I'm sorry, Ms. Cheng. I didn't really know what had happened before.

60
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:37,149
I guess we were just hoping your husband could persuade you.

61
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,429
That's why we told him.

62
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,270
Your company spares no effort to achieve the goal.

63
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,789
I'll cancel my order. How about that?

64
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,869
I don't need you guys to do the design, okay?

65
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:46,709
I'm sorry, Ms. Cheng.

66
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,669
Please listen to me.

67
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:48,829
Get out.

68
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,309
Leave now!

69
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,210
Go! Get out. Get out!

70
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,150
- Ms... 
 - I want you to leave. Get out.

71
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,349
- Ms… Ms. Cheng. 
 - Get out.

72
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,090
Ms...

73
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,630
Ms. Cheng! Ms. Cheng!

74
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:15,109
I just asked you to talk to her. What did you do?

75
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:17,348
What was so bad that the client decided to cancel her order?

76
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:18,709
I'm sorry, Sister Manlin.

77
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:20,749
But I really didn't say anything that crossed the line.

78
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,789
So many designers had gone to speak to her before you.

79
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,629
And there were just some issues with the proposals.

80
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,990
How did you manage to get the order canceled?

81
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,549
She's a renowned artist.

82
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,630
Our loss will be huge if she cancels her order.

83
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:37,069
I was just telling her what you had told me.

84
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:40,270
But I don't know why she suddenly blew up.

85
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,230
What do you mean?

86
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,069
Are you trying to shift the blame onto me?

87
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:47,129
No, no, Sister Manlin. That's not what I meant.

88
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:52,310
Jiang Xiaoning, shirking responsibility is an issue of character.

89
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,550
You misunderstand me, Sister Manlin.

90
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,189
How about I go and explain myself?

91
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,309
You still want to go?

92
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,189
I'll rectify my mistake. I'll take make it up.

93
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,830
I'll take responsibility.

94
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,630
Take responsibility?

95
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:09,530
Okay. Then resign.

96
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,269
You bought so much protein powder.

97
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,350
How long can you keep having it?

98
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,829
I think it won't be long.

99
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,029
That's not true.

100
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,710
I always persist through anything, all right?

101
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,949
Back in university, did I complain when I had to keep you company

102
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,229
while you rushed to finish assignments and

103
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,869
I couldn't rest for a whole month?

104
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:35,229
Accompanying? You mean stay by my side only to eat fries, play games,

105
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,250
sing songs, and scroll through your phone?

106
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,469
Isn't that also accompanying?

107
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,749
Listen to all those things I did.

108
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,629
It's true that I didn't get to rest, did I?

109
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,429
Aren't you going to work out now?

110
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:47,350
I want to train my chest, abs, and biceps.

111
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:50,170
I want Yan Yan to know that men with big chest muscles

112
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:52,250
are equally attractive.

113
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,770
Hello?

114
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:10,650
I've already told you what happened over the phone.

115
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,309
The most difficult thing to handle right now

116
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,850
is the fact that Jiang Xiaoning and Ms. Cheng Yu had an argument.

117
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:18,270
Ms. Cheng not only wants to terminate the contract but also even

118
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:21,030
sue us for breaching the contract.

119
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,109
Ms. Cheng is famous in the art industry.

120
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:26,190
Anything she says will have a huge impact on us.

121
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,029
I didn't argue with Ms. Cheng.

122
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,470
You don't need to explain.

123
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,869
How would this be handled according to the company's rules?

124
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,970
According to our rules,

125
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:37,590
she must leave the company.

126
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:47,990
Jiang Xiaoning, did you argue with the client?

127
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,310
Yes.

128
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:52,250
Did the client expressly tell you she'd cancel the order?

129
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,950
Yes.

130
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:01,950
Director Gu, we can't blame everything on Jiang Xiaoning.

131
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:04,389
- She's new here after all... 
 - Other people shouldn't cut in.

132
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:08,110
This kind of matter should be decided by Director Gu.

133
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:18,190
Let's follow the company's rules then.

134
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,470
You're awake?

135
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,029
We're having a meeting yet you're sleeping.

136
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:37,090
Don't you know having a meeting is a serious matter?

137
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,110
You can leave if you don't want to be here.

138
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,109
What do you mean?

139
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:49,470
You think I'm useless?

140
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,469
I'm handling the company's affairs.

141
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,509
I can handle them, too.

142
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,630
I'm the investor.

143
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,949
I'm handling the matter according to the company's rules.

144
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,969
Since it's my company, I have the right

145
00:07:58,969 --> 00:08:01,850
to change the company's rules. Right?

146
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:04,949
You need to keep the balance of the water in the bowl. 
  (T/N: An idiom for "to treat people fairly") 

147
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,329
I'm giving you another "bowl,"

148
00:08:06,329 --> 00:08:08,029
so you don't have to bother with the only one.

149
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,549
Are you determined to talk back?

150
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,589
I just don't like that you're being so domineering.

151
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:12,909
I'm being responsible to the company.

152
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,810
This is my company.

153
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:18,049
Director Xu. Director Gu. Let's talk nicely.

154
00:08:18,049 --> 00:08:19,850
- Shut up! 
 - Shut up!

155
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:24,430
Fine, this is your company. Right?

156
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,189
Okay. You can manage it.

157
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,070
I don't care anymore.

158
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:37,650
   

159
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:46,690
Director Xu, don't let this small matter affect your relationship.

160
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:47,989
I just can't stand him.

161
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:50,609
What right does he have to fire someone? I refuse.

162
00:08:50,609 --> 00:08:52,090
You can't be wilful on this.

163
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:55,310
You know clearly whether I'm wilful all these years.

164
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:02,030
Jiang Xiaoning, I will give you another chance.

165
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:04,109
Can you resolve this matter?

166
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,789
I'll definitely do my best.

167
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,290
Great.

168
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,819
You guys heard that?

169
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,499
This is the kind of employee I want.

170
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,620
I want employees who are always striving to improve.

171
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,160
Jiang Xiaoning,

172
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,939
I'll give you one week to resolve this matter nicely.

173
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,760
If you pass this deadline, no one can help you.

174
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,780
I'll definitely try my best.

175
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,580
Okay. Meeting's over.

176
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,140
All the best.

177
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,520
 Did you argue with the client? 

178
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,040
 Yes. 

179
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,719
 Did the client expressly tell you to cancel the order? 

180
00:10:56,719 --> 00:10:58,520
 Yes. 

181
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,400
 Let's follow the company's rules then. 

182
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,480
 Boss must be so disappointed in me today. 

183
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,100
 There must be a way to persuade Ms. Cheng. 

184
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,940
I'm here.

185
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,499
You called me to do work, yet you've drunk yourself to this state.

186
00:11:55,499 --> 00:11:57,340
Why didn't you wait for me?

187
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,819
Look. I've fixed up the kitchen.

188
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,040
I fixed it up by myself.

189
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,680
I'm good, right?

190
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,800
Yeah, you're great.

191
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,140
Can you say that again?

192
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,380
What?

193
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:12,648
Say it again that I'm great.

194
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,049
You're great.

195
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:17,990
You're the best.

196
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,200
What happened?

197
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:29,000
I messed up and got scolded by my boss.

198
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,219
Which boss?

199
00:12:30,219 --> 00:12:32,459
Xu Chengran or the other one?

200
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,500
Come on!  What's wrong with these people?

201
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,459
Can't they speak nicely to people who work hard at their jobs?

202
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:38,699
Why do they have to scold you?

203
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,600
It's my fault for being useless.

204
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,379
I messed up and disappointed Boss.

205
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,620
I didn't want to mess up.

206
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,780
But I'm just not good enough.

207
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,680
Stop drinking.

208
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,200
It's all my fault.

209
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,680
It has nothing to do with them.

210
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,279
The client canceled her order.

211
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:02,019
I should receive my punishment and leave the company.

212
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:05,460
Leave the company?

213
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,219
Can you bear to leave your boss?

214
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,020
I...

215
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,180
I can't.

216
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,559
When I think about leaving the company and never seeing my boss again,

217
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:16,499
I just...

218
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,640
Okay, okay, okay.

219
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,760
Don't make it sound like it's life or death.

220
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,140
Look at you.

221
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,640
Today... Today, Director Xu protected me during the meeting.

222
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,539
If not, I would've really had to leave.

223
00:13:28,539 --> 00:13:32,119
He argued with Boss during the meeting today.

224
00:13:32,119 --> 00:13:35,319
Boss got angry, slammed the door, and left.

225
00:13:35,319 --> 00:13:39,439
That exciting? What happened in the end?

226
00:13:39,439 --> 00:13:41,900
In the end...

227
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,999
Director Xu gave me one week.

228
00:13:43,999 --> 00:13:47,760
If I can resolve the matter, he won't hold it against me.

229
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,500
Who knew Xu Chengran could be so manly.

230
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:58,580
I can't let Director Xu down.

231
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,459
I can't let Boss down.

232
00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:02,019
I can't leave the company.

233
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,900
Come on. Here. Here.

234
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:07,040
I just started getting excited and you're being down again.

235
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:15,640
I told you Director Xu is a good person.

236
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,660
He's different from those normal rich second generation.

237
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:22,220
Director Xu is a good person.

238
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,760
You're a good person.

239
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,800
Boss is even better.

240
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,840
All of you are great.

241
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,080
You guys are all great.

242
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,260
Thank you, guys.

243
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,019
Thank you, judges. Thank you, audience.

244
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:17,439
It's an honor for me to win the "Best Male Actor" award today.

245
00:15:17,439 --> 00:15:20,619
This is all thanks to my years of effort and hard work.

246
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:25,839
Of course, more importantly, it was due to the talent and good looks I was born with.

247
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,779
You're too noisy.

248
00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:31,139
Tell me!  Was my acting good?

249
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,480
Was it good?

250
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,819
Who knew if you were just acting or if you really

251
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,720
weren't happy about how I managed the company.

252
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,640
Chuan, you've got no conscience.

253
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,960
The performance at the meeting today was your idea.

254
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,399
I was just playing along. You can't wrong me like this.

255
00:15:47,963 --> 00:15:51,303
Yes, your acting was quite good.

256
00:15:51,303 --> 00:15:55,019
Come, here's a trophy for you. You can display it at home.

257
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,560
There are no outsiders now.

258
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,800
Let's talk.

259
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,420
Be honest with me.

260
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,579
When you saw Jiang Xiaoning being wronged,

261
00:16:10,579 --> 00:16:12,960
did you feel sorry for her?

262
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,719
I had never seen Jiang Xiaoning like that.

263
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,200
She's normally clowning around and cheerful.

264
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,919
The moment you left today, the tears in her eyes kept

265
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:29,160
rolling, rolling, and rolling.

266
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,980
Do you feel sorry for her?

267
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:34,020
Why would I?

268
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:38,620
Do you have special feelings for Jiang Xiaoning?

269
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:42,240
- Be honest. Yes or no. 
 - No.

270
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:47,040
It's easy to lie to me but not to yourself.

271
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,460
Let me put it this way.

272
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:54,820
Your heart is like a still lake.

273
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:59,020
There's no wind, no rain, and no turbulence.

274
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,759
Jiang Xiaoning isn't like others who are queueing up

275
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,380
waiting to be loved by you and enter your life.

276
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,980
She's like a meteorite...

277
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,239
that crashed her way in.

278
00:17:13,239 --> 00:17:15,180
The meteorite sinks to the bottom of the lake

279
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,480
and the lake regains its stillness.

280
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,099
To others, the lake looks the same,

281
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:23,518
but actually, it has been changed forever.

282
00:17:23,518 --> 00:17:26,600
That meteorite is inside of it.

283
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,740
How does that sound?

284
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,579
I've read some books on philosophy these past few days.

285
00:17:31,579 --> 00:17:33,340
Not bad. The literary sense is not bad.

286
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:36,039
Your reading didn't go to waste.

287
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:37,979
In any case, whether or not she's in your heart,

288
00:17:37,979 --> 00:17:39,819
it's not for others to say.

289
00:17:39,819 --> 00:17:43,380
You're the one who needs to acknowledge her and accept her.

290
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,999
I understand your concerns.

291
00:17:44,999 --> 00:17:50,020
I know your physical condition, so I won't give you any suggestions.

292
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:53,600
I just want to say, no matter what choice you make,

293
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,520
just don't regret it.

294
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,180
I initially planned to crash at your place tonight.

295
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:06,939
But it looks like you need some space and some time to reflect on yourself.

296
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,300
 Scared? 

297
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,060
 A little. 

298
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,379
 Boss, I'll protect you. 

299
00:18:19,379 --> 00:18:22,299
 Boss! Boss! 

300
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:39,239
 Wang Kai, send me Ms. Cheng's address and contact details. 

301
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,339
Xiaoning, it's late. Why aren't you asleep?

302
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:04,860
Grandma, why are you up?

303
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:09,800
Your auntie is snoring. I can't sleep.

304
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,100
Why are you crying?

305
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,319
I'm not. The weather's too hot.

306
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:17,679
I'm sweating.

307
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,060
Do you think I'm stupid?

308
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:23,380
Come on, tell me what happened?

309
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,980
Nothing.

310
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,120
Everything's fine.

311
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,499
Kid, you're just as stubborn as your father.

312
00:19:31,499 --> 00:19:34,099
You carry all the burdens on your shoulders.

313
00:19:34,099 --> 00:19:35,659
That won't do.

314
00:19:35,659 --> 00:19:38,359
If you have any problems, don't keep them to yourself.

315
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,139
It's bad for your health.

316
00:19:40,139 --> 00:19:43,620
Tell me! What happened?

317
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,039
Just something from work.

318
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:50,040
I... made a mistake.

319
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,799
You're talking nonsense again.

320
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,820
You don't have a job.

321
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,799
Aren't you a student?

322
00:19:55,799 --> 00:20:01,340
Did you get a question wrong and your teacher gave you a low score?

323
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:06,160
I got a question wrong which I shouldn't have.

324
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,080
That's nothing.

325
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,979
Tomorrow, Grandma will give you some money.

326
00:20:10,979 --> 00:20:14,020
Go buy an eraser to erase the mistake.

327
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:17,599
In the future, don't make such mistakes again.

328
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:21,380
Your teacher will like you then.

329
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,160
Okay.

330
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,399
Grandma, why are your hands so cold?

331
00:20:26,399 --> 00:20:28,920
Did you catch a cold?

332
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,240
Wait for me.

333
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,160
Here, drink this.

334
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,780
It's warm. You'll feel better after some sleep.

335
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,120
I won't drink it. I won't.

336
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,239
It's sweet, not bitter at all.

337
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:54,480
Let me blow on it for you.

338
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,140
Come on, be good.

339
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:08,720
Xiaoning, is your dad almost back from his business trip?

340
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,079
I should go to sleep.

341
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:13,699
I still need to go to the bus terminal to pick him up tomorrow.

342
00:21:13,699 --> 00:21:16,320
You should go to sleep early, too.

343
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,300
My granddaughter is so pretty.

344
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:27,060
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too.

345
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,220
Go rest.

346
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,060
 What's up? 

347
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,700
Hello? I'm in trouble. You have to help me.

348
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,379
 You want money, right? 

349
00:21:57,379 --> 00:21:58,759
I'm a little tight on cash recently.

350
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,579
You can't just leave me in the lurch.

351
00:22:00,579 --> 00:22:02,139
 I just gave you some. 

352
00:22:02,139 --> 00:22:06,130
 Besides, I told you that the previous time would be the last time. 

353
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,040
You insist on getting things nasty, huh?

354
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,080
 Whatever. 

355
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,939
I'm telling you, don't mess with me.

356
00:22:13,939 --> 00:22:19,020
When I'm desperate, Xu Guoxiang is going to hear from me.

357
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,240
Hello? Hello?

358
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:45,520
Ms. Cheng, I'm here to apologize.

359
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,059
I've already canceled the order. You don't need to come.

360
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:51,619
But... But... But... Ms. Cheng, I truly want to apologize to you.

361
00:22:51,619 --> 00:22:52,959
I made you so angry last time.

362
00:22:52,959 --> 00:22:55,439
It must be something I said that upset you.

363
00:22:55,439 --> 00:22:56,420
I'm sorry.

364
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,999
I'm not angry.

365
00:22:57,999 --> 00:23:00,780
Please leave and don't come here again.

366
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,540
Ms. Cheng! Ms. Cheng!

367
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,080
Your way of resolving matters is to apologize only?

368
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,020
I don't know what else I can do.

369
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,999
You normally have quite a lot of creative ideas, don't you?

370
00:23:29,999 --> 00:23:31,559
It's my first time encountering such a problem.

371
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:33,940
I don't know what to do.

372
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:37,599
I'm sorry. You must be very disappointed in me.

373
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,780
I... never had much hope for you in the first place.

374
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,720
So I'm not disappointed.

375
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,699
I happened to pass by here and saw you carrying all that stuff,

376
00:23:49,699 --> 00:23:53,260
so I came to see what exactly you intended to do.

377
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,480
Remember my words.

378
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,299
Just apologizing won't solve anything.

379
00:23:59,299 --> 00:24:01,559
Go back and think about it.

380
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:04,620
Designers need to persuade people with their designs,

381
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:07,220
not these things.

382
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,599
I'm sorry. I won't let you down.

383
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,440
 Was I too harsh? 

384
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:01,020
 Will she be able to take it? 

385
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,039
I thought Director Gu would come to her rescue yesterday.

386
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,899
He was so nice to Jiang Xiaoning normally,

387
00:25:09,899 --> 00:25:12,239
yet when it came down to it, he did nothing.

388
00:25:12,239 --> 00:25:13,579
It seemed like she won the lottery,

389
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:14,959
but it ended up being nothing at all.

390
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,399
Jiang Xiaoning is really unlucky.

391
00:25:16,399 --> 00:25:18,399
I heard this project is exceptionally difficult to handle.

392
00:25:18,399 --> 00:25:20,979
It's normal that a newcomer like her fail to make it.

393
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:24,319
But I was quite surprised by Director Xu's actions yesterday.

394
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,440
Is it that his taste has changed?

395
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,579
Nothing is impossible.

396
00:25:28,579 --> 00:25:31,599
If you put it that way, does it mean there's hope for me too?

397
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:33,500
There's no hope for you.

398
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,159
Didn't you say nothing is impossible?

399
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,739
That doesn't apply to you.

400
00:25:36,739 --> 00:25:38,839
You already belong to someone.

401
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:42,080
How come I don't know that?

402
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,479
Look over here, here.

403
00:25:43,479 --> 00:25:45,500
If you can't see clearly, come closer.

404
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,120
There you go again.

405
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,119
It's no use coming any closer.

406
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,099
If I could see it, I would've done it already.

407
00:25:51,099 --> 00:25:55,020
You don't have to be so snobby.

408
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,379
At the very least, I'm the Administrative Deputy Director of this company.

409
00:25:58,379 --> 00:26:01,380
You're all directors, but why is the disparity so huge?

410
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,680
Can't we have someone more handsome?

411
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,199
Am I not handsome? Am… Am I not handsome?

412
00:26:04,199 --> 00:26:05,819
- Morning! 
 - Morning!

413
00:26:05,819 --> 00:26:07,120
Everyone, have some Meco.

414
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,740
Thank you, Xiaoning.

415
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:12,140
Why are you so happy all of a sudden?

416
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:15,739
- What happened yesterday... 
 - Jia Jia, Cherry Berry, your favorite.

417
00:26:15,739 --> 00:26:18,920
- I'll open it for you. 
 - Okay, okay, okay.

418
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,739
As to what happened yesterday,

419
00:26:20,739 --> 00:26:23,920
there are still a lot of things I need to learn from everyone.

420
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:27,659
No problem. We will guide you patiently.

421
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:29,359
I won't be shy then.

422
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:31,800
- You should drink, too. 
 - I…

423
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,440
Sister Manlin...

424
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,340
I want yours.

425
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,720
Your favorite, Berry and Grapefruit.

426
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,520
Thank you.

427
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,679
Jiang Xiaoning, I wasn't picking on you yesterday.

428
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,279
- After all... 
 -  I understand.

429
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,500
I don't blame you at all.

430
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,940
It was my fault for not handling it well.

431
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,820
Since Director Xu is willing to give you a chance, then try your best.

432
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,300
If you need my help, let me know.

433
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,339
Thank you, Sister Manlin. I will ask you if I need any help.

434
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,259
 Hurry, look at this. What a big bouquet of flowers. 

435
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:09,280
 Look at that! 

436
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,400
   

437
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,040
 He's so handsome. If my boyfriend was this handsome and bought me such a big bouquet, 

438
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,060
 I'd be so happy. 

439
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,040
What are you doing?

440
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,940
Yan Yan, do you like it?

441
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,239
It's a little heavy, but I can help you carry it.

442
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,319
Hurry, leave. Don't embarrass me here.

443
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:34,119
If you don't like it, I'll have to kneel before you.

444
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:36,500
You'll regret it if you do.

445
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,979
Don't camp out here before and after work.

446
00:27:38,979 --> 00:27:40,519
I'll be even more annoyed if you do this.

447
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,640
I really do have a reason for coming today.

448
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:48,119
Jiang Xiaoning's notebook. Help me give it back to her.

449
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:51,919
You can give it to her boss, your good friend. Isn't that more appropriate?

450
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,900
If I do that, I'll miss a chance to see you.

451
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,520
Careful!

452
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,100
Are you okay?

453
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,319
Not bad, Xu Chengran.

454
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,020
You even hire side actors now.

455
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,080
Remember to get a side camera next time to record it.

456
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,320
No coffee?

457
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,520
Love you!

458
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,959
 Let's go take a photo. 

459
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,720
 Okay. 

460
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,819
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

461
00:28:43,819 --> 00:28:46,079
Can we take a picture?

462
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,680
Sure.

463
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:51,140
Can you move a little to the side?

464
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,400
I'll give it to you.

465
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,500
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

466
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,500
   
   

467
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,060
Boss.

468
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,959
Why are you here?

469
00:29:30,959 --> 00:29:32,879
You asked me to come up with a solution.

470
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,760
I came here to take a look.

471
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,700
You...

472
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:40,059
This is the company's project. Of course, I need to get involved.

473
00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:41,620
Have you come up with a solution?

474
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,700
I had a chat with the company's designer

475
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,660
and have found a breakthrough.

476
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:48,459
So, I was thinking of having a chat with Ms. Cheng's husband.

477
00:29:48,459 --> 00:29:49,760
Why?

478
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,519
I had a chat with Qiao Mengjia as well.

479
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,839
She told me that last time, she spoke to her husband,

480
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,119
he actually agreed to have the wall torn down

481
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:56,460
and said that this was for Ms. Cheng's own good.

482
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,199
But this was denied by Ms. Cheng.

483
00:29:58,199 --> 00:30:00,939
I believe that there must be a story behind this wall.

484
00:30:00,939 --> 00:30:04,840
It's just that this couple is unwilling to bring it up.

485
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:08,240
Do you think looking for him would solve the problem?

486
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,580
I'm not sure, but at least it's a way forward.

487
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,780
So that's why I need to take a good look at this wall

488
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:18,980
to find a breakthrough and convince Ms. Cheng.

489
00:30:19,934 --> 00:30:21,734
Try your best then.

490
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,999
Boss, where's your car?

491
00:31:05,999 --> 00:31:07,619
I took a taxi.

492
00:31:07,619 --> 00:31:09,680
Taxi?

493
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,040
Let me call a taxi for you then.

494
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,860
Do you have a signal on your phone?

495
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,359
There's no signal.

496
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:24,879
Oh, no. How do we call a taxi now?

497
00:31:24,879 --> 00:31:26,690
How did you come?

498
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,810
I rode this here.

499
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:36,829
Slow down.

500
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,730
Boss, don't worry.

501
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,130
I'm a steady rider.

502
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:45,910
If your seat isn't stable, you can hold onto me.

503
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:52,490
Do you hate me for agreeing to fire you?

504
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:54,110
What did you say?

505
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:58,190
I said "Do you hate me?"

506
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:01,510
That scared me.

507
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:04,150
Boss, what did you say just now?

508
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,190
Boss?

509
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:08,090
Boss! Boss!

510
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:15,430
 I said, "Do you hate me?" 

511
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:17,610
 That scared me. 

512
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:19,149
 Boss, what did you say? 

513
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:20,409
 Boss! 

514
00:32:20,409 --> 00:32:23,010
 Boss! Boss. 

515
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:25,230
Boss.

516
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:28,990
Boss.

517
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:31,810
Are you okay, Boss?

518
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:35,530
Boss, are you okay?

519
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:41,389
Boss, I didn't do it on purpose.

520
00:32:41,389 --> 00:32:42,669
Are you okay?

521
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,529
That was considered murder.

522
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:46,170
I didn't.

523
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:48,929
I was talking to you and didn't see the bump.

524
00:32:48,929 --> 00:32:51,189
I didn't hear what you were saying.

525
00:32:51,189 --> 00:32:53,470
What were you saying?

526
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:56,469
I asked you whether you hated me.

527
00:32:56,469 --> 00:32:58,410
No, not at all.

528
00:32:58,410 --> 00:32:59,749
Who would believe you?

529
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,370
You were taking revenge just now.

530
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:03,330
Boss, I'm not lying to you.

531
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:04,770
And I don't hate you at all.

532
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:06,410
- Really? 
 - Really.

533
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:07,890
 You were obviously taking revenge. 

534
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:10,590
 I… I'm not lying to you. 

535
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:13,089
 Boss, get on the bike. We still have a long way to go. 

536
00:33:13,089 --> 00:33:15,349
 Get on the bike? And fall again? 

537
00:33:15,349 --> 00:33:17,050
 But isn't it tiring for you to walk down? 

538
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:18,229
 I'd love to. 

539
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,550
 Then I'll walk with you. 

540
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:34,429
Miss Jiang, here you go.

541
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,730
Thank you.

542
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:41,290
Actually, Director Gu had already spoken to me immediately after the incident.

543
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:42,749
I understand your difficulty.

544
00:33:42,749 --> 00:33:45,729
After all, there is a split between me and my wife.

545
00:33:45,729 --> 00:33:49,930
Mr. Mu, I'd like to know why Ms. Cheng

546
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:53,709
is so insistent on keeping that wall while you agree to tear it down.

547
00:33:53,709 --> 00:33:56,130
Is there a story behind this?

548
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:01,390
Actually, there's nothing that can't be said.

549
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:04,410
I remember when that place wasn't an art district yet,

550
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:07,809
my wife often brought my son there to play.

551
00:34:07,809 --> 00:34:10,910
That wall has a lot of fond memories on it.

552
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:17,549
However, my son died from drowning

553
00:34:17,549 --> 00:34:19,870
when he was five.

554
00:34:20,669 --> 00:34:23,110
All these years,

555
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:26,770
my wife has always been in pain

556
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:29,050
and still can't come out of the pain.

557
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:33,590
So, Ms. Cheng built the art gallery

558
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:36,610
to commemorate your son.

559
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,830
- Director Gu. 
 - Come in.

560
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:48,429
This is an order we just finished. Please sign here.

561
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:50,130
Sure.

562
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,919
Director Xu and you are fine now?

563
00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:57,839
We're fine.

564
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,799
So actually, you guys planned this.

565
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:03,500
Yes.

566
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:11,040
You guys could put on a show in front of the employees, but why hide it from me?

567
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,180
You would have guessed it anyway

568
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,520
even if we didn't tell you such trivial stuff.

569
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,580
But you guys doing this makes me feel like

570
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,900
I'm an outsider.

571
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,600
You think too much.

572
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:31,300
Your attitude towards Jiang Xiaoning is very different.

573
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,200
Is that so?

574
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,800
You allow her to go to your house.

575
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,539
You gave her a hairpin.

576
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,780
I've been by your side for six years.

577
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:43,640
I've never seen you treat an employee like this.

578
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,320
This isn't your usual style.

579
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,579
Throwing such a difficult project to someone

580
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:53,740
who isn't even a qualified architectural assistant to handle

581
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:56,880
isn't your usual style either.

582
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,980
That's because she's hardworking and has potential.

583
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:05,240
I wanted to give her a chance.

584
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:09,679
I didn't let her leave also because I wanted to give her another chance.

585
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:16,300
Maybe I was too strict with her.

586
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,439
It's good to be strict with the company's business.

587
00:36:18,439 --> 00:36:20,059
But if the situation is special...

588
00:36:20,059 --> 00:36:23,260
Is the situation special or the person?

589
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:35,520
Su Manlin, you don't need to interfere with my personal affairs.

590
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,300
I know clearly about my own affairs.

591
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,920
I'm sorry.

592
00:36:47,051 --> 00:36:48,911
I'll leave you to your work.

593
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,280
I understand.

594
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:10,060
I can also understand why Ms. Cheng wants to keep that wall.

595
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:15,700
Actually, letting go isn't achieved by not looking,

596
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:19,980
not listening, and not thinking.

597
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:24,460
Ten years ago, my parents passed away in a car accident.

598
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,820
I was also in the car at that time.

599
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:32,719
From that moment on, nightmares of the accident have always haunted me.

600
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:36,860
I even tried to hide all of my parents' things.

601
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:40,660
I thought I could forget if I didn't see them.

602
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:44,080
But strangely, the more you want to forget,

603
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,640
the more clearly you'll remember.

604
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:51,760
Eventually, my grandma and auntie took out all of their items,

605
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,859
which was just like they had never left us.

606
00:37:54,859 --> 00:37:58,900
Every Spring Festival, we leave a set of cutlery for them.

607
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:02,639
My grandma also tells me funny stories about my parents from the past.

608
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:04,840
Heartwarming stories also.

609
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:08,460
I'm getting more used to accepting

610
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:11,260
the fact that they are gone.

611
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:16,120
That day, when I went to look at the wall,

612
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:19,339
there were many lines drawn with crayons on the wall.

613
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,580
Just like a rainbow.

614
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:25,139
And cute little footprints and fingerprints.

615
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:28,580
Those must have been left behind by your child, right?

616
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:34,000
Maybe Ms. Cheng is doing this to try to save herself.

617
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,920
Once the art gallery is constructed,

618
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,920
that place must be the place she'll visit the most often.

619
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,839
Every time she goes there, she can reminisce every single moment she had with her child.

620
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:48,540
Isn't that a form of healing as well?

621
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:53,800
At least, no matter if it's my parents or your child,

622
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,360
they have been in this world once

623
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:59,300
and they left behind beautiful memories.

624
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:02,780
They should be remembered by us.

625
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:07,080
If we don't even dare to keep memories or to touch them,

626
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,860
that would be the most regretful thing.

627
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,680
I was too brash previously.

628
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,860
I sincerely apologize to you and Ms. Cheng.

629
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:22,260
Whether we will get to design the wall in the end,

630
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:27,280
I earnestly request you to keep that wall which is filled with memories

631
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,880
because it deserves to be there.

632
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:47,560


633
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,399
♫  Destiny is a little annoying  ♫

634
00:39:50,399 --> 00:39:53,240
♫  Takes those I care about  ♫

635
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,980
♫  Away from me  ♫

636

♫  If memory is bright  ♫

637
00:39:58,839 --> 00:40:01,860
♫  It would hold up a lamp in my heart  ♫

638
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:06,260
♫  And light up the night  ♫

639
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,939
♫  Sunshine alternates with moonlight  ♫

640
00:40:26,939 --> 00:40:29,919
♫  Returning to life in time  ♫

641
00:40:29,919 --> 00:40:33,360
♫  Gift me with a dream  ♫

642
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:38,000
♫  A dream with you in it  ♫

643
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,839
♫  The one who caught me off guard  ♫

644
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:12,180
♫  Steps foot into my life...  ♫

645
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:19,720
♫  It's you...  ♫

646
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:24,040
♫  If it weren't for parting  ♫

647
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:29,240

648
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:36,820
♫  It's you...  ♫

649
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,859
♫  Exchanging sunshine for moonlight  ♫

650
00:41:39,859 --> 00:41:42,939
♫  Exchanging fortune for the past  ♫

651
00:41:42,939 --> 00:41:47,700
♫  Exchanging my heartbeat for you  ♫
