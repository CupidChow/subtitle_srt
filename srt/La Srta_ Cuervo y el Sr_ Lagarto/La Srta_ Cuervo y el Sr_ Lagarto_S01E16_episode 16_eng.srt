2
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:18,749
♫  I can't help but feel a little happy  ♫

3
00:00:18,749 --> 00:00:23,579
♫  I can't help but feel a little nervous  ♫

4
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:25,819
♫  The earth is turning because of you  ♫

5
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,219
♫  Without you, the earth stops  ♫

6
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:34,230
♫  You are the rainbow that fills up the black and white  ♫

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,699
♫  I was once obsessed with the legend of the four-leaf clover  ♫

8
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:44,609
♫  I dreamed of a white-horse carriage and 
you becoming my prince  ♫

9
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,599
♫  Your gaze is too seducing, please save me  ♫

10
00:00:48,599 --> 00:00:53,399
♫  I'm turning into a moth, flying towards the fire  ♫

11
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,919
♫  Your smile is dancing on your lips  ♫

12
00:00:57,919 --> 00:01:02,579
♫  Am I the happiness you're looking for?  ♫

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:07,319
♫  The doe inside me is lost  ♫

♫  Holding your hand, let's count down to happiness  ♫

15
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:19,599
♫  I can't help but be a little fragile  ♫

16
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:24,219
♫  I can't help but feel a little gloomy  ♫

17
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:26,519
♫  The sky is bright because of you  ♫

18
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,940
♫  Without you, the sky is grey  ♫

19
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:33,549
♫  You are the angel who takes away all loneliness  ♫

20
00:01:33,549 --> 00:01:37,000
   

21
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,050
   

22
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,940
Boss, what's wrong?

23
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,940
It's nothing.

24
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,959
It's getting late. I should go home now.

25
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,320
Okay, you can go home first.

26
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,559
Stay safe.

27
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,999
Tell me when you got home.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,500
Okay.

29
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:35,220
♫  My eyes are tearing up  ♫

30
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,730
♫  I have so much to tell  ♫

31
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,879
 Is this the end? 

32
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,200
♫  The secrets will remain untold  ♫

33
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,619
♫  Make it last forever  ♫

34
00:02:49,619 --> 00:02:52,919
 In order to finish every task on the list, 

35
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:55,859
 I kept working in the most efficient way. 

36
00:02:55,859 --> 00:02:59,599
 We took one project after another. 

37
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,320
 I believe that leaving with glory 

38
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,440
 is better than living aimlessly in this world. 

39
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,379
 This is the right way to bid farewell to this world. 

40
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:19,119
 Everyone sees me as a workaholic. 

41
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,460
 But only I know 

42
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,599
 that I am just finishing 

43
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,740
 my grand farewell performance. 

44
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:32,140
 The Jin An Award is the last stop of this tour. 

45
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:37,600
♫  The belief when we made our promise  ♫

46
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:45,650
♫  I was so in love with the silhouette  ♫

47
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:51,260
♫  We'll meet again if there is no farewell  ♫

48
00:03:51,260 --> 00:04:01,950
♫  I'll stay here, waiting for you  ♫

49
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,319
 This is the dearest VVIP tenant. 

50
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,170
 Mr. Ice Cream. 

51
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:39,000
♫  We're all alone on the street  ♫

52
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:45,270
♫  The silent youth  ♫

53
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:50,240
♫  Tomorrow will have the answer  ♫

54
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,300
♫  The case will be full of memories  ♫

55
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:01,760
♫  The meaning will withstand the passage of time  ♫

56
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:06,440
♫  The lively boy passes by in the car  ♫

57
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:12,760
♫  The belief when we made our promise  ♫

58
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,780
 The last resting place for a person 

59
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,599
 is their return to nothingness. 

60
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,720
 Ashes to ashes. 

61
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,820
 Does that mean I've completed everything? 

62
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:37,280
♫  I'll stay here, waiting for you  ♫

63
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,039
Qi Hong, you're resourceful.

64
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:43,479
- How should we celebrate it? 
 - He's right.

65
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,420
- How do we celebrate it? 
 - The atmosphere...

66
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,439
What is it?  What happened?

67
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:49,739
What happened? How can you not know about it?

68
00:05:49,739 --> 00:05:51,300
What is it?

69
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,439
Director Gu has won the Jin An Award.

70
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,939
He received the notice this morning.

71
00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:56,180
It made waves in the office!

72
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,559
- Really? 
 - Of course.

73
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,579
This is great!

74
00:05:58,579 --> 00:05:59,579
How should we celebrate this?

75
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:01,280
Jiang Xiaoning.

76
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,399
Where is Director Gu?

77
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,059
He texted me and told me not to pick him up.

78
00:06:06,059 --> 00:06:07,900
He's out on business.

79
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,080
What are you doing? Having a party?

80
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,219
- Director Xu. 
   - Director Xu.  

81
00:06:13,219 --> 00:06:15,400
Director Gu has won the Jin An Award.

82
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:20,220
I said Director Gu has won the Jin An Award.

83
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,180
Where are you now?

84
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,359
Outside. What is it?

85
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:34,320
 Do you know about the award? 

86
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,340
I know.

87
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,899
 Send me your location. I'll go to you. 

88
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,799
I'll be at the office soon.

89
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,000
Wait for me there.

90
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,480
Mr. Gu! Excuse me.

91
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,580
The one you had your eye on has been sold.

92
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,600
It's been sold?

93
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,260
I'll take a look at another one then.

94
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:12,100
As for the design...

95
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,360
The design doesn't matter now.

96
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,220
Mr. Gu, no offense,

97
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:22,760
but you seem very different from last time.

98
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,560
- Do I? 
 - Yes.

99
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,399
Last time, you seemed determined and persistent.

100
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:31,439
I thought we could strike a deal for sure.

101
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,159
Although I sell tombs, I think the fewer cemeteries sold, the better.

102
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,019
After all, if you can live, no one would choose to die.

103
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:40,760
Isn't that right?

104
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,220
 Stop thinking about disappearing. 

105
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:48,839
 Just like my parents. They were never gone. 

106
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:51,040
 They will always be here. 

107
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,399
 I once saw the light in your eyes. 

108
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,839
 It's a happiness that I wish would never disappear. 

109
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,660
 I don't want to lose that light. 

110
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:05,400
Mr. Gu, do you still want to have a look at another one?

111
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,279
I'll reconsider it. Thank you.

112
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,480
Please do reconsider it.

113
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,038
Sir, there is a traffic jam ahead.

114
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:35,140
What about making a left turn and taking another route?

115
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,559
Sure, go ahead.

116
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,519
 I made a detour, 

117
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,460
 but I didn't waste time. 

118
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,519
 Even if I had to pay more than others, 

119
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,419
 but I believe as long as I keep moving forward, 

120
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:05,800
 I will reach my goal. 

121
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:11,160
 Is there perhaps another way to go 

122
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,320
 in life as well? 

123
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,659
Congratulations, Boss! Congratulations!

124
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,480
The youngest architectural designer in this industry

125
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,680
to win the Jin An Award.

126
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:54,319
Director Gu, from now on, the Chuan Studio has reached a whole new level.

127
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,359
Congratulations, Director Gu!

128
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,740
 Great! 

129
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,220
Thank you, everyone.

130
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,240
You should just get back to work.

131
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,980
 What's wrong with him? 

132
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,919
All right.

133
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,399
You know very well what kind of a person he is.

134
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,340
He is a stiff man who doesn't know how to have fun.

135
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,320
Moreover, he has won so many awards.

136
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,719
Winning the Jin An Award is no big deal.

137
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,540
Indeed.

138
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,600
Is something bothering Director Gu?

139
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,600
He... He is always like this.

140
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,559
You know him better than anyone.

141
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,659
Stop standing there. Get back to your work.

142
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,179
Okay! Let's go.

143
00:10:43,179 --> 00:10:45,600
Let's go.

144
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,140
Director Xu, do you need me to work today?

145
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,959
That was the plan.

146
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,740
But we're celebrating Gu Chuan's success,

147
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,480
so it's better to leave the work aside for now.

148
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,999
Okay. I'll carry on with my script.

149
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,700
Okay.

150
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,640
It's such a pity that my beautiful eyes

151
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,560
can never see through your heart.

152
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,240
It's such a pity

153
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,580
that my heart is an impregnable fortress.

154
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,820
No one can see through it.

155
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,520
Sorry.

156
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,660
What is it?

157
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,000
What?

158
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,800
You've won the Jin An Award.

159
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,560
What is your next plan?

160
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,320
After winning the Jin An Award,

161
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,340
I will continue my plan.

162
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,159
Chuan, do you know this adage?

163
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,380
Plans always fall behind changes.

164
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,920
What changes?

165
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:58,400
Over the years, I noticed that you've been changing.

166
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:04,279
So as your dearest brother and as a friend who loves you

167
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,860
and you love the most,

168
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:11,480
I must remind you that it's time to change your unreliable plan.

169
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,560
Even if I changed the plan,

170
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,120
the outcome would stay the same.

171
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,500
It's going to happen sooner or later.

172
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,540
The more time you have, the better your chance is.

173
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:32,140
Moreover, even if you don't care about yourself,

174
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:35,180
at least be considerate of those around you.

175
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:39,880
Are you going to leave me and your parents behind?

176
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,439
Or are you going to leave the Chuan Studio and those

177
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,480
who fought by your side behind?

178
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,980
What about Jiang Xiaoning?

179
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,620
She is still young.

180
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:53,760
She has neither a degree nor a family of her own.

181
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,879
You act like a father figure all the time.

182
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,840
Are you going to leave her and let her go?

183
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,240
Just think about it.

184
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,279
Why are you still here?

185
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,879
I was waiting to drive you home.

186
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,460
Don't bother. I'm busy.

187
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,280
Let me drive you there.

188
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,320
Boss, are you feeling unhappy because you've won enough awards?

189
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,159
Or is there something else that is even more upsetting?

190
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,620
You've been pulling on a long face the whole day.

191
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,620
Have I?

192
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,220
You should look at yourself in the mirror.

193
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,460
You're wearing a worried frown.

194
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,599
Boss, are you sure you don't need a ride?

195
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,640
Yes, I've called a taxi. You should go home.

196
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,060
What about tomorrow morning?

197
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,059
- Wait for my notice. 
 - Okay.

198
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,650
Boss, I don't know why you're upset,

199
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:36,720
but I must tell you this. Congratulations.

200
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,759
No matter what happened, achieving a dream is never a bad thing. Right?

201
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,360
What if achieving a dream is a bad thing?

202
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,260
Why would it be a bad thing?

203
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,480
Because you would no longer have a goal.

204
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,119
That's simple.

205
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,520
Just set another goal for yourself.

206
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,700
Take me for an example. My dream is to go skiing.

207
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,999
And my dream has come true.

208
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,620
I also want to graduate and get my certificate.

209
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:11,300
I also want to become an outstanding architectural designer like you.

210
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,799
Boss, when it concerns a dream, you can go with a greater goal.

211
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,600
If it takes you some time to figure it out,

212
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,440
I wouldn't mind spending some of my time and energy to provide you

213
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,960
with some reasonable advice for your reference.

214
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,439
I look forward to your advice.

215
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,220
Sure.

216
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,359
No problem, Boss. I'll keep it in mind.

217
00:16:38,359 --> 00:16:40,999
Sir, I'll leave him to you. Drive safely.

218
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,380
Boss, see you tomorrow.

219
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,520
Stay safe.

220
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,639
  Son, shouldn't you be in bed now? 

221
00:17:06,639 --> 00:17:09,180
I couldn't sleep.

222
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:13,000
 What could be so exciting that it keeps my son awake at night? 

223
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,539
I've won an award. I've won the Jin An Award.

224
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,400
 Really? 

225
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,139
Gu! Come here!  Your son has won an award!

226
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:21,679
- What is it? 
 - Hurry!

227
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:22,820
What did he win this time?

228
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:25,080
 The Jin An Award. 

229
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,620
Really?

230
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,259
If he had won such a prestigious award, wouldn't he put a smile on his face?

231
00:17:36,259 --> 00:17:38,000
 Are you sure? 

232
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,320
 Don't be silly. 

233
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,439
When did he ever lie to us with such a serious matter?

234
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,559
Then he just doesn't want to see me.

235
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,020
You two carry on.

236
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,700
Father.

237
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,839
Come here.

238
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,400
He asked for you.

239
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,120
 Father, I am telling you this great news 

240
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,840
 because I'm very happy. 

241
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,880
 I just found it hard to smile for the camera. 

242
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,180
Then don't smile.

243
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:08,460
I remember when you went on stage for the awards when you were little,

244
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,519
I never saw you smile either.

245
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,659
Are you serious? It's different.

246
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:15,079
It's an international award!

247
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,080
 Gu, what's got into you? 

248
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,159
 Xiao Chuan, 

249
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,919
 you don't need all the success and glory. 

250
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,119
 Don't be so tense all the time. It's bad for your mental health. 

251
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,999
 Not to mention you've won so many awards at a young age. 

252
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,039
 Your career is taking off. 

253
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,720
 You should be content. 

254
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,000
I am.

255
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,219
Father. Mother.

256
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,740
You must be very disappointed in me.

257
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,980
Nonsense.

258
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:47,060
As your parents, we are both very proud of you.

259
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:51,800
 After so many years, I never listened to your advice. 

260
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,860
 I didn't get married or become a father. 

261
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,700
I don't even live with you.

262
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,960
My son.

263
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,079
When it comes to your life, there are no set rules

264
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,719
that you must abide by.

265
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,799
 But as Chinese parents, we do have a standard to follow. 

266
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:22,399
 Which is to avoid causing our children any trouble when they grow up. 

267
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,839
Xiao Chuan, remember this.

268
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,279
As long as you are well, your mother and I

269
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,679
will always be happy and proud of you.

270
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,580
We'll be content.

271
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,600
Thanks, Father.

272
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,640
My sight is getting blurred.

273
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,780
Xiao Chuan, what's wrong?

274
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,180
 It's nothing, Mother. 

275
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:13,280
I just... I miss you.

276
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,020
We miss you, too.

277
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,860
Give yourself a break when you have time.

278
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,060
Get some rest.

279
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,660
 I'll take a long break someday. 

280
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,439
You should get some rest, too.

281
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,460
Take care.

282
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,760
Don't stay up too late.

283
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,799
Chuan, are you ready yet?

284
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,620
They are about to start.

285
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,340
Not bad.

286
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,259
What do you think, Jiang Xiaoning? Do I have good taste?

287
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,660
Jiang Xiaoning.

288
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,759
So handsome.

289
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,159
Of course. I picked it for him.

290
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,580
You're really handsome.

291
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,980
All right. Wipe your drool.

292
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,680
Let's go.

293
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,770
   

294
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,159
I never thought that so many architectural designers would be here.

295
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,540
I must record this.

296
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:38,300
I might not have another chance to see so many designers this life.

297
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,259
Boss, who are the most renowned designers here today?

298
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,519
Over there. We have William from the UK.

299
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:53,960
Team Sky from Austria. Liu Liming.

300
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:58,760
And from the U.S., the team of Richard Barn Architecture.

301
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,240
There are also Gu Chuan and his assistant.

302
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,119
 I hereby announce the Sixth Jin An Awarding Ceremony 

303
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,850
 officially begins! 

304
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:38,590
   

305
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,799
First of all, please turn your attention to the screen.

306
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,600
Look!

307
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,719
Look at the crowd.

308
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,840
There are so many foreigners. Right?

309
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,120
So ignorant.

310
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,840
There are so many real estate tycoons.

311
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,159
 The damage caused by melting glaciers is enormous. 

312
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:06,160
 With global warming, the rising sea level, and melting glaciers 

313
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:11,519
 have destroyed the natural habitat of animals like polar bears. 

314
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,260
 They are facing starvation. 

315
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,250
   

316
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:23,260
Ladies and gentlemen, the theme of our ceremony for this year is

317
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,839
"Protect it, It's Our Home."

318
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,479
"Save the Earth."

319
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,160
"Protect the Environment."

320
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,900
That's Director Xu! Director Xu!

321
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:38,959
Look, he is so handsome.

322
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,239
Have some water.

323
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,580
 Our awarding ceremony will officially begin. 

324
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:48,159
First of all, we'll start with the Lifetime Achievement Award.

325
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,620
 Let's welcome our award winner, 

326
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,719
    
 Ginobili Weir!

327
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,800
 Let's welcome him! 

328
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,359
 Congratulations. 

329
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,160
 Thank you. 

330
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:26,039
I'm delighted to receive this award.

331
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,599
I wish to thank everyone who made it possible.

332
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,200
Thank you.

333
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,060
 Another round of applause for him. 

334
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:44,279
The next award is the most important award of tonight,

335
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,359
the Jin An Designing Award.

336
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:53,239
Let's welcome our presenter, the CEO of the Jin An Award Foundation,

337
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,359
Mr. James May, to present the award.

338
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,960
Let's welcome him.

339
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,540
Good evening, everyone.

340
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:05,119
Gold Coasts Award is committed to honoring and encouraging

341
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,799
some of the world's most elite young design talents.

342
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,620
This award ceremony has been running for six years now,

343
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:14,519
and in that time we've honored

344
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,599
some of the most exciting design works

345
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,140
and designers from amongst the designing community.

346
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,780
Tonight, it is my greatest honor

347
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:29,239
to award the biggest award to Mr. Gu Chuan!

348
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,400
From Chuan Design Studio!

349
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,500
Boss, go get it.

350
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,140
Congratulations.

351
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,360
Stop filming. It's a formal occasion.

352
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,960
Just applaud first.

353
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,400
Thank you.

354
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,460
Well? Do I have a good taste in men?

355
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,439
Director Xu, don't be so full of yourself.

356
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,840
Don't say it out loud.

357
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,440
   

358
00:27:55,550 --> 00:28:03,520
♫  Walk across this empty space and take a chance  ♫

359
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,160
Hi! My name is Gu Chuan.

360
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,560
I hope that designers from China

361
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,000
can do more than just showing some so-called

362
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,440
eye-catching uniqueness of China.

363
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,900
Do not be content with superficial symbols.

364
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:25,140
I hope they can present the wisdom and the thoughts

365
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:28,679
that come from our rich culture.

366
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,340
Over the decades,

367
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:34,100
designers from China have been learning from the West.

368
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,319
They are using architectures from the West as a reference

369
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,280
to plan the construction and the buildings of our cities.

370
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,860
We are learning the design concept of the West,

371
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,799
 but these buildings have a far greater reputation in China 

372
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,140
 than they are in foreign lands. 

373
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:52,039
 We have entered a new phase. 

374
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,540
 People will begin to consider one thing. 

375
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:58,159
 That is how this modernization can be linked to the culture, 

376
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:01,980
 the history, and our lifestyle that we're living right now? 

377
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:06,399
China is a country with a rich and fascinating history.

378
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:11,060
History has great value in modern days.

379
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,700
In the process of learning from history,

380
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,740
great creativity will be inspired.

381
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:18,740
This will have an impact on the whole world.

382
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,620
When we're talking about a design from China,

383
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:25,140
I hope that everyone will not just talk about its geographical meanings,

384
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,960
but try to ponder its cultural meanings.

385
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:32,900
Because it has so much wisdom of the past in it.

386
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,439
The designs from China will continue to push forward

387
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,700
creativity in cultural and social spheres.

388
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,959
Our buildings will slowly shift away from materialistic

389
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,639
and modular design.

390
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:47,380
In the future, new praxis and new cultural needs

391
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:50,520
will promote more variations in architecture design.

392
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,320
Thank you.

393
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,439
 Great! 

394
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,679
 Impressive! 

395
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,160
That was amazing!

396
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,079
What an inspiring speech!

397
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,420
Now that you have won the greatest award tonight,

398
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,919
it can be said that you've won the Grand Slam.

399
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,960
Could you tell us do you have any future plans

400
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,820
that you'd like to share with us?

401
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,600
My future plans?

402
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,140
I don't have one yet.

403
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,980
I've been waiting

404
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:43,120
for a piece of advice about my future plan.

405
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:04,399
 Thank you, Mr. Gu Chuan, for your wonderful speech. 

406
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,460
Congratulations again!

407
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,120
Give him a like.

408
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,159
Great.

409
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,959
Give him a like. Did you notice?

410
00:31:25,959 --> 00:31:27,970
When Director Gu was giving the speech,

411
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:31,340
he was looking at Jiang Xiaoning!

412
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:35,800
Why would he look at her when talking about his future plans?

413
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,840
Could it be...

414
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,959
Cut it out!

415
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,800
Are you a choir?

416
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,960
No. Don't be ridiculous. Please.

417
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,119
Boss just wants to give his assistant some motivation.

418
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,660
Isn't that normal?

419
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,100
How is this not normal?

420
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:58,659
Wait. You people, do you know what this is?

421
00:31:58,659 --> 00:32:00,079
It's called a legacy.

422
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,599
It's his hope for the future! For the younger generation!

423
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:03,799
The younger generation!

424
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,039
Is that so?

425
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,400
You, Sister Manlin, and Mr. Cheng are still young, too.

426
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,959
Why aren't they...

427
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,619
Jia Jia, Su Manlin and Mr. Cheng are already very outstanding.

428
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:17,200
Brother Kai, you got so serious.

429
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:24,160
I've never got an award anyway.

430
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,640
Thank you.

431
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:40,540
Director Gu, your speech was so inspiring.

432
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:43,580
We've been clapping for you down there.

433
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:47,280
Chuan, you were amazing.

434
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,399
Let's go. Let's go to the after-party.

435
00:32:49,399 --> 00:32:52,320
I've asked the colleagues to go there first.

436
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,320
Go on without me.

437
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,480
What's wrong with him?

438
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,279
Don't worry. Leave him be.

439
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,500
Let's go over and wait for them.

440
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,659
Boss, I don't know where they are having the after-party.

441
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:15,559
I'll ask Director Xu.

442
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,220
We're not going there.

443
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,240
Where are we going then?

444
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,420
Somewhere quiet.

445
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,270
Right.

446
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:14,479
Is he here yet?

447
00:34:14,479 --> 00:34:16,399
- No. 
 - Call him again.

448
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,160
Okay.

449
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:43,960
Boss, do you like this place?

450
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,160
It's not bad.

451
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,800
It's quiet.

452
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,239
This is a good place to think.

453
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,360
It's also a great place...

454
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,320
 to confess my love. 

455
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,460
A great place of what?

456
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,420
Nothing.

457
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:14,639
 Jiang Xiaoning, aren't you always brave? 

458
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:17,399
 The timing and this place. 

459
00:35:17,399 --> 00:35:19,199
 Isn't this the perfect chance? 

460
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:21,679
 Why are you being a coward right now? 

461
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:25,379
 Aren't you going to pursue your love? 

462
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,720
Boss.

463
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,240
In your future plans,

464
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:43,280
can I have a place in it?

465
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,340
Because...

466
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,500
I like you.

467
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,599
I know I'm a little impulsive.

468
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:03,419
But I've thought a lot about our relationship.

469
00:36:03,419 --> 00:36:06,079
I don't deserve you with my current qualifications,

470
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,719
but whether as a friend or an employee, I've always admired you.

471
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,659
I studied hard and worked hard to become a better person

472
00:36:12,659 --> 00:36:15,460
only to narrow the gap between us.

473
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:19,100
Seeing you every day becomes my only motivation.

474
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,479
I don't know what I should do.

475
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,180
I don't think I'm thinking straight now.

476
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,800
I mean...

477
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,740
You like me?

478
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,399
I'm not going to force you to give me an answer.

479
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,179
I just got a little impulsive.

480
00:36:41,179 --> 00:36:43,800
I can't think straight.

481
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,079
You don't have to answer me.

482
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:50,559
I'm thinking about many things. I'm in a dilemma. So...

483
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:52,620
Jiang Xiaoning,

484
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,700
just focus on your work for now.

485
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:58,560
There are some things I haven't worked out yet.

486
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,720
I'll talk to you after I've thought them through.

487
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:05,640
After you joined our company,

488
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,500
I've seen your efforts.

489
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:12,260
I can see what you've done great.

490
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:25,500
It's not about work.

491
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,840
It's getting late.

492
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,640
Go home.

493
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,849
♫  Destiny is a little annoying  ♫

494
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:34,779
♫  It takes those I care about  ♫

495
00:37:34,779 --> 00:37:38,500
♫  Away from me  ♫

496
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,400
♫  If memory is bright  ♫

497
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,239
♫  It would hold up a lamp in my heart  ♫

498
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,579
♫  And light up the night  ♫

499
00:37:46,579 --> 00:37:50,360
I'll do my best, Boss.

500
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:11,730
♫  The destined one  ♫

501
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:16,000
♫  Guide me forward  ♫

502
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:24,620
♫  Who is it?  ♫

503
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:28,760
♫  We are total strangers meeting for the first time  ♫

504
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:33,100
♫  Why does my heart beat so fiercely?  ♫

505
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:42,300
♫  Who is it?  ♫

506
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,340
You're back?

507
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,939
Don't lean on me! It is hot!

508
00:39:14,939 --> 00:39:16,900
I just want to hug you.

509
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:20,219
What's wrong? Tired from work?

510
00:39:20,219 --> 00:39:22,800
It's not the job.

511
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,700
However, I think I've done something stupid.

512
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,020
No way.

513
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:32,240
You're the smartest girl. Right? You little smarty.

514
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,960
You're the most reliable girl.

515
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,419
It's just a mistake.

516
00:39:35,419 --> 00:39:38,040
Just forget it and start over.

517
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,479
Not everything can be redone.

518
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,879
I was too reckless.

519
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,279
I was unreasonable.

520
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,799
I took it the wrong way. It's all my fault.

521
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,879
Listen to my advice.

522
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,960
What about getting another job?

523
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,619
I know your boss is treating you well.

524
00:39:54,619 --> 00:39:56,279
But look at what you've become.

525
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,940
This job is much more tiring than those part-time jobs.

526
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,020
You were never this tired.

527
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,679
I can't quit. Unless Boss fires me.

528
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:07,899
I want to become an architectural designer. I can't quit.

529
00:40:07,899 --> 00:40:11,240
So this is why you're staying in that company?

530
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:14,360
It used to be the reason.

531
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,360
But not anymore.

532
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,179
Auntie, I'll go take a shower.

533
00:40:21,179 --> 00:40:23,579
Don't worry. I have to work tomorrow. Rest well.

534
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:26,079
You are always so stubborn. Only telling the good news.

535
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,119
Refuse to tell me your worries and only tell me the good news.

536
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:33,159
That's because I can handle it. I'll go take a shower.

537
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:34,759
Let me know if you need anything.

538
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,460
Okay.

539
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,719
 Jiang Xiaoning, 

540
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:01,460
 may all your wishes come true. 

541
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,819
 Jiang Xiaoning, 

542
00:41:02,819 --> 00:41:06,820
 may all your wishes come true. 

543
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:26,479
 Jiang Xiaoning,  

544
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,500
 you either work hard or get lost. 

545
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,479
 Jiang Xiaoning,  

546
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,780
 you either work hard or get lost. 

547
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:38,039
 You must be Mr. Gu. Do you need a designated driver? 

548
00:41:38,039 --> 00:41:40,359
 You can keep it if you like it. That's the last one. 

549
00:41:40,359 --> 00:41:42,499
 Director Gu, mind the speed bump. 

550
00:41:42,499 --> 00:41:43,719
 Director Gu, this is for you. 

551
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,559
 May you be happy and healthy. 

552
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,559
 I like my boss. I like the company, too. 

553
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:50,780
 I will do my best. 

554
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,380
 Because... I like you. 

555
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:07,539
 If someone has been living in the dark for almost ten years, 

556
00:42:07,539 --> 00:42:11,820
 for him, it would be normal to despair. 

557
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,499
 He won't be afraid. 

558
00:42:13,499 --> 00:42:16,100
 He won't worry about gains and losses. 

559
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,780
 But when he gets to see the light again, 

560
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:22,919
 he won't be able to live without the light. 

561
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:26,160
 So, Jiang Xiaoning, 

562
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,780
 it's not that I won't listen to you. 

563
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:32,300
 It's just that I don't have the courage to listen to you.  

564
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:36,399
 Because I am a man who can't even live a normal life. 

565
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:49,040


566
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:59,429

567
