1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,430


2
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:18,809
♫  I can't help but feel a little happy  ♫

3
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:23,409
♫  I can't help but feel a little nervous  ♫

4
00:00:23,409 --> 00:00:25,989
♫  The earth is turning because of you  ♫

5
00:00:25,989 --> 00:00:28,309
♫  Without you, the earth stops  ♫

6
00:00:28,309 --> 00:00:34,290
♫  You are the rainbow that fills up the black and white  ♫

7
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:39,789
♫  I was once obsessed with the legend of the four-leaf clover  ♫

8
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:44,569
♫  I dreamed of a white-horse carriage and 
 you becoming my prince  ♫

9
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:48,629
♫  Your gaze is too seducing, please save me  ♫

10
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:53,270
♫  I'm turning into a moth, flying towards the fire  ♫

11
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:57,990
♫  Your smile is dancing on your lips  ♫

12
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:02,629
♫  Am I the happiness you're looking for?  ♫

13
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:07,250
♫  The doe inside me is lost  ♫

14
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:13,580
♫  Holding your hand, let's count down to happiness  ♫

15
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,650
♫  I can't help but be a little fragile  ♫

16
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,210
♫  I can't help but feel a little gloomy  ♫

17
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,550
♫  The sky is bright because of you  ♫

18
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,769
♫  Without you, the sky is grey  ♫

19
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:33,329
♫  You are the angel who takes away all loneliness  ♫

20
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:37,010
   

21
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:41,010
   

22
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,349
- Sister Yan Yan. 
 - Is this okay?

23
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,470
Let me see.

24
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,170
Is this okay?

25
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:55,229
In your career, you need to have a hint of sexiness.

26
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,029
But at the same time, you need to look innocent and cute.

27
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,429
I think this is nice.

28
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,790
Really?

29
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,710
By the way,

30
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,530
this is a better match.

31
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:09,419
Don't you think that this is too expensive and formal?

32
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,549
I went there yesterday.

33
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:13,250
All of them were wearing casuals.

34
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:19,850
The first rule in a workplace: "Never lose on your first day at work."

35
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,350
That makes sense.

36
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,189
But I'd better give this bag back to you.

37
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,790
Take it back.

38
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,469
Sister Yan Yan, I'm going to be late.

39
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,469
I have to leave now.

40
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:33,150
Look. My canvas bag is quite nice, too.

41
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,550
Jiang Xiaoning!

42
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,610
What time is it now?

43
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,950
As an assistant, how can you be here later than the boss?

44
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,149
I'm sorry, Director Wang.

45
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,329
Something happened on my way here.

46
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:56,730
These are gifts for everyone.

47
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,869
Well... Okay.

48
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,109
Well...

49
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,389
It's okay. It's fine.

50
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,309
Let me tell you.

51
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,209
The work culture in our company is free, relaxed, and casual.

52
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:11,350
Look at what you are wearing.

53
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,429
Your clothes are too formal.

54
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,989
I was thinking that I can't lose on my first working day.

55
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,990
So...

56
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,990
That's the spirit.

57
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,749
Okay now. Go and find Director Gu.

58
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,990
Where is he?

59
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:36,130
I can still make it even if I go and pick up your parents first.

60
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:37,469
After all, they know me.

61
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,310
It's more comfortable for them.

62
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,129
I never thought that they would contact you straight away.

63
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:42,589
Sorry for the trouble.

64
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,989
Not at all.

65
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,049
They are no longer young.

66
00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:47,890
They need someone familiar to take care of them.

67
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,190
Come in.

68
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,109
Why are you here?

69
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,069
Hello, Director Su.

70
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,269
I asked her to come.

71
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:59,590
From today on, Jiang Xiaoning will be my driver plus assistant.

72
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:02,609
- But yesterday didn't you say that— 
 - Go back to your work.

73
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,269
Congratulations, Jiang Xiaoning.

74
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,349
From now on, do your best.

75
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,629
Thank you, Director Su.

76
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,189
You can call me Sister Manlin.

77
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,530
Okay, Sister Manlin.

78
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,410
I'll get going first.

79
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,670
Mr. Gu.

80
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,289
No. Boss.

81
00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:25,649
Just call me Director Gu, just like the others.

82
00:04:25,649 --> 00:04:27,510
Okay, Director Gu.

83
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,309
Didn't you turn me down yesterday?

84
00:04:29,309 --> 00:04:30,309
Why did you...

85
00:04:30,309 --> 00:04:32,429
If you are not willing to be here, it's not too late to leave.

86
00:04:32,429 --> 00:04:33,749
I'm super willing to work here.

87
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,990
What do I need to do then?

88
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,789
You are my assistant nominally.

89
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:42,269
But stay out of any of my personal matters.

90
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,490
You just need to drive me around.

91
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,149
For the rest of the time, just stay in the company.

92
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,310
As for what you want to learn,

93
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,629
you can do that as long as you don't affect others' work.

94
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,230
Okay, Director Gu.

95
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,789
Come with me to organize some files first.

96
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,069
Then, we'll go to the resort for a meeting.

97
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,790
Okay.

98
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,149
   

99
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,589
Director  Gu, here's a speed bump.

100
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,290
Be careful.

101
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,990
Director Gu, where's your car?

102
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,390
That one.

103
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,990
Get in.

104
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,510
Press it.

105
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,949
Director Gu, let's go.

106
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,550
Okay.

107
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,970
Why is it so quiet?

108
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,330
Director  Gu, the car is broken.

109
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,789
This is an electric car.

110
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,010
You just need to change the gear.

111
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,750
Okay, Director Gu.

112
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:45,429
Drive carefully. Look forward.

113
00:06:45,429 --> 00:06:47,450
It is a red light now, Director Gu.

114
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,309
I'm not trying to spy on you.

115
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:51,189
I just want to learn.

116
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:54,430
I've never come into contact with such a high-level project before.

117
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:56,949
How about this?

118
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,570
Join us for the meeting later.

119
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,549
Really?

120
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,189
Just keep quiet.

121
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,190
Thank you, Director Gu.

122
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,370
Su Manlin is here.

123
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,509
Hello, Uncle and Auntie.

124
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,450
Hello.

125
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:13,529
Come, Auntie. Leave this to me.

126
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:15,469
Thank you. Sorry for troubling you every time.

127
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:16,949
You are very welcome.

128
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,149
Director Gu has a very important meeting today.

129
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,669
He really can't make it.

130
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:22,890
So, he asked me to pick you up.

131
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,609
Is that true?

132
00:07:24,609 --> 00:07:26,509
Don't need to care whether it's true or not.

133
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:29,089
No need to take it seriously.

134
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:30,609
He didn't even answer your call.

135
00:07:30,609 --> 00:07:31,929
Do you really think that he'll come here to pick you up?

136
00:07:31,929 --> 00:07:35,109
Uncle, I'll really have to speak up for Director Gu.

137
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:37,050
He especially asked me to pick you up

138
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:40,750
and personally booked the hotel for you.

139
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,710
See? I know that my son cares about us.

140
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,010
Soon, he'll have more time after he signs the contract.

141
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,469
Come, Uncle and Auntie. Let's go.

142
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:48,750
Let's go.

143
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,629
Hello, we are from Chuan Studios.

144
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,949
Please wait for a moment while I check.

145
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,450
Thank you.

146
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:02,110
Director Gu, do I need to do anything later?

147
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,149
Just listen.

148
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,750
I'm listening.

149
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,750
What?

150
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,190
Didn't you ask me to listen?

151
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:14,690
- I'm asking you to listen and don't talk. 
 - Okay.

152
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:17,150
Hello, Sir. Please go to Meeting Room One.

153
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,389
Okay. Thank you.

154
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,370
Thank you.

155
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:23,429
   

156
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,109
Female designated driver?

157
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:29,790
Director Gu, is she from your company, too?

158
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,730
I remember now.

159
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,469
We've met before.

160
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,129
How did you get in during the day?

161
00:08:35,129 --> 00:08:36,589
We don't need a designated driver here.

162
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:37,789
Get out.

163
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:38,859
She is my assistant.

164
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,069
Today is her first day of work.

165
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,829
First day of work?

166
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,470
Is this a coincidence

167
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,369
or did you plan this?

168
00:08:45,369 --> 00:08:48,009
First, you are a designated driver. And suddenly, you are an employee.

169
00:08:48,009 --> 00:08:49,509
You are indeed from a designing company.

170
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:51,310
What a great plan.

171
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,929
Director He, this is really not the case. I can explain it to you.

172
00:08:53,929 --> 00:08:57,510
Even if you are his assistant and I believe that,

173
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:01,010
tell me why she said that she is a designated driver on that day.

174
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:04,469
Did you plan that on purpose to set me up?

175
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,150
Director Gu,

176
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:10,330
is this how your company shows your sincerity to collaborate with us?

177
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:11,629
I was a designated driver that day.

178
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,129
I just started working today.

179
00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:14,389
You made a contribution on that night.

180
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:17,410
That's why you are working for him now.

181
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:19,869
They say that Chuan Studios is very professional.

182
00:09:19,869 --> 00:09:24,630
Now, even a designated driver can become the personal assistant of the chief architect.

183
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,209
This is so ridiculous.

184
00:09:26,209 --> 00:09:28,551
Looks like we can't trust you with this project.

185
00:09:28,551 --> 00:09:30,791
Director Gu, how about I wait for you in the car?

186
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,689
No. You have to do the meeting minutes for me.

187
00:09:32,689 --> 00:09:35,049
Even a designated driver can do the meeting minutes now?

188
00:09:35,049 --> 00:09:37,270
And you said that this is not a trick?

189
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,210
He Sheng!

190
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,830
Director Qin.

191
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,950
Hello, Gu Chuan.

192
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,149
Finally, we meet.

193
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:46,389
Hello, Director Qin.

194
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,389
Come. Let's start the meeting.

195
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,070
Okay. After you.

196
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,149
    
 Let's get started.

197
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,909
I look forward to your design.

198
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:01,050
Me too.

199
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,589
Director Qin, I talked to Director Gu just now

200
00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:06,889
and found out that Director Gu's assistant was a designated driver.

201
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:08,609
It's her first day of work today.

202
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:11,809
So, I think that such a comprehensive company like his

203
00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:15,290
will definitely be able to present us with extraordinary proposals.

204
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:17,029
You are right, Director He.

205
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,730
We are indeed a comprehensive company.

206
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:23,749
Our studio welcomes anyone with a will to chase after their dreams.

207
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:27,750
As long as they have a good personality, we'll accept them.

208
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:31,950
Director Qin, I believe that you've chosen our proposal

209
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:35,270
because you've already done some research on our studio.

210
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:38,329
I believe that besides our designs,

211
00:10:38,329 --> 00:10:41,570
you are satisfied with our working attitude as well.

212
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,109
Of course.

213
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,770
Business is business.

214
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:48,190
I've indeed seen your work before.

215
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,289
I've also asked around about your company's reputation.

216
00:10:50,289 --> 00:10:52,389
Your reputation is as good as your designs.

217
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:54,910
I really admire your company.

218
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:58,589
So, when Director He presented me with proposals from other companies,

219
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:02,110
I gave a priority to your proposal first.

220
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,110
Thank you for your trust.

221
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:11,470
Now, let me explain to you the overall idea of our proposal.

222
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:16,610
Our design is based on container hotels that are rare in China.

223
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:19,349
When we talk about containers, what will come to your mind first?

224
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:23,170
Color, shape, or its uses.

225
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:26,210
We'll put the containers one by one on the mountain.

226
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:28,989
With the condition of total privacy, the guests can enjoy

227
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:32,950
a 360-degree view of different scenery.

228
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:35,549
This is a mountain that is away from the city.

229
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,909
If this hotel can become a landmark at that place,

230
00:11:38,909 --> 00:11:42,110
I'm sure you know how beneficial it will be.

231
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,830
Let's take a look at the design.

232
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,650
♫  If the youth is precious, then cheers  ♫

233
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:52,330
♫  Those passionate dreams follow my command  ♫

234
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,029
 I get to attend such an important meeting 

235
00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:56,129
 with Director Gu on my first day of work 

236
00:11:56,129 --> 00:11:58,669
 and get the chance to see such an amazing design. 

237
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:01,969
 Jiang Xiaoning, you finally have a change of luck. 

238
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,829
   

239
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,170
I chose the right boss.

240
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:09,229
You were awesome just now, Director Gu. I was stunned.

241
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,789
Did you do the meeting minutes?

242
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:11,749
Yes.

243
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,489
Director Gu, there are things that I don't understand.

244
00:12:13,489 --> 00:12:15,449
Can you explain them to me? I want to sort it out.

245
00:12:15,449 --> 00:12:18,550
I don't have time to explain them to you.

246
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:21,830
By the way, when did you offend He Sheng?

247
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,509
When you went drinking last time.

248
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,529
Sister Manlin was drunk and she went to the toilet.

249
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:27,790
- Then... 
 - Get to the point.

250
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,689
The point is, Director He tried to take advantage of Sister Manlin.

251
00:12:31,689 --> 00:12:34,430
But I managed to stop him.

252
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:39,109
He won't take revenge on us because of this and kick us out from this competition, right?

253
00:12:39,109 --> 00:12:41,230
You are overthinking this.

254
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:45,429
Director Gu, you talked so much in the meeting just now.

255
00:12:45,429 --> 00:12:47,670
You must be thirsty. How about a bottle of water?

256
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,490
Whatever.

257
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:57,350
Wait for me.

258
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,889
Hurry up. Director Gu is busy.

259
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,089
Don't waste his time.

260
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,550
Hurry up.

261
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,729
You are still here.

262
00:13:14,729 --> 00:13:15,930
Director He.

263
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,750
Why are you so nervous?

264
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,529
I'm not. Please give me back my phone.

265
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:21,350
Thank you.

266
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,630
What exactly are you trying to do?

267
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:31,269
You have always been their employee, right?

268
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:33,869
You did it on purpose to trick me, right?

269
00:13:33,869 --> 00:13:35,649
No. That's not true.

270
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:39,809
I am a newbie. I don't know what I did to offend you.

271
00:13:39,809 --> 00:13:41,910
You better be truthful with me.

272
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:45,509
I have a say in the approval of your proposal.

273
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:47,949
Director He, our company's proposal is really good.

274
00:13:47,949 --> 00:13:49,389
So what if it's good?

275
00:13:49,389 --> 00:13:52,669
I can totally turn it into something bad.

276
00:13:52,669 --> 00:13:53,909
How can you do that?

277
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,529
This is not about me. This is about you.

278
00:13:56,529 --> 00:14:00,729
This project is a huge gold mine. We are all enjoying the same profit.

279
00:14:00,729 --> 00:14:04,969
You are full now, but I'm still hungry.

280
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,749
I don't understand what you are talking about.

281
00:14:06,749 --> 00:14:09,089
If I personally offended you, I apologize.

282
00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:11,850
Don't let it affect this project.

283
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:16,689
Director He, don't be mad. Drink some water.

284
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,790
Do you want to eat anything? My treat.

285
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,330
Two nights ago, you ruined my plan.

286
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:26,430
Since you want to be responsible for it, sure.

287
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:29,339
I don't care if you are a designated driver or Gu Chuan's assistant.

288
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:33,780
If you make me happy, I'll help you.

289
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:36,999
Director He, how can I make you happy?

290
00:14:36,999 --> 00:14:39,640
You are so innocent?

291
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,729
I really don't know what you are talking about.

292
00:14:41,729 --> 00:14:43,909
Director Gu is waiting for me in the car. I have to leave now.

293
00:14:43,909 --> 00:14:46,250
Are you looking down on me?

294
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,749
- You! 
 - Director He!

295
00:14:50,749 --> 00:14:52,890
What are you trying to do?

296
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:56,450
Director Gu, it's good that you are here.

297
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:57,949
You saw it, right?

298
00:14:57,949 --> 00:15:01,229
Your female assistant sprayed water on me. You should ask her instead.

299
00:15:01,229 --> 00:15:02,929
That's not true. Director He wanted to...

300
00:15:02,929 --> 00:15:04,829
What did I want? Are you going to say that I wanted to rape you?

301
00:15:04,829 --> 00:15:06,429
- Just now, you said that... 
 - What did I say?

302
00:15:06,429 --> 00:15:08,849
Do you think I'll fancy you, a female assistant?

303
00:15:08,849 --> 00:15:10,149
No need to say anything.

304
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,709
Jiang Xiaoning, call the police.

305
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:13,909
There's a CCTV here.

306
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:17,549
No matter whose fault it is, we'll find out after we check the CCTV.

307
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:19,950
He took away my phone.

308
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,789
Calm down.

309
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:39,790
Director Gu, don't do this.

310
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:42,050
I'm just talking about the designated driver

311
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:43,870
and design matter with your assistant.

312
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:46,810
If you want to talk about the design, come to me.

313
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,909
No need to find my female employee.

314
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:52,209
- Okay. I understand. 
 - Apologize.

315
00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:53,910
I'm sorry, Director Gu.

316
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,990
Not to me.

317
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:58,690
Apologize to my female assistant.

318
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:06,370
I'm sorry, Assistant Jiang.

319
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:07,589
Forget it, Director Gu.

320
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,069
It's not a big deal. Forget it.

321
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:11,410
- What kind of attitude is this? 
 - No.

322
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:13,029
Director Gu, don't make this into a big deal.

323
00:16:13,029 --> 00:16:14,870
Forget it.

324
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,590
Fine.

325
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:24,870
If this happens again, I'll see you at the police station.

326
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,630
Is there a CCTV here?

327
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,590
Great.

328
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:47,610
Gu Chuan!

329
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,500
Give me the car key.

330
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,760
I'll drive.

331
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,659
Boss, drive slowly. Don't exceed the speed limit.

332
00:17:36,659 --> 00:17:39,220
I always thought that you hired me as a driver

333
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:42,160
because you can't drive.

334
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,360
I just don't drive often.

335
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,839
Why didn't you shout for help just now?

336
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:55,360
I was in shock just now.

337
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,060
When you see him after this, shout for help.

338
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,120
Call me immediately.

339
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,359
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Gu.

340
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:04,119
Boss, don't be mad.

341
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:05,800
I'll remember what you said.

342
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,839
If I meet someone like him again, I'll call you immediately

343
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,180
and shout for help.

344
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,240
- Boss. 
 - What is it?

345
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,140
I have something to tell you.

346
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:27,359
It took me a long time to finally find my dream job.

347
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,820
And I even have a great boss like you.

348
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,779
When I was listening to your proposal today, I was so excited.

349
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,879
You started to glow.

350
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:39,160
And I thought that meeting you was the beginning of my good luck.

351
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,639
If I work in this kind of company, I'll get closer and closer to my goal.

352
00:18:42,639 --> 00:18:45,380
This is where my dream begins.

353
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:49,980
But what if our proposal is rejected because of He Sheng?

354
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,339
All of you had put so much effort into it.

355
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,960
I don't want it to be ruined because of me.

356
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,980
Are you saying that you are worried about

357
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,040
destroying the company all by yourself?

358
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,360
You are really overthinking this.

359
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,740
I kept thinking about it on my way back.

360
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:11,959
This is my first day of work and I had brought so much trouble to you.

361
00:19:11,959 --> 00:19:13,759
I'm afraid that you'll fire me.

362
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:17,640
It's not easy for me to find a job that I like.

363
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,719
Actually, I've been very unlucky since I was a child.

364
00:19:20,719 --> 00:19:22,639
A lot of things are not my fault.

365
00:19:22,639 --> 00:19:25,319
But everyone blames me for it. And I got used to it.

366
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:27,340
- But— 
 - Are you done?

367
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,599
Yes.

368
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,920
When I'm excited, I start to blabber.

369
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,780
If you are done, go back and rest now.

370
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,720
Director Gu, wait!

371
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,379
Wait for a moment.

372
00:19:38,379 --> 00:19:40,320
Just a moment.

373
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,660
Director Gu, this is for you.

374
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,080
What is this?

375
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,380
A present.

376
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:11,000
Don't open it until you are home.

377
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,199
Director Gu, may you be healthy and happy.

378
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:20,879
Bye, Director Gu. Director Gu, you are my idol.

379
00:20:20,879 --> 00:20:23,380
- Are you done? 
 - Yes.

380
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,060
- Are you really done? 
 - Yes.

381
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,719
Bye, Director Gu. Bye, Director Gu.

382
00:20:27,719 --> 00:20:28,840
Director Gu, you are the coolest!

383
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,460
You are my Idol Boss!

384
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:03,699
 When I was listening to your proposal today, I was so excited. 

385
00:21:03,699 --> 00:21:06,300
 You started to glow. 

386
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:21,080
♫  Walk across an empty space and take a chance  ♫

387
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:28,950
♫  Is this the place you want to be  ♫

388
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:33,820
♫   to change within  ♫

389
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,520
♫   within  ♫

390
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,779
Indeed good-looking.

391
00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:43,259
So good-looking. One word: handsome.

392
00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:44,220
Truly handsome.

393
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:48,580
♫  Can't wait where we could start again  ♫

394
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:52,960
♫  Cause I got the feeling  ♫

395
00:21:55,320 --> 00:22:01,320
♫  I got the feeling  ♫

396
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:08,160
♫  No one is in the building  ♫

397
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:14,158
♫  Bathing in the afterglow, two perfect worlds  ♫ 
  Charging. 

398
00:22:14,158 --> 00:22:20,880
♫  Cause I got the feeling  ♫

399
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,520
♫  I got the feeling  ♫

400
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,480
 Don't apologize to me. 

401
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,320
 Apologize to my female assistant. 

402
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:41,820
   
 Only one word. 

403
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:46,260
   
 Handsome, handsome, handsome. 

404
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,559
   
 Only one word 

405
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,039
   
 Handsome, handsome, handsome. 

406
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,200
   
 What's going on, lovesick? 

407
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,239
That was rude.

408
00:23:42,239 --> 00:23:45,480
Run so fast. Afraid that I would catch up with you?

409
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,359
What's wrong, hottie?

410
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:56,299
A dozen beers are ready.

411
00:23:56,299 --> 00:24:00,019
What's the rush, hottie? Go to my place. Kill the Satyr.

412
00:24:00,019 --> 00:24:03,079
There will be drinks and alcohol. And me.

413
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,740
   

414
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,400
Director Gu, good morning.

415
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,360
Good morning.

416
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,919
Sister Manlin said you prefer light food.

417
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,959
So I made oatmeal for you.

418
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:39,340
My cooking skills are just average.

419
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,940
But you must have some.

420
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,320
This breakfast is made for my idol.

421
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,320
If you don't eat it, it will hurt your fan's feelings.

422
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:48,559
Don't call me idol anymore, or you'll be fired.

423
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:49,720
I'll remember this.

424
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,079
But you must have breakfast.

425
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,300
Skipping breakfast is bad for your health.

426
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,620
Okay, let's go.

427
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,500
You already had breakfast?

428
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,960
You asked Jiang Xiaoning to make it?

429
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,999
Anyway, do you know that Nika is having a design exhibition here?

430
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,719
I don't know if you like him or not.

431
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,080
I kind of like him.

432
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,639
When I was abroad, Xu Chengran and I went to see his exhibition before.

433
00:25:37,639 --> 00:25:39,519
He'll be there today.

434
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:41,600
Director Xu gave me two tickets.

435
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,499
Do you want to go with me?

436
00:25:43,499 --> 00:25:46,200
Okay. Bring along Jiang Xiaoning.

437
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,220
She wants to learn.

438
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,720
But we've only got two tickets.

439
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,699
No worries.

440
00:25:53,699 --> 00:25:57,700
I'll ask Xu Chengran for another ticket. It won't be troublesome.

441
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,820
Okay, I'll see you after work.

442
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,520
Okay.

443
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,379
   
 Regarding the order, would you like to have another talk about it?  

444
00:26:15,379 --> 00:26:18,140
   
 You can come to my place. 

445
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,700
Rubbish.

446
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,380
   

447
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,160
Manager Wei.

448
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,939
Zhao Yan, I've spoken with Director Ouyang over the phone.

449
00:26:32,939 --> 00:26:34,659
Regarding the order matters, we can work together.

450
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:37,260
You can set a time and make an appointment, talk about the details.

451
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,780
Get it done as soon as possible, okay?

452
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,560
Okay.

453
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,860
Oh, right.

454
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:47,719
This evening, after work, there will be a gathering.

455
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,680
Let's have dinner and some drinks.

456
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:53,020
We'll sing some songs, etc. You should join us.

457
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:57,979
I'm tired from working overtime these two days. So, perhaps next time?

458
00:26:57,979 --> 00:27:00,759
Everyone is tired. That's why we need to relax.

459
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:03,399
Look at you. You don't have to shut people out.

460
00:27:03,399 --> 00:27:05,560
It's really inappropriate.

461
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:09,239
Oh, this! I need to send it over to the customer. So, I have to finish it by today.

462
00:27:09,239 --> 00:27:10,820
I can't go.

463
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,439
Zhao Yan, please.

464
00:27:12,439 --> 00:27:13,599
Yes.

465
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,900
Zhao Yan, just go.

466
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,679
How about this? You guys go ahead today.

467
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,220
Next round on me?

468
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,859
It's for our department. I'm making money.

469
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,139
Okay.

470
00:27:24,139 --> 00:27:26,799
Get your job done.

471
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,900
Don't work too hard.

472
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,500
Good for you.

473
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,760
Come, let's go.

474
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,180
Rubbish.

475
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,520
All are rubbish.

476
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,419
Is this really for me?

477
00:27:46,419 --> 00:27:48,800
It's for you. Don't you like to learn?

478
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,620
This is a good opportunity.

479
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,319
I've never been to an exhibition.

480
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,719
I've only seen it on the internet. Never seen this before.

481
00:27:54,719 --> 00:27:56,819
I'm so happy. Thank you.

482
00:27:56,819 --> 00:27:58,499
That was easy for you to find happiness.

483
00:27:58,499 --> 00:28:00,419
We've got great employee welfare in this company.

484
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:04,559
You're a fairy down from heaven, overcoming poverty. And I ran head-on into you.

485
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,979
I'll see you after work then. Director Gu will be joining us, too.

486
00:28:06,979 --> 00:28:08,800
Okay.

487
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,839
Sister Manlin, I need to answer the call.

488
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,500
Okay.

489
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,180
Hello.

490
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,240
 Are you Jiang Xiaoning? 

491
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,519
 Please come to the hospital. 

492
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,580
 Someone in your family is hospitalized. 

493
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,900
Why are you stunned? Get ready with the drinks.

494
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,660
The customer will arrive soon.

495
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,939
Sister Manlin, I'd like to take leave later.

496
00:28:31,939 --> 00:28:33,620
I'm okay with an unpaid leave today.

497
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,959
What's the matter? Something urgent happened?

498
00:28:35,959 --> 00:28:37,840
Something happened at home.

499
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,060
It's okay, you can go.

500
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:41,519
I'll inform Qi Hong. Your work attendance is fine.

501
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:42,560
Thank you.

502
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,160
Hurry, go.

503
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,519
   

504
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,499
Excuse me. Where is the emergency room?

505
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:30,040
- Over there. 
 - Thank you.

506
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,140
   

507
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,419
   

508
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,220
   

509
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,079
Director Tang.

510
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:56,259
Don't need to be so formal.

511
00:29:56,259 --> 00:29:57,300
Working overtime?

512
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,700
I was just getting some files sorted.

513
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,920
You seem to be busy recently.

514
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,780
At work, is there any difficulty?

515
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:06,679
No. Doing good.

516
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:07,939
You're Xiaoning's best friend.

517
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:10,359
If there is anything, you can always tell me immediately.

518
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:12,879
Thank you. I'm doing okay.

519
00:30:12,879 --> 00:30:14,740
Okay.

520
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,200
Your phone is ringing.

521
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,460
   

522
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,200
Xiaoning.

523
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,899
 Sister Yan Yan, Auntie had an accident. She is still being evaluated in the hospital. 

524
00:30:29,899 --> 00:30:32,439
Take it easy. What happened to Aunt?

525
00:30:32,439 --> 00:30:33,560
 She is still being evaluated. 

526
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,399
I still don't know how it is going to be.

527
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:38,239
 Calm down. Tell me which hospital. I'll come over right now. 

528
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,920
Don't come.

529
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:43,660
I called you because I need you to help me to take care of my grandma.

530
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,719
She's been having increased confusion recently.

531
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,479
 I'm worried that she is alone at home. 

532
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:49,979
But... can you be there alone?

533
00:30:49,979 --> 00:30:51,700
 I'm fine. 

534
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,919
Don't worry. Auntie will be fine.

535
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,379
Let me take care of Grandma. I'll take care of her.

536
00:30:55,379 --> 00:30:57,500
If anything happens, call me immediately.

537
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:00,500
 Okay, thank you, Sister Yan Yan. 

538
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,120
What happened?

539
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,279
Auntie is in the hospital. I'm going to take care of grandma now.

540
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,700
How about this? I'll take you to Grandma's place first.

541
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,880
Then I'll go to the hospital to be with Xiaoning.

542
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,260
Director Gu, let's go. You don't want to run into a traffic jam.

543
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,920
Where is Jiang Xiaoning?

544
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,039
I don't know.

545
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,139
After giving her the ticket, I haven't seen her.

546
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:33,600
Did you arrange anything for her?

547
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,920
No.

548
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,599
Maybe she doesn't want to go, but feels bad to tell you.

549
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:40,700
Or she went home to change clothes.

550
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,679
We shall just go first.

551
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,500
Call her.

552
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,660
Doctor, how is my auntie?

553
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:49,879
She is okay now.

554
00:31:49,879 --> 00:31:53,079
Due to the hit to the head, she is in a short coma now.

555
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:55,679
But I don't rule out the possibility of having a concussion.

556
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:59,139
Let's wait for the MRI result to find out what it is actually.

557
00:31:59,139 --> 00:32:01,179
How did she get hurt?

558
00:32:01,179 --> 00:32:02,780
I'm not quite sure about it.

559
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:06,459
A passerby called 120. Emergency call.

560
00:32:06,459 --> 00:32:07,700
Thank you, Doctor.

561
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,420
It's okay.

562
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,480
   

563
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,500
Hello, Sister Manlin.

564
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,219
 Where are you? 

565
00:32:27,219 --> 00:32:29,060
Director Gu.

566
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,539
I'm still outside.

567
00:32:31,539 --> 00:32:34,640
 - Today, maybe I...   
 - Not going to the exhibition?

568
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,750
I'm sorry, Director Gu.

569
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:41,440
- I... 
  - What's more important than attending the exhibition? 

570
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,199
Nothing. My personal matters.

571
00:32:45,199 --> 00:32:48,220
What about the dreams and goals you always talked about?

572
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,539
Director Gu, you're right.

573
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:57,120
I'm sorry. I may have disappointed you.

574
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,659
 I hope you can understand. 

575
00:32:58,659 --> 00:33:01,599
Jiang Mai's family member. Come, please sign here.

576
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:03,220
Okay.

577
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,420
The medical expenses have to be paid by today.

578
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,480
Okay, I get it.

579
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,180
Thank you.

580
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,180
Jiang Xiaoning, where are you?

581
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,540
   

582
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,300
Jiang Xiaoning.

583
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,979
Director Gu. Sister Manlin.

584
00:33:43,979 --> 00:33:46,640
What happened?

585
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,959
My auntie had a minor car accident. Fortunately, a passerby brought her to the hospital in time.

586
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,119
Director Gu, I'm sorry.

587
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:02,059
I just feel that I'm a bit unlucky. I missed such a great opportunity.

588
00:34:02,059 --> 00:34:04,019
Please don't take it to your heart.

589
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:05,659
Is she okay?

590
00:34:05,659 --> 00:34:10,099
Yes. The doctor said that she only needs to be in the hospital for a few days.

591
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,580
Su Manlin, go and pay the bill.

592
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,799
I'll ask the finance department to transfer it to you.

593
00:34:16,799 --> 00:34:18,400
Okay.

594
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,729
There's no need for it, Director Gu. I just joined the company.

595
00:34:22,729 --> 00:34:25,129
I'm already so touched that you came to the hospital.

596
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:27,629
If I asked you to help me pay the medical expenses,

597
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:30,130
I don't think I can sleep well at night.

598
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:33,340
This is a loan from the company.

599
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:36,050
When your auntie gets better, you still have to go back to the studio.

600
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:38,320
And you'll need to work harder, too.

601
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,799
A portion of your monthly salary will be deducted.

602
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,170
This is not special treatment given to you by the company.

603
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:46,810
There is no need to trouble you with the money.

604
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:50,919
Xiaoning, I've sent Zhao Yan over to take care of your grandma.

605
00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:53,039
- How is Auntie? 
 - Nothing serious.

606
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:54,920
That's good.

607
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:58,199
Director Gu, this is my good friend, Tang Xu.

608
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:00,459
Brother Xu, this is my boss, Director Gu.

609
00:35:00,459 --> 00:35:04,039
Thank you for taking care of Xiaoning. Leave the rest to me.

610
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:06,720
Xiaoning, let's go and pay the fee.

611
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,999
Don't worry, Xiaoning.

612
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,239
I just don't want you to have too much pressure.

613
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,659
Wait till you earn a lot of money in the future. Only then can you pay me back.

614
00:35:17,659 --> 00:35:21,720
Brother Xu, using your money will be pressure for me.

615
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,119
I've already thought about it.

616
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:27,399
Director Gu, do I have to pay the interest?

617
00:35:27,399 --> 00:35:28,980
No need.

618
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:32,740
With such an amount of money, do you have to act like a savior?

619
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,599
Brother Xu, I don't think that's the case.

620
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:36,499
Director Gu is a kind person.

621
00:35:36,499 --> 00:35:39,259
It's a bit hard for me to raise enough money in a short time.

622
00:35:39,259 --> 00:35:41,279
Can I borrow it from the company first?

623
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,919
Of course, you can. Didn't I just say so?

624
00:35:44,919 --> 00:35:48,079
But in the future, if you want to leave the company,

625
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,919
you must make up the amount.

626
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,459
You may leave the company after doing so.

627
00:35:52,459 --> 00:35:56,000
That means, Director Gu also can't fire me simply.

628
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,539
Thank you, Director Gu. I'll give you an IOU.

629
00:35:57,539 --> 00:35:59,500
Xiaoning, you don't have to.

630
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,710
It feels like he is giving alms.

631
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:09,630
   

632
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,339
Regarding Jiang Xiaoning's matter, I've taken care of everything.

633
00:36:18,339 --> 00:36:20,479
I'll hand over the IOU to the Financial Department tomorrow.

634
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,279
Although there is no such precedent before, it won't be troublesome

635
00:36:23,279 --> 00:36:25,560
to sort it out either.

636
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,280
Okay.

637
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,619
Jiang Xiaoning is quite strange, too.

638
00:36:30,619 --> 00:36:34,140
That friend of hers seems quite into her.

639
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,999
People are giving her money for free, but she didn't want it. She'd rather borrow from the company.

640
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,640
Do you really want to deduct it from her salary?

641
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,819
Or else what? Deduct it from your salary?

642
00:36:48,819 --> 00:36:52,619
I didn't mean that. All I'm saying is

643
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:56,180
I feel that the way you treated Jiang Xiaoning is a bit different.

644
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,640
Did I?

645
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,760
No employee has such precedent before.

646
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:07,539
I just hope that nothing like this will happen to others' families.

647
00:37:07,539 --> 00:37:12,080
And everyone can always stay healthy and happy.

648
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,900
You're right.

649
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,839
I'm surprised. Before this, you never said something like this.

650
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:21,000
Even if you did it, you wouldn't say it.

651
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,339
It wasn't me to say so. Jiang Xiaoning said it.

652
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:30,600
When you mention her, you seem to talk a lot.

653
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,359
Attending the exhibition, too. You bring her along.

654
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,060
   

655
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,300
 Xiao Chuan, I'm in front of your house. 

656
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,880
 I have something new as a gift today, I wanted to give it to you. 

657
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,020
I'm going home now.

658
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,159
Although you look like you're shocked, the value is normal.

659
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:21,220
It means you're used to getting shocked.

660
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,599
Every time you're here, you behave like this. I'm so used to it.

661
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:28,039
I'm so used to you to the extent that I don't even have a reflex action towards you anymore.

662
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:33,319
Anyway, my small step is your big step.

663
00:38:33,319 --> 00:38:35,040
Open the door.

664
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:01,619
Auntie, you finally woke up.

665
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,820
Xiaoning,

666
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:11,080
I got into trouble again.

667
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,160
It's okay.

668
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:17,220
You finally get to earn some money.

669
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:20,820
Now you have to spend it all on me.

670
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,399
Does it matter? Do we have to talk about this now?

671
00:39:25,399 --> 00:39:28,119
What actually matters is you're okay. You scared me to death.

672
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:31,780
I was so afraid that something would happen to you.

673
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,520
Don't move around.

674
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:39,040
I wasn't careful enough.

675
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,719
I thought the weather was good.

676
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,980
I was going to get the medicine for your grandma.

677
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:49,419
Then, I rode on your scooter and went out.

678
00:39:49,419 --> 00:39:54,900
Unexpectedly, my waist couldn't move all of a sudden.

679
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,840
I then hit the tree.

680
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:01,959
You should go back and check on your scooter. See whether it can be repaired.

681
00:40:01,959 --> 00:40:04,980
What if it is broken?

682
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:12,620
Xiaoning, am I crippled?

683
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,280
No, no.

684
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,800
Is my face disfigured?

685
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,100
I can't get married anymore?

686
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:25,739
Your face is not disfigured. You can still get married.

687
00:40:25,739 --> 00:40:28,859
You're already in such a condition. Please don't say things that make me feel bad.

688
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:30,979
You just have a good rest and recuperate from it.

689
00:40:30,979 --> 00:40:33,899
Don't think about anything. There is nothing more important than you and grandma.

690
00:40:33,899 --> 00:40:35,700
Get it?

691
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,200
How are you feeling now?

692
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:46,759
- It hurts. 
 - Okay, okay.

693
00:40:46,759 --> 00:40:50,199
Don't think of anything. I'll be here if there is anything.

694
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,900
What is the update?

695
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,780
You'll know in a while.

696
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,579
When will I be normal?

697
00:41:11,579 --> 00:41:13,539
Am I not working hard enough now?

698
00:41:13,539 --> 00:41:16,300
You need to have faith in me...

699
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,320
What did you say just now?

700
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,200
What?

701
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,259
Normally, you'll ask me "when will I die"?

702
00:41:29,259 --> 00:41:31,100
But just now you asked me...

703
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:35,480
You asked when you will be a normal person.

704
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:38,420
Did I? I was just asking.

705
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:43,139
You asked casually and that's your inner voice. It comes out spontaneously.

706
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,879
- Maybe. 
 - Look.

707
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:48,819
You even admit it yourself.

708
00:41:48,819 --> 00:41:53,519
Xiao Chuan, is it my effort that touched you?

709
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,919
Doctor, you're overthinking it.

710
00:41:57,919 --> 00:41:59,229
Tell me.

711
00:41:59,229 --> 00:42:02,950
Have you recently met anyone?

712
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:06,190
Met someone?

713
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:09,709
I met someone. Just an employee.

714
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:14,669
Did this new employee change you?

715
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:16,670
A female employee.

716
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:18,289
Yes, female.

717
00:42:18,289 --> 00:42:21,930
Do you have feelings for her? She changed you.

718
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:25,589
Doctor, I think you're off topic.

719
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:31,020
I sometimes wonder. Why did I put my life in your hands?

720
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:35,379
Also, did you buy your doctoral diploma?

721
00:42:35,379 --> 00:42:37,840
You!

722
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,599
Please don't doubt my professionalism.

723
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:43,339
In this field, I have authority too.

724
00:42:43,339 --> 00:42:46,339
Those who produce a heart may have done it steadily, but not as great as me.

725
00:42:46,339 --> 00:42:49,690
Those who did well didn't do it as steadily as I did.

726
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:51,859
Look at it.

727
00:42:51,859 --> 00:42:54,399
Look at this new design.

728
00:42:54,399 --> 00:42:56,359
I specially made it for you.

729
00:42:56,360 --> 00:43:00,140
It's a heart rate simulation icon.

730
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:01,780
What do you think?

731
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:03,860
Isn't it beautiful?

732
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:09,239
You came all the way, just to add this to me?

733
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,639
No, not only this. It's an upgraded version.

734
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:15,239
This allows your heart to charge faster.

735
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,839
I also brought a charging generator.

736
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,279
When you're on a business trip,

737
00:43:19,279 --> 00:43:22,919
it helps solve your temporarily charging issues.

738
00:43:22,919 --> 00:43:25,639
Aren't I attentive?

739
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,939
Yes. Work hard.

740
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:29,780
Work hard.

741
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,320
You can do it.

742
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:44,640


743
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:56,879
♫  Destiny is a little annoying  ♫

744
00:43:56,879 --> 00:43:59,740
