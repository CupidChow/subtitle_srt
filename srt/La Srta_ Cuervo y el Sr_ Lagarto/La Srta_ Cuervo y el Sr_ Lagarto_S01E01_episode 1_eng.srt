00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,249
Don't worry.

4
00:00:30,249 --> 00:00:32,409
Once I finish this sunset photography homework,

5
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:34,009
I'll come pick you up.

6
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,370
Didn't you say that you're going to pick up your parents first?

7
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,600
Meeting the in-laws together, isn't that better?

8
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,059
What? I'm not ready though.

9
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,740
 Plus, I didn't bring any gifts. 

10
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,849
 What do you think I should bring to 

11
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,830
 my first meeting with aunt and uncle? 

12
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,550
Hold on.

13
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,250
I'm finishing up a time-lapse shoot.

14
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,550
Stay right there, don't move!

15
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:14,710
â™«  Skirt in your hand I could say we were slower than slow  â™«

16
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:19,230
â™«  I was wet the moment I cried  â™«

17
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:23,670
â™«  Yeah, the moment I cried  â™«

18
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,810
â™«  And his bed was made  â™«

19
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:31,190
â™«  His hair was for you  â™«

20
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:33,010
â™«  The heart was broken up  â™«

21
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,749
â™«  But there was nothing to do  â™«

22
00:01:34,749 --> 00:01:37,950
â™«  But you gonna fuck it  â™«

23
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:43,210
â™«  Baby, gonna fuck it  â™«

24
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:46,810
â™«  Pretend that you're happy  â™«

25
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:51,770
Dad, stop the car!

26
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,010
- What is it? 
 - What is this?

27
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,040
Ning Ning, what happened?

28
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,340
What is it?

29
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,880
Go home.

30
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,100
Bye-bye.

31
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,740
Ning Ning, hurry and get in the car.

32
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,560
Let's go.

33
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,799
   

34
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,159
Dad, when are we going to get to grandma's?

35
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,040
Almost there, almost there.

36
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,999
Mom, did you bring the gifts for grandma?

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,959
Yep.

38
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,199
Don't worry.

39
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,440
That's good. I won't worry then.

40
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,360
Dad, look out!

41
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,320
What are you spacing out for? Come down and help!

42
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,280
 Mom! 

43
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,639
 Mom! 

44
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,400
 Dad! 

45
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,400
 Dad! Dad! 

46
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,140
 Dad! Mom! 

47
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,960
 Mom! 

48
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,900
Mom!

49
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,020
Dad! Dad!

50
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,860
Mom!

51
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,400
Mom!

52
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,840
Dad!

53
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,959
Is anyone there?

54
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:45,180
Is somebody there?

55
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,860
Yes.

56
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,780
Yes, there is.

57
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,699
Older Brother, I'm stuck in the car.

58
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:58,320
I can't see Mom and Dad.

59
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,520
It's okay.

60
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:07,119
They may have just passed out.

61
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,040
Older Brother, when can we get out of here?

62
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,260
I'm so scared.

63
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,620
Here, give me your hand.

64
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,400
Don't be scared.

65
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,420
Older Brother will always be with you.

66
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,419
â™«  Destiny is a little annoying  â™«

67
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:57,440
â™«  It takes those I care about  â™«

68
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,199
Older Brother, what's wrong?

69
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,839
Your hand is so cold.

70
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:05,880
â™«  It would hold up a lamp in my heart  â™«

71
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:10,100
â™«  And light up the night  â™«

72
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,660
Older Brother! Older Brother!

73
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,480
 Older Brother, wake up! 

74
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:26,200
Older Brother! Older Brother!

75
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,140
 Older Brother! 

76
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:34,479
 Older Brother! 

77
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,639
 Let's go take a look. 

78
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,678
 Older Brother! 

79
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,920
 Come on! 

80
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,180
 Right over there! 

81
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,320
 Hurry! 

82
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,999
 Right here! Found them! 

83
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,280
 Over here! 

84
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:51,280
â™«  Total strangers during our first encounter  â™«

85
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:55,680
â™«  Why does my heart beat so fiercely  â™«

86
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:03,780
â™«  Who is it  â™«

87
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,099
â™«  Exchanging sunshine for moonlight  â™«

88
00:09:07,099 --> 00:09:09,259
â™«  Exchanging fortune for the past  â™«

89
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,180
   

90
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:14,940
â™«  Exchanging my heartbeat for you  â™«

91
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,080
 Found them! Found them! 

92
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:27,280
Boss, why do you need these vouchers?

93
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,160
Aren't these for the grand opening promotion?

94
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,119
Our store is closing as of today.

95
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,940
"Thank you for the support. All items are free of charge."

96
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,660
Boss.

97
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:44,740
- Jiang... 
 - Xiaoning.

98
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,479
This is so sudden.

99
00:09:46,479 --> 00:09:48,680
This is sudden?

100
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,919
You've been here half a month, have you seen any customers?

101
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,039
I can't take any more losses.

102
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,780
I have to close.

103
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,560
Why do I have such bad luck?

104
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,639
Wait, what do you mean?

105
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:04,120
I lost money but you're the unlucky one?

106
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,360
This is already my 27th job.

107
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:13,680
Boss, I wish you great prosperity and fortune in the future.

108
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,820
   

109
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,600
    

110
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,340
Store closed.

111
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,860
Store...

112
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,079
I'm still a CEO with a conscience.

113
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,240
Your paycheck. No need to look.

114
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,879
I'm getting paid?

115
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,359
Why are you so surprised?

116
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,840
Did you work for free at your previous jobs?

117
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,839
Not for free, things just didn't go too well.

118
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,839
The stores I worked at before either got trashed

119
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,519
or had accidental fires.

120
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,639
And some owners inherited a fortune and went to travel the world.

121
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,599
Boss, are you all right?

122
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,840
Now I see.

123
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,900
You were born to be bad luck for your bosses.

124
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,159
Not really, I was just born unlucky.

125
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,799
I'm bad luck for myself.

126
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,959
Iâ€¦ I was just joking.

127
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,880
Don't take it to heart.

128
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,559
Here, take this.

129
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,900
I'll get somebody to help.

130
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,560
I'd like the milky toast.

131
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,319
Milky toast is our store special.

132
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,700
Rich in milk flavor, super tasty.

133
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,679
Sir,

134
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,000
our store is closing, so all baked goods are free of charge.

135
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,599
Our boss said he wants people to remember that

136
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,640
there was once a bakery here.

137
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,400
Milky toast, thank you.

138
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,420
Okay, okay.

139
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,240
Your toast.

140
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,739
Sir! Sir!

141
00:12:06,739 --> 00:12:10,420
All our items are free, no need to pay.

142
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,040
Sir! Sâ€¦

143
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:40,279
Store closing, all items are free. Store closing, all items are free.

144
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,799
 Welcome. 

145
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,540
 All items are free. 

146
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:58,280
Hurry up! We only have three minutes left.

147
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,280
Hurry!

148
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,759
 Director Gu wants Hao Jing Hua Yuan's proposal 

149
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,920
 and the demonstration video completed today. 

150
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,959
 Remember, make sure to double-check the page numbers and content. 

151
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,860
 No mistakes allowed. 

152
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,639
 Lastly, confirm the participants of the meeting. 

153
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,759
 The report has been uploaded to the meeting mailbox. 

154
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,439
 Make sure to avoid wasting time searching through the report 

155
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,560
 during the meeting. 

156
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,760
Last week's meeting minutes must be printed out and bound. 
    

157
00:13:49,586 --> 00:13:51,100
   

158
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,520
What? Can't you guys just play along?

159
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,759
Great work, everyone! Give yourselves a pat on the back.

160
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,940
I'll give you guys bonuses.

161
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,279
Forget the bonus.

162
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,819
You should cash in the 300 rounds of coffee that you promised everyone first, right?

163
00:14:17,819 --> 00:14:20,380
I've been so busy lately. I forgot.

164
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,360
Right, great wits have short memories.

165
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,159
What? What brings our big investor here today?

166
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,479
Supervision?

167
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,359
I wouldn't dare.

168
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,479
You're all my precious cash cows.

169
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,799
I was just passing by, so I thought I'd feed my precious cash cows.

170
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,340
Where is my Chuan? Is he here?

171
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,429
Sir, just look at our surroundings.

172
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:44,309
Mountains and rivers nearby, south-facing. Definitely great Feng Shui.

173
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:46,270
We are the best in the city

174
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:48,509
and there are many choices in terms of building specifications,

175
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,610
covering consumers at various income levels.

176
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,310
Please be careful.

177
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:55,069
Sir, may I ask who this is for?

178
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,749
So I can give my recommendations accordingly.

179
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,810
For myself.

180
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,149
What?

181
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:02,629
Sir, that's an unlucky joke to make in broad daylight.

182
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:03,749
You're scaring me.

183
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,069
Why can't I buy one for myself?

184
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,269
Of course, you can't.

185
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,269
It's written in the rules that

186
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,309
the cemetery plots are for those who have passed away.

187
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:10,950
This is a legit business.

188
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:14,289
Also, to buy a cemetery plot, you'll need certain documentation, such as death certificates.

189
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,609
- Fire, fire... 
 - I'm not joking.

190
00:15:16,609 --> 00:15:19,590
I'll have the documents ready soon enough.

191
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,409
Thisâ€¦ Thank goodness it's broad daylight.

192
00:15:31,409 --> 00:15:32,669
Hello?

193
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:35,709
Not at work during work hours, where did you go?

194
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,389
What's so important?

195
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,590
 It's a private matter. 

196
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,629
Private matter?

197
00:15:40,729 --> 00:15:43,309
There are private matters between you and me?

198
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,989
 If you say it that way, I'm heartbroken. 

199
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,509
Get to the point.

200
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:49,029
 That would be the Hi Resorts project. 

201
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,829
I'm meeting the person in charge of the first party, He Sheng.

202
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:53,490
We're meeting up in the evening to get connected.

203
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,989
You know that I never socialize with clients.

204
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,949
 Don't worry, I won't make you drink. 

205
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:01,429
You're the chief architect of this project after all.

206
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:04,890
Your attendance would show that we respect the first party.

207
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:07,829
It's not respectful enough that you, our investor, are going?

208
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:10,789
Aren't you planning to win the Jin An Award with this project?

209
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:13,210
You don't want to win the big three awards?

210
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:18,110
All right. I'll send you the address later.

211
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,790
Come and pick me up.

212
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:33,549
Manlin, he hung up on me.

213
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:36,069
I'm the one who cares about him the most in this world.

214
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,389
Whatever he wants to do, I'm with him.

215
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,749
When he's happy, I'm happy too.

216
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,229
When he's not, I cheer him up.

217
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,449
And he hung up on me? Why?

218
00:16:45,449 --> 00:16:48,189
It's between the two of you, what can I say?

219
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:50,629
Director Su, interviews are taking place in the conference room.

220
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:51,949
Okay, I'll be right there.

221
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:52,869
What interview?

222
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,789
An assistant for Director Gu.

223
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,469
He needs an assistant?

224
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:58,029
Doesn't he need an assistant?

225
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:00,830
He does. He has so much work to do every day.

226
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:03,930
He needs an assistant to deal with trivial matters.

227
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:08,610
He does. He does.

228
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:14,670
Mr. Gu, are you satisfied?

229
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:18,590
The location is good, but I don't like the design.

230
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:23,690
But all our plots have the same design.

231
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:27,530
I will design my cemetery plot myself.

232
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:30,690
Thenâ€¦ Then, let's discuss this at a later time.

233
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:33,610
But you're alive. I don't mean anything else by that.

234
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:36,229
I'm just saying that you're alive and so young.

235
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:39,730
We cannot sell cemetery plots to a living person.

236
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:47,290
The required documents should be ready pretty soon.

237
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,750
Ah, I seeâ€¦

238
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,570
   

239
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:02,350
 Unlocked. 

240
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,829
I'm back!

241
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:09,110
Grandma, you're watching TV?

242
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:11,710
You're home early today.

243
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:14,650
The bakery closed down.

244
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:19,730
Let me thinkâ€¦ your previous job lasted five days.

245
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:22,669
This time, let me countâ€¦ around half a month.

246
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:23,909
That's an improvement.

247
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:26,070
Our family's way of encouraging people is always so unique.

248
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,949
Like the old saying goesâ€¦ What is it again?

249
00:18:27,949 --> 00:18:30,469
When God closes a door, he opens a window.

250
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,509
Right?

251
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:35,949
In our family's case, I think God has closed the windows, the doors,

252
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:39,410
and the sewage pipes altogether.

253
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,550
Even if the God of Fortune has found our address,

254
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:45,430
he just can't get in.

255
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:46,709
Don't lose heart.

256
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,269
I'll find a new job tomorrow.

257
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,170
Do you believe me?

258
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,750
Yes.

259
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,910
What else can I do?

260
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:58,070
Ah, my back.

261
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:03,450
If this was before, your aunt, I can do everything.

262
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,149
But ever since my lower back has gone bad,

263
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,789
I don't have enough strength.

264
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,570
This time it's not so bad.

265
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:12,130
In my bad luck this time, there is a glimmer of hope.

266
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,110
I got paid.

267
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:17,310
Really?

268
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,709
This boss is a good person.

269
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:22,130
God bless him.

270
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:24,830
I said so already.

271
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:31,590
Grandma, watching home shopping again?

272
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:32,909
I want to buy this.

273
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:35,149
Your aunt says it's too expensive and won't let me.

274
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,229
Buy it anyway.

275
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:38,149
When I get paid for my part-time job as a designated driver,

276
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:40,470
I'll buy you anything you want.

277
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,589
Okay.

278
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:45,770
How about helping your aunt replace the refrigerator and the TV?

279
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:47,430
Sure. Let's get new ones.

280
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:50,429
Also, buy a lobster for Aunty.

281
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,730
A lobster I can do.

282
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:53,550
Crayfish.

283
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:56,150
Abalone.

284
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,229
Yes to the abalone.

285
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,230
Vegetarian abalone.

286
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,329
All right, all right. Stop joking around, you two.

287
00:20:00,329 --> 00:20:01,950
Go wash your hands with your grandma. Let's eat.

288
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,230
Let's eat, Grandma.

289
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:04,209
Time to eat.

290
00:20:04,209 --> 00:20:06,650
- Make sure you both wash your hands properly. 
 - Time to eat.

291
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:07,650
Why does this taste so good?

292
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:09,129
- Aunty. 
 - Put abalone in it.

293
00:20:09,129 --> 00:20:11,390
No wonder.

294
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:29,490
I just went to view a cemetery plot; thought it was pretty nice.

295
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,850
No need to report to me.

296
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:35,709
I just want to complete my plan as soon as possible,

297
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:38,710
in this limited amount of time that I have.

298
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:41,909
Why haven't you given up on your plan of

299
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:44,549
winning the three big awards of architecture and dying

300
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:47,030
without taking anything?

301
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,690
It's true.

302
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:54,930
People can't take anything with them when they die.

303
00:20:55,710 --> 00:21:01,650
But if I can leave something behind before I die,

304
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:04,709
people would know that someone named Gu Chuan had lived in this world.

305
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:06,680
That'd be nice.

306
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:08,810
My Chuanâ€¦

307
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:11,629
How about I turn the car around and not go to the office?

308
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:14,390
I'd rather you not win any awards for the rest of your life.

309
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:17,509
You want me to leave this world filled with regret?

310
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,830
How about taking me with you?

311
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:26,390
Oh right. Su Manlin is hiring an assistant for you.

312
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:29,209
I don't need an assistant.

313
00:21:29,209 --> 00:21:30,549
That's what I said.

314
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,090
But I've changed my mind.

315
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,929
You do need one. I need one more than you do.

316
00:21:33,929 --> 00:21:37,050
I need someone to be there for you when I can't.

317
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:40,550
Not going to give you any chance to carry out your nonsense plan.

318
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:45,210
You're afraid that I'll disturb you when you're

319
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:49,610
with your many girlfriends, right?

320
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:56,210
Chuan, you need to have hope in life, have faith in Dr. Peer.

321
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:58,269
Regardless, I have to get someone to watch over you.

322
00:21:58,269 --> 00:22:01,410
If something were to happen to you, it would weigh on my conscience.

323
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:06,170
Rightâ€¦

324
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:08,270
You have a heart,

325
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:10,070
I don't.

326
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:39,889
 Two hundred and sixty-eight thousand yuan left to save 300,000. 

327
00:22:39,889 --> 00:22:42,610
 One thousand yuan, income from the bakery. 

328
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:44,250
 Paid the water bill. 

329
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,770
 Two hundred and sixty-seven thousand, 

330
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:51,470
 two hundred and twenty-eight yuan left to be saved. 

331
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:10,910
 Time for Miss Designated Driver to get to work. 

332
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:13,970
Jiang Xiaoning, let's go!

333
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:32,710
- Hello, Director Gu. 
 - Hello, Director Gu.

334
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,870
Director Gu, please sign here.

335
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,330
Thank you.

336
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:45,909
Director Gu.

337
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:48,989
The weekly project summary and client feedback have been organized

338
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,690
and placed on your desk.

339
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:52,609
You shouldn't have to do this.

340
00:23:52,609 --> 00:23:55,349
You should focus on your design plans.

341
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,450
Yes.

342
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:58,269
So, this is why you need an assistant.

343
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,549
This way, you won't have to trouble Director Su.

344
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:03,210
It's okay, I can do it.

345
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:06,990
Xu Chengran says you're hiring an assistant for me.  I don't need an assistant whatsoever.

346
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:10,850
What do you mean you don't. You do and you need one as soon as possible.

347
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:13,070
Go work on your designs.

348
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:15,710
Director Su, a word, please.

349
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:23,489
What do you need to say behind Director Gu's back?

350
00:24:23,489 --> 00:24:25,109
Hire him an assistant as soon as possible.

351
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,829
Find someone who can look after him 24/7.

352
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,069
What is it?

353
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:30,670
What is it? Why 24/7?

354
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:32,909
I can't say much.

355
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:34,709
Just find him someone as soon as possible.

356
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:36,709
But Director Gu has to agree to it.

357
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:37,989
His opinion doesn't matter.

358
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:39,690
As long as you agree and I agree.

359
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:41,390
Hold onâ€¦

360
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:44,490
I have something to deal with.

361
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:45,869
Just hurry it up.

362
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:48,450
Money is not an issue. This is very important.

363
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:51,450
Please.

364
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:52,750
Hello?

365
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,690
Yes, I'm coming.

366
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:15,290
   

367
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:31,409
   
 People can't take anything with them when they die. 

368
00:25:31,409 --> 00:25:37,210
 But if I can leave something behind before I die, 

369
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:40,469
 people would know that someone named Gu Chuan had lived in this world. 

370
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:42,350
 That'd be nice. 

371
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,980
   

372
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,930
Come on.

373
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:56,330
I'll do it myself.

374
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:57,949
- Director Su. 
 - Director He. Director He.

375
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,589
Director Su has had too much already.

376
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,989
Why don't I'll drink with you instead?

377
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,629
One can never drink too much with a confidant.

378
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:04,210
Noâ€¦

379
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:06,189
How are we confidants?

380
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:08,749
A confidante would have to be someone like Director Su.

381
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:11,770
A companion is called a companion for a reason.

382
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,150
Right? Director Su?

383
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:15,469
Come on. One more. All right?

384
00:26:15,469 --> 00:26:19,190
Let's do one more round.

385
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:28,229
Director He, your companion is down, let your confidant take over.

386
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:30,170
Bottoms up.

387
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,290
Let me take a call.

388
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,770
Chuan.

389
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:41,830
You're here? I'll come and get you.

390
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,290
Director He, Gu Chuan is here.

391
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:45,730
He just finished work. I'm going to go get him.

392
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,690
We'll continue once I'm back.

393
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:11,790
How did we end up here?

394
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:15,789
Director He, you win. I admit defeat.

395
00:27:15,789 --> 00:27:18,329
Already? I've just barely started.

396
00:27:18,329 --> 00:27:20,189
We have to keep on drinking.

397
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:23,629
How about we go somewhere else?

398
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:24,710
Director He, don't be like this.

399
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:27,229
- No more drinking. 
 - Let's go to a different place?

400
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,829
Would the two of you like to go to another place?

401
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,510
Do you need a designated driver?

402
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:33,130
Waiter! Waiter!

403
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,490
What's going on? What is it?

404
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:38,989
How can you let just anyone into your place? You're hopeless.

405
00:27:38,989 --> 00:27:39,909
This is just a misunderstanding. Misunderstanding.

406
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:42,989
I came in to use the restroom and happened to see the two of you

407
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:44,510
having trouble going back to where you were.

408
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:46,330
Waiter. This gentleman has had a lot to drink.

409
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:48,029
Please help him. I'll help the lady.

410
00:27:48,029 --> 00:27:49,029
Let's go.

411
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,629
Which private room again?

412
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:52,190
M-M02

413
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:53,409
Okay, M02.

414
00:27:53,409 --> 00:27:55,529
Let's go. Be careful. Careful, careful.

415
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:57,309
Careful, careful, careful.

416
00:27:57,309 --> 00:27:59,250
Come on.

417
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,330
Careful, careful, careful.

418
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:03,910
Sir, let me help you.

419
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:09,269
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

420
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,989
Miss, let me tell you.

421
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:13,629
You have to be careful at a karaoke place like this.

422
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:15,149
Don't drink too much.

423
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,590
There are many perverts here.

424
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:19,350
Slowly, slowly. Careful, careful, careful.

425
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,509
Do you feel sick?

426
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,690
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

427
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:24,010
Over here, over here, over here.

428
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:27,310
Be careful. Sit. Come, sit down, sit down.

429
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,810
Good.

430
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:33,570
I'll have the waiter bring you some hot water later.

431
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,669
    
 This is my name card.

432
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:38,629
Remember to call me if you need anything.

433
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:40,269
Or you can find me at the front doors.

434
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,469
It's better to have female drivers.

435
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,770
Safety first.

436
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:44,810
You know what I mean.

437
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:47,389
Thank you for earlier.

438
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:48,590
You're welcome.

439
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:49,949
They don't let designated drivers inside.

440
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:51,909
They're scared we'll ruin the fun. I'll be outside.

441
00:28:51,909 --> 00:28:54,069
Remember to call if you need me later.

442
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,849
Stay safe. Don't drink too much.

443
00:28:55,849 --> 00:28:58,869
Don't drink too much of these. Stay safe.

444
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:04,489
   

445
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:05,970
   

446
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:12,689
Who are you? You were pretty fast in helping her.

447
00:29:12,689 --> 00:29:14,870
You seem to know the way around better than I do.

448
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:17,869
No. I used to be a waitress here, so I know the way pretty well.

449
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:20,389
Sir, your room is over there.

450
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:22,149
Didn't you say you were a designated driver?

451
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:23,869
How did you become a waitress?

452
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:25,349
Used to be a waitress, now I'm a designated driver.

453
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,690
What nonsense?

454
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:30,789
Look!  Whatever you are, get lost now.

455
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,029
Don't ever let me see you again.

456
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:32,750
Got it?

457
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:35,910
Yes, yes. I'm leaving, leaving now.

458
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:40,509
- Sorry, sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry. 
 - This way.

459
00:29:40,509 --> 00:29:42,050
Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

460
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:45,050
- Director He, do you know her? 
 - No.

461
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:48,290
Just a designated driver looking to make some money.

462
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:50,269
We drank, so we do need a designated driver.

463
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:52,269
You didn't have to come out to get the two of us.

464
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,990
Come on, let's go back and continue.

465
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,390
Okay.

466
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:08,750
 What was that? It was pretty hard. 

467
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:19,109
I have a feeling that I'll have bookings tonight.

468
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:21,170
At least one.

469
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:35,550
Director He, it seems we've drunk enough.

470
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:37,910
Let's talk about the design plans.

471
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:43,470
Director Xu said no work talk tonight.

472
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:47,330
Right. Tonight is time for everyone to relax.

473
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:48,849
It's after-work hours.

474
00:30:48,849 --> 00:30:52,390
Since Director Gu is here, how about a drink?

475
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:54,789
I'm sorry. I don't drink.

476
00:30:54,789 --> 00:30:56,670
Just water for me.

477
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,829
Director Gu, you're not giving me face.

478
00:30:58,829 --> 00:30:59,989
Director He, that's not it.

479
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:01,429
Gu Chuan never drinks.

480
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,869
Here, let me drink in his place.

481
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:04,890
Director Xu,

482
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:07,990
Director Gu is even more hopeless than you are.

483
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:09,069
Forget it.

484
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,109
This is boring.

485
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:12,069
Coming here and only drinking water.

486
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,269
How about getting hotpot takeout

487
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:15,010
and eating it here, as a late-night snack?

488
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:17,310
I don't eat hotpot either.

489
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:28,350
Director He, how about this?

490
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:30,170
Bottoms up.

491
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,949
Director Su gets me.

492
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:38,710
My companion.

493
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:41,630
- Let's paint the town red! 
 - Let's!

494
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,570
That's mine...

495
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:45,869
Are you raising a fish?

496
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:46,829
You can't drink like this.

497
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:47,910
You have to be punished.

498
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,289
Double drinks. Come on.

499
00:31:49,289 --> 00:31:50,469
Let's finish this one.

500
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:52,109
Director He. Director He.

501
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:54,029
She has drunk so much already.

502
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:57,130
If you like to drink this much, let me.

503
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:58,909
Chuan, stop it. You can't.

504
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:00,269
Director He, he can't even have one.

505
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:01,909
He's going to transform if he does.

506
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:03,730
I'm okay.

507
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:05,330
Nice!

508
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:15,269
 So you can drink. 

509
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:17,770
 Then, why did you pretend? 

510
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:23,149
Chuan, if you feel sick, go ahead and leave.

511
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,690
 Leave? 

512
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:26,590
 It's still early. 

513
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:39,170
Chuan, let me take you home.

514
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:40,450
It's fine.

515
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:42,590
You have to go.

516
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:45,650
Fine.

517
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:49,470
Director He, let's get together another time.

518
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:52,150
Come.

519
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:53,749
Do you really need to shake hands?

520
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,730
This is to show my good faith.

521
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:58,470
Okay.

522
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:03,670
Another time, then.

523
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:25,030
How many bookings have you had?

524
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,330
Two.

525
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:27,589
Don't know what's up today.

526
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:28,749
So few bookings.

527
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,730
Oh well.

528
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:32,770
How about you?

529
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:35,110
I haven't gotten any yet.

530
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:36,829
That sucks.

531
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:40,430
It must be hard for a girl like you to be a designated driver.

532
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:44,030
- Slow down, slow down, slow down. 
 - What happened to me?

533
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,210
Nothing.

534
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:47,509
- Sir, do you need a designated driver? 
 - Yes, yes, yes.

535
00:33:47,509 --> 00:33:49,950
Wait, wait, wait.

536
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:51,990
It's you again.

537
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:54,409
A female driver. No, no, no.

538
00:33:54,409 --> 00:33:55,549
What's wrong with a female driver?

539
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,929
Female drivers are drivers, too. I have a driver's license.

540
00:33:57,929 --> 00:33:59,829
Sir, don't be a sexist.

541
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,670
It just can't be you.

542
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:02,930
Let me, let me, let me.

543
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:04,271
- I'll do it. 
 - The car is over there.

544
00:34:04,271 --> 00:34:05,810
- Okay. 
 - Where is Su Manlin?

545
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:06,870
- Boss, be careful. 
 -  Su Manlin.

546
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:09,570
- I want to keep drinking with her. 
 - Be careful.

547
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:10,668
My friend needs a designated driver, too.

548
00:34:10,669 --> 00:34:11,789
He's back there. His last name is Gu.

549
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:13,889
Okay, thank you.

550
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:15,329
- Slowly, Director He. 
 - Thank you.

551
00:34:15,329 --> 00:34:16,389
- No problem. 
 - Director Xu.

552
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:19,269
Come, come, come. Slowly.

553
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:28,750
Mr. Gu?

554
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,950
You need a designated driver, right?

555
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:35,569
I know her. She has my card.

556
00:34:35,569 --> 00:34:38,270
Did you guys come together?

557
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:41,229
You're okay?

558
00:34:41,229 --> 00:34:43,050
I'm okay.

559
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:49,230
I know you, too.

560
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:51,429
Trust me. I'll get you home safe and sound.

561
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:54,669
Plus, I'll give you a 100 yuan discount.

562
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,389
You said you know me?

563
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:12,490
Yeah.

564
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:13,629
This morning.

565
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:16,070
White toast, 100 yuan.

566
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:19,590
 Milky toast. Thank you. 

567
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,389
 Okay, okay. 

568
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:24,230
 Your toast. 

569
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:28,969
I remember now.

570
00:35:28,969 --> 00:35:32,830
That's why I said I'll give you a 100 yuan discount.

571
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,890
Sorry, Mr. Gu.

572
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:23,910
Give me a minute.

573
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:32,770
Go take a breath.

574
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:45,889
Director Gu, I'm really sorry.

575
00:36:45,889 --> 00:36:47,689
I have this habit when driving at night.

576
00:36:47,689 --> 00:36:52,770
When there is a truck, I always pull over to let it pass.

577
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:54,410
Why?

578
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:58,869
My habit has nothing to do with me being a female driver.

579
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:00,909
It might be because of the car accident.

580
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:03,730
Anyway, safety first.

581
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:06,010
Car accident?

582
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:07,949
It's nothing, just a bit of psychological trauma.

583
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:10,910
I promise it won't affect the safety of my driving.

584
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:23,630
 Dad! A truck! 

585
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:10,749
I'm sorry, Mr. Gu.

586
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:13,890
Iâ€¦ I got nervous all of a sudden.

587
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:17,510
Did you need to get this nervous?

588
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:23,050
Why did the lights go out?

589
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:26,290
Mr. Gu, let me go check.

590
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:39,050
What's going on?

591
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:41,610
Why can't I turn the engine on?

592
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:50,890
You can't turn it on?

593
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:56,210
Mr. Gu, I swear I didn't do anything. I was just driving.

594
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:58,250
It's not your problem.

595
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:01,690
But this car broke down while I was driving it.

596
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:03,870
I'll take responsibility.

597
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:06,870
No need.

598
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:11,890
Call a tow truck.

599
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:22,129
I didn't know tow trucks also provide drop-off service.

600
00:39:22,129 --> 00:39:24,230
Thank you, Mister.

601
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:27,469
Please help me drop her off at home.

602
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:29,269
Do you know Jialin Huayuan?

603
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:31,910
Your girlfriend doesn't live with you?

604
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:33,689
She's not my girlfriend.

605
00:39:33,689 --> 00:39:35,229
Sorry, I've mistaken.

606
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:36,370
Leave it to me.

607
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:37,730
Bye-bye.

608
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:40,110
Mister, we can go.

609
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:23,350
 Charging.
