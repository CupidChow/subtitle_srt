00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:11,590


2
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:18,920
♫  I can't help but feel a little happy  ♫

3
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,560
♫  I can't help but feel a little nervous  ♫

4
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,960
♫  The earth is turning because of you  ♫

5
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,260
♫  Without you, the earth stops  ♫

6
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:34,420
♫  You are the rainbow that fills up the black and white  ♫

7
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,960
♫  I was once obsessed with the legend of the four-leaf clover  ♫

8
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,580
♫  I dreamed of a white-horse carriage and 
you becoming my prince  ♫

9
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:48,640
♫  Your gaze is too seducing, please save me  ♫

10
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,320
♫  I'm turning into a moth, flying towards the fire  ♫

11
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,940
♫  Your smile is dancing on your lips  ♫

12
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:02,680
♫  Am I the happiness you're looking for?  ♫

13
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,340
♫  The doe inside me is lost  ♫

14
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:14,880
♫  Holding your hand, let's count down to happiness  ♫

15
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,579
♫  I can't help but be a little fragile  ♫

16
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:24,120
♫  I can't help but feel a little gloomy  ♫

17
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,540
♫  The sky is bright because of you  ♫

18
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,960
♫  Without you, the sky is grey  ♫

19
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,339
♫  You are the angel who takes away all loneliness  ♫

20
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:37,060
   

21
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:41,020
   

22
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,199
 Hello, Boss. 

23
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,600
Am I that picky?

24
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,919
Boss, you are not picky, I am.

25
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,640
As your assistant, I have to make sure you like me.

26
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,040
I like you already.

27
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,980
I like what you pick.

28
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,820
That's great.

29
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,639
Do you have instructions for me?

30
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,679
Since you're so good at picking stuff out,

31
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,100
come pick me up tomorrow morning.

32
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,520
Help me pick out some outfits.

33
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,460
Isn't everyone meeting up at the office first

34
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,580
to take the bus together tomorrow morning?

35
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,940
 We can drive ourselves there. 

36
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,779
Why do you suddenly need to buy clothes? What do you need them for?

37
00:02:17,779 --> 00:02:21,380
To be honest, I don't have much experience when it comes to shopping for clothes.

38
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,119
Everything I own looks pretty much the same.

39
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,960
Are you expecting me to wear suits during our team-building event?

40
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,679
Oh, that's true.

41
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,800
All right then. See you tomorrow morning.

42
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,359
Okay. Go to bed early.

43
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,159
We have a long drive ahead tomorrow.

44
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,020
Good night.

45
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,419
Hurry up and get in the car! Get in.

46
00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:01,000
Jia Jia, remember to save me a seat.

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,940
Let's go.

48
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,219
Hurry. Hurry up.

49
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:07,099
Be proactive in the team-building event.

50
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:10,539
Do we have everyone? If we do, let's get this show on the road.

51
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:12,500
Director Gu isn't here yet.

52
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,619
Director Gu said he's got something to do first. Xiaoning will drive him there.

53
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,520
Did he say what it was?

54
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,360
I... Do I dare to ask about our boss's personal business?

55
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,800
If you want to know, call Xiaoning and find out.

56
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,640
Let's go.

57
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,579
Are you coming?

58
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,440
If not, we're leaving without you.

59
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,039
Good morning, Boss.

60
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,699
Morning, did you sleep well?

61
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:51,339
Very well. Don't worry, Boss. Long-distance driving won't be a problem.

62
00:03:51,339 --> 00:03:53,359
Good. Then let's go shopping first.

63
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:54,519
You mean it?

64
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,840
Of course.

65
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,079
Then, what kind of clothes would you like to buy?

66
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:59,960
You can decide.

67
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,100
Boss, you don't have any luggage?

68
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,519
I already put everything in the trunk last night.

69
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,120
Great.

70
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,700
Boss.

71
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,540
You think these are good?

72
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,100
All right, I'll go try them on.

73
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,000
Miss, this one is a matching outfit to your boyfriend's.

74
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,079
Would you like to try these on?

75
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:01,180
No. It's not a good idea.

76
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,899
Try them on. How would you know without trying them on?

77
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,980
Looks pretty good.

78
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,040
But this necklace...

79
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,980
This is what Brother Xu...

80
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,600
My friend bought it for me on a business trip.

81
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,399
It doesn't go with this outfit.

82
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:37,200
Really?

83
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,480
You're right.

84
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,480
I'll take it off then.

85
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,480
Now everything looks much better.

86
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,639
Okay, we'll take both.

87
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,139
Very well, Sir. This way, please.

88
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:56,760
Okay.

89
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,020
 Boyfriend. 

90
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,020
 Jiang Xiaoning, keep on dreaming. 

91
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,320
♫  So empty  ♫

92
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:41,520
♫  The people around  ♫

93
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,260
♫  So empty  ♫

94
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,420
♫  Their feelings  ♫

95
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,899
♫  One, two, three, count with me  ♫

96
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:54,759
♫  If the youth is precious, cheers  ♫

97
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:57,639
♫  Those blazing dreams, follow my command  ♫

98
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:59,040
♫  Four, five, six  ♫

99
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,460
♫  Chase without doubt, long live the young  ♫

100
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:06,720
♫  You are the most perfect when full of vitality  ♫

101
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,320
We're here.

102
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,440
Let's go.

103
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,300
Hurry.

104
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,760
Here, come on.

105
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,599
- Give... Give it to me.
- Make sure you take care of it.

106
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:19,840
Go inside.

107
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,379
It's so pretty! Come on.

108
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:22,940
Here. Be careful.

109
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,159
- It's even prettier over there. 
 - Watch your step.

110
00:07:25,159 --> 00:07:27,460
It's so pretty here.

111
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,480
So nice.

112
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,420
Let's go check it out.

113
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,139
Look over there. And that.

114
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:36,079
What's... What's that called?

115
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,859
Let me take your picture.

116
00:07:37,859 --> 00:07:39,540
Everyone, listen up.

117
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:43,360
This is the Lu Sen Bubble Houses we'll be staying at.

118
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,699
Choose whichever one you want. Go get some rest first.

119
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,779
Leave the most spacious one for Director Gu.

120
00:07:47,779 --> 00:07:51,820
We'll be having a barbeque party tonight!

121
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:57,720
Wang Kai, I want the one closest to Director Gu.

122
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,580
I already said you can choose whichever you want.

123
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,860
I have to report to Director Gu about work whenever needed.

124
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,819
Can't you let Director Gu relax for a few days?

125
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:09,360
Director Gu has been so wound up.

126
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,019
He finally agreed to come out with us this one time,

127
00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:12,459
yet you still want him to work?

128
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:16,060
Su Manlin, how ruthless you are.

129
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,900
Jia Jia.

130
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,280
Come here.

131
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,938
I'll be your next-door neighbor.

132
00:08:31,938 --> 00:08:33,179
I've done all the possible research.

133
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,320
Food, entertainment, you name it. I'm super prepared.

134
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,879
Sure. I'm okay with whatever.

135
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,579
There is a large temperature difference between day and night.

136
00:08:43,579 --> 00:08:48,239
Kai Kai Wang's heart-warming package, only for Qiao Mengjia.

137
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,319
Wow, 666! You're so thoughtful. 
  (T/N: A cold medicine) 

138
00:08:51,319 --> 00:08:52,579
I have a question.

139
00:08:52,579 --> 00:08:56,920
Why didn't Director Xu come with us?

140
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,079
Director Xu has gone MIA recently.

141
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:03,340
It doesn't matter whether he comes or not.

142
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:07,199
Don't you think I'm really sweet and really thoughtful?

143
00:09:07,199 --> 00:09:08,559
You're right, thanks.

144
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,299
Sister Hong, I have 666. Do you want some?

145
00:09:11,299 --> 00:09:13,799
Dong! Dong, come take some photos for me.

146
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:15,559
Sure thing.

147
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,079
Make sure to get the bubble house in the frame. Hurry.

148
00:09:17,079 --> 00:09:19,760
I… He… I don't...

149
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,919
Come here.

150
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,940
I'll charge you.

151
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,659
Cheese!

152
00:09:26,659 --> 00:09:28,300
Let's go. Over there and over here.

153
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,460
Time to fight for the rooms.

154
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,879
Jia Jia! No need to fight, we're sharing one anyway.

155
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:34,260
Sharing? Sh... Sharing?

156
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,020
I thought we were just neighbors?

157
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,720
- This is it. 
 -This one?

158
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,499
- Jia Jia, this is the one. 
 - This is it?

159
00:09:40,499 --> 00:09:42,059
Keep going you guys. Bye.

160
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:44,161
Check out the ones in front.

161
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,780
   

162
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,039
   

163
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,839
 Yan Yan, are you off work? 

164
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,020
   

165
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,520
This has been checked.

166
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,020
Okay.

167
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:57,680
   

168
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,619
   

169
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,520
   

170
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,600
Zhao Yan, what are you doing?

171
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,560
I want to work overtime.

172
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,740
Let's go have dinner together?

173
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,259
No, I'm fine. I can finish this today.

174
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:54,920
This isn't urgent. You can submit it later.

175
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,459
Come on, Zhao Yan. Even Manager Wei is giving us the green light.

176
00:11:57,459 --> 00:11:59,180
Come on. Didn't you say you were going to buy us dinner?

177
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,240
Exactly. This won't do.

178
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,339
Zhao Yan, that's not what you said when you came to my office to ask for some time off.

179
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:07,519
- Right. If you don't come, Manager Wei will... 
 -  All right. I'll go.

180
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,540
Let me pack up first.

181
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,850
Oh, by the way, don't take your car.

182
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:13,460
You're taking mine.

183
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,379
Seriously?

184
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:16,640
Hurry up, we'll wait for you.

185
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,579
Brother Kai, I'll leave you to it. I'm going to grab something to eat first.

186
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:18,520
Go ahead.

187
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,040
Won't he be full then?

188
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,520
Pass me the salt.

189
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,959
Convenient and delicious.

190
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:33,560
This self-heating hot pot is a must-have for camping.

191
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,539
Boss! Boss is here.

192
00:13:44,539 --> 00:13:46,019
It's a day off, why are you scared?

193
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:49,239
The purpose of having a team-building event is to improve the relationship between Boss and us.

194
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:52,660
That's not it. Look at their outfits.

195
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:56,320
His style did change.

196
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,359
Are you blind?

197
00:13:59,359 --> 00:14:01,759
The matching black and white outfits, you idiot.

198
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:03,699
- Brother Kai. Jia Jia. Sister Hong. 
 - Xiaoning.

199
00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:05,340
Director Gu.

200
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,999
Director Gu, new clothes?

201
00:14:07,999 --> 00:14:09,399
Looking good!

202
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:11,019
Looks good on Xiaoning, too.

203
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:13,080
Yes, yes. Pretty.

204
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,990
Director Gu, take some rest first.

205
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,450
The food will be ready right away.

206
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:18,299
Xiaoning, take a seat too.

207
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:20,419
It's okay, Brother Kai. Let me do the cooking.

208
00:14:20,419 --> 00:14:23,459
No way. You must be tired after driving for the entire day. Let me.

209
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:25,500
- Thanks, Brother Kai. 
 - Over here, Xiaoning.

210
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,899
Director Gu, I know you're not used to eating these.

211
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:30,639
I asked them to pick up some food for you from a restaurant.

212
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,060
It'll be delivered shortly.

213
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,719
No worries. Let me.

214
00:14:33,719 --> 00:14:37,019
- No way. It's fine. There's smoke here. 
 - It's fine.

215
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:39,899
- This... 
 - Brother Kai, you go and take a break. I'll help Boss.

216
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:40,979
Okay, okay.

217
00:14:40,979 --> 00:14:42,719
- You can take care of other things. 
 - It's okay.

218
00:14:42,719 --> 00:14:46,159
Jiang Xiaoning, you still have unfinished work.

219
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:49,320
Can you finish everything by noon tomorrow?

220
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,779
Got it, Sister Manlin.

221
00:14:55,779 --> 00:14:58,539
Brother Kai, after driving the whole day, I'm pretty tired.

222
00:14:58,539 --> 00:15:00,479
Plus, I have a bunch of work to finish. I'll go back first.

223
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:02,559
Wait, don't go. Have some of Director Gu's grilled meat.

224
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:05,659
I mean, have some of the meat Director Gu grilled before leaving.

225
00:15:05,659 --> 00:15:07,440
I'm good. You guys enjoy it.

226
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,919
I'm heading back first.

227
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:10,600
Xiaoning.

228
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,419
I know you're tough on yourself, but you can't starve yourself.

229
00:15:15,419 --> 00:15:17,340
Take these with you.

230
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,580
Let me see what else there is.

231
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,239
The cauliflower is ready.

232
00:15:21,239 --> 00:15:23,679
I'm giving this to Xiaoning so she can take it with her.

233
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:25,139
- Thanks. 
 - Be careful. It's hot.

234
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:27,679
Here's the room key. Go get some rest.

235
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:29,559
- Thank you, Sister Hong. 
 - You're welcome. Go on.

236
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:31,720
Boss, I'm leaving.

237
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,460
Director Gu.

238
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:52,139
Director Gu, you should get some rest, too. Let Cheng Dong do it.

239
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:55,199
It's all right. There's no "Director Gu" here today. We should all have fun.

240
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,499
Exactly! Have fun!

241
00:15:57,499 --> 00:16:00,360
Everyone, raise your glass.

242
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,599
Let's...

243
00:16:01,599 --> 00:16:03,559
- Director Gu. 
 - Thank Director Gu.

244
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:05,980
Director Gu, thank you for getting us together

245
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,350
and building such a big and lovely family.

246
00:16:08,359 --> 00:16:11,259
To Chuan Design Studios! Cheers!

247
00:16:11,259 --> 00:16:13,440
Cheers!

248
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,290
   

249
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,319
Boss, what are you doing here?

250
00:17:02,319 --> 00:17:04,280
You didn't finish eating, did you?

251
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,099
I can't eat that stuff.

252
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:09,499
Didn't you say you were going to cook something delicious for me yesterday?

253
00:17:09,499 --> 00:17:11,318
Oh, right. I made a congee.

254
00:17:11,318 --> 00:17:13,320
Boss, come in first.

255
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,498
Boss, sit anywhere you like. I'll go and get the congee.

256
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,399
Vegetable shrimp congee.

257
00:17:29,399 --> 00:17:31,459
It took me one whole night to make it.

258
00:17:31,459 --> 00:17:34,840
The temperature should be just right.

259
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,860
Low oil and salt. Not spicy.

260
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:42,400
The shrimp have been peeled as well.

261
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,500
Smells pretty good.

262
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,900
How is it?

263
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,060
Are you not going to eat?

264
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,420
This is all wrong.

265
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:30,539
Boss, how did you know what I was struggling with?

266
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:33,859
Only one look is enough to tell me you're stuck again.

267
00:18:33,859 --> 00:18:36,079
You're the savior that God has sent to help me.

268
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:37,659
You are so smart.

269
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:41,120
I just want to have a bowl of congee in peace.

270
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,320
It looks much better this way.

271
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,680
If there's anything you don't understand, just come ask me directly.

272
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,740
You knowing what to do is an asset to me as well.

273
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,460
Yes, sir.

274
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,519
Fireworks. It's so beautiful.

275
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,560
Impressive.

276
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:08,640
♫  Caught off-guard by our first encounter  ♫

277
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,000
♫  And the corner of your mouth is lifting  ♫

278
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,800
♫  Heart pounding involuntarily, this phenomenon  ♫

279
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:22,499
♫  Am I abnormal or are you shining?  ♫

280
00:20:22,499 --> 00:20:23,839
So astonishing.

281
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,880
I haven't seen fireworks in a long time.

282
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,920
If you like it, I can bring you here every weekend.

283
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:41,220
♫  Heart pounding involuntarily, this phenomenon  ♫

284
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,920
Boss, look at the stars.

285
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,640
I haven't looked up just to see the stars in a long time.

286
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,480
The city is developing.

287
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,120
Everyone is so busy every day.

288
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,880
Plus, there's pollution.

289
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:12,180
I haven't seen a night sky like this in a really long time.

290
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,780
That's why we need to cherish what we have now.

291
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:17,700
Happiness is when we are able to look up at something.

292
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
True.

293
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,060
Happiness is when we are able to look up at something.

294
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,780
Boss, make a wish!

295
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,400
I don't have one.

296
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,880
Then I'll borrow your wish.

297
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,700
Can you even borrow that?

298
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,719
The first wish I'd like to make is that I wish my grandma, my auntie,

299
00:21:48,719 --> 00:21:52,359
all of my friends, and colleagues good health.

300
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,320
Health comes first.

301
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:59,260
My second wish is that our company earns lots and lots of money

302
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,520
so that I can get a raise.

303
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,720
You directed that part at me, didn't you?

304
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,320
My third wish is about something that I can't tell you.

305
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,140
I can guess it even if you don't say it.

306
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:18,279
You must be saying something bad about me.

307
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,599
No.

308
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,840
No, I didn't, Boss.

309
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,800
You'd better be telling the truth.

310
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:36,220
♫  I feel the love when you're by my side  ♫

311
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,859
What did you wish for?

312
00:23:11,859 --> 00:23:15,520
I wish I could meet my Mr. Right soon. You?

313
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,159
To become a billionaire.

314
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,260
To be richer than a country.

315
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,380
Richer than a country.

316
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,780
Zhao Yan, I'll go first.

317
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,199
Bye.

318
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,360
Slowly.

319
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,540
Bye, Manager Wei.

320
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,780
Xiao Yan.

321
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,540
Our department should

322
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,639
get together more often in the future.

323
00:24:24,639 --> 00:24:27,200
People having a great time together, isn't that great?

324
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,399
All right, go home and rest.

325
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,319
I'm leaving now.

326
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,800
Goodbye.

327
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,600
Good night.

328
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,600
 Mom. Dad. 

329
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,040
 I'm so scared. 

330
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,760
 Don't be. 

331
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,320
 I will always be with you. 

332
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,160
 Older Brother. 

333
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,639
 Older Brother. Older Brother. 

334
00:26:29,639 --> 00:26:32,260
 What's wrong? Your hand is so cold. 

335
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,390
Don't.

336
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,860
Don't.

337
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,420
Don't.

338
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,360
Don't grill the eggplants.

339
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,500
Just grill the ribs.

340
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,490
More cumin...

341
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,140
and a little bit of chili.

342
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,240
Director Gu.

343
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,980
Still awake?

344
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,260
Well...

345
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,440
What's wrong?

346
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,519
I think I went to the wrong room.

347
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:28,120
I was going to bring you some food, but no one answered.

348
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,280
So you live here?

349
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,959
No.

350
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,759
Jiang Xiaoning lives here.

351
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,999
She's working.

352
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,820
I couldn't sleep, so I thought I could check on her.

353
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,679
How's Jiang Xiaoning?

354
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,279
Did she finish her work?

355
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,599
Is the workload too much for her

356
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,839
that she needs someone to help her out?

357
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,079
It's all right.

358
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,399
You also know we all have been through this phase,

359
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,600
working in this industry.

360
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,680
Director Gu...

361
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,320
It's nothing.

362
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,559
I just feel that you've changed quite a lot recently.

363
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,680
You're a lot more relaxed.

364
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,780
I'm happy for you.

365
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,520
Really?

366
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,440
Thank you.

367
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,940
If there's nothing else, I'll go back first.

368
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,180
You neither shut your door

369
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,280
nor picked up your phone.

370
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,060
You didn't think that I would worry, did you?

371
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:09,359
What's with your company and your job?

372
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,320
Making you this drunk every day.

373
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,340
It's nice having a man in the house.

374
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,439
No, no! I can't drink anymore.

375
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,440
Sorry.

376
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,440
All right, no more drinking.

377
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,300
Since you're here,

378
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,999
let's talk things through.

379
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,620
Don't move!

380
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,640
What did you ask me?

381
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,540
My company?

382
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:47,560
How can I not know what those people are thinking?

383
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,480
I won't be tricked

384
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:56,000
because I've never seen them as human beings.

385
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,680
And you, too.

386
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,839
I won't be tricked by you either.

387
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,480
Don't laugh.

388
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,640
I'm going to beat you up if you laugh.

389
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,540
You.

390
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,959
You.

391
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,840
Do you know why I beat you?

392
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,039
Ask me.

393
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,300
Come on, ask me.

394
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,880
Why?

395
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,260
I don't know either.

396
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:28,240
I learned Sanda because I thought

397
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,480
I could protect myself

398
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,140
and make myself stronger.

399
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,380
But I realized later this isn't the case.

400
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,820
In this world,

401
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:47,100
a lot of things are unsolvable.

402
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:53,520
You don't have the ability to protect yourself at all.

403
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:03,080
That's why you need me to protect you.

404
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,180
Do you know?

405
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:20,240
When I was little,

406
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:25,560
I just wanted to grow up faster and faster.

407
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,460
That way,

408
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:33,420
I can live the carefree life

409
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:36,160
and do as I please.

410
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:40,190
I thought I was different from all the other girls

411
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,760
that I didn't need hugs

412
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,760
and protection.

413
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,160
But then I realized,

414
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,920
I'm worse than them.

415
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,320
I'm too average.

416
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,880
There is nothing special about me.

417
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,820
You are special to me.

418
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,560
I want to sing.

419
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,340
Sure.

420
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:26,559
♫  You're the haze in my sky  ♫

421
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:31,900
♫  A disaster for my clear blue sky  ♫

422
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:36,779
♫  The most unreasonable highlight  ♫

423
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:41,860
♫  We're not enemies but our paths keep narrowing  ♫

424
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:44,480
♫  But who asked me to love  ♫

425
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,020
♫  Who asked me to love  ♫

426
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,520
♫  I love this bad guy  ♫

427
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,100
♫  I want to rely on you  ♫

428
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,600
♫  But who aske me to love  ♫

429
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,260
♫  Who asked me to love  ♫

430
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,720
♫  I have no idea  ♫

431
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,580
♫  I won't let go  ♫

432
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:05,180
♫  I adore you for no particular reason  ♫

433
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:07,040
♫  This unreasonable love  ♫

434
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,240
♫  I can't explain but just want to  ♫

435
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,700
♫  mess around with you  ♫

436
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,240
♫  Come on, let's hurt each other  ♫

437
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,200
♫  If you dare to love, you have to be ready to get hurt  ♫

438
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,920
♫  We thank our fate  ♫

439
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,140
♫  We all deserve it  ♫

440
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,219
Thank goodness Boss left already.

441
00:35:43,219 --> 00:35:45,720
I wonder when though.

442
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,780
I hope I didn't drool.

443
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,800
I don't think I did.

444
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,179
- Good morning, Boss. 
 - Morning.

445
00:36:09,179 --> 00:36:11,840
Boss, did you sleep well last night?

446
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,440
Very well. What about you?

447
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,839
It was great! Thank goodness someone got me a blanket,

448
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,040
or I would've gotten sick for sure.

449
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,040
Let's go get some breakfast.

450
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,700
Sure. I didn't eat enough last night.

451
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,959
Starting now, you're free to do what you want.

452
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,599
I will give these travel brochures to you.

453
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:30,599
Around here, there are theme parks, ancient towns, scenic areas,

454
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,159
basically everything.

455
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,860
Thanks.

456
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:36,439
We'll meet after dinner.

457
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:40,760
Director Gu will join us and we'll have a karaoke party!

458
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,240
- How's that? 
 - Cool.

459
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,599
Listen up, listen up. Don't get lost.

460
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,599
Don't get lost.

461
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,599
This is not a field trip for elementary school students.

462
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,679
Who would get lost?

463
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,380
If your IQ reaches half of that of an elementary school student,

464
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,200
I wouldn't be worried.

465
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,419
Stop messing around.

466
00:36:56,419 --> 00:36:58,099
Where do you plan to go?

467
00:36:58,099 --> 00:36:59,579
Of course the theme park.

468
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:01,079
Theme parks are so fun.

469
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:05,279
There's also a huge Ferris wheel in this theme park.

470
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,619
How romantic!

471
00:37:06,619 --> 00:37:07,940
That's great!

472
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,559
This is for you kids.

473
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,000
I'm not going.

474
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,219
I plan on finding a quiet place and enjoying the scenery.

475
00:37:14,219 --> 00:37:15,740
I'll check out the bridge.

476
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:18,420
- Bridge? 
 -  Bridge?

477
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,919
There's a bridge with a long history here.

478
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,519
I've only seen it in books.

479
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,260
I'm here already so why not go check it out.

480
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:27,460
It's not far. I'll be back before dark.

481
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,919
I'm going to the ancient town.

482
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,040
Maybe I could shop around.

483
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,500
Director Su, where are you going?

484
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,920
I'm not sure yet.

485
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,040
Director Gu, where do you plan to go?

486
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,580
I'll probably just walk around.

487
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,940
Xiaoning, do you want to come with us?

488
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,199
Will there be a lot of people at the theme park?

489
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:48,259
Will the queue time be long?

490
00:37:48,259 --> 00:37:49,219
How far is the bridge?

491
00:37:49,219 --> 00:37:50,119
How many years of history does it have?

492
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:52,019
Will there be a lot of delicious food in the ancient town?

493
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:55,160
Is it a real ancient town or just one built for tourism?

494
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,420
A curious kid.

495
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,919
Jiang Xiaoning, come here.

496
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,320
You got some data wrong last night.

497
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,739
Poor Jiang Xiaoning.

498
00:38:09,739 --> 00:38:12,280
What mistake did she make that it has to be brought up during the team-building event?

499
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:15,379
I want Director Gu to bring up my mistake during the team-building event as well.

500
00:38:15,379 --> 00:38:17,560
It means he cares.

501
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,639
Never mind.

502
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,359
It's better that he doesn't care.

503
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,599
I hope he never sees me.

504
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:26,020
But he has to pay me regardless.

505
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,599
Director Su, what do you say?

506
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,679
Where do you want to go?

507
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,799
I'm a little dizzy.

508
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,540
I'm going to sleep.

509
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,120
Always like that.

510
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,780
Why are you here?

511
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,080
Where is this?

512
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,419
You're asking me that?

513
00:39:19,419 --> 00:39:22,079
You got so drunk last night that you didn't even close the door.

514
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,199
You're lucky that it was me who walked in.

515
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,000
What if it was a bad guy?

516
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,279
Thank you.

517
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,040
No problem.

518
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,359
I'm all good.

519
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,080
You can leave now.

520
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,359
I'm good, too.

521
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,719
I rescheduled everything to stay with you.

522
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,059
Who's your boss? He got you this drunk.

523
00:39:40,059 --> 00:39:42,020
I need to go make him pay.

524
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,300
You don't understand me.

525
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,760
I mean you can leave my home now.

526
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,479
I need to stay to take care of you.

527
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,359
I don't need to be taken care of.

528
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,600
You're my girlfriend.

529
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,880
Who else would I take care of?

530
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,020
I'm not your girlfriend.

531
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,119
You are.

532
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,079
I'm not.

533
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,120
You are.

534
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,379
Between you and me, who got drunk last night?

535
00:40:13,379 --> 00:40:15,039
We are separate individuals.

536
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,919
There is nothing between us.

537
00:40:16,919 --> 00:40:18,479
Why do I not understand?

538
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,540
You do understand.

539
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,559
But that day, we had already...

540
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:25,119
Just pretend you had a dream

541
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,159
and that dream came true.

542
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,199
Congratulations.

543
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,380
A dream?

544
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,439
Zhao Yan, what are you talking about?

545
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,159
Who do you think I am?

546
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,219
I have always been the one to say these things to a girl.

547
00:40:34,219 --> 00:40:35,600
Isn't that even better?

548
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,999
That means we are the same type of people.

549
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,480
So I don't need to explain any further.

550
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,559
I don't care. You need to be responsible for me.

551
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:43,319
Can't you tell how much I like you?

552
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,600
Can't you tell how serious I am?

553
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,799
It's my problem, all right?

554
00:40:47,799 --> 00:40:50,460
I don't trust love and I don't need love.

555
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,000
You've hurt me.

556
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,540
Zhao Yan, you indeed have hurt me.

557
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,699
What do you want me to tell you?

558
00:40:58,699 --> 00:41:01,179
You want me to tell you that you need to be responsible for me and I'll love you for my entire life.

559
00:41:01,179 --> 00:41:03,200
Right, I should say

560
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,819
"Oh my gosh, I love you so much."

561
00:41:05,819 --> 00:41:08,439
Let's be together for life and never leave each other, "please?"

562
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,639
How about that?

563
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,799
Anyhow, I'm not breaking up with you.

564
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,920
Don't ever think of getting rid of me.

565
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,700
I don't like you.

566
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,879
Give me a chance.

567
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,319
I'll make you fall for me.

568
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,439
I don't want to date anyone.

569
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,239
Who said we have to date each other?

570
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:32,080
Xu Chengran, your good friend, is officially online from today.

571
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,240
Yan Yan,

572
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,420
I'll become your man sooner or later.

573
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,400
Get out.

574
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,140
Get out of here now.

575
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,919
I'll send someone to bring you the hangover soup.

576
00:41:55,919 --> 00:41:57,880
Take care of yourself.

577
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:14,960


578
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:25,079
♫  Destiny is a little annoying  ♫

579
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:27,979
♫  Takes those I care about  ♫

580
00:42:27,979 --> 00:42:31,720
♫  Away from me  ♫

581
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,580
♫  If memory is bright  ♫

582
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:36,499
♫  It would hold up a lamp in my heart  ♫

583
00:42:36,499 --> 00:42:40,300
♫  And light up the night  ♫

584
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,659
♫  Sunshine alternates with moonlight  ♫

585
00:43:01,659 --> 00:43:04,660
♫  Returning to life in time  ♫

586
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:08,140
♫  Gift me with a dream  ♫

587
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:12,140
♫  A dream with you in it  ♫

588
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:41,539
♫  The one who caught me off guard  ♫

589
00:43:41,539 --> 00:43:45,800
♫  Steps foot into my life...  ♫

590
00:43:49,899 --> 00:43:54,480
♫  It's you...  ♫

591
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,660
♫  If it weren't for parting  ♫

592
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:02,840
♫  How can we meet again?  ♫

593
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:12,560
♫  It's you...  ♫

594
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,599
♫  Exchanging sunshine for moonlight  ♫

595
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:17,739
♫  Exchanging fortune for the past  ♫

596
00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:22,400
♫  Exchanging my heartbeat for you  ♫
