â™«  I can't help but feel a little happy  â™«

3
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:23,579
â™«  I can't help but feel a little nervous  â™«

4
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:25,979
â™«  The earth is turning because of you  â™«

5
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,279
â™«  Without you, the earth stops  â™«

6
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:34,220
â™«  You are the rainbow that fills up the black and white  â™«

7
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,839
â™«  I was once obsessed with the legend of the four-leaf clover  â™«

8
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:44,539
â™«  I dreamed of a white-horse carriage and 
you becoming my prince  â™«

9
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:48,639
â™«  Your gaze is too seducing, please save me  â™«

10
00:00:48,639 --> 00:00:53,300
â™«  I'm turning into a moth, flying towards the fire  â™«

11
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:58,039
â™«  Your smile is dancing on your lips  â™«

12
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:02,619
â™«  Am I the happiness you're looking for?  â™«

13
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:07,320
â™«  The doe inside me is lost  â™«

14
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,510
â™«  Holding your hand, let's count down to happiness  â™«

15
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,479
â™«  I can't help but be a little fragile  â™«

16
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:24,219
â™«  I can't help but feel a little gloomy  â™«

17
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:26,579
â™«  The sky is bright because of you  â™«

18
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:28,899
â™«  Without you, the sky is grey  â™«

19
00:01:28,899 --> 00:01:33,539
â™«  You are the angel who takes away all loneliness  â™«

20
00:01:33,539 --> 00:01:37,060
   

21
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:41,060
   

22
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,140
Is that style too modern?

23
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,359
No.

24
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,439
Although it appears to be a bit run-down, it's actually not

25
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,780
one of those outdated cafes from decades ago.

26
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,280
A lot of people come here is purely because of its good location.

27
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,439
If you place other cafes at this location,

28
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,900
it'll achieve the same effect.

29
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,359
What we need to do is to make everyone have the desire to

30
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,500
come in and take a photo after having one look at this cafe.

31
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,879
Although some designers may despise this sort of thing,

32
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,399
this is the best method for businessmen.

33
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,679
And it's the best way for this cafe to

34
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,319
integrate into its surroundings.

35
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:24,080
The industrial style or retro style doesn't really suit this place.

36
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,380
Okay, I got it.

37
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:30,079
Director Gu, the exhibition hall project is going very well.

38
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,400
I'll send you our finalized proposal shortly.

39
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,800
Okay.

40
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,319
The owner of the cafe will be here soon.

41
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,620
He must have been stuck in traffic.

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,899
I'm going down to take a walk.

43
00:02:55,899 --> 00:02:57,499
Let me know when the owner is here.

44
00:02:57,499 --> 00:02:59,000
Okay.

45
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,540
Penny for your thoughts?

46
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,180
You guys are done with the discussion?

47
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,540
Why didn't you come up and join us?

48
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,919
You guys were talking business.

49
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,079
Sister Manlin also told me that she would let me know

50
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,080
what you guys discussed.

51
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,200
Let's go.

52
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,740
We're here.

53
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,860
Here.

54
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,919
Sister Manlin, this is your room.

55
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,200
Boss, your room is over here.

56
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,120
Let's see.

57
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,840
Here.

58
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,060
Boss, your room key.

59
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,079
I'm just next door.

60
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,279
Let me know if you need anything.

61
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,680
Okay.

62
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,560
This is a really nice room.

63
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,260
Hello, Boss.

64
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,819
Do you really need to be this polite?

65
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,320
We've only been apart for less than a minute.

66
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,100
That's true.

67
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,119
Boss, I heard the hot springs here are pretty good.

68
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,480
You can soak in the hot springs at night and look at the stars.

69
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,600
It's cloudy now.

70
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,800
I believe as long as you wait patiently, you'll be able to see them.

71
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,720
Although this place doesn't have the pollution or haze from the city,

72
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,399
I should still advise you you'd better check the weather forecast

73
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:09,460
in the future.

74
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,280
But what if the weather forecast is wrong?

75
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,719
I'll still go to the hot springs,

76
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,620
or else I've come here for nothing.

77
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,039
Sister Wenwen, what a coincidence.

78
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,439
Are you staying at this hotel, too?

79
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,699
You're here to soak in the hot springs, too?

80
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:40,759
To relax for a bit.

81
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,319
My boss asked me to book a hotel, so I booked this one.

82
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,699
Looks like we're quite like-minded. We have similar tastes.

83
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:46,700
That's right.

84
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,979
This hotel was designed by a Japanese designer.

85
00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:51,019
And the hot springs here are very well-known.

86
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:53,979
It's a top choice amongst tourists in this area.

87
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,739
- I see. 
 - Come join me.

88
00:05:55,739 --> 00:05:57,140
Okay.

89
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,620
Be careful.

90
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,899
Sister Wenwen, have some.

91
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:23,160
I'm good. You can have it.

92
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,700
By the way, Sister Wenwen,

93
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,880
are you a professional photographer?

94
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,919
I used to be a photojournalist.

95
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,220
And then I worked as a part-time photographer for National Geographic.

96
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,020
I only began working full-time these years.

97
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,540
But it's so rare to see female photographers.

98
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,280
You must have been to many places.

99
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,920
I've been to every place you can think of.

100
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,119
Recently, my husband began to focus on the domestic market.

101
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,639
So I followed him and came back.

102
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,500
You got married at such a young age?

103
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,399
I won't say I'm still young.

104
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,119
I just got engaged this year.

105
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,959
I'm waiting for my photography exhibition to finish

106
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,639
so that I can have my wedding at the end of this year.

107
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,960
How about you? What do you do for a living?

108
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,580
Me?

109
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:15,560
I'm currently working at an architectural company.

110
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,999
An architectural designer?

111
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,159
No, no, no.

112
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,959
My dream is to be an architectural designer.

113
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,439
But for now, I'm just an assistant to my boss.

114
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,860
Still in the process of learning.

115
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:29,240
Our boss is a really, really good architectural designer.

116
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,800
He had won a lot of international awards at a young age.

117
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,260
He's handsome and talented.

118
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,839
Anyway, he's just so outstanding.

119
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,600
Super brilliant.

120
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,939
Such a boss...

121
00:07:40,939 --> 00:07:42,880
Must be quite strict, right?

122
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,239
He used to always pull a long face at first.

123
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,560
But now he smiles at me from time to time.

124
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,600
He's the kind of person who would look super handsome when he smiles.

125
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,260
You like him?

126
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,800
How did you know?

127
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,140
I mean... I mean, what made you ask such a question?

128
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,839
Because you only answered my question in one sentence, but

129
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,560
you spent the rest of the time praising him.

130
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,420
I just look up to him.

131
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,079
That's all. I don't have feelings for him.

132
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,700
No feelings at all.

133
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,399
I'm not an employee of your company.

134
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,919
You don't need to be so nervous.

135
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,900
Is it very obvious?

136
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,340
Very obvious.

137
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,100
You're not someone who can lie after all.

138
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,719
If it's so obvious, what if my boss could tell from long ago?

139
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,140
I just drank a little and I am talking too much now.

140
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,079
 I'm done sorting out the proposal. 

141
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,000
 Do you want to come over and have a look? 

142
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,900
 Sure, you can send it to me. 

143
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,079
 The proposal is on my laptop. 

144
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,200
 How about I bring it over to you? 

145
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,600
 Never mind. I'll go over. 

146
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,020
You're right.

147
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,070
Since you and I are just strangers,

148
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:22,720
I'm not afraid to tell you.

149
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,760
Actually, it's really hard for me to not like him.

150
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,240
Although he appears to be quite cold normally,

151
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,250
he's always the first one to appear

152
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,620
when I need help.

153
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,260
And he does it very naturally,

154
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:41,839
as if it was just a coincidence.

155
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,740
You'll never expect that he did it intentionally.

156
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,950
He is someone who shines so

157
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,700
brightly wherever he goes.

158
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,020
When you're talking about your boss,

159
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,280
you really did go on and on.

160
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,700
Looks like you're really into him.

161
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,340
We just met.

162
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,279
And I've talked a lot already. I feel a bit embarrassed.

163
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:03,820
I didn't even ask you if you wanted to hear it.

164
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,539
It's okay. I understand.

165
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:08,780
Sometimes, it's easier to talk openly

166
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:11,360
to someone you don't really know.

167
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,759
You speak so highly of this man, even I want to get to know him.

168
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,000
I'll introduce him to you later,

169
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,860
but you must keep what I told you tonight as a secret.

170
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,559
You don't need to. I was kidding.

171
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,940
It wouldn't really matter whether I meet him or not.

172
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,910
One day you'll learn

173
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:31,760
you can run out of curiosity.

174
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,180
Okay, I can't stay in any longer.

175
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,260
I'm feeling a little dizzy.

176
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,940
By the way, I still want to remind you.

177
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,960
Be careful when you're falling in love with your boss.

178
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,900
Be careful not to lose your love and your job.

179
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,060
Got it.

180
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,700
I only admire him.

181
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,659
I have no other intentions.

182
00:11:50,659 --> 00:11:52,520
I'm leaving. I'll send you the photos later.

183
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,020
Okay.

184
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,660
See you.

185
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,959
- Bye-bye. 
 - Bye-bye.

186
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,300
Okay.

187
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,800
Then send it to me.

188
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,480
 Who is it? 

189
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,000
Gu Chuan.

190
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,260
 Director Gu, the proposal is on my laptop. I've left it on the table. 

191
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,560
 Please come in and get it. 

192
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,959
Director Gu, this proposal is quite urgent.

193
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,839
I suggest that you review it while I amend it concurrently.

194
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,619
It's more efficient this way.

195
00:13:23,619 --> 00:13:27,380
It's okay. I can amend it myself after I'm done reviewing it.

196
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,700
Director Gu,

197
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,500
I have a question to ask you.

198
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,060
What is it?

199
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,719
Were you so busy working on the proposal this entire time in your room

200
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,600
that you didn't even leave yourself any time to get changed?

201
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,010
What's wrong?

202
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:51,900
All these years, I've never seen you relax.

203
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:55,060
It's like you're constantly preparing for war.

204
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:58,519
Director Gu, you're already very exceptional.

205
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,401
You're a top-notch architectural designer in our industry.

206
00:14:01,401 --> 00:14:04,140
Do you have to be number one?

207
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,900
I have never competed with anyone.

208
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:11,000
I'm just trying to accomplish my own goals.

209
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,940
Apart from winning the Jin An Award, do you have any other plans?

210
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,800
Acting mysterious.

211
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,960
Haven't I always been like this?

212
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,260
You've changed a lot recently.

213
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,520
You've become more bubbly and you like to smile now.

214
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,080
Is it because of Jiang Xiaoning?

215
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,440
Perhaps.

216
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,980
Looking at her reminds me of myself

217
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:47,240
when I first got into the company.

218
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,839
I was about the same as her.

219
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,880
I was a fresh and inexperienced graduate,

220
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,439
running around every day.

221
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,960
I seemed to have endless energy.

222
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,559
Chasing after you every day with tons of questions.

223
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,860
Even messed up a lot of stuff.

224
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,760
But...

225
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:06,700
it seems that I didn't bring you that much joy.

226
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,560
You know that I'm a pessimistic person.

227
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,180
I will always prepare for the worst.

228
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:20,140
But Jiang Xiaoning is the opposite of me.

229
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,970
I can feel an extremely strong

230
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:26,100
sense of optimism from her.

231
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,600
No matter how bad things get, she can always turn it around.

232
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,940
For example, I like to cut to the chase.

233
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,700
However, she likes to enjoy the process.

234
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,660
I like living my life according to my own plan,

235
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,039
realizing it step by step.

236
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,280
But she...

237
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,839
is like an alarm that won't stop going off.

238
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,940
And she makes everyone around her extremely enthusiastic as well.

239
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,150
You could say that she's the opposite

240
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,860
of me in every way.

241
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,720
It's quite interesting.

242
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,060
Then, do you like her?

243
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,980
In what way?

244
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,360
Romantically.

245
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,500
They came out.

246
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,380
The moon and stars are all out.

247
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,680
I don't think I'll fall in love with anyone.

248
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,020
Okay, rest early.

249
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,960
I'll go back to review the proposal.

250
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,120
Jiang Xiaoning, where did you go just now?

251
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:57,780
I went to soak in the hot springs with a friend I just met.

252
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,140
Then the moon came out.

253
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,019
I'll head back first.

254
00:17:11,019 --> 00:17:14,140
Boss and Sister Manlin, let me know if you need anything.

255
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,780
I'll head back as well.

256
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:40,420
 Boss and Sister Manlin must be discussing work. 

257
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:46,160
 But if they were discussing work, 

258
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,240
 why would Sister Manlin wear such sexy sleepwear? 

259
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,470
She's a born beauty,

260
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:59,900
while you're destined to be normal.

261
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,430
After waiting for so long,

262
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,440
the clouds have finally gone.

263
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,820
Why are you sighing over there when you've got what you wanted?

264
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,620
Boss, you showed up out of nowhere.

265
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,700
It's you who was too immersed in your own world.

266
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,720
Jiang Xiaoning,

267
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,200
I think you're quite something.

268
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,230
A lot of things become miracles

269
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,320
the moment they encounter you.

270
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,400
You have to believe it to see it.

271
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,620
Indeed.

272
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,520
The moon is quite pretty.

273
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,880
I told you so.

274
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,900
Okay.

275
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,099
You've seen the moon.

276
00:19:12,099 --> 00:19:13,839
Now you should go back and rest.

277
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,940
How about you, Boss?

278
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,500
I still need to work.

279
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,559
Su Manlin just gave me some proposal to read.

280
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,800
I need to check it through one more time.

281
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,060
Do you need my help?

282
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,590
The only thing you can help me with

283
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:29,180
now is to get inside and rest.

284
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,079
Good night, Boss.

285
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,119
Good night, Boss. Good night.

286
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,340
Was Boss giving me an explanation?

287
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,540
Was he? Was he?

288
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,530
Doesn't matter.

289
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:50,480
I'll take it as an explanation.

290
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,160
They really were discussing work.

291
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,620
Jiang Xiaoning, how could you misunderstand your boss?

292
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:58,180
Is there something wrong with your brain?

293
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,900
I'm working. Why are you here again?

294
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,660
I missed you, so I came to see you.

295
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,900
Didn't I tell you that we should just be friends?

296
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,519
You did. I'm giving you these flowers as a friend.

297
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,460
Lilies.

298
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,360
So you will treat me as your mother now?

299
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,599
Thank you, friend.

300
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,160
Goodbye, friend.

301
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,120
I don't have much to do.

302
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,559
But I do.

303
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,399
What do you have to do?

304
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,159
Why should I tell you?

305
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,560
Zhao Yan.

306
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,420
What's going on?

307
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,960
Who is this?

308
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,959
My cousin.

309
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,260
Cousin?

310
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,520
Oh, your cousin.

311
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,019
- Hello, cousin. 
 -  Hello.

312
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,200
All right, I'll wait for you at the restaurant.

313
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,800
Okay.

314
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,820
Oh, by the way cousin,

315
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:10,400
if you're free, you can join us.

316
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,559
Who was that? Why did you say I'm your cousin?

317
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,400
Your company doesn't allow their employees to date?

318
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:24,140
Since you've already met him, I'll tell you the truth then.

319
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,800
My boyfriend.

320
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,159
What did you mean by that?

321
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,659
I'm still too young and lmost fell for it.

322
00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:38,340
I don't believe you'll choose someone like that to be your boyfriend.

323
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,379
Believe it or not. It's up to you. I've already told you.

324
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,879
Don't think you can trick me into leaving by using some random person as an excuse.

325
00:21:45,879 --> 00:21:48,320
I don't need to trick you.

326
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,160
Do you think I'm three?

327
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,460
You expect me to believe you're dating...

328
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,980
a greasy middle-aged man like him?

329
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,300
Manager Wei.

330
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,940
You're here, Yan Yan.

331
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,020
Where's your cousin?

332
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,599
He was just dropping something off. He left already.

333
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:10,219
Okay. Close the door and sit.

334
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,640
Originally, I planned on having your cousin join us.

335
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,980
Is he your boyfriend?

336
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,160
No.

337
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,959
It's not a big deal.

338
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:29,479
We're in the 21st century.

339
00:22:29,479 --> 00:22:33,319
We're all adults. It won't affect anything. It won't.

340
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,500
Come on. Are we really drinking at noon?

341
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,820
What's the matter?

342
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:44,019
I'll call the company and tell them that we're doing fieldwork together.

343
00:22:44,019 --> 00:22:46,450
Then, on this beautiful afternoon,

344
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:48,750
let's find a hotel and enjoy our downtime together.

345
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:51,899
When it's time, we'll "clock off" and head back to our own places.

346
00:22:51,899 --> 00:22:54,420
No one will be affected.

347
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,259
Sir, you can't do this.

348
00:22:56,259 --> 00:22:57,879
I apologize for interrupting.

349
00:22:57,879 --> 00:22:59,679
Is this your friend?

350
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,580
Cousin!

351
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,279
We know each other. You can leave the room now.

352
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,779
I was looking for you. Come on. Take a seat

353
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,079
Your appearance says that you're a boss.

354
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:17,019
How should I address you? Here's to you.

355
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:21,080
It's just a name.

356
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,280
Call me brother-in-law.

357
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,380
Sister.

358
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,520
Brother-in-Law.

359
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,100
Here's to you, Brother-in-Law.

360
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,779
Look at your cousin.

361
00:23:51,779 --> 00:23:53,900
So polite and knows the ways of the world.

362
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,360
Cheers, cousin.

363
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,399
Cousin? You're the cousin.

364
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:03,520
Your whole family are cousins!

365
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,339
Stop it, Xu Chengran!

366
00:24:05,339 --> 00:24:08,319
What are you doing? Let go!

367
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:10,100
Stop!

368
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,079
 Crazy. Get up. 

369
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:17,519
 Get up. Manager Wei, are you all right? 

370
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:19,380
Let's go!

371
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,219
- Are you crazy! 
 - I am.

372
00:24:23,219 --> 00:24:25,759
I just wanted to test if I'll be able to act crazy for you this one time.

373
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:27,179
Are you done testing? If you're done, just leave.

374
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:30,199
I just have one question. Why did you pick someone like him over me?

375
00:24:30,199 --> 00:24:32,059
- Because he's better than you. 
 - I didn't see that.

376
00:24:32,059 --> 00:24:34,419
- You have to look deeply into his inner self. 
 - My inner self is outstanding,  too.

377
00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:35,759
The you right now is clearly not outstanding.

378
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,219
That's because you said he's better than me.

379
00:24:37,219 --> 00:24:40,759
You're just getting worse if you keep acting like this. Leave. Stop embarrassing me!

380
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:45,700
â™«  You're the haze in my sky  â™«

381
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:51,000
â™«  A disaster for my clear blue sky  â™«

382
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,400
You're right.

383
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:58,220
I am insane to embarrass myself for a woman with mental problems.

384
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,919
It's not worth it.

385
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:03,600
â™«  But who asked me to love  â™«

386
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,140
â™«  Who asked me to love  â™«

387
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,700
â™«  I love this bad guy  â™«

388
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,160
â™«  I want to rely on you  â™«

389
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,720
â™«  But who asked me to love  â™«

390
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,260
â™«  Who asked me to love  â™«

391
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,839
â™«  I have no idea  â™«

392
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:21,240
â™«  I won't let go  â™«

393
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,780
â™«  I adore you for no particular reason  â™«

394
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:26,080
â™«  This unreasonable love  â™«

395
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,860
â™«  I can't explain but just want to  â™«

396
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,780
â™«  mess around with you  â™«

397
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,360
â™«  Come on, let's hurt each other  â™«

398
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,259
â™«  If you dare to love, you have to be ready to get hurt  â™«

399
00:25:36,259 --> 00:25:38,960
â™«  We thank our fate  â™«

400
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,340
â™«  We all deserve it  â™«

401
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,020
â™«  But who asked me to love  â™«

402
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:46,579
â™«  Who lets me love  â™«

403
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:49,099
â™«  I have no idea  â™«

404
00:25:49,099 --> 00:25:52,920
â™«  I won't let go  â™«

405
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:06,020
My Chuan, where are you?

406
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,440
Chuan.

407
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,600
Next time, can you come and find me when you're sober?

408
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:22,139
I'm in so much pain. Can you see?

409
00:26:22,139 --> 00:26:23,860
See what?

410
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:28,300
My heart... is broken.

411
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,300
I see your moral integrity has shattered into pieces.

412
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,000
You're not wrong.

413
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,720
But why did Yan Yan do that?

414
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,859
We have already done everything.

415
00:26:40,859 --> 00:26:43,340
Why did she change her attitude all of a sudden?

416
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:47,300
Or... she just wanted my body?

417
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:51,799
I really don't want to talk to you. You're so gross.

418
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:54,680
Do whatever you want. I'm going to sleep.

419
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,750
Don't leave. Chat with me.

420
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:59,210
I'm so sad that I want to die.

421
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,979
You're so sad that you want to die?

422
00:27:01,979 --> 00:27:04,839
Then die. I'm not going to stop you.

423
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:14,680
You're right. I'll go die.

424
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:25,280
When he left me there alone,

425
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,480
I was in shock.

426
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,560
The palms of my hands started to hurt.

427
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,660
I hope he's not actually mad at me.

428
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,779
What should I do?

429
00:27:37,779 --> 00:27:42,080
I'm just terrified to build this relationship with him.

430
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,320
What are you scared of?

431
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:53,939
Have you watched this movie called "Memories of Matsuko"?

432
00:27:53,939 --> 00:27:55,640
Nope.

433
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,180
"I apologize for being born as a human."

434
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,460
What are you talking about?

435
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,700
A quote from the movie.

436
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,139
The leading female character grew up without her father's love.

437
00:28:09,139 --> 00:28:14,320
She became this person who desperately wanted to be loved by others.

438
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,580
I don't want to be that kind of person.

439
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,860
I can live happily by myself.

440
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,980
I don't need love.

441
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:25,720
In my opinion, you really hurt him this time.

442
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,900
Do you not regret it?

443
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,420
You know.

444
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:34,979
I originally thought that he was one of those playboys

445
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:36,840
who could cut things off easily.

446
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,920
I didn't expect him to be this serious.

447
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,920
You're right.

448
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,660
It does not feel good to act so carefully

449
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,990
and to be so afraid of losing someone.

450
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,980
Xiaoning, I need to warn you.

451
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:58,040
Are you still going to have this crush on your boss?

452
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,620
I'm afraid that you'll get hurt.

453
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:13,540
Sometimes... it's good to keep a distance.

454
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,100
Should we keep a distance?

455
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,580
Why are you so quiet today?

456
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,659
I'm not, Boss. I'm trying to focus on driving.

457
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,440
 I still need to warn you. 

458
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,540
 You need to think it through whether you still want to have this crush on your boss. 

459
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:09,820
 Sometimes, keeping a distance might be a good thing. 

460
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,820
 We are indeed from two different worlds. 

461
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:31,480
Is this what you refer to as focusing on driving?

462
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,559
I'm sorry, Boss. I'll drive slowly.

463
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,740
What did you do last night?

464
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:42,160
I... drank a little with Sister Yan Yan.

465
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,640
Are you sober now?

466
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,640
I'm sober.

467
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:55,180
Jiang Xiaoning, I hope that you can focus when you're working.

468
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,459
Do you hear me?

469
00:30:56,459 --> 00:30:59,440
Yes. I'm sorry, Boss.

470
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,799
 Now, it looks like they're from the same world. 

471
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,540
   

472
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:56,599
Sister Wenwen, I saw the pictures you sent me. They're wonderful.

473
00:31:56,599 --> 00:31:58,770
How can I show my appreciation?

474
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,579
If you really want to thank me, help me design my photography exhibition.

475
00:32:02,579 --> 00:32:04,220
Me?

476
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:07,899
I would love to, but I'm still an assistant. I'm not qualified.

477
00:32:07,899 --> 00:32:11,140
What about recommending a professional designer to you?

478
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:15,119
Sure. Help me set up an appointment with a designer and have them come over.

479
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:16,279
I'll send you the address.

480
00:32:16,279 --> 00:32:18,320
 Okay. 

481
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,940
Come on in.

482
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,420
You sober?

483
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,659
Boss, I'm not an alcoholic.

484
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:42,860
How can I not be sober at this time?

485
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,379
So, what is it?

486
00:32:45,379 --> 00:32:48,179
Do you remember the photographer I told you about last time?

487
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:51,639
She's going to hold a photography exhibition and she wants our company to help her design it.

488
00:32:51,639 --> 00:32:54,739
Sure. Just talk to Su Manlin.

489
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,240
Why Sister Manlin?

490
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,739
She's responsible for all the arts-related projects in the company,

491
00:33:02,739 --> 00:33:06,400
including that art gallery project from before.

492
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,519
What? Is there a problem?

493
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:14,279
No. It's just I spoke highly of you in front of her.

494
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:18,279
I said you're extremely talented, elegant, handsome.

495
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:21,160
Definitely a top-notch designer in the industry.

496
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:24,800
If you can't go, I'm afraid that she'll be disappointed.

497
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,619
Go to Su Manlin. She can definitely handle it.

498
00:33:29,619 --> 00:33:32,679
Okay. I'll leave then.

499
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,060
   

500
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:07,660
 Hello? 

501
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:10,460
Director Xu, the money has been transferred.

502
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:13,799
- I transferred the construction payment from before to... 
  - All right. 

503
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,520
I don't need the details, as long as it has been done.

504
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:20,379
 But the numbers on the book are really different. 

505
00:34:20,379 --> 00:34:22,618
If someone checks it, they'll know for sure.

506
00:34:22,618 --> 00:34:24,559
- I'm worried... 
  - No need to worry. 

507
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,059
Even if someone does check, they'll never know it's you.

508
00:34:27,059 --> 00:34:30,400
Besides, I'm here, aren't I?

509
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,660
Understood.

510
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:36,278
 All right. Don't overthink it. 

511
00:34:36,278 --> 00:34:38,780
Thank you for having so much faith in me.

512
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:43,219
Why are you still so polite with me after all these years?

513
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:48,460
Don't forget to come here to have a meal with me this weekend.

514
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,420
 Yes. 

515
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,040
Good.

516
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,310
Hi, Brother Xu.

517
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:23,440
 Xiaoning, I'll go pick you up tonight. 

518
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,999
 Let's go watch a movie together. 

519
00:35:24,999 --> 00:35:28,279
I'm still at work. Not sure about the plans for the evening yet.

520
00:35:28,279 --> 00:35:30,139
 Okay, I'll let you go then. 

521
00:35:30,139 --> 00:35:33,639
All right, we'll talk later. Let's go another time. I'm hanging up.

522
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:39,219
Jiang Xiaoning, when did you start reporting directly to Director Gu about projects?

523
00:35:39,219 --> 00:35:41,440
I... I didn't.

524
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,139
This photography exhibition project.

525
00:35:43,139 --> 00:35:46,600
Didn't you go over my head and report it to Director Gu directly?

526
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,839
I'm sorry, Sister Manlin. I didn't think it through.

527
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:52,059
Think more before you act next time.

528
00:35:52,059 --> 00:35:53,760
Let's go.

529
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:06,759
Sister Wenwen, sorry you had to wait.

530
00:36:06,759 --> 00:36:08,640
No problem.

531
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,660
This is the Vice President and Design Director, Su Manlin.

532
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:18,779
Sister Manlin, this is my friend. A photographer, Chen Wenwen.

533
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:25,040
Turning this space into an exhibition hall is a nice idea.

534
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,559
The view is unobstructed and the space is large enough.

535
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:29,940
More importantly, the price is reasonable.

536
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:34,299
However, it might be a little difficult to construct.

537
00:36:34,299 --> 00:36:36,739
Transportation of materials will be a problem, too.

538
00:36:36,739 --> 00:36:40,099
And we're not sure if it'll take a long time to receive approval.

539
00:36:40,099 --> 00:36:42,119
That's not a problem. I've got time.

540
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:47,850
- I'm just thinking... 
 - It'll be impossible for the entire space to be used for the exhibition.

541
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,780
That's fine. Half will be enough.

542
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,940
Even half will be too much.

543
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:58,460
My advice is to make a third into indoor space

544
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:01,760
and make the rest into a resting area.

545
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,880
Then integrate some landscaping into the exhibition area.

546
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,919
I don't think that's a good idea.

547
00:37:07,919 --> 00:37:10,420
- Landscaping... 
 - The addition of a garden design

548
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,899
will liven up the atmosphere of this rooftop.

549
00:37:12,899 --> 00:37:17,099
Otherwise, this rooftop will be no different from other rooftops in the CBD. 
  (T/N: Short for Central Business District) 

550
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:21,300
But I prefer this open and boundless feeling.

551
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,740
Let me put it this way.

552
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:29,430
The purpose of accepting smaller-scaled, arts-related projects

553
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:32,139
like this is not to make a profit,

554
00:37:32,139 --> 00:37:35,259
but to accumulate work to get nominated for awards.

555
00:37:35,259 --> 00:37:39,380
So, I urge you to trust our professional artistic vision.

556
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:43,500
We will definitely help you attract people's attention.

557
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:51,100
All right. Let me think about it.

558
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:55,180
Do you have any similar design plans I could refer to?

559
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:58,159
Of course. Please come to our office tomorrow.

560
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:00,619
I can explain everything to you in detail.

561
00:38:00,619 --> 00:38:03,339
Sure. I'll go take a look.

562
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,339
Xiaoning, let's have dinner together.

563
00:38:06,339 --> 00:38:08,720
I'm not off work yet.

564
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,840
It's after business hours already.

565
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:17,459
Why are you looking at me? It's up to you.

566
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,910
When you've made your decision,

567
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:23,020
please let Jiang Xiaoning contact me.

568
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,940
I'll leave first.

569
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,520
Sister Manlin, take care.

570
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:45,379
Sorry, Sister Wenwen, I thought too highly of myself.

571
00:38:45,379 --> 00:38:49,340
I thought I could let Boss handle your project himself.

572
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:53,359
As long as my requirements can be met, it doesn't matter who will be designing it.

573
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:59,440
But I feel like your vice president doesn't like you much.

574
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:04,560
The reason Sister Manlin got angry could be because I went over her head and reported to Boss directly.

575
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,980
It was my fault.

576
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:10,059
You really think she's angry because you went over her head?

577
00:39:10,059 --> 00:39:11,860
What else?

578
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,039
You said so yourself.

579
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:19,420
No girl would not like someone as exceptional as your boss.

580
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:23,580
Maybe she's mad because you're too close to your boss?

581
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,780
Do you think so?

582
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,780
I'm just guessing.

583
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:32,580
Sister Wenwen, how could you know so much about relationships?

584
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:39,680
Sometimes, a heart-breaking experience will make you grow up.

585
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:44,439
So I envy you for having someone you like so much.

586
00:39:44,439 --> 00:39:45,919
Cherish it.

587
00:39:45,919 --> 00:39:49,200
Don't wait until you miss it to regret it.

588
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:54,160
I do want to cherish it, but I don't even have the courage to make a love confession.

589
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,100
How come?

590
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:01,419
Like one of my older sisters said, Boss and I grew up in different environments.

591
00:40:01,419 --> 00:40:03,039
We have different life experiences.

592
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,440
Not to mention our outlooks and horizons.

593
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,459
This is not the Jiang Xiaoning I know.

594
00:40:09,459 --> 00:40:11,039
Being in love with someone.

595
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,579
You need to have trust first and then courage.

596
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:15,879
Aren't you a courageous person?

597
00:40:15,879 --> 00:40:20,439
But you said yourself. One has to be careful when falling in love with their bosses?

598
00:40:20,439 --> 00:40:22,700
Love always comes first.

599
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,440
Just eat first.

600
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:43,879
 If you're drinking again tonight, don't come to pick me up tomorrow. 

601
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,899
 I told you I'm not an alcoholic. 

602
00:40:47,899 --> 00:40:49,179
 I'm already getting ready for bed. 

603
00:40:49,179 --> 00:40:51,060
 Good night, Boss. 

604
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,059
- Sister Wenwen. 
 - Xiaoning.

605
00:41:15,059 --> 00:41:17,220
- This way, please. 
 - Okay.

606
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,600
This way.

607
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:29,100
   

608
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,460
Sister Wenwen.

609
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,120
Boss.

610
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:02,060
Gu Chuan.
