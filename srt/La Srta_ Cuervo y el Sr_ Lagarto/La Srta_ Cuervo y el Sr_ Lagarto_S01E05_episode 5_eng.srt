â™«  I can't help but feel a little happy  â™«

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,679
â™«  I can't help but feel a little nervous  â™«

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,819
â™«  The earth is turning because of you  â™«

5
00:00:25,819 --> 00:00:28,219
â™«  Without you, the earth stops  â™«

â™«  You are the rainbow that fills up the black and white  â™«

â™«  I was once obsessed with the legend of the four-leaf clover  â™«

8

â™«  I dreamed of a white-horse carriage and 
you becoming my prince  â™«

â™«  Your gaze is too seducing, please save me  â™«

â™«  I'm turning into a moth, flying towards the fire  â™«

11
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,020
â™«  Your smile is dancing on your lips  â™«

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,580
â™«  Am I the happiness you're looking for?  â™«

â™«  Holding your hand, let's count down to happiness  â™«

15
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:19,600
â™«  I can't help but be a little fragile  â™«

16
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,219
â™«  I can't help but feel a little gloomy  â™«

17
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:26,519
â™«  The sky is bright because of you  â™«

18
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,940
â™«  Without you, the sky is grey  â™«

00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:33,349
â™«  You are the angel who takes away all loneliness  â™«

20
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:37,000
   

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,950
   

22
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,980
Director Gu, did my flower drawing really bring you inspiration?

23
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,399
It did help.

24
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:48,759
I'm so happy!

25
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,550
To think that the flower I drew could bring you inspiration.

26
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:56,731
Not only the flower you drew but also your attitude towards life.

27
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,449
I didn't know I could be of such use.

28
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,729
That's the highest praise I could possibly receive.

29
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:04,249
But you suddenly said so much to me,

30
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,370
I need some time to digest everything.

31
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,060
Jiang Xiaoning.

32
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,060
Director Gu.

33
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:18,740
From now on, you can call me Boss.

34
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,460
Why? Before...

35
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,340
That was before.

36
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,539
Didn't you say that bosses always have a straight face?

37
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:29,759
In the future, I hope you'll constantly remind me

38
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,880
to not always have a straight face, to be happier.

39
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,800
Yes, Boss.

40
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,360
- Also... 
 - Boss, please go on.

41
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,760
Your drawing is really ugly.

42
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,619
I was just drawing casually.

43
00:02:48,619 --> 00:02:50,119
The drawing is ugly, but it's the thought that counts.

44
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,020
Boss.

45
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,880
Everyone,

46
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,359
we're officially signing the contract

47
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,579
for the resort project in two days.

48
00:03:04,579 --> 00:03:05,679
Signing?

49
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,900
That means we've sealed the deal?

50
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,400
Yes.

51
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,199
Great!

52
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,399
I thought all that work was for nothing.

53
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,760
Director Gu, doesn't great news like this deserve a celebration?

54
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,579
Yes, yes, yes! Director Gu, how about going out and treating us to a feast?

55
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:31,820
â™«   Fireflies all around   â™«

56
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,980
Sure.

57
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,359
Manlin, decide on a place with everyone. I'll pay.

58
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,679
Then you have to join us.

59
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,119
That's right, Director Gu.

60
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,439
Join us.

61
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,879
You've never gone out with us together.

62
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:45,879
They're right. Director Gu, join us.

63
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,759
I'll pass.

64
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:49,179
It'll be boring if you don't come. Let's have fun together.

65
00:03:49,179 --> 00:03:50,999
That's right! Come with us.

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,959
 Come with us! Come with us! 

67
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,260
All right.

68
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,799
Those who don't come will be considered as being absent from work.

69
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,759
Oh right! One more thing.

70
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,620
Wang Kai, give Jiang Xiaoning a desk.

71
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,000
A desk?

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,159
As of today,

73
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,639
Jiang Xiaoning has officially passed her probation period.

74
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,639
â™«  One, two, three, count with me  â™«

75
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,620
â™«  If the youth is precious, then cheers  â™«

76
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,518
â™«  Those passionate dreams follow my command  â™«

77
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,579
Thank you, Boss! Thanks, everyone!

78
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:21,740
â™«  Chase recklessly, long live the young  â™«

79
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,919
Give it your all. Those who contribute to the company will be rewarded.

80
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,621
â™«  You are the most perfect when full of vitality  â™«

81
00:04:26,621 --> 00:04:27,700
Reward?

82
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,790
â™«  If the youth is precious, then cheers  â™«

83
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,940
Xiaoning, congrats, congrats, congrats!

84
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,620
- You're awesome. 
 - What is the reward?

85
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,639
I... I've never gotten one.

86
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,600
How should I know?

87
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,159
What reward? What is the reward?

88
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,199
I don't know either.

89
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,819
â™«  You are the most perfect when full of vitality  â™«

90
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:43,319
It's rare for Director Gu to join us.

91
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,860
How about having him say a few words?

92
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,559
No need to applaud.

93
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,880
I don't have anything to say.

94
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,320
Boss.

95
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,899
Make sure to enjoy yourselves tonight.

96
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:08,680
I'm happy to have this meal together with everyone.

97
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,700
Come one, dig in.

98
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,440
This looks pretty good.

99
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,259
There... There aren't any wet wipes around.

100
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:21,179
Waiter!

101
00:05:21,179 --> 00:05:22,600
I'll go.

102
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,500
Xiaoning, get me an empty cup.

103
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,580
Xiaoning, Brother Kai wants a wet wipe, so do I. Thanks.

104
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,720
Wet wipe, wet wipe, empty cup.

105
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,599
- Anything else? 
 - That's all.

106
00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:33,440
Manlin, get a waiter.

107
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,600
We shouldn't let our people run around doing errands.

108
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,000
Okay.

109
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,439
Xiaoning, we couldn't have gotten

110
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,559
this resort project done without you.

111
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,140
How about a toast to that?

112
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,919
Thank you. Thanks, everyone.

113
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,520
Thank you, thank you.

114
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,599
Xiaoning, I heard He Sheng gave you a hard time.

115
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,739
He's difficult to deal with.

116
00:06:05,739 --> 00:06:06,699
Thanks for your hard work.

117
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,400
It's my job.

118
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,240
- Thanks. 
 - Cheers.

119
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:21,700
Xiaoning, shouldn't you say something to Director Gu?

120
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,019
Thanks.

121
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:27,420
Qi Hong!

122
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,319
Director Gu never clinks glasses with anyone.

123
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,959
Are you setting Xiaoning up for trouble?

124
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,679
We are us, Jiang Xiaoning is Jiang Xiaoning.

125
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,380
It's different.

126
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:42,700
Boss, I'm really grateful to you and Manlin.

127
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,800
Here's to you.

128
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,239
I don't drink.

129
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:49,220
It's okay, I'll drink.

130
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,060
- She finished her drink. 
 - Right.

131
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,300
One more thing.

132
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,680
I'd like to ask for your forgiveness.

133
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,140
What?

134
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,200
Could you stand up?

135
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,479
I was drinking for liquid courage.

136
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,599
All my words of gratitude are expressed in this hug.

137
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,480
Thank you, Boss.

138
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,719
What is going on?

139
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,559
You called me here to watch this?

140
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,300
Public confession, a hug filled with love?

141
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,940
Thank you, Manlin. Thank you, thank you.

142
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,560
 Xiaoning must be drunk. 

143
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,600
She drank too much, too much.

144
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,079
Let's drink to the hug of love.

145
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,999
Cheers! Cheers!

146
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,879
Let's drink to the hug of love. Cheers, cheers.

147
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,560
Cheers.

148
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,119
You and Jiang Xiaoning.

149
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,480
Don't!

150
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,600
I know what you're thinking.

151
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,460
There is nothing between me and her.

152
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,279
You went to meet a big shot like Director Qin,

153
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,959
and you only brought her with you.

154
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,180
That has got to be the first time in years?

155
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,260
I just wanted her to know that the problems from before

156
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,180
had nothing to do with her.

157
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:31,020
Chuan, if you feel something, just go with it.

158
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,680
Your eyes say you're taking it seriously.

159
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,420
Everyone is enjoying themselves, are you sure you want to leave now?

160
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,640
Yes, I'll leave first.

161
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,660
All right.

162
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,039
Call a designated driver then.

163
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,140
I won't drop you off.

164
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,899
I'm going to drop Manlin off later.

165
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:54,719
That old pervert He Sheng has been after her for a while.

166
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,319
Now that he has been fired, who knows what he'll do?

167
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,999
I'll drop Manlin off, just to make sure she's safe.

168
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,740
All right, I'm leaving it to you.

169
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,999
Boss! Boss!

170
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,520
Boss!

171
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,519
I'll leave you to it.

172
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,760
Boss, wait for me. I'll go get the car right now.

173
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,999
You drank.

174
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,340
You want to go to jail for drunk driving?

175
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,659
Boss, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have drunk.

176
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:21,759
I'm leaving now.

177
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,499
See you at the office tomorrow.

178
00:09:23,499 --> 00:09:25,000
Bye-bye.

179
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,879
How about I give you a lift?

180
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:28,839
It's about to rain.

181
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,339
Boss, I'm pretty sober.

182
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:31,319
I'm not drunk.

183
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,159
I know which bus to take.

184
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,900
- I'm not drunk, not drunk. 
 - All right.

185
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,380
Boss! Boss.

186
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,479
You're the boss. Boss.

187
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,539
I wouldn't have drunk if I had known.

188
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:45,239
Could've earned some extra money as a designated driver.

189
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,360
Even now, you're still thinking about earning money.

190
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,420
You're really something.

191
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,680
Yes, Boss.

192
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,720
Boss, you look kind of handsome.

193
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,140
You really are drunk.

194
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,460
You smiled!

195
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,820
That's right!  You should smile more often.

196
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,920
You look like a mannequin when you don't smile.

197
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,239
Okay, okay, okay.

198
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,500
You're drunk, so everything you say is right.

199
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,479
Not drunk. Not drunk.

200
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,840
We're here?

201
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,780
Okay.

202
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,279
Thank you for driving me home, Boss.

203
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,500
Are you sure you can get home by yourself all right in this state?

204
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,180
I'll be fine. Don't worry, Boss.

205
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,259
It's just through here.

206
00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:23,719
You go on home and rest.

207
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,040
Let me know when you get home.

208
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,039
Okay. Bye, Boss.

209
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,999
You go first.

210
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,239
I'm going then.

211
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,600
Go home.

212
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,639
I'll be fine.

213
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,779
Bye, Boss.

214
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:34,380
Bye.

215
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,180
Kind of drunk.

216
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,360
Hopefully, I didn't do anything stupid.

217
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,440
No,

218
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,580
I can't go home like this.

219
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:04,040
Can't let Grandma smell the alcohol.

220
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,280
Let me walk it off before going home.

221
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,040
Zhao Yan.

222
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,319
Why are you here?

223
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,479
To discuss our collaboration with Manager Wei

224
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,420
and to treat you to dinner.

225
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,659
I'm on a diet. I'm not eating.

226
00:12:35,659 --> 00:12:37,839
Speak to Manager Wei directly about the collaboration.

227
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,040
Stop resisting. You need a man.

228
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,039
Can you get a mirror to look at yourself?

229
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,320
Whether or not I need a man has nothing to do with you.

230
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,120
Let go of me.

231
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,300
Give me a chance,

232
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,960
and give yourself a chance.

233
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,799
Let go, you filthy woman!

234
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,600
Cursing me out?

235
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,740
I should be okay now.

236
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,720
Boss?

237
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,280
Hey, Jiang Xiaoning, are you home yet?

238
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,440
I... am... home.

239
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:03,799
Don't worry, Boss. I'm fine.

240
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:05,560
What's that sound?

241
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,440
It's nothing, Boss.

242
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,580
Jiang Xiaoning, tell me the truth.

243
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,720
Are you not home yet?

244
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,340
Boss,

245
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,740
I didn't lie to you on purpose.

246
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,479
I was scared that Grandma would smell the alcohol on me.

247
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,500
I wanted to get some air and get rid of the alcohol smell.

248
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,400
Hurry.

249
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,999
Boss, I met someone even drunker than me.

250
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,040
Compared to him, I'm considered sober.

251
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,160
Hi, have some water.

252
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,540
- Thank you. 
 - You're welcome.

253
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,800
- He Sheng? 
 - He Sheng?

254
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,159
Little Miss Designated Driver.

255
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,800
Youâ€¦ What are you doing!

256
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,640
It's really you.

257
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,039
 What a coincidence. 

258
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,560
I've been looking for you desperately but to no avail.

259
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,759
Who knew you would come to me.

260
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:15,379
Give me back my phone. I don't know you.

261
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,740
You've drunk too much.

262
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,940
 I've drunk too much? Could I have found you if I didn't drink too much? 

263
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,559
I... Let me tell you, Little Miss Designated Driver.

264
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,039
You're really something.

265
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:29,819
You caused me to lose my job.

266
00:15:29,819 --> 00:15:32,580
Now the company wants to search my past records.

267
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:36,279
Today, I'll show you who you can mess with

268
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,880
and who you should never mess with in your lifetime.

269
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,999
Let go of me.

270
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,220
- You dare to hit me? 
 - What's wrong with you?

271
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,619
Let go of me! Let go of me!

272
00:15:44,619 --> 00:15:46,220
Let's go.

273
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,260
   

274
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,000
- Move it. 
 - Director He.

275
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,199
- Let's go. 
 - What are you doing?

276
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,999
You'll find out soon enough.

277
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,300
Move it.

278
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,800
 Let's go! 

279
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,179
- Let go of me! 
 - Let go of you?

280
00:16:07,179 --> 00:16:09,660
You wish.

281
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,060
 - Let go of me! 
 - Move it! 

282
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,560
 Director He! 

283
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,400
Move it!

284
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,180
Director He, what are you doing! Director He!

285
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,319
What am I doing? You'll find out soon.

286
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,540
What are you doing? Director He.

287
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:29,500
- Director He. 
 - Little Miss Designated Driver.

288
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,300
- What do you think you're doing? 
 - Boss.

289
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,020
Gu,

290
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,000
I was worried I wouldn't be able to find you.

291
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,580
Stop... Stop... Stop fighting!

292
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,640
Stop fighting! Stop fighting! Stop...

293
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,919
Boss!

294
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,159
Stop fighting!

295
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,959
Stop! Stop fighting!

296
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,800
To hell with you.

297
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,619
- I'm going to kill you. 
 - Boss!

298
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,200
Little Miss Designated Driver.

299
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,240
You shouldn't have messed with me.

300
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:09,440
â™«   When I look at you, I feel like I've been electrocuted  â™«

301
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,630
â™«  Take my hand, don't let it go  â™«

302
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:20,260
â™«   I'll follow you to the end of the world   â™«

303
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,200
â™«   He and she   â™«

304
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,180
â™«   Round and round, losing ground  â™«

305
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:30,830
â™«   Wandering Earth, fading, wiped out  â™«

306
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:34,580
â™«   Round and round, I'll go  â™«

307
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,879
Boss! Boss!

308
00:18:36,879 --> 00:18:38,260
Boss!

309
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,999
Boss! Boss, where's your phone?

310
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,580
I'll call an ambulance for you.

311
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,759
Boss!

312
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,279
Boss, wake up! Boss!

313
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,759
Boss, you can't die! Boss!

314
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,320
Boss!

315
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,940
â™«  Pieces piece together our encounter  â™«

316
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,239
â™«  I'm willing to admit  â™«

317
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,060
â™«  I belonged to you from that moment on  â™«

318
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,139
â™«  I still won't quit  â™«

â™«  Even if I'm driving off the highway  â™«

320
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:07,399
â™«  The clips flash back to awake your silhouette in the shadows  â™«

321
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:13,400

 more clearly, like the night  â™«

322
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,179
Boss, you scared me.

323
00:19:16,179 --> 00:19:19,119
If you had lost your life saving me,

324
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,240
I'd regret it for the rest of my life.

325
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,679
I'm sorry.

326
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,700
I'm sorry, Boss.

327
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,479
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

328
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,260
I'm sorry.

329
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:35,720
I'll take you to the hospital, okay?

330
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,979
I'm sorry, Boss.

331
00:19:36,979 --> 00:19:41,500
Jiang Xiaoning, you talk too much.

332
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,779
I'm sorry, Boss.

333
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:44,999
I don't know what to do.

334
00:19:44,999 --> 00:19:46,900
I'm sorry.

335
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,639
- Director Xu! Director Xu! 
 - Xiaoning.

336
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,720
- Boss. 
 - Chuan.

337
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:04,469
What happened?

338
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,170
How did this happen?

339
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,329
He Sheng drank too much.

340
00:20:08,329 --> 00:20:10,930
He bumped into me and wanted to take revenge.

341
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:15,929
This piece of trash dared to do something like that.

342
00:20:15,929 --> 00:20:18,990
But thankfully, Boss came to my rescue on time.

343
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,490
Chuan,

344
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,450
are you okay?

345
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:24,910
I'm fine.

346
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:29,130
Xiaoning and I will go to the hospital to get patched up first.

347
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:32,310
We'll leave He Sheng to you.

348
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:49,290
   

349
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:04,270
Boss, where did you go?

350
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:06,170
Has your wound been bandaged?

351
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:08,130
Yes, it has.

352
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,989
That's good. The doctor prescribed some medication.

353
00:21:09,989 --> 00:21:12,789
I'll go and get it. You can rest here for a while.

354
00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:14,510
Okay.

355
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:36,130
Tell me. What exactly happened?

356
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,409
This guy's name is He Sheng.

357
00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:39,750
He drank too much and assaulted my friend.

358
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,610
I don't know what happened but then he fainted.

359
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:46,670
I'm guessing he has done too many bad things. It's karma.

360
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:47,969
Check this person's records.

361
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,449
He was indeed electrocuted.

362
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:53,350
In this thunderstorm, especially outside, in an open area.

363
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,350
He got electrocuted.

364
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:57,209
The IV helped. He'll wake up soon.

365
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:59,269
- Thank you. 
 - No worries.

366
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:02,129
Where's your friend?

367
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:04,570
Injured. Receiving treatment now.

368
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:09,029
Miss Officer, you need to ensure justice is served to evil people like him.

369
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:11,740
Mind your manners.

370
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,889
Don't electrocute me.

371
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:15,490
Don't...

372
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:16,709
Don't electrocute me.

373
00:22:16,709 --> 00:22:19,309
- Sir. 
 - Don't electrocute me.

374
00:22:23,351 --> 00:22:25,191
Sir.

375
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:27,970
Sir...

376
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:31,790
Sir! Let me ask you.

377
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:33,990
What happened?

378
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,490
Police?

379
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:39,229
Pâ€¦ Police? Officer.

380
00:22:39,229 --> 00:22:41,050
I...

381
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:47,369
Officer, Letâ€¦ Let me tell you.

382
00:22:47,369 --> 00:22:49,410
You need to believe me.

383
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,150
Everything I'm saying is true.

384
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:55,830
That person releases electricity.

385
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:59,369
That guy released electricity and electrocuted me.

386
00:22:59,369 --> 00:23:02,530
He electrocuted me twice.

387
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:06,250
I was scared to death. I'm telling you!  Everything I'm saying is true.

388
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,250
It was so scary.

389
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,489
Sir, do you remember how much you drank?

390
00:23:09,489 --> 00:23:12,390
No, I'm telling you. Officer, listen to me.

391
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,890
Have you seen the comics about Pikachu?

392
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:18,349
Let me tell you. He's Pikachu. He electrocuted me.

393
00:23:18,349 --> 00:23:20,689
He... Movies work too. The Flash.

394
00:23:20,689 --> 00:23:23,749
- He's the Flash. 
 - Let go.

395
00:23:23,749 --> 00:23:25,410
That's enough, He Sheng.

396
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:27,929
How much have you drunk? You reek of alcohol.

397
00:23:27,929 --> 00:23:31,709
You assaulted someone and now you're telling lies. Lying to the police.

398
00:23:31,709 --> 00:23:34,189
Just you wait!  You're going to be punished to the full extent of the law.

399
00:23:34,189 --> 00:23:35,790
He's lying.

400
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:38,129
Listen. His friend Gu Chuan is so scary.

401
00:23:38,129 --> 00:23:40,309
- Officer, you mustâ€¦ 
 - Stop being so loud!

402
00:23:40,309 --> 00:23:43,509
This is a hospital. Be quiet.

403
00:23:43,509 --> 00:23:44,369
You're too much.

404
00:23:44,369 --> 00:23:46,169
We've verified his identity.

405
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:47,270
His name is He Sheng.

406
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:50,969
He's involved in a financial crime case and two sexual harassment cases.

407
00:23:50,969 --> 00:23:52,549
He's on bail pending trial.

408
00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:56,580
Oh no, oh no, oh no. My head hurts, I feel awful.

409
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,730
I don't know anything.

410
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:00,310
I'm telling you, stop pretending.

411
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:02,169
How about this? Watch over him.

412
00:24:02,169 --> 00:24:04,109
When he's sober, bring him to the station for questioning.

413
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,089
Okay.

414
00:24:05,089 --> 00:24:07,649
You. Get in touch with your friend.

415
00:24:07,649 --> 00:24:10,369
We need to verify the situation with the other two witnesses.

416
00:24:10,369 --> 00:24:12,570
They're here in this hospital.

417
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,990
Is this your friend's?

418
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:18,670
Yes.

419
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:21,010
Okay, let's go.

420
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:26,229
My head hurts. Let me sleep a little longer, just a little longer.

421
00:24:26,229 --> 00:24:27,729
I feel awful.

422
00:24:27,729 --> 00:24:30,769
He Sheng had too much to drink. I gave him a bottle of water to drink.

423
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:34,610
I didn't have time to react, then he snatched my phone away.

424
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:38,449
He blamed me for causing him to lose his job and dragged me off by force.

425
00:24:38,449 --> 00:24:40,689
Luckily, Boss arrived just in time.

426
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:43,329
He even used the beer bottle to attack us.

427
00:24:43,329 --> 00:24:46,070
My mind just went blank.

428
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:49,250
It was raining heavily then.

429
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:52,199
The thunder was very loud. There was a lot of lightning.

430
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:55,079
Then He Sheng fainted.

431
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,380
Boss and I both got injured.

432
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:01,020
And then, we came to the hospital to get our wounds treated.

433
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:04,429
So according to you, he first obstructed you

434
00:25:04,429 --> 00:25:06,169
at the entrance of your community.

435
00:25:06,169 --> 00:25:07,870
Yes.

436
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,489
I think I more or less understand the situation now.

437
00:25:10,489 --> 00:25:12,910
Go back and rest well tonight.

438
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:17,689
We'll search the surveillance records at the entrance of your community to verify what you said.

439
00:25:17,689 --> 00:25:22,009
As for He Sheng, I'll wait until he's sober to continue with my questioning.

440
00:25:22,009 --> 00:25:25,529
We may reach out to you for your assistance and cooperation in the future.

441
00:25:25,529 --> 00:25:27,209
We'll definitely cooperate.

442
00:25:27,209 --> 00:25:31,170
Even if they don't cooperate, I'll make sure they cooperate.

443
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:34,229
- Okay, I'll be taking my leave. 
 - Let me see you off.

444
00:25:34,229 --> 00:25:35,889
It's okay, thank you. I have the police car.

445
00:25:35,889 --> 00:25:38,610
At least, let me walk you to the hospital entrance.

446
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:54,789
Boss, are you okay?

447
00:25:54,789 --> 00:25:57,710
You don't look too good.

448
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:00,310
Drive me home.

449
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,869
Not waiting for Director Xu?

450
00:26:01,869 --> 00:26:03,010
Let's not wait.

451
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:04,810
Okay.

452
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,839
I already said you didn't have to see me off.

453
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:10,419
I insist. Sorry that you had come here so late at night.

454
00:26:10,419 --> 00:26:12,459
Plus, there are a lot of weirdos out there nowadays.

455
00:26:12,459 --> 00:26:16,760
A pretty police officer like you should be careful out there.

456
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,819
We may contact you if we need anything else in the future.

457
00:26:18,819 --> 00:26:22,539
Okay. Also, ma'am, that He Sheng has always been a drunkard.

458
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:26,019
Lying is in his nature. Make sure you're not fooled by him.

459
00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:27,660
Thank you for your reminder.

460
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,420
Goodbye.

461
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,080
Bye-bye.

462
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,120
Come out.

463
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,820
I'm telling you.

464
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,339
Growing up, even my parents haven't ever hit me.

465
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:49,440
You're too violent.

466
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,080
I'm telling you.  If the test results show that something is wrong with me,

467
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,700
I'm so going to make you pay.

468
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:58,329
And even if you had to hit me, you didn't have to hit me so hard.

469
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:00,869
Let's say you had to hit me this hard, you didn't have to hit me on the face.

470
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,629
Listen. If I don't get any women in the future...

471
00:27:02,629 --> 00:27:05,069
No, if my face is ruined,

472
00:27:05,069 --> 00:27:07,170
what am I supposed to do?

473
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:09,350
Don't come near me.

474
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:13,550
A grown man whining and weeping like that, what an embarrassment.

475
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:14,950
Wait. Who are you?

476
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,529
What has this got to do with you?

477
00:27:16,529 --> 00:27:19,289
My mouth is my own, I can say what I want. Is it your business?

478
00:27:19,289 --> 00:27:21,009
Do you believe I'll hit you?

479
00:27:21,009 --> 00:27:22,209
You want to hit me?

480
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:24,809
You can't even win a fight with her and you want to fight me?

481
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,429
I wouldn't mind compensating you for your injuries along with this pretty lady.

482
00:27:27,429 --> 00:27:30,229
- But can your bodyâ€” 
 - Are you going to get tested for your injuries?

483
00:27:30,229 --> 00:27:31,970
Yes.

484
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:34,710
Just you wait.

485
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:38,890
Do you still remember...

486
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:50,449
Boss, be careful.

487
00:27:50,449 --> 00:27:52,390
I'm fine. You can go home now.

488
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:55,130
Are you sure?

489
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:57,849
But I'm still worried about your condition.

490
00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:00,330
How about I wait a while?

491
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,990
Okay, it's up to you.

492
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:05,190
But don't disturb me.

493
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,870
â™«  Destiny is a little annoying  â™«

494
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,849
â™«  It takes those I care about  â™«

495
00:28:28,849 --> 00:28:32,600
â™«  Away from me  â™«

496
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,449
â™«  If memory is bright  â™«

497
00:28:34,449 --> 00:28:37,490
â™«  It would hold up a lamp in my heart  â™«

498
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:41,149
â™«  And light up the night  â™«

499
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:05,769
â™«  The destined one  â™«

500
00:29:05,769 --> 00:29:07,729
â™«  Guide me forward  â™«

501
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:10,010
 Charging. 

502
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:18,040
â™«  Who is it?  â™«

503
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:38,990
These two didn't even tell me before leaving.

504
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:42,989
I'm hungry. Buy me something to eat.

505
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:44,090
Then starve to death.

506
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:46,029
How about I use the money meant to pay for your tests for your funeral?

507
00:29:46,029 --> 00:29:47,750
No, you...

508
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:51,149
What was wrong with my taste? How did I fall for you?

509
00:29:51,149 --> 00:29:54,510
Looking at you, who would want you?

510
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:57,810
Me. You do have bad taste.

511
00:29:57,810 --> 00:29:59,510
You don't even fancy such a pretty lady.

512
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:01,050
Get your hand off me.

513
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:03,150
I'm helping you.

514
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:04,990
I don't need it.

515
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:12,090
Serves you right.

516
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:15,650
If you touch me again, you'll end up like him.

517
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:17,450
And you, are you going to get tested or not?

518
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:19,610
I don't have time to waste on you.

519
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:23,249
- No, no, no. Not testing. 
 - Me! I want an examination of my wounds.

520
00:30:23,249 --> 00:30:24,650
- Trying to pull a fast one? 
 - No.

521
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:27,509
If it's not convenient for you today, I'll make an appointment with you.

522
00:30:27,509 --> 00:30:29,509
Let's add each other on WeChat. Do you want to scan me or I scan you?

523
00:30:29,509 --> 00:30:31,010
Do you want me to kick you?

524
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:33,969
Yes. As long as it's something you're giving me, I want it.

525
00:30:33,969 --> 00:30:36,870
What's the situation? Who called the police.

526
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:39,110
Officer.

527
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:41,250
Why is it you again?

528
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,669
Hello, Grandma.

529
00:30:53,669 --> 00:30:59,830
Xiaoning, it's so late. Why aren't you home yet?

530
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:01,190
I'm at the office, working on a project.

531
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,830
We were notified that we need to work overtime last minute.

532
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:05,970
Go to sleep. Don't wait up for me.

533
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:07,649
Burning the midnight oil is bad for your health.

534
00:31:07,649 --> 00:31:09,910
Take care of your health.

535
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,090
 Don't worry, Grandma. 

536
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:12,540
Sleep early.

537
00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:14,310
I'm hanging up.

538
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:48,190
Boss.

539
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:55,070
Boss, are you okay?

540
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:15,190
Boss, if there's anything, call me anytime. I'm downstairs.

541
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,970
Take it easy.

542
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:18,970
So you're sure you want to settle?

543
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:19,929
Yes.

544
00:33:19,929 --> 00:33:22,250
Yes. It wasn't me who called the police in the first place.

545
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:26,650
What's the situation with you?

546
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:28,689
Officer, as long as she's willing to compensate,

547
00:33:28,689 --> 00:33:30,249
I can resolve matters peacefully.

548
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:33,790
Officer, can I call the police for workplace sexual harassment?

549
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:36,689
Zhao Yan, don't push it, you!

550
00:33:36,689 --> 00:33:39,829
I initially didn't want to use public resources and bring trouble to the police.

551
00:33:39,829 --> 00:33:41,369
There was a reason why I hit you.

552
00:33:41,369 --> 00:33:45,129
If we're really going to haggle over every ounce, it's not certain who should be compensated.

553
00:33:45,129 --> 00:33:48,129
Fine. Since the police are here today,

554
00:33:48,129 --> 00:33:50,030
let's forget it.

555
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:57,230
Are you okay?

556
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,809
I'm fine, thank you.

557
00:33:58,809 --> 00:34:00,890
Then I'll get going.

558
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:03,970
Take care.

559
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,529
Stay away from this person. Stay safe.

560
00:34:11,529 --> 00:34:13,510
How about I drive you home?

561
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,470
That won't be necessary.

562
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:24,510
Why are you smiling like that?

563
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:29,610
I'll never forget what you did to me earlier.

564
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:32,209
You want revenge? I'll take you on any time.

565
00:34:32,209 --> 00:34:35,120
You seriously humiliated me,

566
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,260
but somehow, I kind of liked it.

567
00:34:37,269 --> 00:34:41,348
Anyway, it's a magical feeling. I've never felt that way before.

568
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:49,109
I don't add strangers on WeChat.

569
00:34:49,109 --> 00:34:52,388
You already hit me. It wouldn't hurt to send me a red pocket.

570
00:34:52,388 --> 00:34:56,090
This way, we can write off whatever happened between us.

571
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:59,109
Plus, after you add me, you can delete me.

572
00:34:59,109 --> 00:35:02,849
You hitting me is a fact. A red pocket is not too much to ask for, right?

573
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:15,950
   

574
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,249
   

575
00:35:17,249 --> 00:35:18,369
Done.

576
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:19,590
Want me to hit you again?

577
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:22,289
Sure. If you want to.

578
00:35:22,289 --> 00:35:23,890
Weirdo.

579
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:29,369
Look. Now that we're starting over, shouldn't we re-introduce ourselves?

580
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:33,049
Hello, Zhao Yan. I'm Xu Chengran.

581
00:35:33,049 --> 00:35:34,869
How did you know my name?

582
00:35:34,869 --> 00:35:36,949
I heard that person call you by your name.

583
00:35:36,949 --> 00:35:39,930
I'm not interested in getting to know you.

584
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:42,010
Don't follow me.

585
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:55,210
   

586
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:02,950
 Charging complete. 

587
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:58,130
â™«  Cicada chirping at the end of the street  â™«

588

â™«  Two sleeping cats  â™«

589

â™«  Coolness after the rain  â™«

590
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:13,810
â™«  Endless dreams  â™«

591
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:18,850

592
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:23,590

593
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:29,070

594

598
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:54,370
â™«  You smile and say hello  â™«

599
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,950
   

600
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:20,590
Hello?

601
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,949
Gu, what happened?

602
00:38:22,949 --> 00:38:27,669
I received a warning that says your heart is discharging a high amount of electricity.

603
00:38:27,669 --> 00:38:29,990
It was an accident.

604
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:34,569
Doctor, why did I lose consciousness for around ten seconds?

605
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:37,090
Does it have to do with the discharge?

606
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:38,890
No, no, no. It's not.

607
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:42,030
That's a protective mechanism in case of an overload.

608
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:44,270
 When the mechanical heart discharges too much electricity, 

609
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:48,249
 the system will take around ten seconds to reboot 

610
00:38:48,249 --> 00:38:49,570
 in order to protect the device. 

611
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:51,969
 Backup power will also be activated simultaneously. 

612
00:38:51,969 --> 00:38:53,569
But you need to be careful.

613
00:38:53,569 --> 00:38:55,590
The reboot is very dangerous.

614
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:59,010
If it takes too long to reboot, brain hypoxia

615
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:02,710
 will put your life in danger. 

616
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,910
Okay, I got it.

617
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:09,310
 Gu, are you in love? 

618
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:10,990
No.

619
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:17,090
Gu, before I resolve these issues, make sure you keep your emotions under control.

620
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:21,729
Falling in love will cause excitement and elevate your heart rate.

621
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:25,450
 Your mechanical heart will discharge electricity and malfunction. 

622
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:28,930
 Holding hands, hugging, kissing, 

623
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:31,389
 intimate physical contact... 

624
00:39:31,389 --> 00:39:35,809
 Every single fluctuation in your emotions will cause fluctuations in your heart function. 

625
00:39:35,809 --> 00:39:39,510
 So, falling in love is a very dangerous thing for you. 

626
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,409
 Stop fighting! Boss! 

627
00:39:41,409 --> 00:39:43,190
 Boss! 

628
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:51,069
 Gu, are you still there? Gu? 

629
00:39:51,069 --> 00:39:52,630
I'm listening.

630
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:53,969
 Don't be so pessimistic. 

631
00:39:53,969 --> 00:39:58,090
 Give me some more time, I'll find a solution. 

632
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:01,569
A solution? You've been saying that for ten years.

633
00:40:01,569 --> 00:40:04,669
Where is the solution? I've heard enough.

634
00:40:04,669 --> 00:40:06,650
I'm hanging up.

635
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:08,290
 Gu! 

636
