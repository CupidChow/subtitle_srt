♫  I can't help but feel a little happy  ♫

♫  I can't help but feel a little nervous  ♫

♫  The earth is turning because of you  ♫

♫  Without you, the earth stops  ♫

♫  You are the rainbow that fills up the black and white  ♫

7
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,739
♫  I was once obsessed with the legend of the four-leaf clover  ♫

8
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:44,440
♫  I dreamed of a white-horse carriage and 
you becoming my prince  ♫

00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,979
   

22
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:44,319
 Help me put this pot above the microwave, I'll take care of the rest. 

23
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,359
Thank you, Boss.

24
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,860
Okay.

25
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,400
Jiang Xiaoning.

26
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,260
When we were eating, I heard your auntie say

27
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:10,160
that your family was involved in a car accident ten years ago?

28
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,020
Was that ten years ago today?

29
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,820
Yes.

30
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,920
Where was it?

31
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,220
It was on the way to the geopark.

32
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,280
It was my birthday that day.

33
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,180
 My dad finally had time to take me to Grandma's place. 

34
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,700
 But on the way there... 

35
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,800
 Dad! A car! 

36
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,079
 Do you remember I told you that I have 

37
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,240
 an eldest brother whom I miss a lot? 

38
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,160
 Actually, 

39
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,480
 that eldest brother was hit and fell off the cliff with us. 

40
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,120
 It was really cold that night. 

41
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,960
He was holding my hand and encouraging me to stay alive.

42
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,220
He even sang the birthday song for me.

43
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,440
 Although he sang in a really low voice, 

44
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,580
 I heard everything. 

45
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,400
 Make a wish. 

46
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,300
 The wishes made on birthdays 

47
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,820
 always come true. 

48
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:31,600
 ♪ Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. ♪ 

49
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:39,240
 ♪ Hope you're happy every day. ♪ 

50
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:51,740
Actually, the birthday song you sang today

51
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,920
was a little special.

52
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Boss, what's wrong?

53
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,880
Nothing.

54
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,499
Have all the dishes been washed?

55
00:04:10,499 --> 00:04:13,360
Let's go to the living room if everything's done.

56
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,060
We'll be leaving then.

57
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,340
Have a safe trip home.

58
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,780
Be happy!

59
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,880
- Bye-bye. 
 -  Bye-bye. 
 -  Bye-bye.

60
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,320
Then... I'm leaving.

61
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,200
You go upstairs first.

62
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,220
You go first.

63
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,640
You first.

64
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,880
You first. I'll wait till you get in the car.

65
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,680
When I get in the car, you're going back.

66
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,080
Hold on!

67
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,200
Don't turn around yet.

68
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:54,159
♫  July, summer  ♫

69
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,219
May I hug you for a while?

70
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,239
♫   A scalding wave of heat is coming   ♫

71
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,540
Today is the saddest day of my life,

72
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:04,680
but also the happiest.

73
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,060
In the past years,

74
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,600
I always spent this day by myself.

75
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,560
But today, I celebrated my first birthday in ten years.

76
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,080
Thank you for being with me.

77
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:22,620
♫   Endless dreams   ♫

78
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:27,520
♫  Diana pink roses  ♫

79
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,260
♫   My heart is wavering like the grass blades   ♫

80
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,600
It's me who should be saying "thank you."

81
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,960
Thank you

82
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,880
for letting me feel the warmth of a family.

83
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,480
Did you know?

84
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:49,840
I haven't been in such an atmosphere in ten years.

85
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,440
It feels very warm and nostalgic.

86
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:03,980
♫  You said hello as you smiled  ♫

87
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,040
Are you really not sensitive to pain?

88
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,640
It's an after-effect from that car crash ten years ago.

89
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,960
Boss, I'll work hard to be happy every day.

90
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,880
- I... 
 - Go ahead.

91
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,600
I just wanted to thank you for accompanying me to the hospital today.

92
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,480
Actually, I didn't mean to not tell you my dad was Xu Guoxiang.

93
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,380
He is your dad whether you choose to tell me or not.

94
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,320
Relax,

95
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,020
I won't tell anyone.

96
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,000
That's not what I mean.

97
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,380
Anyway, thank you for making me feel better.

98
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,780
You don't have to say it.

99
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,220
I know that you must hate me even more now.

100
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,719
But I really didn't mean to hide it from you.

101
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,399
You didn't give me a chance to let me introduce myself to you.

102
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,039
It's unfair.

103
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,040
But now I know you.

104
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,760
Mr. Xu from Xun Lu Group.

105
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,720
Yes! That's me.

106
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,239
But please, I beg you.

107
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,639
Yan Yan, listen to me.

108
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,900
I beg you to give me another chance.

109
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,680
Just one.

110
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,599
I'll prove that I'm serious about you.

111
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,560
Please.

112
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,920
There is no need to beg.

113
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,160
Sure.

114
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,060
I'm saying...

115
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,660
yes.

116
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,200
No.

117
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,600
You said yes. Did… Did you agree?

118
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,100
Yan Yan, you agreed! Yan Yan!

119
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,900
Okay, calm down.

120
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,160
Sorry, I got too excited.

121
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,439
I'm telling you.

122
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,159
I'm warning you!

123
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,799
This chance is offered to Xu Chengran, not Mr. Xu from Xun Lu Group.

124
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,199
I know, I know.

125
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,159
I am Xu Chengran.

126
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,240
Xu Chengran is me.

127
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,980
Why don't you just stay for the night?

128
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,580
Sure.

129
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,599
Drive safely on the way home.

130
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,560
Remember to miss me.

131
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,480
Yan Yan, I love you!

132
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,799
Are you sure you want to drink coffee at this time of the day?

133
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,439
I'm afraid that you won't be able to sleep.

134
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,979
If it wasn't for Gu Chuan, this brat who doesn't care about his life at all,

135
00:10:37,979 --> 00:10:40,760
    
 I wouldn't be working this hard.

136
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,639
If I don't make these improvements possible for his mechanical heart,

137
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:48,359
I'm afraid that the world will lose a top-tier architect in the near future.

138
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,919
But... you haven't had a breakthrough in a long time.

139
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,639
This is the nature of my job.

140
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,100
Maybe I won't make any progress in ten years,

141
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:02,240
or I will make a major breakthrough.

142
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,099
You still have to rest when you need to.

143
00:11:04,099 --> 00:11:06,159
You have to alternate work with rest.

144
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,960
All right.

145
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,920
Let's call it a day.

146
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,239
Breakthrough.

147
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,560
This is the breakthrough!

148
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,320
Right when I needed it.

149
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,920
Charging completed.

150
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,739
Hello?

151
00:11:58,739 --> 00:12:01,020
 Hi, Gu Chuan. 

152
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,919
I'm going to tell you something.

153
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,839
Promise me you will control your emotions.

154
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:10,080
Don't get so excited that you destroy your own house.

155
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,039
Go on.

156
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,020
I'm in the charging station right now. It's safe.

157
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,839
 Since the last episode of your excessive electric discharge, 

158
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,319
 I've been doing different calculations in the lab 

159
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,019
 to try to find a solution to that whole series of errors. 

160
00:12:23,019 --> 00:12:26,080
However, nothing happened.

161
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:32,800
But, just now, a moment ago, the moment that I turned off my computer,

162
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,860
 everything changed! 

163
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,559
So you're saying that...

164
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,420
All of the side effects of your mechanical heart,

165
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,839
the noise, the electric discharge,

166
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,399
and everything else have been solved!

167
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,719
There are only a couple of issues left.

168
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,239
Give me some time and I'll be able to fix everything.

169
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,239
 From then on, you can start living like a normal person again. 

170
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,640
No way.

171
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,759
Are you serious?

172
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:06,679
 I swear to god with my whole career, my assets, and my thesis, 

173
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,120
this is true.

174
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,560
How long would that take?

175
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,679
 Three months. 

176
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,960
 Maximally three months. 

177
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,679
I'm here. I'm here.

178
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,599
I just got home when you called me.

179
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,020
What's up?

180
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,960
I'm coming in now.

181
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,359
No way! What a coincidence.

182
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,679
What if you mistook her for someone else and everything just isn't true?

183
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,520
Today is Jiang Xiaoxing's birthday.

184
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,780
Ten years ago today,

185
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:56,000
we were both in the car accident.

186
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:02,080
Are you sure it was the same car accident?

187
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,880
Yes.

188
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,199
So you're saying the girl you saved ten years go...

189
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,920
is Jiang Xiaoning.

190
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,920
It's such a small world.

191
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,039
I know, right?

192
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,720
I couldn't believe it either.

193
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,600
And you two just...

194
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,520
ran into each other like this.

195
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,800
Not just running into each other.

196
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,600
What else?

197
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,020
Don't leave yet.

198
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,960
What else? Go on.

199
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,580
I don't want to keep running away.

200
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,720
- I… 
 - So you like her?

201
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,500
I knew it.

202
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,200
Why didn't you tell her?

203
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:01,480
Who would accept a boyfriend with a mechanical heart

204
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,360
that can discharge electricity at any time?

205
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,880
How long do you plan to wait?

206
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,020
Three months.

207
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,980
The doctor said that he will fix

208
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:19,160
every single problem that the mechanical heart has.

209
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,720
At that time,

210
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,800
I can live just like a normal person.

211
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,600
Really?

212
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,780
You're saying after three months,

213
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,719
I won't have to drive you, help you drink,

214
00:15:33,719 --> 00:15:37,039
or stare at my phone all day worrying about your heart rate?

215
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,800
Yes.

216
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,219
And that I won't have to worry about you fainting because the battery is running low.

217
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,999
And that I don't need to worry about seeing your suicide note,

218
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,679
your organ donation card, or you just disappearing suddenly?

219
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,420
You're right.

220
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,080
That's great!

221
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,479
This is so sudden.

222
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,840
I don't even know how we should celebrate this.

223
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,060
Let's do this.

224
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:02,380
We're telling Jiang Xiaoning that you like her, now.

225
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:05,540
How can I do that now?

226
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:09,020
I should wait for three more months.

227
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,999
Look at you, so patient.

228
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,239
If I were you, I would be running towards her now.

229
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,199
Destiny decided that you two would come back to each other.

230
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,400
This means she is the one for you.

231
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,760
To be honest,

232
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:29,160
I felt different when I first saw her.

233
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:34,639
Ten years ago, I had a new chance for life.

234
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,859
And when the day all problems of the mechanical heart are fixed

235
00:16:37,859 --> 00:16:40,740
and it can work perfectly finally comes,

236
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,920
it will be another chance for me to start afresh.

237
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,660
I have never...

238
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,220
looked forward to that day this much,

239
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:52,040
like I am right now.

240
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,060
The destiny of you two is just magical.

241
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,260
Oh, right.

242
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,759
The car accident that you just mentioned has reminded me of something.

243
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,780
Does it mean that Jiang Xiaoning's father

244
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,039
was the one involved in the Dong Jiang corruption case?

245
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,379
Jiang Guangda?

246
00:17:10,379 --> 00:17:12,358
How did you know about this?

247
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:14,800
My dad worked for Dong Jiang, too.

248
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,598
After the corruption case, the whole company

249
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,439
was in a chaotic situation.

250
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,559
My dad resigned and started his own business.

251
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,479
He also adopted his colleague's son.

252
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,359
Tang Xu.

253
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,959
Tang Xu and Jiang Xiaoning grew up together.

254
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,300
Your dad adopted Tang Xu.

255
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,160
Does that mean

256
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,160
the three of them knew each other?

257
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,640
Maybe.

258
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,879
The world is just so small.

259
00:17:43,879 --> 00:17:46,079
I'll ask my dad if I get a chance.

260
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,620
Okay, ask your dad when you get a chance.

261
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,959
Now, do you want to go grab a drink?

262
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,160
Now?

263
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,560
Let's wait till your heart is totally fixed.

264
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,400
I really want to drink now.

265
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,579
If you aren't there to watch me, I'll probably end up like I did last time.

266
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,040
Okay.

267
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,060
I'll get to decide how much you drink.

268
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,760
Sure.

269
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,459

270

285
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,799
I'm in a good mood today. I'll drive.

286
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:18,740
But driving is a part of my job.

287
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,599
I said I'm in a good mood.

288
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,040

Why aren't you wearing the hairpin?

292
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,140
I was in a rush this morning and forgot to use it.

293
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,240

00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,020
Nothing's different.

304
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,359
Just like every other day.

305
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,079
You guys never notice anything.

306
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,079
Out of all these years, have you seen Boss like this before?

307
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,279
Of course, I see him every day.

308
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,319
Right, there must be something going on!

309
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,200
Boss was like autumn before.

310
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,200
Today's Boss feels more like spring.

311
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,279
Spring?

312
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,039
    
 Are you playing Landlords?

313
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,700
    
 I think you're just overthinking this.

314
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:50,119
    
 Don't you think that Boss is surprisingly different today?

315
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,860
Not really.

316
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:59,160
It's odder to think all day that some second-generation rich guy wants to date you.

317
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,859
- Qi Hong. 
 - Director Su.

318
00:21:07,859 --> 00:21:10,840
Did you keep the profiles of all the job applicants?

319
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,699
Here. It's here.

320
00:21:13,699 --> 00:21:15,100
Okay.

321
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:43,260
   

322
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,700
Director Su.

323
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,040
Director Su.

324
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,480
Director Su, are you okay?

325
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:07,260
Qi Hong, how can you be so careless as an HR manager?

326
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,759
What did I do? Did something happen?

327
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,479
Jiang Guangda.

328
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,980
Who is that?

329
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,620
Do you not know Jiang Guangda?

330
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:28,960
The architect from Dong Jiang Architecture ten years ago.

331
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,740
The one that smuggled...

332
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,840
Lower your voice.

333
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,339
Smuggled millions of money? Is that the one?

334
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,140
He's Jiang Xiaoning's dad.

335
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,799
This case had such a bad impact on the entire construction industry.

336
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,340
How could you not have done any background checks

337
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,460
and just let her in?

338
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,820
Not to mention that she's Director Gu's assistant.

339
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,160
If our peers find out that we've hired someone

340
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,260
with a background like this,

341
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,200
how would they see us?

342
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,879
What if it gets posted online?

343
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,940
Have you ever thought about what the media would say?

344
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,519
I apologize, Director Su.

345
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,439
It was my problem indeed.

346
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,190
But Jiang Xiaoning is here because you...

347
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,510
What did I do?

348
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,220
You referred her.

349
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,479
I didn't think there would be a problem because

350
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,439
you were the one who referred her.

351
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,260
So I didn't do any background checks.

352
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,940
All right. I'll see what we can do.

353
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,820
Oh, my god.

354
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:43,780
Jiang Guangda.

355
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:47,380
   

356
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,360
Oh, my god.

357
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,599
   

358
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,259
What? You're saying Jiang Xiaoning is the daughter of an embezzler.

359
00:23:57,259 --> 00:23:59,299
Keep it low. Are you trying to get me fired?

360
00:23:59,299 --> 00:24:01,100
Why did no one find out about it earlier?

361
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,160
I'm in HR, not a spy.

362
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:06,759
But this event had a great impact on the entire industry.

363
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,519
It was your fault, too.

364
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,720
How can you lie about this?

365
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,140
Jiang Xiaoning did cover herself up well though.

366
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,500
No wonder why she never talked about her family.

367
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,220
She rode such a fancy car

368
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,500
on her first day of work.

369
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,640
That guy is still giving her rides.

370
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,960
It takes some effort to be able to do that.

371
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,190
You're right.

372
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:29,440
Kids do grow up a little faster in families like this.

373
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,800
You're right.

374
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,859
I grew up with him. He's like my own brother.

375
00:24:33,859 --> 00:24:36,620
It's not like what you think.

376
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:37,940
Xiaoning, don't get us wrong.

377
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:42,700
We just heard it so we were gossiping about it for a bit.

378
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,360
My dad is not a criminal.

379
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,660
Please apologize.

380
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,860
Xiaoning,

381
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:50,940
it is definitely our fault to talk behind your back.

382
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,840
But your dad's case was already decided by verdict.

383
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,500
We're not making things up.

384
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,540
Plus, if your dad didn't do all those things,

385
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:03,020
Dong Jiang Group would not have ended up like that.

386
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,460
The company went bankrupt.

387
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,850
The money that your dad embezzled was mostly

388
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:12,160
pension and compensation for those who left their jobs.

389
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,580
Do you have any idea the number of people who were affected?

390
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,780
Many of them couldn't even afford a meal.

391
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:19,460
I did not wrong him.

392
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,239
I'm repeating this one more time.

393
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,120
My dad is not a criminal.

394
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,660
Xiaoning, it was such a big event.

395
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,759
You could look it up anywhere online.

396
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,060
I didn't make things up.

397
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,660
Chill, chill. Let's not talk about this in the workspace.

398
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,580
We're all colleagues. Don't…

399
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,180
I'm speaking the truth.

400
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,799
That isn't the truth.

401
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,199
My dad is not a criminal.

402
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,700
You must apologize.

403
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,600
There's no need to talk anymore.

404
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,859
- Jiang Xiaoning, what do you want now? 
 - Apologize.

405
00:25:45,859 --> 00:25:47,479
- Let's not do this. 
 - Let go. 
 - Apologize.

406
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:48,759
I told you to let go, did you not hear me?

407
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,779
- Apologize. 
 - Let go!

408
00:25:49,779 --> 00:25:52,999
- Calm down, calm down. 
 - Apologize.

409
00:25:52,999 --> 00:25:54,219
- Jiang Xiaoning, are you crazy? 
 - What are you all doing?

410
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,800
You pushed me?!

411
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,400
Director Gu.

412
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,540
Director Gu.

413
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:09,200
Qi Hong, we've worked together for so many years.

414
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,980
What's wrong with you today?

415
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:14,120
Why did you disclose the confidential information of our employees?

416
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,720
If I knew earlier that my HR manager is someone like this,

417
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,350
should I think this through and see if

418
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:24,600
I can find a better fit?

419
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,000
Director Gu, I made a mistake today.

420
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,540
This will be the last and the only time.

421
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,880
- Sorry, Director Gu. 
 - Sorry, Director Gu.

422
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,959
I'm not the one you should apologize to.

423
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,820
Apologize to Jiang Xiaoning.

424
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:50,940
I'm sorry, Xiaoning.

425
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,680
I made a mistake today.

426
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,220
I'm sorry.

427
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,760
All right, all right. Don't be angry with me.

428
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,760
Xiaoning, I was just gossiping around.

429
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,320
You know what kind of person I am.

430
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,540
Don't take it personally.

431
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,380
Director Gu.

432
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,620
What caused the style change recently?

433
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,320
I'm talking about your clothes.

434
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,000
Did I change?

435
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,319
To be more accurate, I changed back to what I was like before.

436
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,860
Before?

437
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:20,460
Don't tell me you are changing the style of your architecture design as well.

438
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,000
I can't say for sure.

439
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,380
You really have changed a lot.

440
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,740
You got so mad in the meeting room

441
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:32,220
and now you're so relaxed and laughing.

442
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,740
You look like a different person.

443
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,860
Isn't this better?

444
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,880
Is there anything else?

445
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,719
No.

446
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,100
If so, I'll get back to my work.

447
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,700
Boss.

448
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,120
Let me drive.

449
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,999
Don't worry, I'm okay.

450
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,519
I promise I'll drive safely.

451
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,120
Get in the car.

452
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,580
   

453
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,559
 Tomorrow is the weekend. 

454
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,060
 Let me take you somewhere. 

455
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,480
 I'll pick you up at 10. 

456
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,660
 Sure, Boss. 

457
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,340
 A date tomorrow. 

458
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,460
 Sure. 

459
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:08,180
Yes! Yes!

460
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,960
Yes, yes!

461
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,660
Charging.

462
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,759
I got this.

463
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:22,719
I got this tomorrow.

464
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,099
 Let's go! Let's go! 

465
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:36,439
Boss, did something happen recently?

466
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,680
Is there any good news?

467
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,200
Why do you say that?

468
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,970
Your vibe got much more charismatic,

469
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:45,820
like way more!

470
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,100
Have you had breakfast yet?

471
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,279
Not yet.

472
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,439
I knew it.

473
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,580
I got you breakfast.

474
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:56,959
And I knew that you would have something prepared for me.

475
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,220
Would you like to have some before we leave?

476
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,639
I'll eat later.

477
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,199
Let's go! I'm driving today as well.

478
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,259
Sure.

479
00:32:03,259 --> 00:32:05,600
Where are we going?

480
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,480
You'll know when we get there.

481
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,779
Where are you heading, beautiful? I can give you a ride.

482
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,980
You're late.

483
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,580
No, I got here a while ago.

484
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,420
I was watching you from upstairs.

485
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,680
If you are late again, don't come anymore.

486
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,260
I was stuck in traffic.

487
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,100
Don't be mad.

488
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:27,980
Where are we going?

489
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,300
Where do you want to go?

490
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,140
You asked me out and now you want to say where we're going?

491
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,460
Are you doing this or not?

492
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,740
I just want to know if you have a specific place in mind.

493
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:38,460
Of course, my house.

494
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,540
Get in the car!  Let's go.

495
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,420
I'll take you to wherever I decide.

496
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,360
That sounds better.

497
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,200
She likes the dominating style.

498
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,240
   

499
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,440
Boss, Boss, Boss.

500
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,319
Is this a prank?

501
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,780
I can't believe you're bringing me here knowing that I'm very unlucky.

502
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:08,740
You said you were absolutely horrible at this, didn't you?

503
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:11,700
You can catch as many as you want today.

504
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,940
You remembered everything I said?

505
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,659
You're thinking too much. You speak too much.

506
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:17,241
No one can remember all of them.

507
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,539
Stop trying, Boss.

508
00:33:20,539 --> 00:33:23,800
That is mission impossible.

509
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,339
The exhibition will end by the end of this month.

510
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:27,479
Thank god we're here today.

511
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,979
I know. I've always wanted to come.

512
00:33:29,979 --> 00:33:31,119
I know that, too.

513
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:32,220
How do you know?

514
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:35,080
You posted on both Weibo and WeChat.

515
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,080
You did your homework.

516
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,960
Of course.

517
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,860
Are you trying to please me by bringing me here?

518
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,720
Not really.

519
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,320
I work in an art-related field.

520
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,460
Me being here for appreciating aesthetics should be completely normal.

521
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,920
Also, I'm your boyfriend.

522
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,139
It's my job to make my girlfriend happy.

523
00:33:56,139 --> 00:33:59,340
I'm not your girlfriend.

524
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:02,360
Not again. I thought we talked about this that day?

525
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,679
I said to give you a chance to prove yourself.

526
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:08,300
I didn't say that you were my boyfriend.

527
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,600
What?

528
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,880
Great.

529
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,960
I think so, too.

530
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,939
Would you like to try that? That one. Try this.

531
00:34:29,939 --> 00:34:31,400
This one?

532
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,180
Move to the right a little bit.

533
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,960
Forward, forward, forward.

534
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,159
Right, right. Too much, too much.

535
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:02,819
Go more gentle.

536
00:35:02,819 --> 00:35:04,920
To the right.

537
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,120
Move it little by little.

538
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,660
I told you to go right a little bit.

539
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:19,999
It's all your fault. I couldn't focus.

540
00:35:19,999 --> 00:35:22,040
My fault?

541
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:25,779
No way. How can I blame my boss?

542
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,060
Talk.

543
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:52,280
You told me to shut up.

544
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,799
Look at you.

545
00:35:53,799 --> 00:35:55,380
I'm just sad.

546
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,860
Don't try to act cute.

547
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,939
- May I talk? 
 - Yes.

548
00:35:58,939 --> 00:36:00,420
Yesterday, you agreed that—

549
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:03,240
You could say anything except for that.

550
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,800
Then I'll stop talking again.

551
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:13,680
Why didn't I realize you were this compliant?

552
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,800
I was trying to irritate you.

553
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,099
Why?

554
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:22,279
I like you but you always ignored me. So I just wanted to get your attention.

555
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,760
Take a picture for me.

556
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,940
Come here.

557
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,260
Smile.

558
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,220
Let me help.

559
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,460
It's okay, Boss. It's okay.

560
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,400
Why don't you try that one?

561
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,320
That one is easier.

562
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,540
   

563
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:47,919
Boss, maybe I should just give up.

564
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,020
Give it a try.

565
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,920
Come on.

566
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,140
Give it another try.

567
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,700
It's just a picture.

568
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,679
Am I your boyfriend now?

569
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:22,740
No.

570
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,800
Then, what am I now?

571
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,040
Candidate.

572
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,520
How can I pass the test?

573
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,580
It depends on your performance.

574
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:32,000
How should I perform to pass?

575
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,680
I don't know.

576
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,020
There has to be a standard.

577
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:39,040
My standard is...

578
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:44,299
There is none. Just following my feelings.

579
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:49,019
What do you mean? You don't have to if you don't want to.

580
00:38:49,019 --> 00:38:51,060
Don't want to? Impossible.

581
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,879
Whatever my baby says.

582
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,860
Don't call me baby.

583
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,819
Whatever my darling says.

584
00:38:56,819 --> 00:38:57,819
Not darling either.

585
00:38:57,819 --> 00:38:59,919
My queen. Whatever you say.

586
00:38:59,919 --> 00:39:01,859
Okay. Drive me home now.

587
00:39:01,859 --> 00:39:03,520
Of course!

588
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,080
Jiang Xiaoning.

589
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:29,539
Chen Chen? Why are you here?

590
00:39:29,539 --> 00:39:33,460
If I say this is because I can connect with you

591
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:36,640
and came by following your vibes, would you believe me?

592
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,560
No.

593
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,100
Is this your friend?

594
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:43,139
This is Chen Chen. You've met each other at the convenience store.

595
00:39:43,139 --> 00:39:45,240
We studied the same major in university.

596
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,640
I remember now.

597
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,660
Jiang Xiaoning.

598
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,160
Boyfriend?

599
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,399
No, this is my boss. Director Gu.

600
00:39:59,399 --> 00:40:00,840
Boss.

601
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,200
Her boss.

602
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,860
Hello.

603
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,660
Try again.

604
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:21,230
Xiaoning, are you still studying architectural design?

605
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,300
I've been studying by myself.

606
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:32,519
I've registered for this class. It's in the evenings. Shall we be study buddies?

607
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:34,840
Let me think about it.

608
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,619
A little to the right. It's all your fault! You kept talking to me.

609
00:40:41,619 --> 00:40:43,520
Let me do this.

610
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,820
I can't even watch.

611
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,180
Watch carefully.

612
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,100
What happened?

613
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:34,419
The power is out.

614
00:41:34,419 --> 00:41:36,259
I almost got it.

615
00:41:36,259 --> 00:41:39,520
I was this close.

616
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,820
   

617
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:55,830


618
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,619
♫  Destiny is a little annoying  ♫

619
00:42:03,619 --> 00:42:06,599
♫  It takes those I care about  ♫

620
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:10,359
♫  Away from me  ♫

621
00:42:10,359 --> 00:42:12,219
♫  If memory is bright  ♫

622
00:42:12,219 --> 00:42:15,179
♫  It would hold up a lamp in my heart  ♫

623
00:42:15,179 --> 00:42:19,639
♫  And light up the night  ♫

624
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,319
♫  Sunshine alternates with moonlight  ♫

625
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:43,299
♫  Returning to life in time  ♫

626
00:42:43,299 --> 00:42:46,779
♫  Gift me with a dream  ♫

627
00:42:46,779 --> 00:42:51,120
♫  A dream with you in it  ♫

628
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:20,159
♫  The one who caught me off guard  ♫

629
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:24,479
♫  Steps foot into my life...  ♫

630
00:43:28,519 --> 00:43:33,160
♫  It's you...  ♫

633
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:51,220
♫  It's you...  ♫

635
00:43:53,239 --> 00:43:56,339

00:43:56,339 --> 00:44:01,000
