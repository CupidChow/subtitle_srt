â™«  I can't help but feel a little happy  â™«

00:00:18,999 --> 00:00:23,579
â™«  I can't help but feel a little nervous  â™«

00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:25,880
â™«  The earth is turning because of you  â™«

5
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,179
â™«  Without you, the earth stops  â™«

00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:34,920
â™«  You are the rainbow that fills up the black and white  â™«

00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,839
â™«  I was once obsessed with the legend of the four-leaf clover  â™«

8
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:44,539
â™«  I dreamed of a white-horse carriage and 
you becoming my prince  â™«

â™«  Your gaze is too seducing, please save me  â™«

00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:53,300
â™«  I'm turning into a moth, flying towards the fire  â™«

11
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,940
â™«  Your smile is dancing on your lips  â™«

12
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:02,619
â™«  Am I the happiness you're looking for?  â™«

13
00:01:02,619 --> 00:01:07,260
â™«  The doe inside me is lost  â™«

14
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:15,059
â™«  Holding your hand, let's count down to happiness  â™«

15
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,580
â™«  I can't help but be a little fragile  â™«

16
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:24,220
â™«  I can't help but feel a little gloomy  â™«

17
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,579
â™«  The sky is bright because of you  â™«

18
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:28,899
â™«  Without you, the sky is grey  â™«

19
00:01:28,899 --> 00:01:33,339
â™«  You are the angel who takes away all loneliness  â™«

20
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:37,260
   

21
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:41,060
   

22
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:06,000
This uninvited guest comes like a tornado.

23
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,300
Don't talk about him.

24
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,100
How old is he?

25
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,620
What are you insinuating?

26
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,920
Nothing.

27
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,380
What does he look like?

28
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,859
I bet he has quite the look since it bothers you so much.

29
00:02:23,859 --> 00:02:26,020
You may leave now.

30
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,000
Don't keep trying to chase me away.

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,799
With such a nice atmosphere, if I were you, I would have confessed.

32
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,100
And you have to wait for another three months?

33
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,399
Three months later, there's no telling whose girlfriend

34
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,760
Jiang Xiaoning will be.

35
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,400
How did it go for you today?

36
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,260
Well, things went well and were under control, of course.

37
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,340
So, Zhao Yan is still not your girlfriend. Right?

38
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,400
Want to grab a drink?

39
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,980
 Mr. Huang: The address is 189, Guang'an Hutong. 

40
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,840
Brother, do you know me?

41
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,980
Of course.

42
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,540
You don't look familiar to me.

43
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,580
What is it?

44
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,420
Anything I can do for you?

45
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,240
You don't remember me?

46
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,860
I don't think we have met.

47
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,660
Ten years ago,

48
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,479
I asked for your favor.

49
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,060
But you just disappeared.

50
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,039
Do you mean Chen Yun?

51
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,779
That's my brother. He's been dead long ago.

52
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,380
Your brother?

53
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,280
Forget it then.

54
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,020
Hold on.

55
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,920
I can do whatever Chen Yun could.

56
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,180
Pay me and I'll do the job for you.

57
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,380
Really?

58
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,060
Director Xu, he is here.

59
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,820
Director Xu.

60
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:35,360
I've been watching Chen Ao lately and I discovered something.

61
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,860
Go on.

62
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,460
Someone came to see him today.

63
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,799
Who was it?

64
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,400
Gu Chuan.

65
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,799
How could you go and see him yourself?

66
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,680
It's dangerous.

67
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,660
I was looking for an opportunity to get near him

68
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,840
and see if I could worm something out of him.

69
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,799
It's too much of a coincidence.

70
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,639
He actually has a twin brother.

71
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,919
His brother hit me with a car and Jiang Xiaoning's family,

72
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,800
and he assaulted you not long ago.

73
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,280
Don't you think there could be a link?

74
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,180
How would I know?

75
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,879
Which is why I asked for his number

76
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,119
on the pretext of needing his help to see

77
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,240
if I could get anything from him.

78
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,660
I'll go to meet him with you.

79
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,520
Call him and set a date.

80
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,760
All right.

81
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,899
 Hi. The number you have dialed is busy. 

82
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:44,979
-  Please try again later.  
 - No answer?

83
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:46,560
Try again.

84
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,659
How is it? Have you prepared the money?

85
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,300
Looks like he's avoiding you.

86
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,900
   

87
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,720
Assistant Liu, going somewhere?

88
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,559
Chengran? Do you need something?

89
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,780
Do you know this guy?

90
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,679
Yes. Why?

91
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,540
Why did he come to see you?

92
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,039
Our company's new project is launching.

93
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,640
He was a nail house owner there.

94
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,400
Not only did he refuse to vacate his home, he even brought people to cause a ruckus.

95
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,679
We couldn't reach an agreement even after I had a discussion with him here in the office.

96
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,880
He insisted on meeting Director Xu.

97
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,799
Later on, our company secretly gave him more compensation.

98
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,540
Only then did he move out.

99
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,640
I think this photo was taken when he came to get the money.

100
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,020
That explains why he came after me.

101
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:11,100
He went to see you? Are you all right?

102
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,180
I'm fine.

103
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,679
I thought he was just saying it.

104
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,380
I didn't expect he would do it for real.

105
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,500
That's outrageous.

106
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,000
But don't worry. Since he has taken our money,

107
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,400
I bet he won't be coming here anymore.

108
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,919
Okay, I get it now.

109
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,220
Later.

110
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,580
Director Xu, Chengran came asking about it

111
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,900
and I've replied to him as you told.

112
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,399
Also, Chen Ao has been taken care of.

113
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,560
He won't show up ever again.

114
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,080
Director Gu, is there anything else?

115
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,279
There's nothing.  You can get off work now.

116
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,580
Okay.

117
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,579
Boss, may I take a day off?

118
00:10:06,579 --> 00:10:08,700
I can't send you home.

119
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,879
Why?

120
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,539
I have a date with my friends. They're waiting for me.

121
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,679
Sure, go ahead then.

122
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,220
Thank you, Boss.

123
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,220
I'll send you home then.

124
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,739
It's fine. I have a design to work on.

125
00:10:24,739 --> 00:10:26,340
You may go now.

126
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,660
All right then. Don't stay too late.

127
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,960
Okay.

128
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,840
Over here!

129
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,799
Would you like something to eat?

130
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,660
I have no appetite.

131
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,959
Don't be upset.

132
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,820
If this goes on, I'll be in a bad mood too.

133
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,039
It's not that.

134
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,820
Look.

135
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,380
Seriously?

136
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,439
It would take days to tell you the whole story.

137
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,260
I'll tell you everything later.

138
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,719
How about this?

139
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,220
Come over.

140
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,220
What do you think?

141
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,260
That works.

142
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,220
You sure you don't want to eat?

143
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,739
No, I have no appetite.

144
00:11:34,739 --> 00:11:37,099
- Let's talk while we walk. 
 - All right.

145
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,519
- Coming. 
 - Hello.

146
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:46,180
A new friend.

147
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,619
Let me do the introduction. Chen Chen.

148
00:12:47,619 --> 00:12:50,819
- This is my best friend. Sister Yan Yan. 
 - Hi, Sister Yan Yan.

149
00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:54,079
How could you, Jiang Xiaoning? You never told me you knew such a handsome guy.

150
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,679
And you called me your best friend?

151
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,399
She didn't tell me either about her pretty girlfriend.

152
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,319
- Slick. 
 - Of course.

153
00:13:00,319 --> 00:13:03,420
But you're not really my type.

154
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,139
Do you know whose house you are in?

155
00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:08,759
Jiang Xiaoning, before you brought him here, didn't you tell him about my temper?

156
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:10,419
- You come to my placeâ€” 
 - All right now. Stop fighting.

157
00:13:10,419 --> 00:13:12,319
I've bought a lot of food and some self-heating hotpots, too.

158
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,319
I'm starving. Let's eat, all right?

159
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,720
All right then.

160
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,879
Get me one.

161
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,879
I've been craving fish with Sichuan pickles. It drives me crazy.

162
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:20,780
Here, this is for you.

163
00:13:21,722 --> 00:13:23,019
   

164
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,779
I don't get you.

165
00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:28,079
Your family can do more than support you,

166
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,939
but you insist on depending on your own. Why?

167
00:13:30,939 --> 00:13:32,879
I'm not a three-year-old.

168
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,440
Why do they interfere with my life?

169
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,599
In the eyes of parents, their children never grow up.

170
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,239
I'm really envious of you.

171
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,179
If my parents were still alive,

172
00:13:44,179 --> 00:13:47,179
I would let them even if they kept doing that.

173
00:13:47,179 --> 00:13:49,539
Let's drink. Here.

174
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,460
What's with the sigh?

175
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,540
Let's go racing when we have time.

176
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:09,260
If this was the only thing, I wouldn't be so depressed.

177
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,239
Look. Don't get all emotional here.

178
00:14:14,239 --> 00:14:16,539
I hate guys who cry. Leave if you're going to cry.

179
00:14:16,539 --> 00:14:17,959
Don't. Ignore her.

180
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,279
Tell me. What is it?

181
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,980
Xiaoning, I got my heart broken.

182
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,080
I was dumped.

183
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,919
I thought it was something serious.

184
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,179
Out with the old, in with the new. As simple as that.

185
00:14:35,179 --> 00:14:37,179
That's right. Yan Yan knows many people.

186
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:40,219
All kinds of physiques. Take your pick.

187
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,599
You two girls have quite a special way to cheer people up.

188
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,799
Sister Yan Yan,

189
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,739
I want the type of girls with big eyes, double eyelids,

190
00:14:49,739 --> 00:14:51,040
and nice body shape.

191
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,480
That's picky.

192
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:00,159
But I think... if I were you, I would take action

193
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,940
and show them my determination.

194
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,259
You're right. Prove myself with my actions.

195
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:09,500
You have to help me then.

196
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,499
- How? What is it? 
 - Let's take a picture.

197
00:15:13,499 --> 00:15:16,939
- How does this have anything to do with determination? 
 - I'll post it on Moments.

198
00:15:16,939 --> 00:15:18,560
That's right.

199
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,319
Post it on Moments.

200
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,939
This would give the impression that I'm doing just fine

201
00:15:22,939 --> 00:15:24,359
as if I wasn't hurt at all.

202
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,539
- I think that's a good idea. 
 - Sure it is.

203
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:29,220
Come on.

204
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:38,260
Three, two, one.

205
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,900
   

206
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,659
Chuan, have you seen the post on Moments?

207
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,279
What post?

208
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,479
This one.

209
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,719
Is this the pretty boy that you talked about?

210
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,260
A heart hand gesture really? Look.

211
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,959
This is nothing.

212
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,960
It's just a normal friend gathering.

213
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,359
We, too, have had many gatherings with them.

214
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,500
But I've never seen them posting it on Moments.

215
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,559
At times like this, you can't remain so calm.

216
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,420
You just told me that you like Jiang Xiaoning.

217
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,959
This is the first time you have ever liked someone.

218
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,120
You can't just sit here and do nothing.

219
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,220
No.

220
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,879
I haven't confessed to her.

221
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:36,920
Jiang Xiaoning and I are simply boss and employee.

222
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,460
Still trying to act tough?

223
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:47,619
But as a future designer, she's too shallow.

224
00:16:47,619 --> 00:16:51,019
You're right. She is.

225
00:16:51,019 --> 00:16:54,099
He has the looks but he's not that good looking.

226
00:16:54,099 --> 00:16:58,940
Compared to you and me, he's still far from it.

227
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,839
Bad aesthetic judgments. Poor taste.

228
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:03,879
That's right.

229
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,859
Look at his hairstyle. Unbelievable.

230
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,239
The hair quality is just average.

231
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,600
Not only that, they made the heart hand gesture.

232
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,399
It's fine if he did it with Jiang Xiaoning.

233
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,600
Why did he drag Yan Yan along?

234
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,590
Why is it fine to do it with Jiang Xiaoning

235
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:19,110
but shouldn't get your Zhao Yan involved?

236
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,179
Neither is acceptable.

237
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:22,940
We have to win this round.

238
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:26,620
How about... you confess to Jiang Xiaoning tomorrow?

239
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,800
No way.

240
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:35,760
What if Dr. Peer can't come up with a solution three months later?

241
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,700
What do I do then?

242
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,159
If Jiang Xiaoning and I get together

243
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,000
and I end up like a waste of space,

244
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
it would be bad for her.

245
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,960
That's a really lame excuse.

246
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,179
Just be honest. Are you afraid of being rejected by Jiang Xiaoning

247
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:56,900
and that it's going to put you on the spot?

248
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,039
Look.

249
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,260
If you keep this going, Jiang Xiaoning

250
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,999
will end up with someone else.

251
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,120
If a wimpy kid got her before you did, that would be a real shame.

252
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,139
You come up with a way to get this man out of the picture quickly.

253
00:18:12,139 --> 00:18:14,579
Don't let him revolve around Jiang Xiaoning and give him the opportunity

254
00:18:14,579 --> 00:18:15,959
to become a part of Yan Yan's social circle.

255
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,940
No matter what, in these three months,

256
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,100
you can't let Jiang Xiaoning be with this guy.

257
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,780
You have to be with her at all times and protect her.

258
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,620
Wait.

259
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:31,660
Are you being concerned about me or are you worried about Zhao Yan?

260
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,159
That's not the point.

261
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,799
The point is that we can't just sit back and do nothing.

262
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,940
We have to take the lead and get to the bottom of things.

263
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,560
Are you coming or not?

264
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,439
- Are you sure this is the place? 
 - Yes.

265
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,160
Why isn't he here yet?

266
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,700
You're right.

267
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,100
- That's him. 
 - Him?

268
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,480
Can he do it?

269
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,360
It'll be fine.

270
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,479
Hurry. Cover me.

271
00:19:18,479 --> 00:19:20,420
Hit the dragon.

272
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,779
- Hurry. 
 - You two go on.

273
00:19:23,779 --> 00:19:25,460
Coming!

274
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:30,419
Hi.  Are you Miss Zhao, the Super Invincible Conquering Palms? 
    

275
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,120
Here's your delivery.

276
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,259
Did you guys order a takeaway?

277
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:38,040
 No! 

278
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,460
Thank you.

279
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,860
A hangover soup?

280
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,699
Sir. A moment, please.

281
00:19:55,699 --> 00:19:57,480
What is it, sir?

282
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,520
Who accepted the food delivery just now?

283
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,840
Are you a cop?

284
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,000
No.

285
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,679
If that's the case, I can't disclose the customer's personal information.

286
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,120
I'm a very professional food delivery man.

287
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,000
What if I'm to tell you that I am the one who placed the order

288
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,760
and that I can give you a bad rating?

289
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,640
What? Is this a threat?

290
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,760
How about this?

291
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,939
I won't ask you anything and you don't have to answer me.

292
00:20:18,939 --> 00:20:21,400
Just a nod or a headshake will do.

293
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,220
Was it a girl who signed the receipt for the food?

294
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:31,539
Her last name is Zhao. She's about this tall.

295
00:20:31,539 --> 00:20:34,159
She's not pretty and has buck teeth, crossed eyes, and big nostrils.

296
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,159
Says who? She's gorgeous.

297
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,839
There is another girl and a guy in the house, right?

298
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,179
I can't tell you that. No comment.

299
00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:43,699
Fine. You're quite tight-lipped.

300
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,539
How about this? Let's talk.

301
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:49,119
I'll place a few more orders.

302
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,580
Make it ten.

303
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,479
I can tell you don't usually order online food delivery.

304
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,679
What do you mean?

305
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,160
The orders are randomly assigned.

306
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,599
I'll make a remark to have you deliver the food. How about that?

307
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,719
That will do. The customer is king.

308
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:01,959
King, huh?

309
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,359
If that's the case, can I make a few more requirements?

310
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,519
- I'm a... 
 - Don't worry.

311
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:09,299
I know you're a very professional food delivery man.

312
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:11,360
I won't give you a hard time.

313
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,560
Coming.

314
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,219
Didn't you just leave? Why are you here again?

315
00:21:20,219 --> 00:21:23,619
May I know if this is Miss Jiang's house,

316
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:25,660
the gentlest and cutest pretty girl in the universe?

317
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,720
She's in bed already.

318
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,239
I didn't order any food delivery.

319
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,559
I'm not sure about that. The address is correct.

320
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:34,820
If she's asleep, you can accept these for her.

321
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,439
Well, I'll accept them on her behalf then.

322
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,320
They're pretty heavy.

323
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,399
You're a girl. You can't handle them.

324
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:45,880
Why don't you ask your boyfriend or husband to get them?

325
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,099
I am a single young woman. I have no boyfriend.

326
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,200
Let alone a husband.

327
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,640
Shall I bring them in for you?

328
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,600
Thank you.

329
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,100
Where should I put them?

330
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,060
In the house.

331
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,839
Sir, if he keeps delaying, all the following orders will be canceled.

332
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:29,519
Ignore him.

333
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,439
As for me, I'll place another 100 orders.

334
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,159
Well, 100 is a little exaggerated. I'm a professional food delivery man.

335
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:37,019
- Fifty will do. 
 - Fifty, huh?

336
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:39,619
All right. Fifty it is. Whatever makes you happy.

337
00:22:39,619 --> 00:22:40,880
I'm going up for a bit.

338
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,740
Wait here for me.

339
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,639
- Boss? 
 - Why are you here?

340
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,899
I'm here to look for Xu Chengran. He didn't answer my calls.

341
00:22:59,899 --> 00:23:01,880
Is he here?

342
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,320
Chuan, help me! Chuan.

343
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,199
Chuan!

344
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,919
Boss, don't get us wrong.

345
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,159
I had a drink earlier and slept for a while.

346
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,939
When I woke up, I saw that Director Xu came to find Sister Yan Yan

347
00:23:13,939 --> 00:23:15,519
dressed up as a food delivery man.

348
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,720
And he said he was playing a cosplay game.

349
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,359
A game?

350
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,719
Director Gu, would you like to join us?

351
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,480
I'll pass.

352
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,799
This game doesn't look like my type.

353
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,020
I still have plenty of design drafts to revise.

354
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,361
Jiang Xiaoning, are you going home? I can give you a ride.

355
00:23:39,361 --> 00:23:42,560
It's fine, Boss. I'm crashing here tonight.

356
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:46,580
All right then. Well, I... I'll leave you be. Later.

357
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,919
Chuan!

358
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,520
Wait for me!

359
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,719
Perfect.

360
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,900
Delightful.

361
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,600
Xiaoning, let's go to bed.

362
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,060
Why did those two seem so weird?

363
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,719
Gu Chuan, what a loyal friend you are.

364
00:24:04,719 --> 00:24:07,919
If I hadn't escaped, would you have left me there?

365
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,959
Was I that bad?

366
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,159
Yes!

367
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,839
Your look, your body, and your words have betrayed you!

368
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,780
You were going to leave me there.

369
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:17,180
How is that possible? You're overthinking it.

370
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,479
Thank you, brother.

371
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,179
You're my real brother. Unlike some people.

372
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:22,859
I'll place another 100 orders for you tomorrow.

373
00:24:22,859 --> 00:24:23,799
Brother, that's so generous of you.

374
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,519
I'm a professional food delivery man.

375
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,879
Feel free to ask me for anything.

376
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,000
Remember, 100 orders.

377
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,239
Actually, you can't blame me.

378
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,560
You offered to deliver the food.

379
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,340
So? Did you see anyone else?

380
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,079
Why should I tell you?

381
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,119
I risked my life going up there yet you didn't care about me.

382
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,840
Ungrateful!

383
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,559
Actually, I already knew.

384
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,199
After you left, that guy left from the side entrance.

385
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,639
So nothing could possibly happen up there.

386
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,799
Not possible?

387
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,239
That's because I was smart enough to escape.

388
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,679
If not, I would be screwed.

389
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,919
That's perfect, isn't it?

390
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:02,180
You could spend more time with Zhao Yan.

391
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,139
You're right.

392
00:25:03,139 --> 00:25:05,380
Why don't you send me up again?

393
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,319
- Sure. 
 - Hell no.

394
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,820
Drive.

395
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,720
 Boss. 

396
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,520
I would like to take a day off.

397
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,480
Having a meal with your friend again?

398
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,639
Yesterday was an exception.

399
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,760
I hope you don't mind.

400
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,680
Not at all.

401
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,940
Tell me. Why do you need a day off?

402
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,799
The school-leaving examination is coming soon.

403
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,679
If I can't get the credits required in time,

404
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,479
I won't get the graduation certificate and the degree.

405
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,519
So I've registered for an evening cram school

406
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,540
to make some progress in a short time.

407
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,479
I may not be able to take you home

408
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,479
on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday nights.

409
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,180
Is that all right?

410
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,800
Of course.

411
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:01,840
But are there any buses available so late at night after class?

412
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,959
It's fine.

413
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,080
After class, if it's too late, I can ask Chen Chen to send me home.

414
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,760
If there's nothing else, I'll get back to my work.

415
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,380
Hold on.

416
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,160
Are there any spots left in the cram class?

417
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,479
I don't know. Why?

418
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:29,680
I'm thinking to attend the class or something.

419
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,559
Are you kidding me?

420
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,260
You're more than qualified to be a lecturer there.

421
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,759
I've worked for so long.

422
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,359
It's inevitable for my designs to be too commercial.

423
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,079
It's time to get back in class to feel the vibe again.

424
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:45,680
I can help you evaluate if the cram school is up to standard.

425
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,460
What's the matter?

426
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,540
No... Nothing.

427
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,639
Nothing?

428
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,779
It's settled then.

429
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,480
Get back to work.

430
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,519
Under normal circumstances, a residential building

431
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,780
can be divided into many floors.

432
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:17,660
However, the architectural standard, the coverage, and the layout

433
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:21,220
of each floor are completely different.

434
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,240
Well, what is a building with three floors or less called?

435
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,120
It's called a low-rise residential building.

436
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:35,139
- Four to six floors...multi-story residential building. 
  - Her boss is here. 

437
00:27:35,139 --> 00:27:39,520
Seven to nine floors, mid-rise residential building.

438
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,279
As for high-rise buildings, the ones with ten or more than ten floors

439
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,839
are called high-rise residential buildings.

440
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,879
To be specific, low-rise residential buildings 
    

441
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,900
refer to the ones of ten meters or less in height,

442
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:55,240
They usually have one to three floors, such as bungalows and villas.

443
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,399
Generally, low-rise residential buildings

444
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,839
feature simple building structure, a short construction period,

445
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,479
and low construction cost.

446
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,359
They give people a sense of familiarity and tranquility.

447
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,639
They stand right on land and not many floors are built upon it.

448
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,559
They offer better coziness, convenience, and spatial scale

449
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,620
than those of high-rise buildings.

450
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:13,559
Therefore, people love to have them as a residence.

451
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,239
However, low-rise residences occupy a lot of lands

452
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,679
and the land utilization rate is low.

453
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,239
In cities, the land is extremely expensive.

454
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,119
Which makes it difficult to develop this type of residence extensively.

455
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,300
 I don't believe you can stop me. 

456
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,039
Generally, people call buildings

457
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,200
with eight to twelve or thirteen floors as small high-rise buildings.

458
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,199
Small high-rise residential buildings,

459
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:34,120
generally, adopt the reinforced concrete structure with elevators.

460
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,479
There are multiple stories in a small high-rise.

461
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,639
It gives people a sense of familiarity and tranquility.

462
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,360
The house type is preferable with a higher building efficiency ratio.

463
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,639
It also boasts high resilience and high durability

464
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,080
as the ordinary high-rise structure.

465
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,940
   

466
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,740
Both of the two young men. What are you doing?

467
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,140
Stand up.

468
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,399
Get out if you don't want to attend this class.

469
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,400
Don't disrupt the order of the classroom.

470
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,040
Those who weren't listening should be the ones to leave.

471
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,319
So you were listening then?

472
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,280
Well, tell me then. What is spatial sequence?

473
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,440
The latecomer should answer first.

474
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,740
Okay, you tell us.

475
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,250
About that. Spatial sequence...

476
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:32,160
It's actually very simple.

477
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,720
It's...

478
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,360
Well...

479
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,740
In this space... I...

480
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:46,739
Spatial sequence. Construction is a tridimensional entity.

481
00:29:46,739 --> 00:29:49,039
People can't see all of it at a glance.

482
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:52,120
Therefore, in the process of continuously moving from one place

483
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:57,020
to another, people can see its parts little by little and form

484
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:59,039
an overall impression.

485
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:02,500
That's the meaning of spatial sequence in architecture.

486
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,539
Did you see that?

487
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:05,180
It's indeed very simple.

488
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,139
Not bad.

489
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:10,800
Tell us what the elements of green buildings are.

490
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,360
There are many elements of green buildings,

491
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,180
like source economy, lower cost,

492
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:19,559
whole-life design, people-oriented design, design flexibility,

493
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,019
unity of traditional and modern architecture,

494
00:30:22,019 --> 00:30:25,480
unity of architectural theory and environmental science.

495
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,059
Not bad. You may sit down.

496
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,880
Thank you, sir.

497
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,980
Unfortunately, you need to leave the classroom.

498
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,460
Let's not let them interrupt the lesson.

499
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,599
- So he's Gu Chuan? 
 - That's right.

500
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,219
He is the Gu Chuan who won the Jin An Award.

501
00:30:51,219 --> 00:30:52,120
He's so handsome.

502
00:30:52,121 --> 00:30:53,899
Let's move on to detached houses.

503
00:30:53,899 --> 00:30:56,620
So handsome.

504
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,560
Pay attention.

505
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,620
Where were we?

506
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:08,379
A detached house is a single residential building for one family only.

507
00:31:08,379 --> 00:31:09,680
Feeling hungry already?

508
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,679
It was fun going to class with you.

509
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,000
I had fun.

510
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,319
- You left the lecturer dumbfounded. 
 - Jiang Xiaoning.

511
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:16,759
Why are you still here?

512
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,480
Since I have nothing to do, I might as well wait for you to finish class.

513
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,940
Want to grab something to eat?

514
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:24,300
Jiang Xiaoning, buy me a bottle of water.

515
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,900
Sure.

516
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,900
Look at you. Instead of focusing in class,

517
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:37,380
why do you keep pestering Jiang Xiaoning?

518
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:42,000
I think something is charming about her.

519
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,500
It makes you feel better as soon as you see her.

520
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:49,080
If I can work with her every day, I don't mind working for free.

521
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,319
You won't get the chance.

522
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,240
Why? Do you like her?

523
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,639
It's none of your business.

524
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:59,580
Well... if you don't like Jiang Xiaoning

525
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,200
and this goes on,

526
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,079
she might not be yours.

527
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:06,020
If not mine, whose will she be?

528
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:08,360
Mine, perhaps.

529
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,399
Where does your confidence come from?

530
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,700
Myself.

531
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,740
I know Jiang Xiaoning better than you do.

532
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,200
Boss, here's the water you want.

533
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,399
Okay.

534
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,520
Come on. I'll send you home.

535
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,220
Let's go.

536
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,640
Drive safely.

537
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:57,399
Study local culture and bring modern art and historical traces...

538
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:01,839
 If you don't like Jiang Xiaoning, she might not be yours. 

539
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,500
 If not mine, whose will she be? 

540
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,680
 Mine, perhaps. 

541
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,620
 I know Jiang Xiaoning better than you do. 

542
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:12,039
So... this is my rough idea.

543
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,940
What do you think?

544
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,700
Director Gu?

545
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,920
Director Gu!

546
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,440
Go on, please.

547
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,580
I... I'm finished.

548
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,999
Shall I repeat it?

549
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,600
It's fine.

550
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,080
You may go now. I'll come to you later.

551
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,480
Okay.

552
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,660
Brother Dong.

553
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,560
Boss.

554
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,660
Are you going to cram school today?

555
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:52,120
Yes. Until before the exam.

556
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,860
I'll send you.

557
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:56,020
It's fine. There are a lot of projects lately.

558
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,260
I'll just go there by bus.

559
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,880
It's too slow. I'll send you.

560
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,780
End of discussion.

561
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:05,260
You may go now.

562
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,680
Well, thank you, Boss.

563
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,119
I've asked my lecturer.

564
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,760
He said you can't join the class.

565
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,319
It was fine last time.

566
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,219
Look who's talking. The lecturer said you came to show off.

567
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,840
All right then.

568
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:38,178
Boss, are you going to drive back by yourself?

569
00:34:38,178 --> 00:34:40,800
Shall I call you a designated driver?

570
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,238
It's fine. I'll take a walk nearby.

571
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:46,198
After that, I'll drive back on my own.

572
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,279
Can you?

573
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,999
Why don't you wait until my class is over and I'll send you home?

574
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,119
It's all right.

575
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:54,300
Go to class now or you'll be late.

576
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,140
Well, I'll get going then.

577
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:10,859
The load-bearing structure is very easy to remember.

578
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:12,460
Three types.

579
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,319
Two, thirteen.

580
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,120
Jiang Xiaoning, your boss really cares about you.

581
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,540
It's the load-bearing wall.

582
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:22,860
My boss always cares about me and he's been very supportive of me finishing my studies.

583
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:25,559
The load-bearing structure is divided into 13 categories.

584
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,900
Could your boss be in love with you?

585
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,279
I hope so.

586
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,000
Take a look in detail.

587
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,840
Do you like him?

588
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:43,000
I confessed to him before.

589
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,520
Then? What happened?

590
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,380
I guess he rejected me.

591
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,500
I don't stand a chance.

592
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,039
That's not for sure.

593
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:55,160
Before I came to class, I saw him standing at the door.

594
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,320
Do you need my help?

595
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,780
Stop it.

596
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,839
Don't upset my boss.

597
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:06,020
Even if he rejected me, I think we are good now.

598
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,740
Give it a try. Just try it out.

599
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,919
Pay attention.

600
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,360
Don't distract me.

601
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,979
 Have you learned the things taught in class today? 

602
00:36:30,979 --> 00:36:31,859
 Have you? 

603
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:33,899
 Of course. Have you? 

604
00:36:33,899 --> 00:36:35,799
 Tell me what you have learned today. 

605
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,039
 Let's have supper later. 

606
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,180
No, thanks.

607
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:42,400
Boss, you haven't left.

608
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,200
I just came back from a walk.

609
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,399
You're really something, Boss.

610
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,039
You could even take a walk for two hours.

611
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,800
Good for you! I admire you for it!

612
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,660
I'll drive you home, okay?

613
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:57,600
Since your boss is here, shall we go for a late-night snack together?

614
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,000
I'm not hungry.

615
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,260
No?

616
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,439
What a coincidence.

617
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,240
Xiaoning said she was hungry and we were planning to have hotpot.

618
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,099
Well, then you may leave first.

619
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,720
I said... Let's have hotpot.

620
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,559
- Jiang Xiaoning. 
 - Yes!

621
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,959
Drive. I feel like having it now.

622
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,360
I'll lead the way. Follow me.

623
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,080
Jiang Xiaoning, what would you like to eat?

624
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:48,479
My boss can only take food that is less oily, less salty, and not spicy.

625
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,480
He's so picky.

626
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,519
I'm not picky. It depends on my mood.

627
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,759
So you can eat anything?

628
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,699
No, he can't.

629
00:37:55,699 --> 00:37:57,640
I can.

630
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,319
Boss, you can't take this.

631
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:08,839
I'll order porridge for you.

632
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,160
It's fine.

633
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,599
Give me a glass of water.

634
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,820
How about beer?

635
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:17,400
I need to drive Jiang Xiaoning home.

636
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,519
All right then. Jiang Xiaoning,

637
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:22,079
get a big jug of water and make sure it's cold.

638
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,580
Go.

639
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,980
Go on.

640
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,980
Pleasant to the eye.

641
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,520
Stop looking.

642
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,320
-  Looking at what? 
 - Nothing.

643
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,199
- Do you like her? 
 - It's none of your business.

644
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,319
It is.

645
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,319
You can't.

646
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,080
Do you dare?

647
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,680
It's boiling.

648
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,200
Here comes the water.

649
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,639
All right, you two.

650
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,240
It's not spicy.

651
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,300
Feels great!

652
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:17,540
Excuse me. I'm going to the gents.

653
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,080
Afraid?

654
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,559
Who's afraid?

655
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,199
The oil got on my hands. I'm going to wash it off.

656
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,080
I'm squeamish.

657
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,179
Give me water. Water.

658
00:40:33,179 --> 00:40:34,439
Serves you right.

659
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,639
Are you out of your mind?

660
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,940
If anything happens to him, I'm going to kill you.

661
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,400
Jiang Xiaoning, I give it all out for you.

662
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,780
Why did the power go out?

663
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,480
Waiter! The power went out!

664
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,660
Waiter! Boss!

665
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,620
How are we going to eat?

666
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,199
 Don't worry. 

667
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:24,080
 I'm fine, really. 

668
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,959
 Boss, it was my fault. 

669
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,959
 I shouldn't have made you wait for me 

670
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,780
 and let you have hotpot. 

671
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,559
 It's not your fault. 

672
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,640
 I was being gluttonous. 

673
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:49,019
 I promise you won't see Chen Chen again. 

674
00:41:49,019 --> 00:41:51,480
 He's too awful. 

675
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,919
 I used to be good at eating spicy food. 

676
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,919
 If it weren't for the power outage at the hotpot restaurant, 

677
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,420
 we would have battled it out. 

678
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,540
 Why was there a power outage at the restaurant? 

679
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:18,059
 It's nothing. 

680
00:42:18,059 --> 00:42:19,039
 Rest early. 

681
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,239
 I'm going to take a shower and rest. 

682
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,880
 See you tomorrow. 

683
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,400
 See you tomorrow. 

684
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:57,990
