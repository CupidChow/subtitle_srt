2
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:18,809
♫  I can't help but feel a little happy  ♫

3
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,510
♫  I can't help but feel a little nervous  ♫

4
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,989
♫  The earth is turning because of you  ♫

5
00:00:25,989 --> 00:00:28,209
♫  Without you, the earth stops  ♫

6
00:00:28,209 --> 00:00:35,190
♫  You are the rainbow that fills up the black and white  ♫

7
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,889
♫  I was once obsessed with the legend of the four-leaf clover  ♫

8
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:44,569
♫  I dreamed of a white-horse carriage and 
you becoming my prince  ♫

9
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:48,729
♫  Your gaze is too seducing, please save me  ♫

10
00:00:48,729 --> 00:00:53,330
♫  I'm turning into a moth, flying towards the fire  ♫

11
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:57,990
♫  Your smile is dancing on your lips  ♫

12
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:02,630
♫  Am I the happiness you're looking for?  ♫

13
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:07,349
♫  The doe inside me is lost  ♫

14
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:15,010
♫  Holding your hand, let's count down to happiness  ♫

15
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:19,649
♫  I can't help but be a little fragile  ♫

16
00:01:19,649 --> 00:01:24,209
♫  I can't help but feel a little gloomy  ♫

17
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,549
♫  The sky is bright because of you  ♫

18
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:28,869
♫  Without you, the sky is grey  ♫

19
00:01:28,869 --> 00:01:33,429
♫  You are the angel who takes away all loneliness  ♫

20
00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:37,110
   

21
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:41,110
   

22
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,229
 Do you like it? 

23
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,349
 It's a little heavy, but I can carry it for you. 

24
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,289
 You should leave now. Don't embarrass me. 

25
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:04,890
 If you don't like it, I'll kneel down then. 

26
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,970
   

27
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,569
   

28
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,009
   

29
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,370
   

30
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,670
   

31
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,410
   

32
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,090
I'm going to have a girlfriend!

33
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,730
   

34
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,030
   

35
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,650
Getting off work?

36
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,910
You must be tired.

37
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,610
You asked for my contact, but you didn't accept my friend request!

38
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,269
Are you playing hard-to-get with me?

39
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:55,189
That hurts! Let me go! Let me go.

40
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,189
Calm down.

41
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,840
I want you to see in person

42
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,990
how I will verify your friend request.

43
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,030
Dear God,

44
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,589
I'm about to add the girl I'm in love with on WeChat.

45
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:17,329
Please give me your blessing so I won't say anything that will upset her.

46
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,849
I want you to have a taste of waiting eagerly.

47
00:04:22,849 --> 00:04:24,229
We should exchange our roles.

48
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,229
- Forget it. 
 - Sorry.

49
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:26,590
   

50
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:32,470
Smooth talker.

51
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,310
Your seat-belt.

52
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:03,169
Director Gu.

53
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:05,130
Ms. Cheng Yu just gave me a call.

54
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,151
She is willing to give us a second chance

55
00:05:07,151 --> 00:05:09,670
to redesign the project for her,

56
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:14,210
but on the condition that the wall must be kept.

57
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,450
It's the same request as before.

58
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:20,330
Indeed. Not to mention we proposed so many designs.

59
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,610
What's the difference now?

60
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:25,069
The difference is that she appointed

61
00:05:25,069 --> 00:05:27,790
Jiang Xiaoning to be the architect.

62
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:33,229
Me? Why?

63
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:37,410
According to her, only those who have suffered know how to heal.

64
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:40,829
- I... 
 - Director Gu, this is a serious matter.

65
00:05:40,829 --> 00:05:42,349
You said it earlier.

66
00:05:42,349 --> 00:05:45,009
She's even not qualified to be an assistant.

67
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:47,250
She can't handle the job.

68
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,870
Jiang Xiaoning, you caused this mess.

69
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,369
You earned the opportunity yourself.

70
00:05:53,369 --> 00:05:56,710
So tell me, can you do this job?

71
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,410
Can I...

72
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:00,450
I'll do whatever I can.

73
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:05,209
If you have any questions, feel free to ask for guidance from other architects.

74
00:06:05,209 --> 00:06:06,789
Boss, but I...

75
00:06:06,789 --> 00:06:08,549
I'm not asking you to finish the whole project.

76
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:11,350
I only want you to give me an idea for the design.

77
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,310
I'll try my best.

78
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,489
Very well. Carry on.

79
00:06:15,489 --> 00:06:17,170
Yes.

80
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:24,189
It may only be a draft, but you still need to be cautious.

81
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,109
- Feel free to ask anything. 
 - Sure.

82
00:06:26,109 --> 00:06:28,250
Xiaoning, Cheng Dong is right.

83
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,730
Keep your spirit up.

84
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:32,249
Maybe you'll come up with something remarkable.

85
00:06:32,249 --> 00:06:34,169
Thank you. I'll do my best.

86
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:35,169
- All the best. 
 - All the best!

87
00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:36,910
Good luck!

88
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,309
All right.

89
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,709
It seems like bad luck doesn't always haunt you.

90
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,450
Work hard.

91
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:03,050
You only contacted me because of what Jiang Xiaoning told you?

92
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,269
What else could it be?

93
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:07,370
I thought you finally saw the greatness in me.

94
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,170
Shall we keep this going?

95
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,410
What did she say about me?

96
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:17,390
She told me...

97
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:20,730
you are a rich second generation who is pretty nice.

98
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,800
That's all?

99
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,839
It's true that I'm pretty nice.

100
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:33,480
As for the rich second generation...

101
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,920
Not really.

102
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,301
I worked hard to start my own business.

103
00:07:37,301 --> 00:07:40,020
My dad's money has nothing to do with me.

104
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,400
The two of us...

105
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,820
have never gotten along since I was a child.

106
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:47,049
He never needs me anyway.

107
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,350
He has others to serve him.

108
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,809
Do you have a sibling?

109
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,250
I wish I had.

110
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,109
My family is a little complicated.

111
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:57,829
I'll explain more another day.

112
00:07:57,829 --> 00:08:00,869
In short, I hate his money.

113
00:08:00,869 --> 00:08:03,930
I don't want to be shackled by money like my mother.

114
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:11,150
You can either finish the story or say nothing at all.

115
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:14,490
Telling only parts of it is awkward.

116
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:20,370
It's just a typical family drama.

117
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:22,370
Their marriage is dead already, but they won't get a divorce.

118
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:24,680
I guess it was their pride.

119
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:27,689
I asked my mother why she didn't get a divorce.

120
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,830
Do you know what she told me?

121
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:33,670
If she divorces, she won't get as much money as she can now.

122
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:39,270
I feel like money can be so meaningless sometimes.

123
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,769
I refuse to take a penny from them

124
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,749
and I insist on starting my own business.

125
00:08:42,749 --> 00:08:44,609
My car is not bad, right?

126
00:08:44,609 --> 00:08:47,989
It's a second-hand car. I only bought it for the sake of doing business.

127
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:54,950
That's all of my story.

128
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:57,050
Shouldn't you tell me your story?

129
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,549
You have a strong personality.

130
00:08:58,549 --> 00:09:01,490
Your parents must love you a lot.

131
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:06,211
My parents got a divorce when I was very young.

132
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:09,090
They soon formed their own new families.

133
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:14,810
So I was tossed over from one home to another by my parents.

134
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:16,910
They were both my homes

135
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,730
but none of them felt like it.

136
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,430
As soon as I could afford it, I moved out.

137
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:27,249
Come on.

138
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,609
To my hard work and your independence.

139
00:09:29,609 --> 00:09:30,729
Cheers.

140
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,610
For full disclosure,

141
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,929
I only came here to thank you on Xiaoning's behalf.

142
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:38,290
This meal is on me.

143
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,609
I don't care about the reason.

144
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:43,630
As long as you're willing to see me, I'm okay with any bad excuse.

145
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:40,409
Xiaoning, I'm getting off work. Bye.

146
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,970
You fell asleep?

147
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:27,790
Is this the best you can offer?

148
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:31,050
I'm stuck.

149
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:34,270
It does seem like it.

150
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:37,609
Boss, may I ask you something?

151
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:51,570
♪ The birds standing in pair on the tree ♪

152
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,589
Where is the designated driver?

153
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:57,349
Driver? Driver...

154
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:59,090
Get on the car.

155
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:03,290
Come with me if you want to live.

156
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,289
Why should I go with you?

157
00:12:06,289 --> 00:12:09,370
Stop talking if you want to keep your limbs.

158
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,429
You'll be safe here.

159
00:12:22,429 --> 00:12:24,669
You paid for the meal just now.

160
00:12:24,669 --> 00:12:27,369
This man? Leave him to me.

161
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:36,130
Seriously?

162
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,790
I...

163
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,990
Are you okay?

164
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,049
I see.

165
00:13:25,049 --> 00:13:26,969
Now it makes sense.

166
00:13:26,969 --> 00:13:28,149
I see now why she said that.

167
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:30,050
What did she say?

168
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,419
She told me maybe you are the only one

169
00:13:32,419 --> 00:13:35,240
who knows how to heal her wound.

170
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,940
I wish I could be that amazing.

171
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,859
Tell me. What is stopping you?

172
00:13:41,859 --> 00:13:46,599
My concept is that the wall is a dimension different from our reality.

173
00:13:46,599 --> 00:13:49,200
It's a world of memories for Ms. Cheng.

174
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,100
The memories are precious.

175
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,859
So I want to protect it.

176
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,680
Then I got stuck.

177
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,939
I have no idea how to display the other dimension.

178
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,700
How should I protect it?

179
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,940
Wait here.

180
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,200
Is this a gift for me?

181
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,119
Not a chance. Open it.

182
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,920
This is beautiful.

183
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,660
I got it as a gift from a hotel in Switzerland.

184
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,699
It was winter. The whole mountain was covered in white snow.

185
00:14:43,699 --> 00:14:45,540
Just like this snow globe.

186
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:49,019
I was staying at a place known as Rose Town.

187
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:53,320
The time I spent there was very happy.

188
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,299
So this snow globe reminds you of that wonderful memory.

189
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,900
Indeed.

190
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,559
I get it now!

191
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:05,499
The glass of this snow globe is shielding your precious memory.

192
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:10,100
We could use a glass shield to keep the wall safe from any harm.

193
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,099
You're smart.

194
00:15:12,099 --> 00:15:14,599
Glass is a kind of material that is clear as water.

195
00:15:14,599 --> 00:15:18,119
It's there but not very noticeable. Just like memories.

196
00:15:18,119 --> 00:15:22,040
I find that you do have a gift for designing.

197
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,639
Boss, I'm so fortunate to have met you.

198
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:32,379
I mean, thank you for offering me this job.

199
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,139
I never thought there would be an opportunity for me

200
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:38,060
to be so close to my dream.

201
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,139
I always thought I had bad luck.

202
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:45,400
It felt like nothing good would ever happen to me and it was my fate.

203
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,960
Happiness is not something you're born with but earned with effort.

204
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,280
A crow will never become an eagle.

205
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,679
I always fail and always have bad luck.

206
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:58,860
My classmates avoided me.

207
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,240
They thought my bad luck was infectious.

208
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:06,239
Crows are one of the smartest birds in the world.

209
00:16:06,239 --> 00:16:08,339
They would place walnuts on the road

210
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:11,479
and wait for a car to crush the nut so they could eat it.

211
00:16:11,479 --> 00:16:13,219
Crows are very loyal.

212
00:16:13,219 --> 00:16:15,520
They only stay with one partner for life.

213
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,659
They spend their entire life defending their territory and their partner.

214
00:16:19,659 --> 00:16:23,259
Really? I didn't know crows were so great.

215
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,659
So don't be bothered by others' opinions.

216
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:30,480
Remember not to look down on yourself.

217
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,360
Thank you, Boss.

218
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:39,020
Who could it be at this hour?

219
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:42,079
I ordered some food. You must be starving.

220
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,400
You're the best, Boss.

221
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,100
I don't want my employee to work overtime on an empty stomach.

222
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,959
Go get the food. We'll work as we eat.

223
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:53,820
Yes, sir.

224
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:24,920
   

225
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,220
If you acted sooner, I wouldn't be injured.

226
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,479
You were the one acting tough.

227
00:17:37,479 --> 00:17:40,399
I'm a man. I should protect you.

228
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,179
You deserve some credit.

229
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:48,420
At least, you survived until I took off my heels.

230
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,300
Yan Yan,

231
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:59,580
from now on, don't get into fights again.

232
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,260
Why not?

233
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,860
I'll be jealous when you touch other men.

234
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,780
Not even while I'm beating them?

235
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,360
Promise me never to get into a fight again.

236
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,960
If you need a punching bag,

237
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,840
you can punch me.

238
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,360
Xu Chengran.

239
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:44,720
♫  You're the haze in the sky  ♫

240
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:50,100
♫  A disaster for my clear blue sky  ♫

241
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:54,960
♫  But you're my most gentle cover  ♫

242
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:00,020
♫  Blocking out the blinding sunlight  ♫

243
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,680
♫  But I know love  ♫

244
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,240
♫  But I love  ♫

245
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,660
♫  I love this bad guy  ♫

246
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,220
♫  I want to rely on you  ♫

247
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,680
♫  But I love  ♫

248
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,320
♫  But I know love  ♫

249
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,919
♫  I have no idea  ♫

250
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,480
♫  I won't let go  ♫

251
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:27,000
♫  Let go. Let go  ♫

252
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,920
Ms. Cheng.

253
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,620
Miss Jiang, thank you.

254
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:48,619
I must thank you for what you told my husband.

255
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,900
You're young,

256
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,240
but I think your mind is clearer than mine.

257
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,959
Not at all. I'm lost most of the time.

258
00:19:56,959 --> 00:19:58,580
Come.

259
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,360
Do you see the sun?

260
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,920
I remember that one day my son said this to me,

261
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,800
"Mama," I drew a sun for you.

262
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,139
From now on, you'll never feel cold again

263
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,680
and you'll never fall sick again.

264
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,259
This sun will always keep you warm "with its light."

265
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,420
I had a cold that day.

266
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,020
He gave me this sun as a gift.

267
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:34,139
These memories are very precious to you.

268
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,099
They are worth cherishing.

269
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:40,459
So for our design plan, not only are we keeping the wall,

270
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:45,120
but we're also giving it a protective cover to keep it safe forever.

271
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:49,580
Miss Jiang, we appreciate your thoughtful planning.

272
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:54,420
However, is a simple glass shield the only element in your design?

273
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,339
We can add on some decorations.

274
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,950
We can turn it into a snow globe with snow,

275
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:03,200
a castle, and music.

276
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,839
Miss Jiang, it sounds more like an idea.

277
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:09,280
Do you have a specific design?

278
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,000
Specific design?

279
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,480
Ms. Cheng, allow me to introduce the specifics.

280
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,259
For the design of your art gallery, we are planning to implement advanced AR technology.

281
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:24,299
It won't be just a glass-covered world.

282
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,019
We can replicate the image of your son

283
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,779
with the materials you provide.

284
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:32,739
We can recreate the memories left on this wall.

285
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:36,859
In other words, you will be able to see your memories from the past

286
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,640
any time you want.

287
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,720
 We'll put up a glass screen wall at the front. 

288
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,179
 The lighting effect will create a hologram, 

289
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,360
 creating a surreal presentation. 

290
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:54,780
♫  I'll follow to the end of the world  ♫

291
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,060
♫  He and she  ♫

292
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:00,840
♫  Round and round, losing ground  ♫

293
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,800
♫  Wandering Earth  ♫

294
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,880
♫  Fading, wiped out  ♫

295
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,859
No matter what dispute we had before, I must thank you.

296
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:12,260
You make my dream come true.

297
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,619
Thank you.

298
00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:15,900
Thank you for your trust.

299
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,679
Thank you for sharing your experience with us.

300
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:20,540
It's an honor.

301
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,780
The honor is mine.

302
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,259
Very well. We should get going.

303
00:22:25,259 --> 00:22:26,379
Thank you.

304
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,980
Have a nice day.

305
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,980
We finally persuaded them.

306
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,979
Boss, thank you.

307
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,180
Don't mention it.

308
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:00,979
Boss, here's your snow globe.

309
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,819
It's yours now.

310
00:23:03,819 --> 00:23:06,479
You did a good job. Take this as your reward.

311
00:23:06,479 --> 00:23:09,699
But this is too valuable. I can't take this.

312
00:23:09,699 --> 00:23:13,199
It's not that expensive. Just a gift from the hotel.

313
00:23:13,199 --> 00:23:17,659
How fortunate of you. You keep getting gifts.

314
00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:19,120
Pack it up. It's yours now.

315
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,060
Thank you, Boss.

316
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,899
Am I more magnificent than the view here?

317
00:23:40,899 --> 00:23:42,379
The view?

318
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:45,160
The view is no match for your elegance.

319
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,160
Stop fawning over me.

320
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,500
Boss, are you going to fire me?

321
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,939
You haven't paid the medical bills for your aunt.

322
00:23:57,939 --> 00:24:00,840
I can't possibly let you go so easily.

323
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:08,299
Boss, you know? There is an issue with you.

324
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,060
What is it?

325
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,740
You're cold on the outside, soft on the inside.

326
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,520
I'm not soft on the inside.

327
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,640
You just can't see it.

328
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,619
Let's go. The sun is about to go away.

329
00:24:32,619 --> 00:24:34,519
The sun is never going away.

330
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:37,019
You just can't see it sometimes.

331
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:39,499
Earth's rotation blocks your line of sight

332
00:24:39,499 --> 00:24:41,699
but the sun is always there.

333
00:24:41,699 --> 00:24:43,880
Whether you like it or not,

334
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,760
the sun will rise the next morning.

335
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,280
Don't always look at the negative side.

336
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,359
Just like my parents, they are never gone.

337
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:56,100
They are always in here.

338
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:02,900
If you can't change your life, then make the present days happy ones.

339
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:09,720
Why are you telling me this?

340
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,419
Because I once saw the light in your eyes.

341
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:15,280
But it didn't last long.

342
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:19,400
I think you're a man of stories.

343
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,080
I saw the light in your eyes.

344
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,320
It's the kind of happiness that I wish will never disappear.

345
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,220
I don't want you to lose that light.

346
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,900
Did I say too much just now?

347
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:43,060
Not at all... You're right.

348
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,220
Life is short.

349
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,740
Why not make it a happy one?

350
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,880
The view here is nice.

351
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:13,160
It looks better a little to the right.

352
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,840
 You must be Mr. Gu. 

353
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,340
 Don't apologize to me. 

354
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,850
 Apologize to my female assistant. 

355
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:49,820
♫  A scalding wave of heat is coming  ♫

356
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,430
 Boss! 

357
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,460
 Why do I keep thinking of him? 

358
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:09,779
♫  Two felines sleeping soundly  ♫

359
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:13,019
 Jiang Xiaoning, you finally got a job. 

360
00:27:13,019 --> 00:27:16,600
 What are you thinking? 

361
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,600
 I'm doomed.

♫  Diana pink roses  ♫

♫  Time passes by gently  ♫

♫  Our gaze meets unknowingly  ♫

366
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:47,360
♫  Are you moved  ♫

367
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:52,080
♫  Open the window and witness the new moon  ♫

 Send me the photo from earlier.

♫  The flashbacks and images  ♫

381
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,219
 I once saw the light in your eyes. 

382
00:29:07,219 --> 00:29:09,139
 But it didn't last long. 

383
00:29:09,139 --> 00:29:12,240
 I don't want you to lose that light. 

384
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,080
 I mean the photo of the afterglow. 

385
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,879
 Sorry, Boss. I made a mistake. 

386

♫  Where have you been?  ♫

387
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:42,840
♫  Is it the rain, mist, or the tears  ♫

388
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:48,740
♫  I want to run away from this summer day  ♫

389
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:52,179
 Jiang Xiaoning, are you drunk? 

390
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,399
Good morning, Director Gu. The files are on your desk.

391
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:17,720
Okay.

392
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,580
Who gave you the flowers? They're pretty.

393
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,080
I bought them myself.

394
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,880
You bought them?

395
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,559
What are the flowers for?

396
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:27,479
Is this for an important client?

397
00:30:27,479 --> 00:30:29,579
If you need more, I can go get some.

398
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:32,519
No. I bought them for myself.

399
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,860
Is Jiang Xiaoning here?

400
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:37,879
She is.

401
00:30:37,879 --> 00:30:40,240
Send her to my office.

402
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:50,779
Cheng Dong, you two will be in charge of this project.

403
00:30:50,779 --> 00:30:53,140
Your focus is...

404
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,799
To whom are those flowers for?

405
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:05,119
No idea.

406
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:07,960
I was worried that drinking coffee on an empty stomach might cause a stomachache,

407
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,940
so I brought some snacks.

408
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:12,219
Xiaoning, how thoughtful of you.

409
00:31:12,219 --> 00:31:14,919
I didn't have time for breakfast. I'm starving.

410
00:31:14,919 --> 00:31:17,479
Dong, give me the meat jerky.

411
00:31:17,479 --> 00:31:19,099
I need to replenish my energy.

412
00:31:19,099 --> 00:31:21,439
Thanks, Xiaoning. You're becoming more attentive.

413
00:31:21,439 --> 00:31:24,560
Of course not, I learned from the best.

414
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:29,319
Xiaoning, our boss has more trust in you now.

415
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:32,299
When your career takes off, don't forget me.

416
00:31:32,299 --> 00:31:34,459
I've never thought about something so far away.

417
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:35,920
No way.

418
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:39,219
By the way, leave the trivial matters to us.

419
00:31:39,219 --> 00:31:40,299
When you become successful...

420
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,140
Don't forget us.

421
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,839
Sister Manlin, have some coffee.

422
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,660
Director Gu asked for you.

423
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,280
Okay.

424
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:06,279
Good morning, Boss. You asked for me?

425
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:08,699
Trim the flowers for me and put them in a vase.

426
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,920
Yes, right away.

427
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:15,259
Boss, why are you interested in flowers suddenly?

428
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,250
Since I can't change my life,

429
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:22,130
I must find a way to make my life somewhat happier.

430
00:32:22,139 --> 00:32:24,220
You're making fun of me.

431
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:27,300
I need you to buy everyone a bouquet of flowers.

432
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,340
Is it a tough task?

433
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:33,199
No problem. I'll get it done now.

434
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,439
Director Gu bought everyone flowers.

435
00:32:51,439 --> 00:32:54,160
Pick the ones you like.

436
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,140
I'm taking this.

437
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,739
Come on, pick a flower.

438
00:32:58,739 --> 00:33:00,020
 Director Gu really bought us flowers? 

439
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,299
 Is this really happening? 

440
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,179
 Pick a flower. 

441
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,240
 Pick yours now. 

442
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,220
 I want this. 

443
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,379
What's wrong with Boss?

444
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,620
How should I know?

445
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,619
Why is he giving everyone flowers all of a sudden?

446
00:33:09,619 --> 00:33:11,960
Is he in love?

447
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,219
Jiang Xiaoning?

448
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,960
Yes, Jiang Xiaoning.

449
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,139
Nothing is impossible.

450
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:22,620
Did you finish your work and have nothing to do?

451
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,820
Take it.

452
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,900
Sister Manlin, pick a flower.

453
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,639
 Hello? Director Gu, hello. How may I help you? 

454
00:33:44,639 --> 00:33:46,379
Order some plants for me.

455
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,679
Okay, no problem.

456
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,959
What plants do you want?

457
00:33:49,959 --> 00:33:52,879
 You may ask the florist we used to work with. 

458
00:33:52,879 --> 00:33:54,339
 Ask for his opinion. 

459
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:57,539
I want my room to be more lively.

460
00:33:57,539 --> 00:33:58,920
 Okay, consider it done. 

461
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,059
 Should I send them to the office? 

462
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:03,819
Yes. I'll need some for my home, too.

463
00:34:03,819 --> 00:34:05,699
 Okay. You can count on me. 

464
00:34:05,699 --> 00:34:07,500
 Director Gu, bye. 

465
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:21,739
Hello?

466
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:25,159
 Gu! Your data seems promising lately. 

467
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:28,400
I want to know if you're feeling any changes.

468
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,759
Nothing special in particular.

469
00:34:30,759 --> 00:34:33,189
Perhaps it's because I'm not as busy lately.

470
00:34:33,189 --> 00:34:34,609
There is less pressure.

471
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:37,859
I've told you not to work too hard.

472
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:40,220
It helps a lot.

473
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:45,610
Other than work, have you experienced anything memorable?

474
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:48,440
Nothing special.

475
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,800
Maybe...

476
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,920
I feel a little happier lately.

477
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:57,659
 Technically, happiness will increase your blood flow, 

478
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:03,440
which would increase the need for oxygen and the load on your heart.

479
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,340
But this is odd.

480
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,759
However, happiness brings positive results.

481
00:35:09,759 --> 00:35:12,620
Continue being happy.

482
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,500
Okay.

483
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,080
 Charging. 

484
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:36,330
 Director Gu. 

485
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:37,950
 Come in. 

486
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:41,870
There are some issues at the resort.

487
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:43,110
What's wrong?

488
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:44,949
It's nothing major.

489
00:35:44,949 --> 00:35:49,149
We made adjustments to the plans, but it involves partial relocation.

490
00:35:49,149 --> 00:35:51,529
The progress will be delayed.

491
00:35:51,529 --> 00:35:52,429
Which means...

492
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:54,970
Judging by the pace,

493
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:57,769
we won't make it in time for the Jin An Award nomination.

494
00:35:57,769 --> 00:36:00,290
We'll have to wait for another two years.

495
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:05,049
 Waiting for another year might not be a setback. 

496
00:36:05,049 --> 00:36:07,510
 But it must not be later than that. 

497
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:15,049
It's rare to see architects who are so obsessed with one award like you.

498
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:18,630
Everyone's life is a different story.

499
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:22,309
We don't have to be so focused on winning the award.

500
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:24,410
Why not leave it in fate's hand?

501
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:27,770
I've been waiting to win this award.

502
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:31,810
Consider it my finish line.

503
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:35,429
You are still too young to be thinking about the finish line.

504
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:38,350
Are you not going to live after winning this award?

505
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:41,330
This one is all I will ever need.

506
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:42,770
Very well.

507
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:46,950
However, I've always admired your persistence.

508
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:53,650
By the way, what's with the sudden interest in plants and flowers?

509
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:56,829
I don't know either.

510
00:36:56,829 --> 00:37:01,930
Maybe I'm hoping to bring some light to the darkness in my life.

511
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:05,450
As long as it makes you happy.

512
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:17,309
 However, happiness brings positive results. 

513
00:37:17,309 --> 00:37:19,990
 Continue being happy. 

514
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:40,330
The resort project is over for the time being.

515
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:42,189
Thank you for your hard work.

516
00:37:42,189 --> 00:37:47,830
Tomorrow, all of you will have a two-day team-building event.

517
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:50,150
Thank you, Boss!

518
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:52,290
As for the destination, that's up to you.

519
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:53,769
Okay! Thank you, Boss!

520
00:37:53,769 --> 00:37:55,889
My goodness, he was smiling!

521
00:37:55,889 --> 00:37:57,709
What is going on? Is this really happening?

522
00:37:57,709 --> 00:38:00,029
Is he in love?

523
00:38:00,029 --> 00:38:03,469
Jia Jia, your lipstick is smudged.

524
00:38:03,469 --> 00:38:04,629
Check it out.

525
00:38:04,629 --> 00:38:05,969
Jiang Xiaoning.

526
00:38:05,969 --> 00:38:07,769
- Sister Manlin. 
 - I don't think you'll be able to join us.

527
00:38:07,769 --> 00:38:09,349
You haven't finished your work.

528
00:38:09,349 --> 00:38:10,749
What work?

529
00:38:10,749 --> 00:38:12,929
The presentation for our gallery project.

530
00:38:12,929 --> 00:38:16,969
Not to mention the project statement assigned to you is really urgent.

531
00:38:16,969 --> 00:38:19,870
Okay. No problem.

532
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:21,790
Xiaoning.

533
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:27,839
Can't you just finish the work before you come back from the trip?

534
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,310
Is that all right?

535
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:33,029
Wang Kai, I said no and you dare say yes?

536
00:38:33,029 --> 00:38:36,269
Are you standing against me or are you defending Jiang Xiaoning?

537
00:38:36,269 --> 00:38:39,790
Jiang Xiaoning, can you finish it or not?

538
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:41,650
I can do it.

539
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:48,470
Thanks, Brother Kai.

540
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:49,269
Don't mention it.

541
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:50,509
It's no big deal.

542
00:38:50,869 --> 00:38:53,630
I can't stand her autocratic manner.

543
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:55,529
This is my job. Don't worry.

544
00:38:55,529 --> 00:38:58,229
Okay. Keep it on.

545
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:14,070
Brother Xu, why do you insist that we talk in person?

546
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:16,269
You just got back from your business trip, you should get some rest.

547
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,709
I brought some souvenirs.

548
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:19,269
Give them to Grandma and Aunty.

549
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,349
Thank you, Brother Xu.

550
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:23,090
By the way, one more thing.

551
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:27,470
What is this?

552
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:29,550
A small present.

553
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,159
I'll take the souvenirs, but I can't accept this.

554
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:37,439
Xiaoning, I would be upset if you turned me down.

555
00:39:37,439 --> 00:39:39,059
I'll be mad if you give this to me.

556
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,699
Don't worry. It's cheap. It's not expensive.

557
00:39:41,699 --> 00:39:43,480
 - Let me drive you home. 
 - You're not as nice as you were. 

558
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,601
 I'll help you put it on. 

559
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,630
It's done.

560
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,619
It looks good on you.

561
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,660
Thank you, Brother Xu.

562
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:05,999
I left something in the office. You can go back first.

563
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,980
- How is it? 
 - Look, you're pretty with it.

564
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,979
 Where have you been lately? 

565
00:40:17,979 --> 00:40:20,500
 You disappeared without a word. 

566
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,539
 Yan Yan, I miss you. 

567
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,660
Love-struck again?

568
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,899
What? Why are you drinking on your own?

569
00:40:44,899 --> 00:40:47,100
You haven't contacted me in a while.

570
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,980
I'm busy.

571
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,180
Busy with what?

572
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,260
I'm busy spending time with my girlfriend.

573
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,940
You have a girlfriend?

574
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:00,160
Who's the lucky girl?

575
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,699
My perfect lady. Fate brought her to me.

576
00:41:03,699 --> 00:41:08,219
My true love and my buster. I'll spend the rest of my life with her.

577
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,460
You're crazy.

578
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,020
Bye.

579
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:20,320
One more, please.

580
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,140
 Are you asleep? 

581
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:43,899
 I'm still awake. I'm thinking about what food I should prepare for you. 

582
00:41:43,899 --> 00:41:46,840
 The food there might not fit your appetite. 

583
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,559
 Hello, Boss? 

584
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,960
Am I that picky with food?

585
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,279
You're not picky, but I am.

586
00:41:57,279 --> 00:42:01,020
As your assistant, it's my duty to make you like me.

587
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,560
I already like you.

588
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:16,820


589
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,659
♫  Destiny is a little annoying  ♫

590
00:42:23,659 --> 00:42:26,600
♫  Takes those I care about  ♫

591
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:30,340
♫  Away from me  ♫

592
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,199
♫  If memory is bright  ♫

593
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:35,220
♫  It would hold up a lamp in my heart  ♫

594
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:39,520
♫  And light up the night  ♫

595
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,199
♫  Sunshine alternates with moonlight  ♫

596
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:03,279
♫  Returning to life in time  ♫

597
00:43:03,279 --> 00:43:06,820
♫  Gift me with a dream  ♫

598
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:11,490
♫  A dream with you in it  ♫

599
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:40,199
♫  The one who caught me off guard  ♫

600
00:43:40,199 --> 00:43:45,240
♫  Steps foot into my life...  ♫

601
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:53,100
♫  It's you...  ♫

602
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:57,400
♫  If it weren't for parting  ♫

603
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:02,600
♫  How can we meet again?  ♫

604
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:09,980
♫  It's you...  ♫

605
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:13,219
♫  Exchanging sunshine for moonlight  ♫

606
00:44:13,219 --> 00:44:16,299
♫  Exchanging fortune for the past  ♫

607
00:44:16,299 --> 00:44:20,960
♫  Exchanging my heartbeat for you  ♫
