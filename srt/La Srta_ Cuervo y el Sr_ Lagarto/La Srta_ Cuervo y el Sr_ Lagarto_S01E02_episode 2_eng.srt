00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,920
â™«  I can't help but feel a little happy  â™«

3
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,560
â™«  I can't help but feel a little nervous  â™«

4
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,959
â™«  The earth is turning because of you  â™«

5
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:28,259
â™«  Without you, the earth stops  â™«

6
00:00:28,259 --> 00:00:34,420
â™«  You are the rainbow that fills up the black and white  â™«

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,959
â™«  I was once obsessed with the legend of the four-leaf clover  â™«

8
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:44,479
â™«  I dreamed of a white-horse carriage and 
you becoming my prince  â™«

9
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:48,639
â™«  Your gaze is too seducing, please save me  â™«

10
00:00:48,639 --> 00:00:53,320
â™«  I'm turning into a moth, flying towards the fire  â™«

11
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,000
â™«  Your smile is dancing on your lips  â™«

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,679
â™«  Am I the happiness you're looking for?  â™«

13
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:07,340
â™«  The doe inside me is lost  â™«

14
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:14,980
â™«  Holding your hand, let's count down to happiness  â™«

15
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:19,579
â™«  I can't help but be a little fragile  â™«

16
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:24,220
â™«  I can't help but feel a little gloomy  â™«

17
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,540
â™«  The sky is bright because of you  â™«

18
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,920
â™«  Without you, the sky is grey  â™«

19
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,339
â™«  You are the angel who takes away all loneliness  â™«

20
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:37,060
   

21
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:41,060
   

22
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,100
Stop bothering me, all right?

23
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,870
Don't look at me like that.

24
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:54,100
I didn't touch you last night.

25
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,439
Please believe me.

26
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,860
Could you please let me explain?

27
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:02,160
I would like to know what happened last night as well.

28
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,940
Didn't you agree to break up?

29
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,539
Don't cry.

30
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:13,539
I know you didn't touch me, but I don't understand.

31
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,779
I got drunk on my own initiative.

32
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,939
Why didn't you do anything?

33
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,860
Did I do something wrong?

34
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,939
I've been handling this order for almost three months.

35
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:31,059
I believe our company is your best option on the market.

36
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,259
I just hope that you can give us a chance.

37
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,739
Let's try working together.

38
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,400
Of course, there will be opportunities,

39
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,500
but it'll depend on

40
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,700
how you're going to repay me.

41
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,740
Why don't you like me?

42
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,960
No reason.

43
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,779
Then why did you drink with me, take me to a hotel, and

44
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,600
sleep next to me?

45
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,019
I paid for the room and I had a lot to drink, too.

46
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,460
Did you expect me to sleep on the sofa?

47
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:02,099
I... I will do my best, give it everything I can.

48
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,739
No, no, no.

49
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,339
That's not important.

50
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,460
The repayment I'm referring to has nothing to do with the order.

51
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,059
This is the key card to my private room upstairs.

52
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,259
Take it.

53
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,040
It'll give you easier access.

54
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,039
Director Ou Yang, there's no need to go through such trouble.

55
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,319
If there are any specific questions,

56
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,779
I'll communicate with your assistant.

57
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,220
No need to waste any of your time.

58
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,939
Pretty high EQ.

59
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,640
I like it.

60
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,129
You don't need to be shy.

61
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,849
We're each getting what we want.

62
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:36,289
Helping each other out.

63
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,670
Working intimately.

64
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,209
I'm leaving.

65
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,770
You're a smart girl.

66
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,570
You know what I want.

67
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:10,010
Give me a chance, I know you'll like me.

68
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,810
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,909
Exceptional people tend to be very busy,

70
00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:16,630
so I don't have time to waste on love.

71
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,169
Don't contact me anymore.

72
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,770
Thank you.

73
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:29,110
Director Ou Yang! Director Ou Yang!

74
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,610
Why in such a rush?

75
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,689
Director Ou Yang, I think you may have misunderstood.

76
00:04:35,689 --> 00:04:37,369
I didn't.

77
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,369
I'm telling you, I can support you.

78
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,649
Your boss, Director Wei, told me you're single.

79
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,849
You need someone to look after you.

80
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:47,950
Otherwise, you'll have trouble falling asleep by yourself at night.

81
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,609
Looking after me at work is enough, please

82
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,910
don't trouble yourself over my personal life.

83
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:57,750
I know that you really need a man in your life,

84
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,970
especially a man like me.

85
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,730
Scumbag.

86
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:31,349
Wait, wait, wait.

87
00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:33,510
Sorry, sorry.

88
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,050
Thank you.

89
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:42,550
You've got moves, beautiful.

90
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,269
Ran into a scumbag?

91
00:05:44,269 --> 00:05:45,489
It's okay.

92
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,090
Have a drink and sleep it off.

93
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:51,750
Trust me, I've been there.

94
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,890
I'm not a scumbag, why did you hit me?

95
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,969
Sir, do you need help?

96
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:08,030
- No, but someone on the third floor does. 
 - Okay.

97
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,550
Hold on.

98
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,809
Well, do you have a tissue?

99
00:06:11,809 --> 00:06:15,530
   

100
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:16,890
How do you feel?

101
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:19,089
Do you want to throw up?

102
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:20,209
Hold on.

103
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,449
Here, here, here. Here's a bag.

104
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:22,769
Here's a bag.

105
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:23,969
In here.

106
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,790
Here, here, here.

107
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,809
Have some yogurt.

108
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,850
Your stomach will feel better.

109
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,250
Here.

110
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:37,790
You have everything in your bag, huh?

111
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,650
I'm a pro.

112
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,430
You're pretty clever.

113
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:45,150
If you need a designated driver, call me anytime.

114
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,969
I have your card.

115
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:51,069
I'll call you if I need you.

116
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:52,470
Great.

117
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,789
Only 600 meters till the car reaches here.

118
00:06:57,789 --> 00:06:59,850
Just hold on a little longer.

119
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,649
You called a car?

120
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:03,609
Thank you.

121
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:04,889
No worries.

122
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,369
I'm already so grateful that

123
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:07,609
you didn't hold me accountable for your car.

124
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,910
I'll only feel at ease once we get you home safely.

125
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:16,030
Is being a designated driver your job?

126
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,920
It's a part-time job.

127
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:21,290
Originally, I was working at a bakery,

128
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:24,850
but today, the bakery shut down.

129
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:29,169
So you're unemployed?

130
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,910
I guess so.

131
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,889
The car's here. Let's get in.

132
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,410
Come on.

133
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:42,409
Be careful.

134
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,330
Slowly, slowly.

135
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:55,929
 This watch can monitor your heart rate, 

136
00:07:55,929 --> 00:07:59,130
 but it's only an estimate based on the rate of your blood flow, 

137
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:02,130
 since you don't actually have a pulse. 

138
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,390
 This car accident 

139
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,889
 caused your chest cavity to be punctured, 

140
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:09,409
 severely damaging your heart. 

141
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:13,169
 This mechanical heart can give you a second life. 

142
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:15,710
 However, you should know that 

143
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:19,970
 it will also bring you pain, which you must endure. 

144
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:24,909
 Its working noise may cause you severe insomnia. 

145
00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:28,849
 If the mechanical heart "beats" too fast, 

146
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:31,590
 you will also be in great pain. 

147
00:08:32,489 --> 00:08:37,110
 Also, there will be restrictions to your life. 

148
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:42,630
 You won't be able to exercise, drink, or fall in love. 

149
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:46,409
 When other people fall in love, it's happiness. 

150
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:49,989
 But when you do, it'll be very dangerous. 

151
00:08:49,989 --> 00:08:56,030
 So, you can't allow yourself to feel too much from now on. 

152
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:58,989
 It has been ten years. 

153
00:08:58,989 --> 00:09:02,929
 This heart used to be able to work for 20 consecutive hours. 

154
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:05,390
 Now, it can only work for 10. 

155
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,249
 Its usage time is getting shorter, 

156
00:09:07,249 --> 00:09:09,389
 while its charging speed is slowing down. 

157
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:12,889
 The doctor told me everything, except for one thing. 

158
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:18,369
 This mechanical heart has another new side effect, which is 

159
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,310
 an electric discharge. 

160
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,169
 When the heart rate reaches 100 bpm, the human body 

161
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:25,470
 can feel the discharge. 

162
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:28,530
 At 110 bpm, there's enough discharge to light up a light bulb 

163
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,650
 and the human body will feel pain. 

164
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,590
 If it reaches 180 bpm... 

165
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,289
 I haven't experienced that either. 

166
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:37,710
 It might be a disaster. 

167
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,590
 But... 

168
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:43,930
 Mr. Gu? 

169
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:46,070
 You need a designated driver? 

170
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,370
 Why was she unaffected? 

171
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:56,949
 Older Brother, where are you? 

172
00:09:56,949 --> 00:09:59,070
 I can't see you. 

173
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:03,190
 Is this your cake? 

174
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,490
 It's my birthday today. 

175
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,090
 Wishing you... 

176
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:12,389
 happiness every day. 

177
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:14,290
 Older Brother! 

178
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:36,589
 Hello. I'm the one you drove home last night, Su Manlin. 

179
00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:38,169
 Our company is hiring. 

180
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,409
 If you're interested, come to Chuan Studios 

181
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:44,210
 on the 18th floor of the Yun Yi building at 10:00 in the morning. 

182
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,569
 Thank you for the opportunity. 

183
00:10:45,569 --> 00:10:47,730
 I'll be there on time. 

184
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,109
Grandma! Aunty!

185
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:55,070
I'm getting a new job!

186
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:06,409
Jiang Xiaoning, this is where you will start anew.

187
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:07,910
Let's go!

188
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:17,150
Director Gu? Director Gu!

189
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,290
Gu... Gu...

190
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,690
Gu...

191
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,290
Is your hand okay?

192
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:52,429
- It's fine. 
 -  That's good.

193
00:11:52,429 --> 00:11:54,189
The building's management has already contacted us.

194
00:11:54,189 --> 00:11:57,289
They may get in touch if there are any issues moving forward.

195
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:59,890
Are they looking for compensation?

196
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,629
They should be compensating you instead.

197
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:03,049
It's the management's negligence.

198
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,889
They failed to identify this safety hazard.

199
00:12:04,889 --> 00:12:05,889
That's good.

200
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:07,689
It's okay, this is just a small matter.

201
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,690
No one has it easy.

202
00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:20,090
So here's the deal. We are hiring an assistant for Director Gu.

203
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,870
Looking at your resume...

204
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,950
You know how to drive?

205
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,729
That's good. Very good.

206
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:29,769
Yes.

207
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:32,309
A lot of my previous jobs were in the service industry,

208
00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:34,469
so I have some experience when it comes to the service industry,

209
00:12:34,469 --> 00:12:36,730
which can be applied here.

210
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,729
I don't need an assistant.

211
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,449
Actually, I have a lot of strengths.

212
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,769
I'm extremely diligent.

213
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,409
I only need four to five hours of sleep a day

214
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:44,929
to function, energetically, for the whole day.

215
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,809
And I don't really get sick.

216
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,129
My sense of pain is delayed.

217
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,449
Small cuts and bruises don't get to me at all.

218
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:54,450
I won't let any illness or injuries affect my work.

219
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:58,009
Even if I need an assistant, it should be an assistant architect.

220
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,689
I studied architectural design.

221
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:02,289
Although I didn't graduate, I have some basic knowledge.

222
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,250
I'm still learning.

223
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,729
You haven't graduated?

224
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:06,969
Then study hard.

225
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:09,170
We'll talk after you've graduated.

226
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:10,909
I'll be extra diligent.

227
00:13:10,909 --> 00:13:13,250
Please give me a chance.

228
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,750
I knew it would end like this.

229
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:27,149
Director Su, I'm sorry. It's my fault.

230
00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:29,809
It's okay. It was my fault for not being clear.

231
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,129
I didn't know you were still a student.

232
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:33,649
Actually, I dropped out.

233
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:36,610
I want to earn enough money before going back to university.

234
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:41,530
I won't trouble you further.

235
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:50,430
   

236
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,930
Manlin, were you okay last night?

237
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:17,910
I'm fine.

238
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:20,449
The designated driver girl took care of me all night long.

239
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,809
She seemed nice and meticulous,

240
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:24,929
so I asked her to come for an interview to be Director Gu's assistant.

241
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,129
What did Gu Chuan say?

242
00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:28,149
Director Gu says he doesn't need an assistant.

243
00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:30,750
If he needed one, it would have to be a Design assistant.

244
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:34,209
He asked her to study hard in her major and come back after she graduates.

245
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:39,049
Studies design, knows how to drive, meticulous. She's a perfect fit.

246
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:41,390
What is Gu Chuan thinking?

247
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,089
Looks like I'll have to get involved.

248
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:45,590
Just you wait.

249
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,009
Good luck.

250
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:48,129
Miss, is your hand okay?

251
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,429
It's fine, it's fine.

252
00:14:49,429 --> 00:14:50,969
If there are any issues, reach out to us anytime.

253
00:14:50,969 --> 00:14:52,089
Sure, apologies.

254
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,849
- Really sorry. 
 - Itâ€¦ It's okay, it's okay.

255
00:14:53,849 --> 00:14:55,970
- Take it easy. 
 - Okay.

256
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:56,909
I'm fine, I'm fine.

257
00:14:56,909 --> 00:14:59,069
- Take care, take care. 
 - Okay.

258
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,830
Drawing again?

259
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:08,250
Why didn't you knock?

260
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,329
Heard that you killed

261
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,890
Miss Designated Driver's dreams of becoming an assistant.

262
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,909
Don't you normally stay out of the studio's affairs?

263
00:15:15,909 --> 00:15:17,149
I want to get involved in this.

264
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:18,609
This matter concerns me greatly.

265
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:22,090
If you think I'm annoying, you can ignore me.

266
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,629
 Hello, Sister Yan Yan. 

267
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:31,450
How was the interview?

268
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:33,670
 I didn't get picked. 

269
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,729
Still laughing despite not getting picked?

270
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:38,350
I'm used to it. I'll just try again.

271
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,889
Good. How about this?

272
00:15:39,889 --> 00:15:41,449
I'll go to your place for dinner tonight

273
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,830
and get extra food for your aunty and grandma.

274
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,810
Sure, see you tonight.

275
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:51,989
Let me be honest with you.

276
00:15:51,989 --> 00:15:55,169
It was me who asked Wang Kai and Su Manlin to look for an assistant for you.

277
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:58,910
I just wanted to get you a personal assistant, like a female driver.

278
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,609
I don't need one.

279
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:03,330
You do. I do too.

280
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:08,190
If you need one, you can get Wang Kai to find you one.

281
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:10,529
The girl who came today was the designated driver

282
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:11,749
who got me home last night.

283
00:16:11,749 --> 00:16:13,049
Her driving is okay.

284
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:14,209
She just lost her job.

285
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,409
You can help her out.

286
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,830
You helping her is as good as helping me.

287
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,989
You said it yourself, her driving is okay.

288
00:16:19,989 --> 00:16:22,529
And she studies design, which can be considered relevant.

289
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:24,649
You can't keep getting me to be your driver.

290
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,850
I'm very busy every day.

291
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,009
Are you?

292
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:31,710
I am. Incredibly busy.

293
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:36,649
I think you're busy having meals, shopping, and gaming

294
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:38,009
with all your girlfriends.

295
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:41,530
This is pure envy, jealousy, and hate.

296
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:52,929
There's nothing to be envious, jealous, or hateful about.

297
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,609
Maybe hate.

298
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:56,790
But I don't hate you.

299
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:00,550
I just hate myself for not dying earlier.

300
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,009
Okay, I misspoke.

301
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:04,290
Don't think so much, okay?

302
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,569
It's okay.

303
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:07,889
I'm not bothered by anything you say.

304
00:17:07,889 --> 00:17:10,850
Chuan, stop spending all your time thinking about those pointless things.

305
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:12,629
You need to have some hope in life.

306
00:17:12,629 --> 00:17:15,049
You still have this studio and your parents.

307
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:17,249
Say no more, you can't outtalk me.

308
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,569
I can't outtalk you, but I can annoy the hell out of you.

309
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:21,509
You have everyone, you have me.

310
00:17:21,509 --> 00:17:23,729
You need to be responsible for me.

311
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:27,209
Right now, I really want to tell you...

312
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:29,130
To get lost, right?

313
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,269
It's okay. I have thick skin.

314
00:17:31,269 --> 00:17:32,969
I won't get lost.

315
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,849
Since you don't like other people watching after you,

316
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,209
then my apologies. I'll just have to sacrifice my precious time

317
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,910
to watch after you myself.

318
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:40,890
What can you do with me?

319
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,609
Fine. Do whatever you want.

320
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,890
   

321
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:18,810
   

322
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,890
My book!

323
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:34,470
Boss Gu.

324
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,410
You read this, too?

325
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:41,449
You can have it if you like. This is the last one in the shop.

326
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,850
Okay, I'll take it then.

327
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:00,130
Why do you keep following me?

328
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:02,129
Can I discuss something with you?

329
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:03,729
Let me copy your book.

330
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:04,969
I'll return it to you after I'm done copying.

331
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:07,590
My copying speed is really fast.

332
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:12,090
This book? You can have it.

333
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:14,110
That won't do.

334
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:16,630
If you need this book for your studies,

335
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,910
I'll just buy another book.

336
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:22,649
Then let's add each other on WeChat. I'll transfer the money to you.

337
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:23,729
I'll transfer the money to you.

338
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:24,609
No need.

339
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:25,569
That won't do.

340
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:28,630
I'll feel better if I pay for my own study material.

341
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,830
Let me scan you.

342
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:45,150
Study hard.

343
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,590
Boss Gu!

344
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:06,949
I gave you the book.

345
00:20:06,949 --> 00:20:08,449
Why are you still following me?

346
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,110
Can I ask you a question?

347
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,210
Okay.

348
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,609
What's the real reason behind you rejecting me?

349
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:14,929
I don't need an assistant.

350
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:16,729
But I need this job.

351
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:19,810
So? Does that mean I have to hire you?

352
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:22,050
That's not what I meant.

353
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:26,129
Although I dropped out of school, I'm still learning on my own

354
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:27,649
in order to pursue my dreams.

355
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:31,049
Now that there's a chance to work in a design studio,

356
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:33,529
this opportunity is too precious to me.

357
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:36,530
With this job, I can support my family

358
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:39,249
and interact closely with professionals.

359
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,329
Once I've saved enough money,

360
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:42,530
I can go back to university and finish my studies.

361
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:47,470
First, your dream has nothing to do with me.

362
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:52,809
Next, if you want to be a designer, there are no shortcuts.

363
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:57,210
The only path for you is to continue your studies.

364
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:08,689
You're right.

365
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:13,069
But in this world, there's always more than one path to any destination.

366
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:26,310
â™«  Caught off-guard by our first encounter  â™«

367
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:30,810
â™«  And the corner of your mouth is lifting  â™«

368
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:34,250
â™«  Heart pounding involuntarily, this phenomenon  â™«

369
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:38,949
â™«  Am I abnormal or are you shining  â™«

370
00:21:38,949 --> 00:21:42,689
Although I made a detour, I'm not wasting my time.

371
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:44,790
Even if I have to sacrifice more than others,

372
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:48,430
I believe as long as I keep going, I'll reach my destination.

373
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:52,069
It's just that along the way, I need pioneers like you

374
00:21:52,069 --> 00:21:54,550
to give me a chance.

375
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:58,150
Our destinations are different.

376
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,510
My office is over there.

377
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:08,830
Missed a crossing.

378
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,370
Your thinking isn't bad.

379
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:14,250
But what you need the most now is to continue studying.

380
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,410
If you have any financial difficulties,

381
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:20,970
you can apply for scholarships or loans.

382
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:26,750
Actually, I can take a bus in front of your office building.

383
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:31,129
- Balloons, balloons, balloons! 
 - Balloons!

384
00:22:31,129 --> 00:22:33,789
- Balloons, balloons, balloons! 
- Balloons!

385
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:36,550
My balloons!

386
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:39,930
How much must that have cost.

387
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:13,590
 Gu, did something happen to you? 

388
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,689
No, nothing.

389
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:18,330
I saw that your heart rate has been extremely high.

390
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,730
That's not good.

391
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:22,029
I know.

392
00:23:22,029 --> 00:23:24,189
 Come to the lab next week. 

393
00:23:24,189 --> 00:23:26,349
 Several patches need to be updated. 

394
00:23:26,349 --> 00:23:27,270
Will they help?

395
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,790
Of course.

396
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:33,020
The working noise will decrease by around ten percent.

397
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,310
And?

398
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,349
That's it.

399
00:23:36,349 --> 00:23:39,990
I'm still working on the rest.

400
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,489
Continue working at it then.

401
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:45,569
Gu, are you unhappy with me?

402
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:47,870
I'm not unhappy with you.

403
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:50,570
I'm unhappy with myself.

404
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:53,749
 Forget it, forget it. Let's not talk about this. 

405
00:23:53,749 --> 00:23:57,850
 Come to the lab next week to do your updates. 

406
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:59,689
I won't be going.

407
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:03,410
I want to make use of this time to win the Jin An Award as soon as possible.

408
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:07,489
Is that award more important, or is your life more important?

409
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:10,010
 Everyone has a different view of life. 

410
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:15,130
To Gu Chuan, it's better to be dead.

411
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:16,329
 Gu! 

412
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:19,089
Okay, Doctor. I have things to attend to.

413
00:24:19,089 --> 00:24:20,430
Let's end the conversation here.

414
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,410
Thank you.

415
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:31,069
Hello. This is yours, right?

416
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:32,950
Okay.

417
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:35,630
Here you go, come again soon!

418
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:40,310
Dear customer, is there something you need?

419
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,949
I need you.

420
00:24:41,949 --> 00:24:43,430
Me?

421
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,110
Then you might have to wait a little longer.

422
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,889
There's still a while before I get off work.

423
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:48,490
Okay.

424
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:52,189
Dear customer, do you want to participate in our activity today?

425
00:24:52,189 --> 00:24:53,609
What activity?

426
00:24:53,609 --> 00:24:55,690
Come, come, come.

427
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:58,109
As long as you put on this mask, hold this stick,

428
00:24:58,109 --> 00:25:01,910
and hit any of these letters, you'll get a surprise gift.

429
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:04,109
We're doing it on a just and equitable basis.

430
00:25:04,109 --> 00:25:06,929
Don't peek. Don't cheat.

431
00:25:06,929 --> 00:25:10,090
Just and equitable.

432
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:12,529
Please begin.

433
00:25:12,529 --> 00:25:13,410
Hit!

434
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:14,790
Okay, okay, okay.

435
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:17,189
- Is that good? 
 - Yes, yes, yes.

436
00:25:17,189 --> 00:25:18,849
What's this?

437
00:25:18,849 --> 00:25:21,509
Snacks from Lai Yi Fen. Two bags!

438
00:25:21,509 --> 00:25:22,430
Really?

439
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:24,150
Follow me, dear customer.

440
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:25,189
Come, come, come.

441
00:25:25,189 --> 00:25:26,310
This much?

442
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:29,889
Two gift bags of fresh snacks from Lai Yi Fen!

443
00:25:29,889 --> 00:25:31,589
Do you mean I get two bags?

444
00:25:31,589 --> 00:25:33,109
It's because you have such good luck.

445
00:25:33,109 --> 00:25:35,550
All thanks to you.

446
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:38,110
Keep it up later.

447
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:42,029
Miss Jiang Xiaoning recently got a new job

448
00:25:42,029 --> 00:25:47,670
at a famous architectural design company, working as a receptionist.

449
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:50,269
Very good, very good. I believe in your acting skills.

450
00:25:50,269 --> 00:25:55,549
Thank you, Director Jiang, for your affirmation. Let me repay you.

451
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:08,210
Finally getting off work.

452
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,510
Let me give you a lift.

453
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:16,529
It's fine. I'll walk.

454
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:47,330
 What do people like me live for? 

455
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:50,989
 If life had already flashed a red light, 

456
00:26:50,989 --> 00:26:55,060
 shouldn't you stop and wait for death? 

457
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:58,310
 Or are you supposed to 

458
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:02,810
 use this time to do something meaningful? 

459
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:06,249
 Although I took a detour, I'm not wasting my time. 

460
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:08,230
 Even if I have to sacrifice more than others, 

461
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:11,650
 I believe as long as I keep going, I'll reach my destination. 

462
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:17,710
 Just that on the way, I need pioneers like you to give me a chance. 

463
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:22,590
â™«  Wandering Earth  â™«

464
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,749
Hey, Wang Kai.

465
00:27:24,749 --> 00:27:28,530
There's something I need you to do tomorrow.

466
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:31,650
â™«  Where the body wants to go  â™«

467
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:36,070
â™«  In my memory  â™«

468
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:39,810
â™«  Who is that?  â™«

469
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:43,930
â™«  I toss and turn  â™«

470
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:49,410
â™«  Pieces piece together our encounter  â™«

471
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:50,750
â™«  I'm willing to admit  â™«

472
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,550
â™«  I belonged to you from that moment on  â™«

473
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:55,250
â™«  I still won't quit  â™«

474
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,789
â™«  Even if I'm driving off the highway  â™«

475
00:27:57,789 --> 00:28:01,049
â™«  The clips flash back to awake your silhouette in the shadows  â™«

476
00:28:01,049 --> 00:28:07,730
â™«  The light in your eyes shines more and 
 more clearly, like the night  â™«

477
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:10,489
   

478
00:28:10,489 --> 00:28:13,350
Food is ready.

479
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:15,610
Grandma, it isn't the lobster season yet.

480
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,329
Let's have some crayfish first.

481
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:18,970
Sure, sure.

482
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:21,629
Jiang Xiaoning, did you pick up some money?

483
00:28:21,629 --> 00:28:22,769
Or do you not want to live anymore?

484
00:28:22,769 --> 00:28:24,229
Don't scare Aunty.

485
00:28:24,229 --> 00:28:28,729
Aunty, Xiaoning got a new job, of course we need to celebrate.

486
00:28:28,729 --> 00:28:32,849
That's right. Aunty, Grandma, this time I'm working in a Class A office building.

487
00:28:32,849 --> 00:28:34,449
An architectural design company.

488
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:36,490
Don't you think that's worth celebrating?

489
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,950
Our Xiaoning has made something of herself.

490
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,889
She has made something of herself.

491
00:28:40,889 --> 00:28:44,810
- That's not too bad. 
 - Xiaoning, what kind of job is it this time?

492
00:28:45,329 --> 00:28:47,350
Receptionist.

493
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:52,070
That's fine, too. That's fine, too.

494
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:54,729
Xiaoning's dream is to be an architect, right?

495
00:28:54,729 --> 00:28:56,369
This is slightly related, right?

496
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:58,609
It's okay, it's okay. Make your way up slowly, slowly.

497
00:28:58,609 --> 00:28:59,689
That's right.

498
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:03,750
Ning Ning, Aunty hopes that your dream comes true.

499
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,969
Grandma too.

500
00:29:04,969 --> 00:29:06,489
- Grandma too. 
 - Yan Yan too.

501
00:29:06,489 --> 00:29:08,150
Thank you.

502
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:10,690
Cheers!

503
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:16,430
Yan'er, Aunty has introduced so many guys to you.

504
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:17,870
Isn't there one you fancy?

505
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:22,629
Aunty, I fancy them, but they don't fancy me.

506
00:29:22,629 --> 00:29:24,049
You need to continue helping me.

507
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:25,070
Come on.

508
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:27,969
You're the same as Aunty. It must be that your expectations are too high, right?

509
00:29:27,969 --> 00:29:30,309
My expectations aren't high at all.

510
00:29:30,309 --> 00:29:31,869
In fact, my standards are really low.

511
00:29:31,869 --> 00:29:33,230
Just needs to be like Andy Lau.

512
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,909
I don't like what you're saying.

513
00:29:34,909 --> 00:29:37,370
How is your uncle low in quality?

514
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:38,450
Who is Andy Lau?

515
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:42,349
Mom, Andy Lau is your son-in-law. Have you forgotten?

516
00:29:42,349 --> 00:29:44,269
Ask Andy Lau to join us for dinner.

517
00:29:44,269 --> 00:29:45,649
Give him a call.

518
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:47,790
Get our son-in-law to join us for dinner.

519
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:50,909
Okay, we'll call. Eat.

520
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:12,830
   

521
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:22,489
Hello, Mom.

522
00:30:22,489 --> 00:30:24,309
 Little Chuan, are you going to bed? 

523
00:30:24,309 --> 00:30:26,630
Soon.

524
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:28,469
 How has your health been recently? 

525
00:30:28,469 --> 00:30:30,670
Pretty good.

526
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:33,629
 Dad and Mom are coming back to China to settle some stuff. 

527
00:30:33,629 --> 00:30:35,830
We want to pay you a visit.

528
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:38,270
Do you have time?

529
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,710
I do.

530
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:45,149
We discussed and decided that we won't be leaving after returning home this time.

531
00:30:45,149 --> 00:30:46,749
We want to live with you.

532
00:30:46,749 --> 00:30:48,310
Not sure if you're willing?

533
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:52,789
 If you're okay with it, we plan to sell our house over here 

534
00:30:52,789 --> 00:30:55,970
 and buy one near you. 

535
00:30:55,970 --> 00:31:01,129
 This way, Mom can cook good food and clean the house for you every day. 

536
00:31:01,129 --> 00:31:03,049
And you can concentrate on your work,

537
00:31:03,049 --> 00:31:06,269
play chess with your dad when you're free, have chats with me.

538
00:31:06,269 --> 00:31:09,009
This way, we, as a family, can live like we used to.

539
00:31:09,009 --> 00:31:10,930
How about it?

540
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:17,590
 Little Chuan, are you listening? 

541
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:19,470
I am.

542
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:24,790
Mom, I'm used to living alone.

543
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:27,709
I won't be used to it if you guys come over.

544
00:31:27,709 --> 00:31:29,589
But you need someone to take care of you.

545
00:31:29,589 --> 00:31:32,109
Besides, when you've lived alone for so long,

546
00:31:32,109 --> 00:31:35,730
you'll start having psychological problems sooner or later.

547
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,550
I'm doing very well.

548
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:41,089
 Little Chuan, why do you keep pushing us away? 

549
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:43,969
What did we do wrong? You can tell us.

550
00:31:43,969 --> 00:31:47,230
 Mom, I've told you many times. 

551
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:49,649
 You didn't do anything wrong. 

552
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:54,450
It's just that I need my own personal space.

553
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:56,229
But we're a family.

554
00:31:56,229 --> 00:31:58,149
We can't always be this estranged.

555
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:00,229
Son, has Mom been doing poorly in any aspect?

556
00:32:00,229 --> 00:32:03,810
If I haven't been doing good enough, I apologize, all right?

557
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:05,709
 Apologize? 

558
00:32:05,709 --> 00:32:08,589
 For what? We don't owe him. 

559
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:21,510
   
 Doctor, how is my son doing? 

560
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:23,810
 His heart has sustained severe damage and his blood pressure is too low. 

561
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:28,029
 He's in critical condition and no longer suitable for a heart transplant. 

562
00:32:29,349 --> 00:32:31,889
 Doctor! Please save my son! I beg you! 

563
00:32:31,889 --> 00:32:34,510
 Isn't there another way? 

564
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:37,330
 There is one way that may give him a chance, 

565
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,249
 but are you willing to give it a shot? 

566
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,010
 What is it? 

567
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:44,090
 A mechanical heart implant. 

568
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,049
 Mechanical heart? 

569
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:50,169
 The R&amp;D is done by Dr. Peer. 

570
00:32:50,169 --> 00:32:53,829
 Mechanical hearts are the only clinically proven artificial heart product. 

571
00:32:53,829 --> 00:32:56,009
 The possibility of rejection is very low. 

572
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:59,689
 But there will be side effects during its use. 

573
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:02,930
 Moreover, future maintenance will be very expensive. 

574
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:05,610
 As long as it will help my son live, 

575
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:09,110
 we're willing to accept any procedure. 

576
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:11,170
 Okay. 

577
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:14,910
â™«  The destined person  â™«

578
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,570
 I'm sorry. 

579
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:19,190
 If I distance myself from you, 

580
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:23,930
 maybe you won't be too heartbroken when I die. 

581
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:28,230
 I'm ready to leave this world, 

582
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:32,370
 but I'm not ready to say goodbye to you. 

583
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:38,369
 The mechanical heart uses a built-in turbine to 

584
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:43,409
 pump human blood through a mechanical pump to the aorta. 

585
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:48,590
 The internal magnetic field allows the turbine to run in suspension. 

586
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:53,949
 It won't create any friction and the parts won't have any wear-and-tear. 

587
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:57,530
 It has a lifespan of at least ten years. 

588
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:03,190
 Around the world, 400 patients have undergone mechanical heart transplant surgeries. 

589
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:06,530
 Their bodies have recovered well. 

590
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:30,350
â™«  The one who caught me off guard  â™«

591
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:34,670
â™«  Steps foot into my life...  â™«

592
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:43,250
â™«  It's you...  â™«

593
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:47,550
â™«  If it weren't for parting  â™«

594
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:51,810
â™«  How can we meet again?  â™«

595
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:13,230
â™«  Thankfully, faith allows people to  â™«

596
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:17,470
â™«  Defend their fates  â™«

597
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:26,130
â™«  Come on...  â™«

598
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:30,390
â™«  The destined one  â™«

599
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:34,690
â™«  Guide me forward  â™«

600
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:43,230
â™«  It's you...  â™«

601
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,230
â™«  Exchanging sunshine for moonlight  â™«

602
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:49,310
â™«  Exchanging fortune for the past  â™«

603
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:53,210
â™«  Exchanging my heartbeat for you  â™«

604
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:21,910
Hey, kid, wake up!

605
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:24,969
Aunty, what are you doing?

606
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:28,770
For your first day, Aunty got some new clothes for you.

607
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,109
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

608
00:36:30,109 --> 00:36:31,910
Get up!

609
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:38,350
New clothes?

610
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:44,610
Aunty, these are a little too big.

611
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:45,749
No, they aren't.

612
00:36:45,749 --> 00:36:47,969
The relaxed fit is the trend this year.

613
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:49,949
These are Aunty's most expensive clothes.

614
00:36:49,949 --> 00:36:51,469
I'm telling you, these are too precious to wear.

615
00:36:51,469 --> 00:36:54,210
Which is older? Me or the clothes?

616
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:55,729
Fashion goes round in circles.

617
00:36:55,729 --> 00:36:58,750
In my opinion, it's time these make a comeback.

618
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:02,990
Xiaoning, this outfit looks good on you, really good.

619
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:04,049
See?

620
00:37:04,049 --> 00:37:05,329
Really?

621
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:08,270
You look just as good as your aunty.

622
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:10,589
What's with your expression? You don't believe me?

623
00:37:10,589 --> 00:37:11,549
You don't believe me?

624
00:37:11,549 --> 00:37:13,609
I'm telling you! I used to be a beauty back in the days,

625
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:15,190
the prettiest in the neighborhood.

626
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:17,449
If my suitors were to line up here, the line would go all the way to Shanghai.

627
00:37:17,449 --> 00:37:18,910
Mom, right?

628
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:21,729
Right. You're my daughter, of course you're pretty.

629
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:23,430
That's right!

630
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:26,690
Xiaoning, these clothes do look nice,

631
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:28,289
but do they meet the school dress code?

632
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:30,649
Granny, she's going to work.

633
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:31,990
Nonsense.

634
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:35,570
She's too young to work.

635
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:37,949
Xiaoning, come here.

636
00:37:37,949 --> 00:37:41,430
Take this to school, share it with your classmates.

637
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:43,470
Thanks, Grandma.

638
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:50,850
Wasn't she doing well two days ago?

639
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:52,669
She's in her 70s.

640
00:37:52,669 --> 00:37:55,250
Sometimes she can think clearly, sometimes she can't.

641
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:57,989
All right. If you guys say these look good, then it must be the truth.

642
00:37:57,989 --> 00:37:59,809
I'll wear this outfit to work today.

643
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,009
Are you happy?

644
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:02,489
Absolutely.

645
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,850
I'm going to work.

646
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:07,270
Mom, you changed the channel again.

647
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:08,629
Can we look at a different male celebrity?

648
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:11,909
   

649
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:14,150
   

650
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:38,930
Brother Xu.

651
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:40,510
Xiaoning.

652
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:48,749
Xiaoning, your outfit is quite retro disco.

653
00:38:48,749 --> 00:38:51,529
Brother Xu, can you not make fun of me as soon as we meet?

654
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:53,289
How could I, Boss Jiang?

655
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:55,959
I just think it's pretty cute.

656
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,560
Aunty made me wear her clothes to work.

657
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,579
Work? You found a new job?

658
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,480
Let me take this call.

659
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,200
Hello?

660
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,260
This is Jiang Xiaoning.

661
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,199
Yes, yes. Now is fine.

662
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,580
I won't be late.

663
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,100
Thank you.

664
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,700
Xiaoning, what is it?

665
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,279
What did you ask me just now?

666
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,599
I was just asking whether you had found a new job?

667
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,079
I hadn't originally, but now I have.

668
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,279
And it's related to architectural design.

669
00:39:28,279 --> 00:39:29,759
Assistant to the boss.

670
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,239
Nice going, Xiaoning!

671
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,279
Brother Xu, I need to borrow the back seat of your car

672
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,300
to make some adjustments to my outfit.

673
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,519
Oh right. Those are for you.

674
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,859
You brought me gifts again? I can't take them.

675
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:45,279
I just happened to pass Lai Yi Fen on my way here.

676
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,579
Snacks? Snacks are okay.

677
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:51,360
Grandma was just telling me to share this with my friends.

678
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,820
Thank you, my good friend.

679
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:57,240
It's your first day, let me drop you off.

680
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,179
Driver Tang, we're going to be late.

681
00:39:59,179 --> 00:40:00,580
What are you waiting for?

682
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:03,120
Yes, Boss Jiang, right away.

683
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,119
Best of luck, Xiaoning.

684
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,620
Okay.

685
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,519
Brother Xu, drive safe.

686
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:28,820
 Good luck. Bye-bye. 

687
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,420
Bye-bye.

688
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,499
Miss.

689
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:37,540
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

690
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,619
Did you get hurt?

691
00:40:38,619 --> 00:40:40,620
Did it hurt? Up you go.

692
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,440
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

693
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,160
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

694
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,840
I'm so sorry.

695
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:52,740
It's okay, Aunty. It's okay.

696

â™«  I was wet the moment I cried  â™«

697

â™«  Yeah, the moment I cried  â™«

698

 Jiang Xiaoning, Jiang Xiaoning. 

702
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,940
 Your jobs do flow like water 

703
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,720
 and your bad luck is seriously etched in steel.
