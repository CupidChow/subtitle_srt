â™«  I can't help but feel a little happy  â™«

â™«  I can't help but feel a little nervous  â™«

â™«  The earth is turning because of you  â™«

â™«  You are the rainbow that fills up the black and white  â™«

â™«  I was once obsessed with the legend of the four-leaf clover  â™«

â™«  I dreamed of a white-horse carriage and

â™«  Your smile is dancing on your lips  â™«

00:00:58,089 --> 00:01:02,669
â™«  Am I the happiness you're looking for?  â™«

â™«  I can't help but be a little fragile  â™«

16
00:01:19,529 --> 00:01:24,069
â™«  I can't help but feel a little gloomy  â™«

17

â™«  The sky is bright because of you  â™«

18
00:01:26,629 --> 00:01:28,949
â™«  Without you, the sky is grey  â™«

00:01:28,949 --> 00:01:33,289
â™«  You are the angel who takes away all loneliness  â™«

20
00:01:33,289 --> 00:01:37,110
   

21
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:41,010
   

22
00:01:55,330 --> 00:02:00,250
   
     

23
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,730
 Director Gu, this is for you. 

24
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,549
 - What is this? 
 - A present. 

25
00:02:19,549 --> 00:02:22,250
 Director Gu, I wish you good health and happiness. 

26
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,550
Auntie.

27
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,329
Auntie, please hear me out first.

28
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:47,130
Jiang Xiaoning.

29
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,989
Have you forgotten? You foolish girl.

30
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:51,450
Your father never took a single cent from anyone.

31
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,211
Why would he embezzle tens of millions of public funds?

32
00:02:54,211 --> 00:02:57,150
That is all because of this so-called good friend!

33
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,529
Your father.

34
00:02:58,529 --> 00:03:00,390
My brother.

35
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,249
Would I not know what kind of person he is?

36
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:04,650
Dead men tell no tales.

37
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,649
No. How could he be framed by such a person?

38
00:03:06,649 --> 00:03:07,929
Do you understand?

39
00:03:07,929 --> 00:03:08,889
It's already in the past.

40
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:11,590
Besides, Brother Xu has nothing to do with this.

41
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,329
I'm telling you I won't forget this.

42
00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:16,450
I will never move on from this.

43
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,049
We'll leave. We are moving out right now.

44
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:21,169
Mom, let's go.

45
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:22,829
Please calm down.

46
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:24,289
You've only just recovered.

47
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:26,169
Grandma is getting older. She couldn't stand being in distress.

48
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:29,149
I'll head back first. I'll visit you another day.

49
00:03:29,149 --> 00:03:31,459
You don't have to go. It's us who should move out.

50
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:33,719
Jiang Xiaoning, are you leaving?

51
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:35,299
Auntie. Auntie.

52
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,590
- Mom. 
 - Auntie!

53
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:41,320
Auntie, when you were admitted to the hospital,

54
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,759
Grandma forgot to turn off the stove

55
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:45,739
and almost burned the entire house down.

56
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:48,499
I don't have any money left to compensate the landlord.

57
00:03:48,499 --> 00:03:50,599
You should know that the money used to pay your hospital bills

58
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:52,299
was borrowed from my company.

59
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:57,220
I can't afford any agent fees or deposits anymore.

60
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,040
Xiaoning, you have to understand.

61
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,519
You know it, too. I can't talk about your father.

62
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:07,759
Whenever I do, I just get so angry.

63
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:09,720
I just can't help it.

64
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,479
I'm not blaming you.

65
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:14,819
Don't cry. You poor thing.

66
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:16,640
All right.

67
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,759
I promise that I will work hard and make a lot of money.

68
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:22,779
When the house is fixed, we will go back to our place.

69
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:24,480
Okay?

70
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,559
Get some rest with Grandma.

71
00:04:29,559 --> 00:04:32,200
I'll go and talk to Brother Xu.

72
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,860
Don't ever mention his name.

73
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,559
Xiaoning, are you okay?

74
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,159
I'm fine, Brother Xu.

75
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:58,039
Brother Xu, please understand my auntie.

76
00:04:58,039 --> 00:04:59,139
That's the way she is.

77
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:01,199
She's just harsh with her words.

78
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,059
She probably still can't let go of the past.

79
00:05:04,059 --> 00:05:05,820
I understand.

80
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,579
But we don't know the truth behind it.

81
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:11,159
No matter what happened, we still grew up together.

82
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:13,680
What happened between the last generation stays with them.

83
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,120
It won't change us, no matter the circumstances.

84
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,740
What about you?

85
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,159
Will you blame me just like your auntie does?

86
00:05:21,159 --> 00:05:24,979
I won't. You're still Brother Tang Xu that I have known since little.

87
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:27,800
Besides, it doesn't hurt me as much now.

88
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,560
It's as you said.

89
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,579
Being alive is about moving forward.

90
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:35,160
I still have a lot of important things to do.

91
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,700
I believe my parents are watching me from Heaven.

92
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:44,720
If I'm sad, they will be upset, too.

93
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:03,170
I know you're not involved.

94
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:06,029
- But... 
 - I understand, Xiaoning.

95
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,830
For you, I will try my best to let her change her mind about me.

96
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,669
I'm sorry, Brother Xu.

97
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:17,170
I never thought things would end up like this.

98
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:19,849
When our house is fixed, we'll move back immediately.

99
00:06:19,849 --> 00:06:21,910
Thank you, Brother Xu.

100
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,430
I feel really refreshed after a shower.

101
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,830
Did I have a bad fall just now?

102
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,410
Did you lose your memory?

103
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:49,670
Who am I?

104
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,090
Where am I?

105
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:55,669
But why is my phone not ringing at all?

106
00:06:55,669 --> 00:06:57,530
Why didn't Yan Yan look for me?

107
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,989
Why are you still working at this hour?

108
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:04,589
Don't push yourself so hard to earn money for me.

109
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:08,150
I'm very glad but I care for you more.

110
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,309
What are you so invested in?

111
00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:13,809
Doing my notes.

112
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:15,069
Whose notebook is this?

113
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:16,450
Mine.

114
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,310
Your notebook?

115
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,990
Such a girly notebook?

116
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,189
   

117
00:07:24,189 --> 00:07:26,450
Jiang Xiaoning?

118
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:29,089
You are annotating Jiang Xiaoning's design?

119
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:31,070
You care for her this much?

120
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,689
She has huge potential.

121
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:34,349
She deserves some guidance.

122
00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:36,449
I think you're getting old that you are starting to like to preach.

123
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,010
Then do I have the potential?

124
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,250
You?

125
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,730
Forget about it.

126
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:45,169
No matter how you insult me, even if you throw me

127
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:48,389
the nastiest remarks, you can't extinguish

128
00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:50,429
the burning curiosity in my heart.

129
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:51,509
Tell me.

130
00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:53,249
Did you fall for Jiang Xiaoning?

131
00:07:53,249 --> 00:07:54,950
Yes.

132
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:58,249
She's ambitious and motivated.

133
00:07:58,249 --> 00:08:00,009
Plus, she's optimistic and full of life.

134
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:01,369
If there is proper guidance,

135
00:08:01,369 --> 00:08:04,950
she can be a great architect in the future.

136
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:08,849
What I feel for her is how an employer likes his employee.

137
00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:10,470
That's all.

138
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,210
That's all?

139
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:19,629
If that's the case, you can't be the one

140
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:21,790
to return this notebook to her.

141
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,589
Why?

142
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:25,709
As her boss, you annotated her design.

143
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:27,389
That's already a big favor.

144
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:29,529
To not let her misunderstand, I will be the one

145
00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:31,129
to return this notebook to her.

146
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:33,110
That's decided.

147
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:36,909
Chuan, thank you.

148
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:38,349
What for?

149
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:41,929
For giving me a proper reason to go to Yan Yan.

150
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:45,450
This will be my ultimate weapon when she doesn't want to see me.

151
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,349
That would have to wait until she's willing to see you.

152
00:08:48,349 --> 00:08:51,030
Whether she wants to or not, I'm going to see her.

153
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,170
   

154
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,110
Can you put on some clothes?

155
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,829
Do you not realize you wear the same clothes every day?

156
00:09:12,829 --> 00:09:14,749
It's either white, gray, or black.

157
00:09:14,749 --> 00:09:17,029
I have zero desire to wear your clothes.

158
00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:18,629
Sure, then don't wear any.

159
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:20,790
Lend me some clothes.

160
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,149
Here is the detailed business plan.

161
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,630
CEO Xu, what do you think?

162
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,649
It's good.

163
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:33,250
Very good.

164
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,810
This operation plan

165
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,249
is done very well.

166
00:09:37,249 --> 00:09:38,770
Thank you, CEO Xu.

167
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:43,430
I never thought you could work things out so quickly.

168
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,690
I'm not wrong about you.

169
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:49,989
Don't worry. I will do better.

170
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,529
Oh, right.

171
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:54,930
Recently, I have some funds.

172
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:59,790
Think of a way to withdraw it through your company.

173
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,230
What's wrong?

174
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,989
Is it a big amount?

175
00:10:06,989 --> 00:10:08,390
It's not.

176
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:13,710
I'll tell you the details later.

177
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,909
Do you have any problems?

178
00:10:14,909 --> 00:10:17,829
No, I don't. Leave it to me.

179
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,830
You may go now.

180
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,390
Why are you here?

181
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:37,429
I called but you didn't answer.

182
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:38,509
So I thought I might drop by.

183
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:40,430
Are you coming in for work?

184
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:41,689
Yes.

185
00:10:41,689 --> 00:10:44,630
But I have some documents to sort out.

186
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,989
Why don't you come in?

187
00:10:45,989 --> 00:10:47,290
Okay.

188
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,749
Good morning, Jiang Xiaoning.

189
00:10:55,749 --> 00:10:58,889
Director Xu, I'm sorry. I didn't know you were here. I saw nothing.

190
00:10:58,889 --> 00:10:59,869
It's fine.

191
00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:03,309
You came at the right time. Ask Yan Yan out for me again.

192
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,869
Director Xu, please don't make things difficult for me.

193
00:11:06,869 --> 00:11:09,930
Sister Yan Yan almost had me killed the last time.

194
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,929
What's with that death stare?

195
00:11:14,929 --> 00:11:17,030
She's my assistant.

196
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,669
Look at you being protective of her.

197
00:11:19,669 --> 00:11:21,669
Fine. You don't have to help me.

198
00:11:21,669 --> 00:11:25,129
I have my dignity. I'll think of a way myself.

199
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:35,469
I'll give you two some time alone. Bye.

200
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,669
Oh, right. My notebook. I think I left it here.

201
00:11:44,669 --> 00:11:46,180
Did you see it?

202
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,210
He just took it.

203
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,510
Don't worry.

204
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,890
He'll return it to you.

205
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:58,400
   

206
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,369
No, what brings you here?

207
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,369
 Did something happen to Xiao Xu? 

208
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:12,809
 No, Xiao Xu is fine. Don't worry. 

209
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,670
That's a relief.

210
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:18,670
 I was wondering why you came all of a sudden. 

211
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:22,670
 You will be released after a few days. 

212
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:25,389
 I might get too busy with work to come and pick you up. 

213
00:12:25,389 --> 00:12:29,490
 I had some free time today so I came to visit. 

214
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,430
 Thank you. 

215
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,030
Anyway...

216
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:37,870
Earlier on, Xiao Xu came to see me.

217
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:41,310
 He told me that you have been good to him. 

218
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:45,150
And that you trust him a lot by entrusting him with the company.

219
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,210
He should be visiting you.

220
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:50,089
I told him. No matter what,

221
00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:52,810
you're still his father.

222
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:55,610
 Thank you. 

223
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:59,390
 All these years, I'm glad I have you. 

224
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:04,610
Lao Tang, you're sounding like a stranger now

225
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:06,449
 We are friends. 

226
00:13:06,449 --> 00:13:08,310
 We are like brothers. 

227
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:10,550
What I promised you,

228
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,410
I will see it through.

229
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:15,250
 I really do see Xiao Xu 

230
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,930
 as my own son. 

231
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:24,129
Nice earrings. It's matching my outfit today.

232
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:30,030
Qi Hong. Director Su.

233
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,630
Where is Jiang Xiaoning?

234
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:33,590
I think she went out.

235
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,489
- You think? 
 - Yes.

236
00:13:35,489 --> 00:13:37,429
Wang Kai informed me a few days ago

237
00:13:37,429 --> 00:13:41,389
that Jiang Xiaoning's working hours and work tasks will be arranged by Director Gu.

238
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:43,570
So she doesn't need to punch in.

239
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,550
Okay. Carry on with your work.

240
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,830
 That was scary. 

241
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:02,669
- Boss, do you need my help? 
 - No.

242
00:14:02,669 --> 00:14:04,509
I'll wait for you then.

243
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:06,050
Okay.

244
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,310
What are you reading?

245
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:28,489
I'm doing my revision. I'm about to sit for my final examinations.

246
00:14:28,489 --> 00:14:31,030
If I don't, I might not be able to graduate.

247
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:36,870
Boss, could I ask you some questions when you are free?

248
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,770
Come here.

249
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,890
I don't really understand this.

250
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:50,969
There are many elements that cannot be altered in architecture.

251
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:53,690
For instance, the shape factor of a building

252
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:57,010
should be lesser than or equal to 0.4.

253
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,610
I'll show you.

254
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,590
Look.

255
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,309
This part here plays a key role.

256
00:15:26,309 --> 00:15:29,670
If you don't do it well, it will affect...

257
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,270
Affect what?

258
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:52,249
Boss, you talked a lot.

259
00:15:52,249 --> 00:15:56,219
You must be thirsty. I'll get you some water.

260
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:01,669
â™«  And the corner of your mouth is lifting  â™«

261
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:04,989
â™«  Heart pounding involuntarily, this phenomenon  â™«

262
00:16:04,989 --> 00:16:10,089
â™«  Am I abnormal or are you shining  â™«

263
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:13,889
 What is going on? My cheeks are burning. 

264
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,250
 This is bad. 

265
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:19,109
 Have I really caught feelings for my boss? 

266
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,810
 Why would this happen? 

267
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:26,789
 There must be something wrong with the mechanical heart. 

268
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,629
- Boss, have some water. 
 - It's fine. I'm not thirsty.

269
00:16:32,629 --> 00:16:35,809
I'm sorry, Boss. For wasting your time.

270
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:39,029
- I'll clean up your table. 
 - It's okay. I'll do it myself.

271
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,730
It's a blackout.

272
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:58,070
Boss, it's...

273
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:00,730
It's not because of me, right?

274
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,489
It's got nothing to do with you.

275
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,729
It's just a short circuit. It has always been this way.

276
00:17:04,729 --> 00:17:06,350
It's always been this way?

277
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:09,350
But this residence seems high-end.

278
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:11,209
I wonder why.

279
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:15,689
How about this? I'll ask the management to come over and have a look.

280
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,050
   

281
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:56,171
   
   

282
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:01,130
Are they doing something intense?

283
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:03,650
I just left and they can't hold themselves back.

284
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:08,650
But will Chuan be okay?

285
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,810
I guess it's just me.

286
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:24,190
Come on in, please.

287
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:28,089
There's suddenly a blackout for no reason.

288
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:30,830
Please take a look

289
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:33,050
to find out the problem.

290
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:35,270
The electrical panel is...

291
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,489
Where did he go?

292
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,989
Do you mean the electrical panel? I know where it is.

293
00:18:38,989 --> 00:18:40,710
This unit often has blackouts.

294
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:43,090
I'll leave it to you guys. Thank you.

295
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,830
Often?

296
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:55,310
Boss.

297
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:59,630
Boss.

298
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,050
Boss.

299
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,250
Boss.

300
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,510
Boss.

301
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,750
Could it be that he got an electric shock

302
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,850
and passed out?

303
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:25,730
Boss, are you in there?

304
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,150
Boss.

305
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,590
Boss.

306
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:44,290
Boss, are you there?

307
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:07,930
It's gorgeous.

308
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,530
What is this?

309
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:46,550
Don't touch it!

310
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,890
Boss.

311
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,409
Who let you in?

312
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:55,169
I'm sorry, Boss. You didn't answer when I was calling for you.

313
00:20:55,169 --> 00:20:57,449
I was worried that something had happened so I went looking for you.

314
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:01,670
I never thought I would have discovered your secret.

315
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:10,150
Wh... What secret?

316
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:13,990
In this very room, you must have done...

317
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:16,410
live streaming sessions.

318
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,489
There's no way.

319
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:21,889
Where are the computers and video equipment?

320
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:22,969
Go out.

321
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:24,129
- Boss. 
 - Go out.

322
00:21:24,129 --> 00:21:26,050
B-Boss...

323
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:32,169
You're not allowed to enter this room without my permission next time.

324
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:35,830
And... I'm not an online streamer.

325
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:38,210
Then, what's this room for?

326
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:41,570
This room...

327
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:44,190
This room is a virtual reality gaming room.

328
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:47,889
It's like "Ready Player One." I know that.

329
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,989
Boss, you're always so stressed at work,

330
00:21:49,989 --> 00:21:52,129
it's normal to take a break occasionally.

331
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:55,690
Boss, are you afraid that someone will say you're goofing around?

332
00:21:55,690 --> 00:22:00,269
No, there's a precedent for the utilization of virtual reality in the field of architectural design.

333
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:02,769
Are you now conducting research into a spectacular design?

334
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:05,190
Something groundbreaking?

335
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,409
Impressive. But rest assured.

336
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:11,349
As your assistant, I'll surely help you to keep it from others.

337
00:22:11,349 --> 00:22:13,050
Okay?

338
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:17,109
Okay. Hurry up and head to the office now. Leave now.

339
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:22,809
You wait a second. I'll go get the car.

340
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,210
Wait.

341
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:27,169
The weather is pretty good today.

342
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:29,470
I would like to go take a walk.

343
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,150
Is it okay?

344
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,890
It's not far.

345
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,689
But I already didn't go to work in the morning,

346
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:38,769
- If I'm not going to work in the afternoon... 
 - As long as you're with me, you've already started working.

347
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:40,809
Let's go.

348
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:42,110
Okay.

349
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:52,350
Last time she told me that she was at work,

350
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:55,390
then she asked me out here to meet.

351
00:22:56,370 --> 00:23:00,710
Then her workplace is probably around here.

352
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:07,049
As long as there's perseverance filled with love,

353
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:09,130
I'm certain that I'll get to see her.

354
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:44,590
How come only one minute has passed?

355
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,710
I feel that one year has passed instead.

356
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:51,090
Love is so torturing.

357
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:04,569
Why is the wind so strong?

358
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,730
My hair is such a mess.

359
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:11,190
What's wrong, Boss?

360
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:16,550
Let's go. Go buy milk with me.

361
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,850
Okay.

362
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,050
Hello. Welcome.

363
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:31,710
   

364
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:42,370
Why are you picking so meticulously?

365
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:44,329
Many aren't able to grab the red packets for food delivery,

366
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:45,689
so they're reluctant to order in.

367
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:47,809
For me, I'll take it to another lower level.

368
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:50,470
For even an item worth 5 yuan, I also need to think it through.

369
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:53,070
Welcome to the world of the poor.

370
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:57,569
Boss, I worked at a convenience store before.

371
00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:00,689
The store manager usually places the food that's expiring soon at the front.

372
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:03,770
So you take the one placed at the back, it'll be fresher.

373
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:08,610
Even though it's expiring soon, it still needs to be bought, right?

374
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:25,169
He's apparently a warm-hearted person,

375
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:27,390
why is his face always expressionless?

376
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:36,870
And this.

377
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:44,010
Jiang Xiaoning.

378
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,209
Chen Chen.

379
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,809
Why are you here?

380
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:48,810
The store that we worked together at before shut down,

381
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:50,570
then I was transferred here.

382
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:53,430
You... How have you been?

383
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:55,409
I've got a full-time job.

384
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:56,969
I'm with an architectural design company.

385
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,409
So impressive.

386
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:00,809
Then we should grab something to eat when you're free.

387
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:02,769
Okay. Let's talk about it when I'm on my rest day.

388
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,070
Okay.

389
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:06,010
Wait.

390
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:08,330
These two are for you.

391
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:09,969
Thank you.

392
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:11,249
Then I'll leave first.

393
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:13,249
- Bye-bye. 
 - Bye-bye.

394
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,590
Remember we're going to eat together.

395
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:20,610
Okay.

396
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:22,009
Is he someone you know?

397
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,690
We were in the same major in university.

398
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,449
The same major.

399
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,049
The most handsome guy in our university.

400
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:29,729
Lots of girls want to take pictures with him just to post them on Weibo

401
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,830
and Moments to show off.

402
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:35,010
Him?

403
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:37,870
Let's go, Boss.

404
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:43,749
- Let's take one more. 
 - Come.

405
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,930
Is it that this dimwit is waiting for me?

406
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:20,849
   

407
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:23,470
    
 Boss,  give me a second.

408
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:32,649
 The most handsome guy in our university. 

409
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,190
 Lots of girls want to take pictures with him 

410
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:37,330
 just to post them on Weibo   and Moments to show off. 

411
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:46,129
Boss, you should try the cherry and berry drink of Meco's.

412
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:48,270
It tastes really good.

413
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:51,570
I've never drunk this kind of drink which has no nutrition at all.

414
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:54,369
This fruit tea contains real tea and fruit juice.

415
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:56,169
Fruit juice can provide us with vitamins

416
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:57,489
and tea can help us to lose weight.

417
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:59,130
Just give it a try.

418
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:00,929
Only girls drink it.

419
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,870
I only drink milk and water.

420
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:06,169
Boss, a tasty drink will cheer you up.

421
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:09,489
Maybe this tastes better than milk and water?

422
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:10,569
Just give it a try.

423
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:13,689
We came all the way here just for it, right?

424
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:14,990
Just a sip.

425
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,969
- Well, this drink... 
 - Try it.

426
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:25,710
How is it?

427
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:30,110
It's so-so.

428
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:32,069
Is it? Then give it back.

429
00:28:32,069 --> 00:28:33,410
Give it back if you don't want to drink.

430
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:36,650
You... You said it's not good...

431
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:38,689
Boss, do you feel better after drinking it?

432
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:40,270
Stop talking.

433
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:42,010
 Doesn't it taste good? 

434
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:01,690
    
 Yan Yan!

435
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:04,370
- It's such a coincidence. 
 - It's such a coincidence.

436
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:05,930
Are you waiting for me?

437
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:08,629
I happened to pass by. Bump into you.

438
00:29:08,629 --> 00:29:09,850
Bye.

439
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:11,950
Don't leave in a hurry.

440
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,209
I was in the wrong last time.

441
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,209
I shouldn't ask Jiang Xiaoning to deceive you and ask you out.

442
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:17,529
I promise I won't dare to do so anymore.

443
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:19,930
I won't lie to you anymore.

444
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:22,570
Did you tell a lie today?

445
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:24,590
I didn't.

446
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:26,569
Your nose is getting longer.

447
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:28,931
I saw that you have been sitting here the whole day.

448
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,210
Wait.

449
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:35,009
You have been looking at me the whole day?

450
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:36,449
It's really touching.

451
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:39,950
Yan Yan, I know that you have feelings for me.

452
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:46,049
I've never met someone who is so thick-skinned.

453
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:48,209
Let me tell you. I have no time to spout nonsense with you.

454
00:29:48,209 --> 00:29:49,810
Leave me alone.

455
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,490
Don't follow me.

456
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,970
Women like speaking with a forked tongue.

457
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:56,489
When you asked me to leave you alone, you were hoping that I could tag along instead.

458
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:58,730
Okay. Then you must follow closely.

459
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:04,889
Didn't you say that women like speaking with a forked tongue?

460
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:07,489
You already ordered me to follow you, I wouldn't dare to defy

461
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:08,849
the order of the queen.

462
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:11,890
Otherwise, I would be tortured.

463
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:15,770
Okay. I think you truly wish to be tortured.

464
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:17,170
Let's go.

465
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,030
For the three-dimensional rendering

466
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:29,110
of the art gallery's design proposal, it's basically the situation.

467
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:31,230
Mr. Gu, if there's no issue with the blueprint,

468
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:33,130
I'll submit the proposal.

469
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:36,769
Tomorrow is the day for the submission of proposals. We need to make haste.

470
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:40,590
Director Gu.

471
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,849
Then we'll submit this proposal.

472
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:45,250
That's it?

473
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,050
Okay.

474
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,310
   

475
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:56,950
Are you all right?

476
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,590
I...

477
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:00,209
You must be kidding.

478
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:01,750
I'm completely fine.

479
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:02,969
Go and take your bath quickly.

480
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:04,950
You still need to go home.

481
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,270
How about you?

482
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:09,030
Me?

483
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:11,009
I... I think the environment here is pretty good.

484
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:12,810
I'll go and get a membership card done later.

485
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:16,850
Go ahead.

486
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:21,070
- After you. 
 - After you.

487
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,570
I insist.

488
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:25,510
Okay.

489
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,110
Keep it up.

490
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:38,369
Be persistent. Be persistent.

491
00:32:38,369 --> 00:32:39,550
Be persistent.

492
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:43,289
Be persistent. Be persistent.

493
00:32:57,690 --> 00:32:59,509
 Is my aesthetic outdated? 

494
00:32:59,509 --> 00:33:01,890
 How is this guy handsome? 

495
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,790
What happened to you?

496
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:24,710
What's wrong? Is it weird?

497
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:27,170
Why don't you stand up?

498
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:29,129
I'm tired of walking for 30 years.

499
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:30,649
Crawling once in a while gives me a feeling of nostalgia.

500
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:32,270
What's wrong?

501
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:35,850
Where did you go?

502
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:40,410
If I'm to say I came back from the gym, would you believe it?

503
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:44,290
If you said you went with Zhao Yan, I would believe that.

504
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:49,490
Chuan, you're truly the one who knows me well.

505
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:57,670
Seriously?

506
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,289
You really can't stand up?

507
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:01,090
I can.

508
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:03,489
Let me see if you can stand up now.

509
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:04,990
Come.

510
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:09,370
You've got no conscience at all.

511
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:16,490
That was fast.

512
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:24,470
Why did you go to the gym out of the blue?

513
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:27,688
There are too many young handsome guys at the gym.

514
00:34:27,689 --> 00:34:30,990
I'm worried about Yan Yan being alone.

515
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:39,670
Let me ask you something.

516
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:44,850
Do you think this look of mine now is what young people like?

517
00:34:46,769 --> 00:34:49,009
I always like it anyway.

518
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:51,649
As for whether young people will like it, I have no idea then.

519
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:53,248
After all, I'm also an old man.

520
00:34:53,249 --> 00:34:54,969
Moreover, I truly can't get hold

521
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:56,930
of the aesthetic of the youngsters nowadays.

522
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:00,129
Why did you ask me this question all of a sudden?

523
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:03,250
Could it be that someone said you're not good-looking?

524
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,329
How could that be possible?

525
00:35:04,329 --> 00:35:06,510
Nobody dares to say so.

526
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:10,770
I just wanted to know your thoughts.

527
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:14,249
Chuan, don't worry.

528
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:15,609
You're still my true love.

529
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:17,329
I just keep Yan Yan company occasionally.

530
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:18,389
Don't be jealous.

531
00:35:18,389 --> 00:35:20,370
All right. All right.

532
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:25,730
Let me show you a photo.

533
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:32,650
Do you think...

534
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:35,129
Do you think this guy looks handsome?

535
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:36,089
Is he handsome?

536
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:37,809
Who is the girl beside him?

537
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:40,030
I'm asking you if this guy is handsome.

538
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:42,270
Pretty handsome. Who is he?

539
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:43,689
What if he's compared with me?

540
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:45,770
Then you still look better.

541
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:48,209
Faithful buddy.

542
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:49,689
You're indeed my faithful buddy.

543
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:51,770
Be gentle. Gentle.

544
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:53,370
But if you're compared with him,

545
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:57,870
your handsomeness seems to be a bit outdated.

546
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:00,970
Outdated?

547
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:02,870
Where are you going, Chuan?

548
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:04,649
Don't you leave. Carry me back to your room.

549
00:36:04,649 --> 00:36:06,129
I really can't crawl back to my house.

550
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,110
You're staying the night here again?

551
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:10,010
Chuan.

552
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:11,769
Chuan.

553
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:12,889
Okay. Then you lie here.

554
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:14,910
It's quite suitable for you.

555
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:18,229
Chuan, don't be so unfeeling. Okay?

556
00:36:18,229 --> 00:36:19,770
You're handsome, okay?

557
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:22,410
You're not outdated, I am.

558
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:24,410
Chuan.

559
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:12,789
Boss, good morning.

560
00:37:12,789 --> 00:37:14,390
Good morning.

561
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:22,130
What's wrong, Boss?

562
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:26,650
What is this?

563
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:27,769
It's a hairpin.

564
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:30,510
There's a hairpin in your pocket.

565
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,649
Maybe they gave it to me as a gift when I bought milk yesterday.

566
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:36,870
Buy milk and get a free hairpin?

567
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:37,929
Right?

568
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:40,110
How could a hairpin be given with milk?

569
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:42,450
Come. I'll give it to you then.

570
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:56,210
Buy milk and get a free hairpin?

571
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:09,289
It looks pretty good on me.

572
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:11,130
Thank you, Boss.

573
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:27,769
Hello, Ms. Cheng. Is there anything?

574
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:31,490
 I just want to know if you can solve my problem. 

575
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:36,009
I've discussed this with other designers in a meeting.

576
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:39,810
The wall in front of your art gallery is truly a conundrum.

577
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:41,489
If it's not demolished,

578
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:44,190
it'll affect the aesthetic appeal of the entire design.

579
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:47,369
Chuan Design is considered a top-notch studio in the industry.

580
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:50,430
And you can't even get the overhaul of an art gallery done well?

581
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:52,489
 We set high standards on design. 

582
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:54,389
We don't want to change the proposal easily.

583
00:38:54,389 --> 00:38:56,709
In fact, Ms. Cheng, we're being responsible for you.

584
00:38:56,709 --> 00:39:00,150
We don't wish to show you an unsatisfactory design.

585
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:04,530
Your biggest responsibility towards me is to keep this wall for me.

586
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,780
Our company has changed a few designers along the way.

587
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,680
We've also submitted more than ten proposals.

588
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,440
The problem is attributed to the wall.

589
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,079
Just be honest with me.

590
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,140
Is it that you can't handle that?

591
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,159
 That's not the case. 

592
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:24,480
 - We just hope that you...  
 - I don't want to listen to this.

593
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,359
Chuan Design is so well-known.

594
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,299
My only requirement is to keep this wall.

595
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:31,039
 You can't even complete the design of an art gallery. 

596
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,639
 How disappointing it is! 

597
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,879
Ms. Cheng, don't be anxious.

598
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,840
Let's think it through again, okay?

599
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,700
I'll wait for your call then.

600
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,800
 In fact, what I want to say is that now he has finally 

601
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,820
 found a girl he likes. 

602
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,399
 A girl he likes? 

603
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,160
 Yes. 

604
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,600
 He even told us that the girl is his assistant. 

605
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,919
 In fact, he's my son. 

606
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,679
 I know him better than anyone. 

607
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,679
 He himself might not even know he's deeply in love with that girl. 

608
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:56,280
 Is she called Jiang Xiaoning? 

609
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,100
Sister Manlin.

610
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,919
Is this a newly bought hairpin?

611
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,919
It's a gift with the purchase of milk.

612
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,040
It looks pretty good on you.

613
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,839
There's a project for you to handle.

614
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,079
Me?

615
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,479
You're not confident? Then forget about it.

616
00:41:14,479 --> 00:41:16,399
No. I'm willing to accept it.

617
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,840
It's just that... I'm not sure if I can do it well.

618
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,780
But I'll try my utmost.

619
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,519
I can see that you're pretty hardworking.

620
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,199
You've always wanted to try your hand at architectural design.

621
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,159
I'm giving you a chance this time for you to get training.

622
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,560
It lies in your hands whether you can do it well.

623
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,279
What's the project about?

624
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,680
It's very simple. This is the design project for an art gallery.

625
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,799
There is an old wall there and the client doesn't want it to be demolished.

626
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,400
But if it's not demolished, our design won't be presented perfectly.

627
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:48,259
You go and convince her to demolish the wall.

628
00:41:48,259 --> 00:41:49,439
For the rest of the matters, do keep your wits about you.

629
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,240
You need to play it by ear.

630
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,600
Okay. Thank you, Sister Manlin.

631
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,100
You can do it.

632
00:41:56,020 --> 00:42:06,030
