♫  I can't help but feel a little happy  ♫

00:00:18,749 --> 00:00:23,679
♫  I can't help but feel a little nervous  ♫

♫  The earth is turning because of you  ♫

♫  Without you, the earth stops  ♫

♫  You are the rainbow that fills up the black and white  ♫

00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,699
♫  I was once obsessed with the legend of the four-leaf clover  ♫

8
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:44,609
♫  I dreamed of a white-horse carriage and

21
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,150
   

22
00:02:08,859 --> 00:02:11,580
Oh no. How did I fall asleep at my boss's place?

23
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:44,259
Director Xu, you're up early.

24
00:02:44,259 --> 00:02:46,480
- Have a seat. 
 - Why not sleep in?

25
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,020
I'd love to, but I can't fall asleep.

26
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm too used to working.

27
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,180
Where's your brother?

28
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,079
He... I don't know.

29
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,679
I haven't seen him lately.

30
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,660
He must be occupied.

31
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,160
By the way,

32
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,560
your dad will be released soon.

33
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,080
I'm talking about Tang Zhengcheng.

34
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,859
Yes. I heard.

35
00:03:15,859 --> 00:03:17,980
It's been a long time since we last talked.

36
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,160
That's not good.

37
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,060
After all, he's your father.

38
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,460
You ought to do what a son should do.

39
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:34,560
He's my biological father, so by right, I should visit him.

40
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,579
But he's also the one who destroyed my life.

41
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:39,900
I know how you feel.

42
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,240
I watched you grow up and be more and more mature all these years.

43
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,620
I know you're not someone cold-blooded.

44
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,680
Your moral standard

45
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,940
and competence are commendable.

46
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,520
And deep down,

47
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,400
I regard you as my son.

48
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,660
Thanks, Director Xu.

49
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,320
I will deal with the matter properly.

50
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,780
Good.

51
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,640
Also, have you heard of Hua Zhou Corporation?

52
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,139
A subsidiary of mine.

53
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:21,058
It's not a big corporation

54
00:04:21,058 --> 00:04:25,980
but if you're willing to put in some effort, it will show potential.

55
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:30,579
In fact, I sincerely hope that you can prove yourself

56
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:32,959
in front of the directors as soon as possible.

57
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,880
So from now onward,

58
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,840
I'll let you handle this company.

59
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,820
Show me what you can do

60
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,239
and do it well.

61
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,380
Okay.

62
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,680
I will do my best.

63
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,600
Don't let me down, okay?

64
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,380
Okay. Don't worry.

65
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,960
Let's eat.

66
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,340
 Thank you for letting me stay over. 

67
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,920
 I fell asleep accidentally yesterday. 

68
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,620
 Rest well. See you! 

69
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,500
Morning, my Chuan.

70
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,800
Breakfast time!

71
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,600
I've been starving.

72
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,520
What happened to your hand? Show me.

73
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,299
It's nothing. I just took a tumble.

74
00:06:07,299 --> 00:06:11,400
Jiang Xiaoning! Is not that you don't know, you are insensitive to pain.

75
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,520
If you're injured, you know, you might die!

76
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,679
I know, my dearest auntie.

77
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,880
Time to have breakfast.

78
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,800
Did your grandma do anything stupid lately?

79
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,020
No, she hasn't.

80
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:26,240
She keeps praising my culinary skill.

81
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,520
So you want to take my place?

82
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,500
Hell no. Just you wait until I'm fully recovered, then we'll have a cook-off.

83
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,340
I will defeat you in seconds.

84
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,280
Yes, Boss?

85
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,420
 It's me, Xu Chengran. 

86
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,839
Morning, Director Xu.

87
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,939
I told Gu Chuan that I wanted to have hotpot at his place this afternoon.

88
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:50,560
Can you bring some ingredients here?

89
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,160
Will do.

90
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,480
You came early today.

91
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,879
It's time for your medication.

92
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,919
Sister Nurse, I have to go to work soon.

93
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,599
Can you look after my auntie?

94
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,900
No worries. Go do your stuff.

95
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,640
- Leave it to me. 
 - Okay.

96
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,220
I'll go now.

97
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,320
Will you be here tonight?

98
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,240
I will. Of course.

99
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,680
Her arm is injured and yet you're ordering her around.

100
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,620
Feeling protective?

101
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:21,120
Seems like Jiang Xiaoning is someone special.

102
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,380
I don't know what you're talking about.

103
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,479
Why are you here this early in the morning?

104
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:26,839
Well, I care a lot about you.

105
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,560
So I came to visit you after I got out of bed.

106
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,920
Who would have thought that I'd arrive at a crime scene?

107
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,660
What crime scene?

108
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:39,760
A girl, staying overnight at your place,

109
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,099
even wearing your clothes.

110
00:07:42,099 --> 00:07:43,859
I never got such treatment from you.

111
00:07:43,859 --> 00:07:47,260
It's good. It means you've grown up, Chuan.

112
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,060
You know about my situation.

113
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,420
Nothing good comes from it.

114
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:56,179
Having emotions is good and I know someone like Jiang Xiaoning

115
00:07:56,179 --> 00:07:57,960
is not your type.

116
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,900
And your point is?

117
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,240
So...

118
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,240
I don't care if you're just being sympathetic or whatever,

119
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,860
mingling with humans, showing emotions, they do you good.

120
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,759
After all, you can't be as cold-blooded as your lizard pet, right?

121
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,660
That's not cute.

122
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,840
 Xiao Xu, 

123
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,519
 it's been a long time. 

124
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,239
 How are you? Good? 

125
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,980
 Not bad. 

126
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,960
 Just very busy. 

127
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,700
 That's good then. 

128
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:07,560
 By the way, I will be released soon. 

129
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,580
 When I'm out, we will be reunited. 

130
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,320
Also, is Uncle Xu treating you well?

131
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,040
 He's very kind. 

132
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,180
 He treats me as if I'm his son. 

133
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:33,040
He can entrust everything to me, including his company.

134
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,600
That's great.

135
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,300
 However, you should judge what's right or wrong yourself. 

136
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,260
Okay?

137
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:48,700
Don't just believe what he says blindly.

138
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,630
Don't be blinded

139
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:53,230
 by money. Okay? 

140
00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:56,060
 He didn't buy me with money. 

141
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,660
 He cares about me. 

142
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,059
 He keeps me company. 

143
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:02,080
I chose to believe and accept him with all my heart

144
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,700
 because at least, he's not a criminal. 

145
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,880
He didn't kill my mom.

146
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,800
He didn't destroy my life.

147
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,860
 I need to leave now. 

148
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,920
 Take care. 

149
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,400
Coming!

150
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,159
Hi, Director Xu.

151
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,959
Not bad, Jiang Xiaoning. You're good at shopping.

152
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,440
Thanks, Director Xu. I'll take my leave now.

153
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,119
Come back here.

154
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,820
Anything else?

155
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,080
Director Gu said that we should eat together.

156
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,079
No need to gawk.

157
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,199
Close the door. Change your shoes.

158
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,600
Come in.

159
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,859
Seems like you've fully recovered. You look spirited today.

160
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,200
Well, I can't feel pain.

161
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,379
Are you Deadpool then? Super regeneration, insensitivity to pain.

162
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:23,799
Something like that.

163
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,860
By the way, where's Director Gu?

164
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,660
Drawing upstairs.

165
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,670
As you know, a designer doesn't deserve any break, friendship, and relationship.

166
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:35,290
When you become a designer in the future, you'll start losing hair, too.

167
00:11:35,299 --> 00:11:37,600
Seriously?

168
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,159
Now that you're here, let me give you one task.

169
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,340
From now onward, spend as much time as possible with Gu Chuan.

170
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:49,279
You're his assistant, after all, so keep an eye on him for me.

171
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,159
Twenty-four-hour surveillance.

172
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,359
It would be better if you can live here.

173
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,720
Report to me whenever something happens.

174
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,540
But why?

175
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,059
It's as if we're spying on Mr. Gu.

176
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:00,839
He's not a 3-year-old kid.

177
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,639
He's worse than a 3-year-old kid, okay?

178
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,079
His destructive power...

179
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,759
Is Director Gu that childish?

180
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,800
When he gets agitated, he might...

181
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:15,759
Just imagine, a workaholic designer, when he goes nuts,

182
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,340
it'll be very scary.

183
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,340
How scary?

184
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,519
You cannot understand anyway.

185
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,619
Just do what I asked you to.

186
00:12:22,619 --> 00:12:24,359
Keep an eye on Gu Chuan.

187
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,000
I will not allow him to do anything that betrays me.

188
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,659
Don't worry.

189
00:12:29,659 --> 00:12:32,100
If you do it well, I'll give you a raise.

190
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,100
Okay. What should I do first?

191
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,320
First...

192
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,800
Add me on WeChat.

193
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,919
Done.

194
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,799
Secondly, prepare the hotpot. I'm hungry.

195
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,299
What about Director Gu?

196
00:12:50,299 --> 00:12:52,700
I don't care. I'm hungry.

197
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,880
All right, Director Xu.

198
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,179
Director Xu, it doesn't seem like we have the pot for hotpot.

199
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:05,440
No pot?

200
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,759
I'll go buy it then.

201
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,320
I need to take care of something too before I come back.

202
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,220
Okay.

203
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,160
Keep an eye on Gu Chuan.

204
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,540
Yes, Director Xu.

205
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,479
Hi, Boss.

206
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,640
Director Xu just left.

207
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,519
Have you had lunch?

208
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,660
Not yet.

209
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,940
Director Xu asked me to buy the ingredients for the hotpot.

210
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,580
He likes hotpot but I don't like the smell of it

211
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:44,179
and I don't have the things you need for hotpot here.

212
00:13:44,179 --> 00:13:47,119
Well, Director Xu said that he'd buy it.

213
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,439
He'll come back after he's done with his business.

214
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,660
It's fine. He won't die from starvation.

215
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,699
By the way, are you feeling better now?

216
00:13:54,699 --> 00:13:56,760
You weren't feeling well yesterday.

217
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,880
I'm fine now.

218
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,679
Boss, since you're not fully recovered yet, if you don't mind,

219
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,880
I can cook something for you.

220
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,199
You know how to cook?

221
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:10,880
Of course. I'm a good cook.

222
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,319
So organized.

223
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,680
Do you have OCD?

224
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,199
Nothing. Just rest, Boss.

225
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,900
I'll manage.

226
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,940
 Mingling with humans, showing emotions, they do you good. 

227
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:20,060
 After all, you can't be as cold-blooded as your lizard pet, right? 

228
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,080
 That's not cute. 

229
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,179
 You asked my assistant to cook. 

230
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,920
 Where are you then? 

231
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,079
 I wouldn't want to be the third wheel. 

232
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,000
 I'll come back later. 

233
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,719
 Are you that bored? 

234
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,840
 Don't ever come back then. 

235
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,399
 Sure. 

236
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,960
 Have fun. Don't fight. 

237
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,800
   

238
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,160
God is helping me this time.

239
00:16:41,859 --> 00:16:44,560
- Manager Wei. 
 - Come in.

240
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,040
Can you sign this leave notice for me?

241
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,300
What for?

242
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,120
Personal matter. But I'll return real quick.

243
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,299
Zhao Yan.

244
00:16:56,299 --> 00:17:00,420
You want to leave during office hours for a personal matter.

245
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,020
I have to refuse.

246
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:05,519
Manager Wei, it's something urgent.

247
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:08,240
I can say yes to your request now,

248
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,060
but why do you always say no whenever I invite you to a gathering?

249
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,498
I'm sorry, Manager Wei.

250
00:17:15,498 --> 00:17:18,280
I'll come to the department dinner next time.

251
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,219
Willing to change is a good thing.

252
00:17:22,219 --> 00:17:23,299
That's right.

253
00:17:23,299 --> 00:17:24,859
We should spend more time together.

254
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:27,060
The more, the merrier.

255
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,360
Thanks, Manager Wei.

256
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,400
Boss, can you come here?

257
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,839
What's up?

258
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,120
Over here, this side.

259
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,300
Can you help me, Boss?

260
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,080
Help me to...

261
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,080
I just want you to take the dishes out.

262
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,020
I'm going to call Xu Chengran and tell him that dinner's ready.

263
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,620
 How did that happen? 

264
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,840
 It shouldn't happen. 

265
00:19:04,479 --> 00:19:07,140
Boss, dinner's ready.

266
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,340
Boss,

267
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,599
you have a particular taste.

268
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,639
When it comes to pets, others prefer cats or dogs.

269
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,640
Why do you keep a pet lizard then?

270
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,600
Lizard is low maintenance.

271
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,880
A dog will wait for you by the door every day.

272
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,300
A cat requires high maintenance.

273
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,360
But a lizard...

274
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,200
Even though we share the same living space,

275
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,260
but we don't bother each other.

276
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,280
Yes, what you say is reasonable.

277
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,579
This one, where?

278
00:19:42,579 --> 00:19:44,280
This one...

279
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,019
Excuse me, Miss, do you have time?

280
00:19:49,019 --> 00:19:49,919
Sorry, busy.

281
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,079
It's a paid survey.

282
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:54,600
If you take it, you'll get a red envelope as a token of appreciation.

283
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,820
I just transferred 1,000 RMB to you.

284
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,360
    
 What kind of survey is this?

285
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,600
It's about females' opinions regarding certain problems.

286
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,320
Are you single?

287
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,299
Yes.

288
00:20:19,299 --> 00:20:22,020
Are you looking for anything particular in your spouse?

289
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,639
I'm not seeing anyone at the moment.

290
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,780
I keep my options open and I'll see.

291
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:32,020
Any criteria are you looking for in your future spouse?

292
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,739
Male. Responsible.

293
00:20:34,739 --> 00:20:36,600
Emotionally stable.

294
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,660
I don't care about income.

295
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,740
Respect women.

296
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,479
What about height, weight, age, and appearance?

297
00:20:42,479 --> 00:20:44,260
What about these?

298
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,279
Decent-looking at least.

299
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:47,479
Can't be fat.

300
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,460
Athletic. Not small.

301
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,500
Small?

302
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,000
I'm talking about age.

303
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,279
Anything else?

304
00:20:56,279 --> 00:20:58,099
What would make you fall in love with someone?

305
00:20:58,099 --> 00:21:00,279
Isn't this the same question?

306
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,500
Are your questions going to be repetitive?

307
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,920
Sorry. The survey is over.

308
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,500
Thank you. Have a nice day.

309
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,681
Show me the receipt number.

310
00:21:07,681 --> 00:21:10,120
I thought you were some sort of con artist.

311
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,959
No need for that. Thanks a lot.

312
00:21:11,959 --> 00:21:13,319
I actually earned some money.

313
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,820
See you!

314
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,960
 Hey, Handsome, I'd like to take the survey, too. 

315
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,660
Sorry, it's over.

316
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,639
It's over.

317
00:21:19,639 --> 00:21:21,020
- My shift is over. 
 - Hey Handsome!

318
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,200
Weird.

319
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,700
Yan Yan.

320
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,079
- Sorry, I'm late. 
 - It's fine.

321
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:41,400
Your drinks, sir.

322
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,640
Enjoy.

323
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,360
I don't know what you like so I ordered everything.

324
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:52,280
What a corny gesture that only worked ten years ago.

325
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,100
I'm on my period so I prefer warm water.

326
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,999
Boss. Careful. It's hot.

327
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,960
Do you like it?

328
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,539
- Not bad. 
 - That's a relief.

329
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,420
You should eat some, too.

330
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,080
Shouldn't we wait for Director Xu?

331
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,880
No need to wait for him.

332
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:59,680
 Xiao Chuan, are you home? 

333
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:10,820
The past few days feel like a dream.

334
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,519
Why do you dream so often?

335
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:16,119
How do you know? I dream every night.

336
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:24,280
I mean I'm really grateful that you protected me that day.

337
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,480
I don't usually have good luck,

338
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,540
but whenever I'm in danger, someone's there to help me.

339
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:34,620
When I was younger, I was in a worse situation than that day.

340
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,380
But back then, an older brother helped me.

341
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,360
However...

342
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,540
However, what?

343
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:50,780
It was dark back then so I couldn't see his face properly.

344
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:55,580
It happened years ago so my memory of it is getting blurry, too.

345
00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:00,400
I don't know if he's still here.

346
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:07,220
Let's eat, Boss.

347
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,900
So I'm here to tell you that

348
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,800
I'm sorry for what happened last time.

349
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:27,020
I've never seen someone who apologizes in such an arrogant way.

350
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,600
You can see it now.

351
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,350
Yes. How lovely!

352
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:35,279
So, this is the reason you asked for a hang out with me

353
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,600
and listen to your nonsense.

354
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,979
Jiang Xiaoning is your friend, isn't she? Do you know where she is now?

355
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:44,119
Did you follow me? Let me tell you.

356
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:48,179
You can't touch me and also my friend.

357
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:49,759
If you dare to seek attention from Jiang Xiaoning...

358
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,219
- Don't blame me if I... 
 - No, I don't... Hold on, please.

359
00:24:51,219 --> 00:24:54,539
You misunderstood me. I've just realized that.

360
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,399
I added her WeChat.

361
00:24:57,399 --> 00:25:01,659
It's such a coincidence! She's working at the company where I invest.

362
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,020
- You are her boss? 
 - Yeah.

363
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,400
You are her boss?

364
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,560
Yes, I am.

365
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,699
This is obviously showing the differences between a buyer's show and a seller's show.

366
00:25:14,699 --> 00:25:20,000
Xiaoning described you to me as "steady, handsome, and not talkative."

367
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,300
I think I should bring her to check her brain or maybe her eyes first.

368
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,940
What she described to you should be another person.

369
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,299
An unimportant boss. All these are not important.

370
00:25:28,299 --> 00:25:31,879
The important point is that I've just come across her posts in Moments. And, you're here.

371
00:25:31,879 --> 00:25:34,860
Are we destined to meet each other?

372
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,719
I'm done with my apologies. I'm leaving now.

373
00:25:36,719 --> 00:25:39,321
I will take good care of Jiang Xiaoning in the company.

374
00:25:39,321 --> 00:25:40,800
So?

375
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,780
So, can you have a date with me?

376
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:47,579
Is it so difficult to secure a job now? I even have to make an appointment for my best friend.

377
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:51,419
- I just want to get to know more about you to see if it's possible for both of us... 
 - No.

378
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:59,359
You didn't even give me a chance to start and you announced it's ended. That's quite hurtful.

379
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,240
What do you like about me?

380
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:09,700
I think that your shoulder throw is too amazing and charming.

381
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,039
I think so.

382
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:15,280
And also this smug face is really attractive to me.

383
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,520
Were you born with a silver spoon?

384
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,740
Kind of.

385
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,439
That's a pity.

386
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,739
I have no other talents.

387
00:26:27,739 --> 00:26:30,880
But I know my own background really well.

388
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:35,579
I'm not suitable to marry into a rich family. And I don't want to be placed on a balance to be compared.

389
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:38,059
So... In short,

390
00:26:38,059 --> 00:26:40,260
I'm allergic to a silver spoon.

391
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,080
Oh, right.

392
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,439
Especially someone like you. Bumming around all day.

393
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:48,720
A silver spoon who lives like a bird.

394
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,759
She got it all!

395
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:55,120
She can see through me at a glance.

396
00:26:56,020 --> 00:27:00,700
She is adorable and charming even when she refuses me.

397
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,420
I really like her!

398
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,600
   

399
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,740
All these are not important now.

400
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,900
Go ahead.

401
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:33,979
It might be Director Xu. I'll go open the door.

402
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,840
Wait!

403
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,860
Boss.

404
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,199
It seems that he is not at home.

405
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,880
You know the password, don't you?

406
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,900
Let's go in and see.

407
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,799
What happened?

408
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,899
Boss, just now...

409
00:28:13,899 --> 00:28:15,279
Are you okay?

410
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,739
What's wrong with you? You startled me.

411
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:20,160
Did I enter the wrong house?

412
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,359
How could it be possible?

413
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,039
I saw a woman in the house.

414
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:26,780
And both of them were hugging each other.

415
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:31,199
You miss your son a lot. You haven't seen him in a few years.

416
00:28:31,199 --> 00:28:33,799
That's just a hallucination. Are you going blind?

417
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:35,999
I'm not. I saw it clearly.

418
00:28:35,999 --> 00:28:38,139
If you can see clearly, then open the door again

419
00:28:38,139 --> 00:28:41,619
and go in to have a look and you'll see clearly.

420
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,920
Son, Dad and I are coming in now.

421
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:52,299
This is the focus of the design plan. You must remember it. Okay?

422
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,719
Son.

423
00:28:55,719 --> 00:28:59,640
Dad. Mom. When did you come in?

424
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,600
We just came in.

425
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,179
See, I told you that you have blurred vision.

426
00:29:05,179 --> 00:29:07,740
You have the entry password?

427
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:10,959
- I... 
 - Your mom and I have been living for several days in the hotel.

428
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:14,199
We made calls to you. Why didn't you answer our calls?

429
00:29:14,199 --> 00:29:16,579
We can't do anything. We're here to see you.

430
00:29:16,579 --> 00:29:20,620
We have no new idea. So we made a call to Xu Chengran and he told us the password.

431
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:30,960
- Hi, Uncle and Auntie. 
 - Hi.

432
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,999
- Hi. 
 - You are...

433
00:29:32,999 --> 00:29:35,759
- I... 
 - She's my newly recruited assistant.

434
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:38,239
Did you jot down the points that I told you?

435
00:29:38,239 --> 00:29:40,899
Yes. I jotted it down. I jotted down all the points.

436
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,459
The computer is not turned on yet.

437
00:29:46,459 --> 00:29:49,120
And he is assigning tasks.

438
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,060
There is a lot of delicious food.

439
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,899
Little girl, are all these made by you?

440
00:29:53,899 --> 00:29:55,559
Yes, I made all these.

441
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,499
Uncle. Auntie. Have you had your lunch yet?

442
00:29:57,499 --> 00:30:00,019
Haven't yet. We're here to visit Xiao Chuan and have a meal together.

443
00:30:00,019 --> 00:30:01,839
It's just in time. Let's eat together.

444
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:04,659
Okay. Uncle and Auntie, have a seat.

445
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,740
Have your seat, Mom.

446
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:23,199
- Uncle. Auntie. This is your tableware. 
 - Thank you.

447
00:30:23,199 --> 00:30:25,559
- Thank you. 
 - You are welcome.

448
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:28,679
- Little girl, how old are you? 
 - Twenty-three.

449
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:30,159
You're so young.

450
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,080
How long have you been with Xiao Chuan?

451
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,839
- Mom. 
 - Auntie, I'm just an assistant to Director Gu.

452
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,179
- What's your name? 
 - Jiang Xiaoning.

453
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:45,341
It's Cong (onion) from the word onion, ginger, and garlic.

454
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,979
I mean Jiang (ginger). It's Xiao (small) from the word big and small.

455
00:30:48,979 --> 00:30:51,679
It's Ning from the word serenity. Jiang Xiaoning.

456
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,860
Jiang Xiaoning.

457
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,220
Jiang Xiaoning.

458
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:59,199
You've done your job. You can go to work now.

459
00:30:59,199 --> 00:31:01,019
Yes. I'm done with work here.

460
00:31:01,019 --> 00:31:02,919
Uncle and Auntie, I'm leaving now.

461
00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:05,439
Don't. There are many dishes here. You should join us before you go.

462
00:31:05,439 --> 00:31:09,339
- Enjoy the meal. Enjoy the meal. 
 - Just join us before you leave.

463
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,080
Xiao Chuan, you...

464
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,760
 Oh no! 

465
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:23,119
 I'm always unlucky. Would it cause the boss to be misunderstood? 

466
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,500
 It happened just by the time... 

467
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,800
 Boss. 

468
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:47,140
 This doesn't seem to be very unlucky. 

469
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,539
 Jiang Xiaoning, 

470
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:49,699
 what's wrong with you? 

471
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:50,899
 Stop thinking too much. Back to work. 

472
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,160
Come on, have some fruit.

473
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,779
This little girl is great.

474
00:32:01,779 --> 00:32:03,919
She can cook at a young age.

475
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,900
She cooks really well.

476
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,219
Xiao Chuan, is this house cleaned by her?

477
00:32:08,219 --> 00:32:10,120
How clean this is!

478
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,439
You have such a girlfriend who takes care of you by your side.

479
00:32:12,439 --> 00:32:14,980
Your father and I can rest assured.

480
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:17,880
Mom, I am telling you once again.

481
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,280
She's just my assistant, not my girlfriend.

482
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:26,800
How long will you both stay here this time?

483
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,260
Stay?

484
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:40,380
We've been here for days, living in the hotel every day.

485
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,180
That's no reason for us to stay.

486
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,160
We're heading back tomorrow.

487
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,660
Gu.

488
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,319
Son,

489
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,799
regarding the matter that I told you about last time,

490
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,980
what do you think of it?

491
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,099
If you don't have any comments, your father and I

492
00:33:05,099 --> 00:33:06,519
will stay here for a few more days

493
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:08,099
and look up some houses around here.

494
00:33:08,099 --> 00:33:10,300
What house to see?

495
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,239
Why should you ask him about that?

496
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,659
Is he paying for that?

497
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:16,180
Why do you ask him everything you want to do?

498
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:18,239
Can't you speak nicely to him?

499
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,999
Didn't I speak nicely?

500
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,919
Over the past ten years, we never dare to speak badly to him.

501
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,199
We don't dare.

502
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,499
Every word that we spoke to him was always

503
00:33:27,499 --> 00:33:28,819
after careful consideration.

504
00:33:28,819 --> 00:33:31,319
We were always afraid that our words might stimulate him.

505
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,479
What about him?

506
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,679
Everything was still fine in the past few years.

507
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,540
But ever since he started his business, our relationship with him

508
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,600
is getting more and more alienated.

509
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,919
I have no idea about it.

510
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,140
Did we do something that offended him?

511
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,800
Just stop.

512
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:51,220
I've been keeping these words in my heart for a long time.

513
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,800
I must ask him about that face to face today.

514
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,779
Xiao Chuan, I'd like to ask you a question.

515
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,280
You don't have to consider how I feel.

516
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:11,020
Why do you treat your mom so indifferently?

517
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,760
Why?

518
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,900
I am used to being alone.

519
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,480
I don't like people disturbing me.

520
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,940
I am not used to it when there are many people at home.

521
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:27,280
Please say it again.

522
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:32,460
Xiao Chuan.

523
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,940
Do you know?

524
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:40,199
You are not hurting your heart, but your mind.

525
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,919
How could I have such a son like you?

526
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,919
How can you say such words to us?

527
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:50,580
Do you know? In order to collect enough surgical expenses,

528
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:54,180
we've spent all our savings.

529
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:56,520
When you were lying on the bed in the hospital,

530
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:01,440
your mom stayed by your side all day and night without leaving you a step

531
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,880
until you recovered.

532
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:13,839
If your mom knew that she saved such a ruthless son like you,

533
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:17,180
she would rather not save you.

534
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,020
Yes.

535
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,480
You're right.

536
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,900
Everyone has sympathy.

537
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,840
But I don't.

538
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:38,760
There are reasons that have made me this way, are there not?

539
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,140
Look at me now.

540
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,639
I can't live with you now.

541
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,739
I can't get married or have children.

542
00:35:46,739 --> 00:35:49,800
I can't give you a chance to enjoy family happiness.

543
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,720
So,

544
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,640
can you assume that

545
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,280
you don't have a son?

546
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,140
Okay.

547
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,520
I agree.

548
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,000
Gu.

549
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,640
It's okay.

550
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,600
That's all right.

551
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,900
Just do it like this.

552
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,240
Jiang Xiaoning!

553
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,239
Sister Manlin.

554
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,959
Why didn't you come to work this morning?

555
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,099
The boss asked me to take leave.

556
00:37:22,099 --> 00:37:23,919
He asked me not to get back to work until he comes back.

557
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,640
Do you know his schedule?

558
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,079
He only told me that he was busy.

559
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:28,919
I'm not sure what he's busy with.

560
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,080
Boss... He...

561
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,081
 How could I have such a son like you? 

562
00:37:38,081 --> 00:37:41,200
 How can you say those words to me? 

563
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,619
 You're not hurting your heart, 

564
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:46,200
 but your mind. 

565
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,460
 Can you assume that 

566
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,960
 you don't have a son? 

567
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,480
 All right. 

568
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,240
 I agree. 

569
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:01,639
 Dad. Mom. I'm sorry. 

570
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:10,500
Why didn't you tell me earlier that such things had happened?

571
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,579
I'm sorry, Sister Manlin.

572
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:13,699
I thought that the boss would tell you.

573
00:38:13,699 --> 00:38:14,819
Where is he now?

574
00:38:14,819 --> 00:38:15,759
How is he now?

575
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,179
He looks quite good.

576
00:38:17,179 --> 00:38:18,699
I went to his home and cooked for him.

577
00:38:18,699 --> 00:38:21,580
He's eating with his dad and mom now.

578
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:23,500
- You cooked? 
 - Yeah.

579
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,940
Since he is injured, I cooked a few simple dishes for him.

580
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,700
Send me his address now. I'll pay a visit to him.

581
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,200
My dear Chuan, I'm back.

582
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,260
How obedient you are,

583
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,599
waiting for me in the living room.

584
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,619
See, I treat you really nice.

585
00:38:51,619 --> 00:38:55,200
Even I go out, I still bring you some consolation gifts.

586
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,640
Why are you ignoring me?

587
00:39:09,779 --> 00:39:12,059
Don't be aggressive. Let's have a good talk.

588
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:13,740
Do you want to stay away from me first?

589
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:16,300
Why did you tell my parents the entry password of my home?

590
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:19,259
No. I can't even tell your own parents?

591
00:39:19,259 --> 00:39:20,759
Of course, you can't.

592
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,079
You can't tell anyone without my permission.

593
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,040
I realized that you intended to remember

594
00:39:25,041 --> 00:39:26,519
the entry password of my house.

595
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,800
No.

596
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,679
Fine. I won't tell it in the future, okay?

597
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:34,000
Since I bought you so many things here, stop being angry. Okay?

598
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,820
Why do you buy so many things?

599
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:43,999
Do you want to ask me for a favor?

600
00:39:43,999 --> 00:39:46,859
What a joke. I'm not someone like that.

601
00:39:46,859 --> 00:39:49,420
I just think that I might be very busy after this,

602
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,639
that I won't have much time to accompany you.

603
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:52,500
So...

604
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,420
Who are you going to harm this time?

605
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,740
I see I'm such a kind of person in your eyes.

606
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:58,420
That's who you are.

607
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,039
I'm telling you very seriously.

608
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,340
I'm serious about that.

609
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,859
You have been saying it six hundred and thirty times this year.

610
00:40:05,859 --> 00:40:07,760
This time is different.

611
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,879
This time is kind of a destined fate.

612
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:15,079
It seems that my previous experiences are accumulated

613
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,380
just for this encounter.

614
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,480
And also, do you know that

615
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,680
she's actually Jiang Xiaoning's best friend.

616
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,620
I got it now.

617
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:30,480
You are here to beg me for asking Jiang Xiaoning to help you. Am I right?

618
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,759
Why do I have to beg you?

619
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,759
I, Xu Chengran, don't need help from others.

620
00:40:33,759 --> 00:40:35,760
You really don't need it, right?

621
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,440
All right. Then, you may go back.

622
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,540
I just came in here and you want to chase me out.

623
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,460
Let me tell you about her.

624
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:47,080
I've never seen a woman like her.

625
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,879
- Is that so? 
 - Yes.

626
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,319
Imagine that if you are with Jiang Xiaoning in the future,

627
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,799
- and I'm with Yan Yan. Four of us... 
 - Okay.

628
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,240
Stop it here. Stop!

629
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,799
I realize that you are just like Jiang Xiaoning. Daydreaming all the time.

630
00:40:57,799 --> 00:40:59,900
Go back to your home now. Don't waste my time.

631
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,700
Let me stay a while longer.

632
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:04,200
There's a guest. I'll open the door.

633
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,220
Manlin.

634
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,680
Director Gu.

635
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,039
Jiang Xiaoning has told me everything.

636
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:13,599
Why didn't you tell me?

637
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,500
How's the injury?

638
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,960
How did you find me here?

639
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,640
He's not in a good mood today.

640
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,659
Thank you for visiting me.

641
00:41:23,659 --> 00:41:26,740
But I don't want to see anyone today.

642
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,779
I just came to see if you were okay.

643
00:41:31,779 --> 00:41:33,279
I'm relieved knowing that you're okay.

644
00:41:33,279 --> 00:41:34,599
I'm leaving now.

645
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,319
If you are not feeling well, you can rest for a few days more.

646
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:41,520
I need your help with a matter tomorrow.

647
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,099
What do you want me to do?

648
00:41:43,099 --> 00:41:44,539
My parents will go home tomorrow.

649
00:41:44,539 --> 00:41:46,800
- So... 
 - Let Jiang Xiaoning do it.

650
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,360
I will do it. Don't worry.

651
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,860
Thank you.

652
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,559
- Xu Chengran, make sure you close the door. 
 - Okay.

653

♫  Destiny is a little annoying  ♫

655
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:32,870
♫  Takes those I care about  ♫

656
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:36,609
♫  Away from me  ♫

657
00:42:36,609 --> 00:42:38,530
♫  If memory is bright  ♫

658
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:41,490
♫  It would hold up a lamp in my heart  ♫

659
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:45,230
♫  And light up the night  ♫

660
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:06,549
♫  Sunshine alternates with moonlight  ♫

661
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:09,550
♫  Returning to life in time  ♫

662
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:13,010
♫  Gift me with a dream  ♫

663
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:17,590
♫  A dream with you in it  ♫

664
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:46,410
♫  The one who caught me off guard  ♫

665
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:50,750
♫  Steps foot into my life...  ♫

666
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:59,410
♫  It's you...  ♫

667
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:03,570
♫  If it weren't for parting  ♫

668
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:07,890
♫  How can we meet again?  ♫

669
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:17,440
♫  It's you...  ♫

670
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,509
♫  Exchanging sunshine for moonlight  ♫

671
00:44:19,509 --> 00:44:22,509
♫  Exchanging fortune for the past  ♫

672
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:27,190
♫  Exchanging my heartbeat for you  ♫
