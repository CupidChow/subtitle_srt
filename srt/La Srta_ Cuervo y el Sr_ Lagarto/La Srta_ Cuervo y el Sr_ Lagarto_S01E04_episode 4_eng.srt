00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,859
♫  I can't help but feel a little happy  ♫

3
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:23,459
♫  I can't help but feel a little nervous  ♫

4
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,840
♫  The earth is turning because of you  ♫

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,260
♫  Without you, the earth stops  ♫

6
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:34,340
♫  You are the rainbow that fills up the black and white  ♫

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,740
♫  I was once obsessed with the legend of the four-leaf clover  ♫

8
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:44,619
♫  I dreamed of a white-horse carriage and 
 you becoming my prince  ♫

00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:48,779
♫  Your gaze is too seducing, please save me  ♫

10
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,320
♫  I'm turning into a moth, flying towards the fire  ♫

11
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,020
♫  Your smile is dancing on your lips  ♫

12
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,680

♫  Holding your hand, let's count down to happiness  ♫

15
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,499
♫  I can't help but be a little fragile  ♫

16
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,160
♫  I can't help but feel a little gloomy  ♫

17
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,600
♫  The sky is bright because of you  ♫

18
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,819
♫  Without you, the sky is grey  ♫

19
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:33,379
♫  You are the angel who takes away all loneliness  ♫

20
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:37,060
   

21
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:41,060
   

22
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,259
- Have some water. 
 - Thank you, Brother Xu.

23
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:52,260
How is Auntie?

24
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,040
She is okay.

25
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,100
But now, I need to check on Grandma.

26
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,480
Brother Xu, thank you for helping me today.

27
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,700
Don't mention it.

28
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,140
Xiaoning, about your new job, have you encountered any difficulties?

29
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,040
I think your boss is a bit arrogant and stubborn.

30
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,279
He doesn't look easy to get along with.

31
00:02:08,279 --> 00:02:09,638
No, he is not.

32
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,160
He always looks like that.

33
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,599
But he is a kind person.

34
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,519
Honestly speaking, you rejected my help.

35
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,159
I feel a bit sad.

36
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,800
Xiaoning, he is just an outsider.

37
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,399
Thank you so much for helping me.

38
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,079
But I don't want to rely on anyone.

39
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,319
Besides, I borrow money from my company.

40
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,780
And I could still keep the job I like.

41
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,159
It turned out all right.

42
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,560
You. You're just exactly the same person you were as a child.

43
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,239
You haven't changed at all.

44
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,600
Let's go.

45
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,980
   

46
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,320
Grandma!

47
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,400
- What? 
 - What's going on?

48
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,540
Xiaoning.

49
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,679
You're here!

50
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,419
Look at the kitchen! It's ruined!

51
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,499
Grandma, are you hurt?

52
00:03:10,499 --> 00:03:11,519
She is okay.

53
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,839
I think she got shocked.

54
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,999
Blame me.

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,639
I fell asleep on the sofa.

56
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,519
Maybe I was too tired from working overtime these two days.

57
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,120
After putting Grandma to sleep, I didn't hear anything.

58
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,960
Okay. Stop. What's the use of this nonsense talk?

59
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,060
Pay for the damages.

60
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,340
This isn't the first time.

61
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,559
After paying the damages, move out immediately.

62
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,300
I'm not renting out this house.

63
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,880
Wait.

64
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,040
How much?

65
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,059
Thirty thousand. Not a penny less!

66
00:03:36,059 --> 00:03:38,699
Let me. It's due to me.

67
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:41,579
Stop it. Let me solve this.

68
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,099
I'm not moving. The lease term is not due yet.

69
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:50,400
We've signed a three-year contract. It's still a long way to go.

70
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,839
I will restore the house, back to the way it was.

71
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,759
If you disagree, you can call the police.

72
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,300
- The police can reason it out. 
 - You...

73
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,439
If you don't restore it to its original condition,

74
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,380
I won't let you get away with it.

75
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,180
This is just...

76
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,040
Why did I fell asleep!

77
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,499
Xiaoning, let me find a place for you to stay first.

78
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:39,710
 Director Gu, wait for me. Wait for me. 

79
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:42,430
 Right away. Right away. Immediately. 

80
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:48,189
 Today, when I heard you talking about the proposal, I was so excited. 

81
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:50,030
 I felt that you were shining. 

82
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:53,689
 Meeting you is the start of my good luck. 

83
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:56,350
 Director Gu, for you. 

84
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:59,150
 Director Gu, wish you good health and happiness. 

85
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,790
Good health and happiness.

86
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,249
 Director Gu, goodbye. 

87
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,409
 Director Gu, you're so handsome. 

88
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,769
 You're my idol. 

89
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,450
 You're my Idol Boss. 

90
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,890
 Come, let's check. 

91
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,549
- Pick it up. Pick it up. 
 - Drop two glasses of beer?

92
00:05:55,549 --> 00:05:59,230
What's going on with you? What's going on with you?

93
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,550
Director Xu, add me on WeChat.

94
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:04,089
Okay. But my WeChat has reached a maximum of 5,000 people.

95
00:06:04,089 --> 00:06:05,769
Let me see who I should delete.

96
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,609
Director Xu is so popular.

97
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,790
Come, cheers.

98
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,470
You guys enjoy first.

99
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:22,870
Move over for me.

100
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:28,330
 Come, cheers. 

101
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,190
Hello.

102
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,950
Chuan, what are you doing? What happened?

103
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,869
It keeps showing that your heart rate is abnormal.

104
00:06:54,869 --> 00:06:56,030
I'm fine.

105
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,889
I just exercised for a little bit.

106
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,690
 Exercise? 

107
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,209
I'm begging you, please. Don't make me worry about you.

108
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:03,329
Your heart's condition.

109
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,289
Don't you know about it?

110
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,329
 How could you do exercise? 

111
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,169
 Why do you always let doctor's words fall on deaf ears? 

112
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,550
I just wanted to try it.

113
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,490
 It's good that you're willing to try. 

114
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,489
But you also have to consider the actual situation.

115
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,689
If anything happens to you, what about the company?

116
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,110
What about me?

117
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:21,389
I'm sorry. I've bothered you.

118
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:23,530
Are you Gu Chuan? Why are you talking to me like this?

119
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,911
This is not the Gu Chuan I know.

120
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:28,231
Okay, I'm going to hang up.

121
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,330
Slow down, watch the step.

122
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:56,429
Brother Xu, this place has stayed the same since I was a kid.

123
00:07:56,429 --> 00:07:59,729
Xiaoning, whose house is this?

124
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:03,490
This is my old house. You can stay here.

125
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:06,489
Xiaoning, did we turn off the burner in the kitchen?

126
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,530
We've been out for too long. Let's go home.

127
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,969
Yes, it's off.

128
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,870
Let's get you into the room and rest. Okay?

129
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,570
Come.

130
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:14,769
I'll turn it off.

131
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,809
I'll make you delicious food later.

132
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:19,450
I'll cook whatever you want to eat.

133
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:21,170
Slow down.

134
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,110
Have some rest.

135
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:31,169
This is my study room.

136
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,950
You can do whatever you want. Make yourself at home.

137
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,370
Okay, Brother Xu. Thank you.

138
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:48,209
- Brother Xu. 
 - It's okay.

139
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:52,369
I know. You don't want to see it.

140
00:08:52,369 --> 00:08:54,808
Yes, I don't want to.

141
00:08:54,808 --> 00:08:57,180
Last time, when I was here,

142
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:01,780
I never thought that so many things would happen to me.

143
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,919
I just feel a bit regretful.

144
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,620
The better the past was, the more in a trance I'm feeling now.

145
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,100
Are you unhappy living in that home?

146
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,640
I'm all right.

147
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,540
Actually, it's not that bad.

148
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,860
You see, after all, I'm in a quite high position now.

149
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,400
Okay. Go to bed early.

150
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,780
I'll come to visit you again another day.

151
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,700
Sure, thank you.

152
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,740
Harassing phone calls in the early morning.

153
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,980
So persistent.

154
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,279
No investment, not purchasing any land. No interviews with journalists.

155
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:02,219
Support gender equality. Not supporting 996 working hour system.

156
00:10:02,219 --> 00:10:04,060
Any more questions?

157
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:07,439
 Chengran, I'm Assistant Liu. 

158
00:10:07,439 --> 00:10:10,419
Assistant Liu, I thought it was telemarketing. What happened?

159
00:10:10,419 --> 00:10:12,560
 Director Xu is hospitalized. 

160
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,919
Don't you worry.

161
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,359
I've spoken to the neighbor.

162
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,399
They'll help to look after Grandma.

163
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,999
As for you, just rest well.

164
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,240
Don't think of anything at all.

165
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,159
Early in the morning, you've done so many things.

166
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,760
How early do you have to get up?

167
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,140
Last night, so many things happened, too.

168
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,639
It's okay, just don't worry about it.

169
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,880
My company has paid the medical expenses for you.

170
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,460
I'll pay them back slowly.

171
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,780
Don't be too frugal on yourself.

172
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,740
I've enough money.

173
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,480
Once I get better,

174
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,000
I must personally thank your boss.

175
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,519
You've had so many jobs before.

176
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,540
None of the bosses treated you well.

177
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,920
You've met a kind boss.

178
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,860
Our boss is not only is kind-hearted and handsome

179
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,420
but also very talented.

180
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,140
How old is he?

181
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,660
Does he have a girlfriend?

182
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,040
Auntie, what are you thinking? Wake up.

183
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,240
It's not like those TV shows that Grandma watched.

184
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,999
He paid for your medical expenses.

185
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,959
Don't be a scourge to him.

186
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,820
I was just asking.

187
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,140
Why are you so nervous?

188
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,999
You better stop having such thinking.

189
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,620
Look at him and what he's got.

190
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,039
What do I have?

191
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,359
Yes, correct.

192
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,080
You?

193
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,719
Except for your poor educational background, your height,

194
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,660
and your financial situation, you have no other shortcomings.

195
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,700
Early in the morning, you did comfort me well.

196
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,120
Okay, I'm leaving.

197
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,599
I'm going to pick up my boss.

198
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,800
I've spoken to the nurse.

199
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,400
For lunch, I'll help you to order a takeaway.

200
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,720
The nurse will bring it for you.

201
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,440
You just leave like this?

202
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,719
- Sorry to trouble you. 
 - No worries. Goodbye.

203
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,000
Careful on your way.

204
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,780
Okay.

205
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,240
Hi, Sister Nurses. Please take good care of my auntie.

206
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,800
- Thank you. 
 - No worries.

207
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,300
Goodbye.

208
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,699
Your niece is so filial.

209
00:11:55,699 --> 00:11:58,079
She bought us breakfast even when it's early in the morning.

210
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,159
She said she has work to do and she has no time to take care of you.

211
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:03,579
She asked us to help and take care of you. What a thoughtful girl.

212
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,019
This child. She is too thoughtful.

213
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:09,299
Okay. Remember to take the medicine after finishing your meal.

214
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:11,280
Okay. Thank you, Nurse.

215
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,580
Brother,

216
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,860
Xiaoning has grown up to be a good girl.

217
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,960
It would be nice if you were here.

218
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,080
Sleeping?

219
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,920
After eating this orange, I'll be going back.

220
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,520
You finally came.

221
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,780
You haven't been home for a long time.

222
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:03,559
You just spent all your time on that lousy company. What good would that do?

223
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:05,300
Why should I go home?

224
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,999
To watch you and your godson bonding?

225
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,880
Or to watch you flirt with another woman?

226
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,680
The reasons I don't go home, you know very clearly.

227
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,779
Chengran, listen to your father and come back.

228
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:21,020
Not only that you'll succeed in your career.

229
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:26,060
In the company, you can win everyone's heart.

230
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:29,860
Look at me now.

231
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:33,380
What if one day I'm gone

232
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,299
and left the company in such a situation?

233
00:13:36,299 --> 00:13:38,560
Have you ever thought about it?

234
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,600
What should I do?

235
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,180
Who shall I hand it over to?

236
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,500
Don't you still have another son?

237
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,819
He works at your place, doing well. Why do you count on me?

238
00:13:48,819 --> 00:13:52,659
I'm not interested in fighting over ownership of family property. I'm fine with the money I have right now.

239
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,180
Xu Chengran,

240
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:00,039
your tantrums. When can you tame them?

241
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,260
   

242
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,529
Why are you here?

243
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:14,089
Director Gu, I'll drive you and pick you up for work.

244
00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:15,949
Isn't your auntie still in the hospital?

245
00:14:15,949 --> 00:14:19,189
I've sorted all things out for my auntie. Let's go.

246
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:36,629
Director Gu, I've bought you some fruits.

247
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:39,070
Thank you for helping me yesterday.

248
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:42,389
It's a small matter. You don't have to thank me.

249
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:45,790
To me, it matters.

250
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:49,869
You lent me money. It proves that I can continue to work in the company.

251
00:14:49,869 --> 00:14:52,650
I can also keep learning from you.

252
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:57,810
Why didn't you finish university?

253
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:02,049
Because my grandma is getting old. She has Alzheimer's.

254
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:05,729
She needs someone to take care of her. My auntie's health condition is not good either.

255
00:15:05,729 --> 00:15:08,610
I quit school to work.

256
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,869
Fortunately, everything goes well now. Everything will get better.

257
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:15,030
Things will get better.

258
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:22,149
Director Gu, can you smile more?

259
00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:25,349
Don't always put on a straight face. Or you'll be a boss always with a straight face.

260
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:29,509
- Do you have a problem with me? 
 - No, no.

261
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:31,890
Although I've only gotten to know you for just a short time,

262
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:36,049
I know that you're a kind person. My auntie said so, too.

263
00:15:36,049 --> 00:15:39,589
She also asked me how you were and if you had a girlfriend.

264
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:44,349
She also said that to thank you for lending me the money,

265
00:15:44,349 --> 00:15:46,449
she wants to introduce a girl to you.

266
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,729
She knows everyone in our community.

267
00:15:48,729 --> 00:15:52,189
What kind of girl do you like? She can find you one.

268
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,570
Please thank her for me.

269
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:57,310
Look, you finally laughed.

270
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,380
Just drive.

271
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,030
Yes.

272
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,650
Director Xu.

273
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:21,270
Brother, you came.

274
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:25,749
Who is your brother? My last name is Xu, your last name is Tang. We're not related.

275
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:31,329
I just asked the doctor. The doctor said you need to stay for another few days, then you can leave.

276
00:16:31,329 --> 00:16:33,569
After discharging from the hospital, you'll need to be on a light diet.

277
00:16:33,569 --> 00:16:36,130
You're not allowed to drink for the time being.

278
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,650
Okay.

279
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,969
I'm leaving.

280
00:16:41,969 --> 00:16:45,389
I'm just an outsider. I don't want to bother the bonding between the father and his son.

281
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,889
 Deputy Director Xu, regarding your employees, Jiang Guangda and Tang Zhengcheng 

282
00:16:57,889 --> 00:17:01,389
 for misuse of public funds, committing an occupational crime, can you reveal some details? 

283
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:03,809
 As the deputy director of the company, are you completely unaware of this? 

284
00:17:03,809 --> 00:17:07,229
 This kind of thing happened under your nose. Would you tender your resignation? 

285
00:17:07,229 --> 00:17:11,509
 I heard that Jiang Guangda had a car accident while trying to abscond. Is this true? 

286
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:15,510
   

287
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,769
 - This is my home. 
 - Dad. 

288
00:17:22,769 --> 00:17:26,430
 - Goodbye, teacher. 
 - Goodbye, teacher. 

289
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:29,689
 Let me introduce him to you. This is my son, Xu Chengran. 

290
00:17:29,689 --> 00:17:31,550
 This is Tang Xu. 

291
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,969
   
 Something happened to his family. 

292
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:35,650
   
 For the time being, he'll stay at our place for a while. 

293
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,410
 You two... 

294
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:40,509
 You're the elder brother. You'll call him Brother Ran Ran from now on. 

295
00:17:40,509 --> 00:17:42,529
 Worth celebrating! 
   

296
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:45,949
 Just turned eighteen years old. Started your own business as soon as you go to the university. 

297
00:17:45,949 --> 00:17:48,710
 Most importantly, it's profitable. 

298
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,569
 Come. It's worth celebrating. Come, let's have a toast. 

299
00:18:07,388 --> 00:18:08,888
Jia Jia!

300
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:11,029
Why are you munching every day?

301
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:14,370
Eating snacks makes me feel good.

302
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:18,129
- All packages are sent? 
 - Yes, Xianning helped me send them.

303
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:21,869
You can't just leave everything to Xiaoning.

304
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,990
I tell you, Xiaoning's biggest mistake is to have met you.

305
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:26,249
I didn't. I like Xiaoning so much.

306
00:18:26,249 --> 00:18:27,970
Does she like you?

307
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:31,089
Yes, she does. I like every colleague in the company.

308
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:32,269
See.

309
00:18:32,269 --> 00:18:34,849
- That's because Xiaoning is a thoughtful girl. 
 - Brother Dong.

310
00:18:34,849 --> 00:18:38,009
Brother Dong, can I borrow your design and have a look?

311
00:18:38,009 --> 00:18:41,269
- Can you understand it? 
 - Of course. I studied design at university.

312
00:18:41,269 --> 00:18:43,689
- Oh sure. 
 - Thank you.

313
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,389
Sister Manlin, you were at the construction site. Right?

314
00:18:48,389 --> 00:18:51,269
- It must be a hard day. Let me get a glass of water for you. 
 - Okay, thank you.

315
00:18:51,269 --> 00:18:53,490
- Oh right,— 
 - Jiang Xiaoning.

316
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:55,250
Come over here.

317
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:59,029
Tell him you won't. You'll be very busy with Director Gu's matter this afternoon.

318
00:18:59,029 --> 00:19:01,449
Brother Kai, can you wait for some time? I'll come over later.

319
00:19:01,449 --> 00:19:02,969
Jiang Xiaoning!

320
00:19:02,969 --> 00:19:04,990
Becoming so daring now?

321
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:07,429
Who is in charge of you?

322
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:09,350
It's not you anyway.

323
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,949
This is a design company. The designer has a say in everything.

324
00:19:11,949 --> 00:19:13,729
- Understand? 
 - I don't understand.

325
00:19:13,729 --> 00:19:15,349
Do I have to kneel down and bow to you?

326
00:19:15,349 --> 00:19:17,369
Then please kneel down and bow now.

327
00:19:17,369 --> 00:19:19,049
Based on the performance in the company,

328
00:19:19,049 --> 00:19:22,050
even if you kneel down and bow, it won't be good enough.

329
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:24,089
Then I'll burn some joss paper for you. What do you say?

330
00:19:24,089 --> 00:19:26,830
Look, guys. Sister Manlin. Brother Kai.

331
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,729
If there is anything, just tell me. That's it.

332
00:19:28,729 --> 00:19:31,429
I'll work overtime today. I'll be off after completing everything. The weather is hot.

333
00:19:31,429 --> 00:19:32,869
Let's not argue and destroy the harmony.

334
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:35,609
If you've anything, just tell me. Don't be angry, okay?

335
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:37,410
Don't argue.

336
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:52,029
Sister Manlin, this is for you.

337
00:19:52,029 --> 00:19:54,429
These are all the similar architectural styles that I could get.

338
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,189
The content is a bit overloaded. It might take a while to load.

339
00:19:56,189 --> 00:19:57,989
When you open it, it might take some time.

340
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,790
Okay. Thank you.

341
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:04,009
What's the matter? Is there anything else?

342
00:20:04,009 --> 00:20:05,809
Thank you for helping me last night.

343
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:07,409
This gift is for you.

344
00:20:07,409 --> 00:20:10,429
It may not be that expensive, but it's a token of my gratitude.

345
00:20:10,429 --> 00:20:14,440
I chose it specifically to express gratitude. And it suits you. It matches you.

346
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:17,049
No need, it was Director Gu who helped you.

347
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,349
I can't accept it.

348
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,829
Please just accept it.

349
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,870
You don't know how moved I was.

350
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,770
Since I've bought it.

351
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:26,970
Okay then, thank you.

352
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:31,069
Oh yes. Regarding that resort project, is there anything else I can help?

353
00:20:31,069 --> 00:20:32,989
No, no need. Director Gu is in charge of it.

354
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,970
It seems like we failed.

355
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:37,110
Failed.

356
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,990
Is it because of me?

357
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,949
There're many reasons that a project failed.

358
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,589
It's impossible due to you alone.

359
00:20:44,589 --> 00:20:46,690
You don't have to carry any emotional burden.

360
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,790
Go and do your job.

361
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,230
Thank you.

362
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:57,369
Director Gu, this document requires your signature.

363
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:13,149
Director Gu, I'm sorry.

364
00:21:13,149 --> 00:21:15,630
That resort project...

365
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:18,949
You're not a designer. Why are you saying sorry?

366
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:26,149
Do you have any idea regarding the resort project?

367
00:21:26,149 --> 00:21:28,669
Me? What idea could I have?

368
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:31,930
At that moment, I was so shocked by this thought.

369
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:34,649
Just say whatever you want. I won't deduct your salary.

370
00:21:34,649 --> 00:21:36,770
I'm going to say now.

371
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:39,609
I think that this project is very good.

372
00:21:39,609 --> 00:21:44,729
However, it's just that Chinese people and people from other countries have different aesthetics.

373
00:21:44,729 --> 00:21:48,269
The containers are placed there. Indeed, it's very avant-garde.

374
00:21:48,269 --> 00:21:50,810
It can be an iconic building.

375
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:54,730
However, I guess people of my auntie's age wouldn't admire it.

376
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,349
They might find it boring.

377
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:02,110
So, shall we color every container differently?

378
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:04,790
I thought the same, too.

379
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,869
Look. I was teaching one's grandmother to suck eggs.

380
00:22:06,869 --> 00:22:08,830
I'll go out now.

381
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,269
I'm sorry, Director Gu. I fell asleep.

382
00:22:54,269 --> 00:22:56,169
Have you finished? I'll take you home now.

383
00:22:56,169 --> 00:22:58,810
You've done a lot of things today.

384
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,710
I'm productive.

385
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,890
It's time to get off work. Let's go.

386
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:08,969
- Have you tried fishing before? 
 - Yes.

387
00:23:08,969 --> 00:23:10,490
Let's go.

388
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:29,030
Director Gu, it's so dark now.

389
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:31,989
We can't see anything in the water.

390
00:23:31,989 --> 00:23:33,870
We can't see anything,

391
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,090
but we can feel.

392
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:43,309
When I was young, my father used to take me fishing.

393
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:46,649
I was under the sun for a few hours and my skin was peeling.

394
00:23:46,649 --> 00:23:48,809
When I got home, my mother scolded me for two hours.

395
00:23:48,809 --> 00:23:52,529
She said I was ugly already. With the sunburn, I was tanned and ugly.

396
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:56,909
I kept wondering what's so fun about fishing?

397
00:23:56,909 --> 00:23:58,989
With money, we can buy fish.

398
00:23:58,989 --> 00:24:02,670
Could it be because the wild ones taste better?

399
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:10,269
Boss, have you ever thought that Jiang Ziya's fishing could be

400
00:24:10,269 --> 00:24:11,589
a performance art in modern days?

401
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:15,089
If this was on the Internet, it would be regarded as a publicity stunt for sure.

402
00:24:15,089 --> 00:24:17,590
Can you stop talking?

403
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,950
You scared fish away already.

404
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:24,429
But there are only two of us at this place.

405
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,270
If I stop talking,

406
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:28,490
it will be very desolate.

407
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:32,610
Creating and designing are lonely.

408
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:35,250
If you want to be a designer,

409
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:38,970
you must learn to think silently.

410
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:43,489
Have I... disturbed your creativity time?

411
00:24:43,489 --> 00:24:45,430
What do you think?

412
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:00,110
Fish!

413
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,970
A fish!

414
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:33,169
 Gu, you have feelings for her. She has changed you. 

415
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:46,989
♫  I was caught off guard when I first met you  ♫

416
00:25:46,989 --> 00:25:50,050
Boss, you're looking into my eyes.

417
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:55,010
♫  I can't control my palpaitation  ♫

418
00:25:55,010 --> 00:26:00,969
♫  Is it because I'm abnormal? Or is it because you're shining?  ♫

419
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:05,829
Put it in.

420
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:14,110
Is there a fish on my side?

421
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:19,410
♫  My heart leaps when you're beside me  ♫

422
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:40,569
♫  My heart leaps when you're beside me  ♫

423
00:26:40,569 --> 00:26:42,069
This is for you.

424
00:26:42,069 --> 00:26:43,549
Your auntie is sick, right?

425
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:46,229
Take this and make some soup to help her recover.

426
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,350
This is your overtime pay.

427
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:52,749
This fish is for my overtime pay?

428
00:26:52,749 --> 00:26:54,289
No, no way.

429
00:26:54,289 --> 00:26:57,109
Director Gu, if the fishbone

430
00:26:57,109 --> 00:26:59,149
gets stuck in the throat, it will be uncomfortable.

431
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,909
We never eat fish.

432
00:27:00,909 --> 00:27:05,130
As for the overtime pay, I prefer money.

433
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:08,670
There's no fish on my menu tomorrow.

434
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:14,490
Why is my life filled with suffering?

435
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:18,429
Since you worked overtime today, you don't have to pick me up tomorrow.

436
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:20,850
Yes, Boss!

437
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:31,989
- Thanks for your hard work. 
 - You're back.

438
00:27:31,989 --> 00:27:33,909
You haven't had your dinner yet, have you?

439
00:27:33,909 --> 00:27:36,409
It's already there. I was waiting for you.

440
00:27:36,409 --> 00:27:37,950
Self-heating hotpot?

441
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:40,289
Get some rest first. Eat something.

442
00:27:40,289 --> 00:27:42,150
Come.

443
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:45,310
What do you say? Some initial positive effects.

444
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:48,349
- Be careful, it's hot. 
 - Thank you.

445
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,110
What is that?

446
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:54,149
Like I told you in WeChat, Director Gu asked me to go fishing with him.

447
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,990
So that's what's in the bucket.

448
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,909
Your boss is great.

449
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:03,870
He has a work-life balance.

450
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:09,129
He's a nice person, but he looks a bit weird.

451
00:28:09,129 --> 00:28:10,850
Weird?

452
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:14,349
Tell me more. I'll help you take him down.

453
00:28:14,349 --> 00:28:16,109
Why are you like my auntie?

454
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:18,309
We are not having that kind of relationship.

455
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:20,829
Haven't I been just like your auntie?

456
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:25,629
Taking him down means not allowing him to bully you at work.

457
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:28,150
What were you thinking?

458
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:33,510
Do you like him?

459
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:36,189
Yan Yan, are you jealous?

460
00:28:36,189 --> 00:28:39,090
Are you afraid that I would ditch you if I were into a guy?

461
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:43,569
You better be. I'm afraid you'd stick to me and disturb me when I'm flirting with guys.

462
00:28:43,569 --> 00:28:45,370
Annoying.

463
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:09,830
Hello?

464
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:10,869
Chuan.

465
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:13,089
Don't go to the office tomorrow. Just work at home.

466
00:29:13,089 --> 00:29:14,910
The weather forecast stated that it will rain tomorrow.

467
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:18,730
 I've got a lot to do at the studio, I must be there tomorrow. 

468
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:24,389
The loss of you being absent for a day is way lesser than the loss of you malfunctioning the elevators.

469
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:27,910
Do you want to make everyone in the building climb the stairs again?

470
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:31,509
 Uncle and Aunt have exhorted me that your condition will be worse 

471
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:34,869
when there is rain and storm due to the electric current in the air.

472
00:29:34,869 --> 00:29:37,069
 Okay, listen to me. Don't go to the office. 

473
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:40,409
- I'll still be around. As long as I'm around— 
   - You are my biggest worry. 

474
00:29:40,409 --> 00:29:45,030
If I'm not around for a day, you'll bring the bar to the office.

475
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:48,729
You've misunderstood me. After all, I invested in this company, too.

476
00:29:48,729 --> 00:29:52,110
 Why don't we be absent together? 

477
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:54,330
 Go out and find something fun that you can do. 

478
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:56,470
What else can you do now?

479
00:29:56,470 --> 00:30:00,269
You can't flirt with girls, can't drink, and can't race cars.

480
00:30:00,269 --> 00:30:02,309
 Let's go to an amusement park. 

481
00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:05,369
 Let's ride the merry-go-round and Ferris wheel. How romantic. 

482
00:30:05,369 --> 00:30:07,789
All right, enough. I'm going to hang up.

483
00:30:07,789 --> 00:30:10,909
If I don't see you in the office tomorrow, I will tell Qi Hong

484
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:13,549
to deduct all your salary for this month.

485
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,889
 Oh, right. 

486
00:30:14,889 --> 00:30:17,929
Nobody is coming to pick me up tomorrow. You should come and pick me up.

487
00:30:17,929 --> 00:30:19,750
 Hello? 

488
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:28,049
I'm the boss too, aren't I?

489
00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:29,969
Does a boss get a salary deduction as well?

490
00:30:29,969 --> 00:30:32,710
What's the point of being a boss then?

491
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:36,270
My call even got hung up by a person without a conscience.

492
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:40,169
You won't even hang up the cleaner's call. How dare you hang up my call.

493
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:48,390
I neither have love nor happiness.

494
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:51,189
What is this life that I'm having? Gosh.

495
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:55,550
I'm starving to death.

496
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:01,589
With people like your boss, you must always have one thing in mind.

497
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,629
What is it?

498
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:05,630
That is, be yourself.

499
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:10,729
Think about it. As the boss of such a big company,

500
00:31:10,729 --> 00:31:12,689
hasn't he met many different employees?

501
00:31:12,689 --> 00:31:14,769
Why did he choose you?

502
00:31:14,769 --> 00:31:16,609
Is it because you're capable?

503
00:31:16,609 --> 00:31:18,649
We have a common answer for this, right?

504
00:31:18,649 --> 00:31:23,449
You're quite smart, but you're still a rookie in this field.

505
00:31:23,449 --> 00:31:25,300
So there must be some highlights

506
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:29,060
in you that attracted him and made him choose you.

507
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:32,129
All you have to do is to learn more and be less confused.

508
00:31:32,129 --> 00:31:34,910
Just be yourself. Perfect.

509
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:36,280
I just don't get it.

510
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:39,400
Why do I feel that I'm a person without any strength?

511
00:31:39,409 --> 00:31:42,269
You don't have to belittle yourself.

512
00:31:42,269 --> 00:31:46,390
Do you know what your greatest strength to me is?

513
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:50,649
You're very sincere, unlike those hypocritical girls.

514
00:31:50,649 --> 00:31:52,910
They are so annoying. So hypocritical.

515
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:55,230
In addition, though you're quite unlucky,

516
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:57,729
but you have a positive mind.

517
00:31:57,729 --> 00:32:02,350
Whenever you encounter a problem, you always take it positively.

518
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:06,670
If I were you, I would be so mad and I would resign.

519
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:10,509
When my parents were still around, they gave me sufficient love.

520
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:12,749
My grandma and aunt did, too.

521
00:32:12,749 --> 00:32:15,629
Whenever I think about the fact that there are still people who love me,

522
00:32:15,629 --> 00:32:18,510
I don't feel that unbearable anymore.

523
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:23,949
You have love in you. You're nice to everyone.

524
00:32:23,949 --> 00:32:25,869
This is something good.

525
00:32:25,869 --> 00:32:28,849
However, there are people who will make use of you and bully you

526
00:32:28,849 --> 00:32:31,329
because they know you will do it.

527
00:32:31,329 --> 00:32:33,649
I don't have anything. What can they get from me?

528
00:32:33,649 --> 00:32:36,809
- I'm not— 
 - All right, enough. Hurry up and eat. We still got walls to paint.

529
00:32:36,809 --> 00:32:41,070
I can also enjoy the feeling of instructing people.

530
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,550
Yes, ma'am!

531
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:46,589
Give me a bite.

532
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,330
Be careful, it's hot.

533
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:56,169
- Is it tasty? 
 - Yes. It's too hot.

534
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:03,750
You've been hanging up my calls.

535
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:07,649
That girl... Why didn't Jiang Xiaoning pick you up?

536
00:33:07,649 --> 00:33:09,309
She's neglecting her duty.

537
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:11,469
Why did she stop sending you to work suddenly?

538
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:13,270
Did you scold her?

539
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:17,649
Don't blame me. Don't blame her either.

540
00:33:17,649 --> 00:33:20,130
I told her not to come.

541
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:24,069
You're being protective. Did something happen?

542
00:33:24,069 --> 00:33:27,529
Nothing. She worked overnight last night.

543
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:31,429
You shouldn't keep a straight face all the time.

544
00:33:31,429 --> 00:33:33,289
You're scaring people away.

545
00:33:33,289 --> 00:33:35,350
It will be nice if you smile more.

546
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:38,850
Why does everyone say that?

547
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,750
Who else said that?

548
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:43,930
Jiang Xiaoning said that, too.

549
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:45,910
Did she?

550
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:49,390
This Jiang Xiaoning is making me surprised.

551
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:51,930
Why?

552
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:55,390
I have a feeling that you won't fire her.

553
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:57,650
Why?

554
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:02,109
It's my instinct. She's probably the one that I've been looking for.

555
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:05,689
Tell you what.

556
00:34:05,689 --> 00:34:08,790
Don't you ever do anything bad to my employees.

557
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,949
I didn't mean that.

558
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:14,929
You're so annoying. You're affecting my happy driving mood.

559
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:30,230
Thanks, Brother Xu.

560
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:33,249
- I'll go to work then. 
 - Okay.

561
00:34:33,249 --> 00:34:36,290
Good morning, Director Xu and Director Gu!

562
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:38,829
Godson?

563
00:34:38,829 --> 00:34:40,688
I don't think it's appropriate for you to call me that.

564
00:34:40,688 --> 00:34:43,708
My father's godson. Is that okay?

565
00:34:43,708 --> 00:34:47,010
He's the godson that I told you.

566
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:50,169
Why are you here at our office? Who are you dropping off?

567
00:34:50,169 --> 00:34:51,870
Good morning, Director Xu.

568
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:55,729
Is the world so small?

569
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:57,740
You're fighting with me over my father and the company.

570
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,569
In the future, you might be fighting for the property with me.

571
00:34:59,569 --> 00:35:02,749
Now, you even send a spy to our company. I can't ignore this anymore.

572
00:35:02,749 --> 00:35:03,909
You can say anything.

573
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:05,929
I'm not a spy. I passed an official interview.

574
00:35:05,929 --> 00:35:08,570
I'm also here to drive Xiaoning to work.

575
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:11,549
Driving my employees to work is not allowed either. It affects her work.

576
00:35:11,549 --> 00:35:13,709
Did you hear him? Do not drive her to work anymore.

577
00:35:13,709 --> 00:35:16,669
- Brother, do you have to do that? 
 - Don't call me brother, I can't take it.

578
00:35:16,669 --> 00:35:19,269
Dear bosses, it's quite late now. Let's go to work.

579
00:35:19,269 --> 00:35:21,910
Our salary will be deducted if we are late.

580
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:29,409
Out of the four people here, you're the only one who might get a salary deduction.

581
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:31,669
I'll leave then. Brother Xu, I'll leave now.

582
00:35:31,669 --> 00:35:33,920
Xiaoning, call me when you get off work.

583
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,740
Okay.

584
00:35:35,749 --> 00:35:39,570
Jiang Xiaoning, are you still on probation now?

585
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:40,370
Yes.

586
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:43,100
The company's rule stated that one must not be in a relationship during probation.

587
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,340
Otherwise, he or she will be fired.

588
00:35:44,349 --> 00:35:45,789
I've never heard of this rule.

589
00:35:45,789 --> 00:35:48,269
- There is one now. Director Xu, do you agree? 
 - Totally.

590
00:35:48,269 --> 00:35:50,809
Good. The Board of Directors has approved.

591
00:35:50,809 --> 00:35:52,749
I understand. One must not be in a relationship during probation.

592
00:35:52,749 --> 00:35:55,769
Do not be in contact frequently with irrelevant personnel.

593
00:35:55,769 --> 00:35:59,030
Who is considered irrelevant personnel?

594
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:02,109
One who is not our employee.

595
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,489
- A male. 
 - Single.

596
00:36:03,489 --> 00:36:05,229
- Similar age. 
 - Tall.

597
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:06,149
Who has his hair styled.

598
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:08,049
- Who wears a wind coat. 
 - Whose surname is Tang.

599
00:36:08,049 --> 00:36:09,380
That's gone too far.

600
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,060
You're right. That's specific enough.

601
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,780
That's about it.

602
00:36:12,789 --> 00:36:15,450
Brother Xu, please leave now.

603
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:19,170
Brother, no matter how you see me, we are brothers after all.

604
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:23,169
Today, I would like to ask a favor from you. Please let Jiang Xiaoning leave.

605
00:36:23,169 --> 00:36:25,189
I don't want to see her suffering every day.

606
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:27,889
I'm begging you. I want her to be in a better place.

607
00:36:27,889 --> 00:36:30,450
This is also my first time begging you in ten years.

608
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:32,770
Brother Xu.

609
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:36,509
He's right. It's really his first time begging me.

610
00:36:36,509 --> 00:36:39,550
However, why should I agree?

611
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:41,960
Chuan, someone is poaching your employee in front of you.

612
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,569
Don't you want to say something?

613
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:48,350
- Jiang Xiaoning, do you want to leave? 
 - No.

614
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:50,129
Did you hear her? She doesn't want to.

615
00:36:50,129 --> 00:36:53,769
Dear bosses, since I've chosen this job, I won't be distracted.

616
00:36:53,769 --> 00:36:56,950
I like my current boss very much and my current company as well.

617
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,380
I will work hard.

618
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,420
Why do you flatter Gu Chuan so much?

619
00:37:00,429 --> 00:37:02,269
But I like it very much.

620
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:03,860
The world used to have no roads,

621
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:07,509
just because of legs like you, there is a road for Chuan now.

622
00:37:07,509 --> 00:37:10,809
- Work hard. I'll give you a raise. 
 - Thank you, Mr. Xu!

623
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:15,329
Brother Xu, please leave now. Come on. Go!

624
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,450
Be careful.

625
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,510
Boss.

626
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:35,809
See you later. Goodbye, Mr. Xu.

627
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:41,050
What an unalloyed success.

628
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:46,109
- What? 
 - Just do it.

629
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:52,210
Call me when you get off work.

630
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:00,689
Boss, it's lunchtime now.

631
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:05,190
Have some soup first.

632
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:11,890
Here you go.

633
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:13,569
This is the fish that you caught.

634
00:38:13,569 --> 00:38:15,309
I woke up early today to stew it.

635
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:19,110
Not only does it contain your own hard work, but also your subordinate's love and respect.

636
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:20,810
Give it a try.

637
00:38:24,029 --> 00:38:28,289
 Boss, since you've had the fish soup, you can't substitute it with the overtime pay. 

638
00:38:28,289 --> 00:38:29,850
How is it?

639
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,810
Not bad.

640
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:37,229
I'll go out first. Boss.

641
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:46,029
 Director Gu, can you please smile more? 

642
00:38:46,029 --> 00:38:49,129
 Don't keep a straight face all the time. Or you'll be a boss always with a straight face. 

643
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,790
Let's go.

644
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:10,889
Drive to Director Qin's office.

645
00:39:10,889 --> 00:39:12,049
Director Gu.

646
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:14,969
Is it about the resort's project? Do you need me to come along?

647
00:39:14,969 --> 00:39:17,330
No, just do your own stuff.

648
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:26,849
- Little Gu, you're here. 
 - Director Qin.

649
00:39:26,849 --> 00:39:30,830
I've told you what happened over the phone.

650
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:33,230
I've seen the complementary proposal. It's quite good.

651
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:35,020
Take a seat.

652
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:38,630
To be honest,

653
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:41,930
my assistant played a big role in this proposal.

654
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:46,709
We did think about the issue of the target audience that you mentioned.

655
00:39:46,709 --> 00:39:50,129
So, we think that when we increase more different containers,

656
00:39:50,129 --> 00:39:52,989
we can also paint different fields of flowers on them,

657
00:39:52,989 --> 00:39:54,709
which will be a stark contrast.

658
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:57,230
This will eliminate your previous worry.

659
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:58,029
Good.

660
00:39:58,029 --> 00:40:01,670
Director Qin, I don't want to hide anything from you.

661
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:04,529
It's true that my assistant started working not long ago.

662
00:40:04,529 --> 00:40:09,550
But my studio wouldn't accept irresponsible people.

663
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:13,010
I think that professionalism can be trained, but nothing can be done

664
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,950
if one is irresponsible.

665
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:18,610
This is also the reason why I asked you to come today.

666
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:20,629
The previous price that you offered

667
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:23,330
was much higher than the market price.

668
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:25,660
I was thinking even if you're Gu Chuan,

669
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:29,600
it wouldn't make me pay for it decisively.

670
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:32,909
After that, I did an investigation.

671
00:40:32,909 --> 00:40:36,569
The person who marked up the price in between has been gotten rid of.

672
00:40:36,569 --> 00:40:40,650
This is how sincere I am towards this cooperation.

673
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:42,390
Thank you, Director Qin.

674
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:47,530
You were willing to be honest and you even brought the draft here.

675
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:50,190
It shows that you're being sincere, too.

676
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:53,110
I hope we can have a good cooperation.

677
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,910
Sure.

678
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:05,070


679
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:16,629
♫  Destiny is a little annoying  ♫

680
00:41:16,629 --> 00:41:19,590
♫  Takes those I care about  ♫

681
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:23,310
♫  Away from me  ♫

682
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:25,069
♫  If memory is bright  ♫

683
00:41:25,069 --> 00:41:28,090
♫  It would hold up a lamp in my heart  ♫

684
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:31,790
♫  And light up the night  ♫

685
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:53,269
♫  Sunshine alternates with moonlight  ♫

686
00:41:53,269 --> 00:41:56,249
♫  Returning to life in time  ♫

687
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:59,790
♫  Gift me with a dream  ♫

688
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:05,330
♫  A dream with you in it  ♫

689
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:33,169
♫  The one who caught me off guard  ♫

690
00:42:33,169 --> 00:42:37,430
♫  Steps foot into my life...  ♫

691
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:45,970
♫  It's you...  ♫

692
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:50,270
♫  If it weren't for parting  ♫

693
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:54,570
♫  How can we meet again?  ♫

694
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:04,050
♫  It's you...  ♫

695
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:06,189
♫  Exchanging sunshine for moonlight  ♫

696
00:43:06,189 --> 00:43:09,269
♫  Exchanging fortune for the past  ♫

697
00:43:09,269 --> 00:43:13,830
♫  Exchanging my heartbeat for you  ♫
