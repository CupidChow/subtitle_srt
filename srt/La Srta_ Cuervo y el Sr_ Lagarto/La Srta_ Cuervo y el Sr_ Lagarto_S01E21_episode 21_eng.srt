â™«  I can't help but feel a little nervous  â™«

â™«  You are the rainbow that fills up the black and white  â™«

â™«  I can't help but feel a little gloomy  â™«

20
00:01:33,339 --> 00:01:37,480
   

21
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:41,060
   

22
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:01,120
   

23
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,700
Boss, do you need me to drive you home?

24
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,539
No need. Are you going to cram school?

25
00:02:06,539 --> 00:02:08,800
That's good. I'm going to cram school, too.

26
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,699
You... still want to go?

27
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:13,559
I don't have anything else on anyway.

28
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,200
Let's go.

29
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,900
But...

30
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,119
- Director Gu, bad news. 
 - What happened?

31
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:36,820
The construction manager of the art gallery site and Chen Dong got into an argument and almost fought.

32
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,319
The situation is getting out of hand.

33
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,040
The workers want to stop working.

34
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,120
Let's go and take a look.

35
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,419
Boss, do you need me to drive you two there?

36
00:02:55,419 --> 00:02:58,360
No need. You can't be of any help if you go anyway.

37
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,760
Okay then.

38
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,950
Sister Manlin and Boss, I'm leaving then.

39
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,840
Be careful. Call me if anything happens.

40
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,880
What do you need her to be careful about?

41
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,940
Nothing much.

42
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:34,560
Just that it's quite late now, and she's a girl...

43
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,860
Xiaoning.

44
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,139
Thank you.

45
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:51,180
Greetings, Boss Jiang.

46
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,559
Why didn't your boss come along today?

47
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,140
Something came up. He went to attend to it.

48
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:00,179
So coincidental? I thought he got scared.

49
00:04:00,179 --> 00:04:02,620
Chen Chen, you've gone too far.

50
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,059
I'm helping you agitate him.

51
00:04:04,059 --> 00:04:05,879
Yet you tell me I've gone too far?

52
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,519
He really has a lot of work to do.

53
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,080
- Stop fooling around. 
 - How am I fooling around?

54
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,319
After knowing you for so many years, Jiang Xiaoning,

55
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,680
you've really fallen in love with your boss.

56
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,320
Whatever you say.

57
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,820
Open the door.

58
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,660
Drive.

59
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,719
No matter what problems occurred, you could always negotiate. Why did you have to hit him?

60
00:04:41,719 --> 00:04:44,120
That's not it. I didn't hit him.

61
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,679
Look at my collar. The buttons have fallen off.

62
00:04:46,679 --> 00:04:49,039
I just pushed you a little. Can that be considered hitting you?

63
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,941
Also, your words were so harsh.

64
00:04:50,941 --> 00:04:52,739
- I... 
 - What do you mean by negligent?

65
00:04:52,739 --> 00:04:54,799
What do you mean by careless and perfunctory?

66
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,920
Did we get the design in the drawing wrong?

67
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,679
The construction quality of the wall isn't even good enough.

68
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:02,999
If it isn't good enough, you can tell us. We can make changes.

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,079
It's not that easy. How do you account for the time it'll take?

70
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:09,039
Chen Dong, in the future, put your inspection results

71
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,879
into a report and submit it to Su Manlin.

72
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,000
Let her do the communicating.

73
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,299
Chargehand Pan, I don't have time today to head in and check on your construction quality.

74
00:05:16,299 --> 00:05:18,220
I'll let Su Manlin do it in a while.

75
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:22,400
If we discover any issues that will affect the construction and our schedule,

76
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,559
then we'll deal with it according to the contract.

77
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,319
By the way, no matter what happens in the future,

78
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,759
do not touch my staff.

79
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,139
- I just pushed him a little. 
 - Not even push.

80
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:33,720
If this happens again in the future,

81
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,540
I won't deal with it in the same manner as I have today.

82
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,620
Carry on with your work.

83
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,039
Okay, okay!  Stop looking.

84
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,040
Start working.

85
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,700
 Hurry, hurry up. 

86
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,859
Su Manlin, are you able to go back yourself?

87
00:05:46,859 --> 00:05:49,559
- I have something going on. 
 - I can drive her.

88
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:51,860
- Can you drive by yourself? 
 - Not a problem.

89
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,360
- Boss, today, Iâ€” 
 - We can talk later.

90
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,880
So Director Gu does know how to drive.

91
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,360
It seems like he has changed a lot recently.

92
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,760
Indeed, he has changed a lot.

93
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,580
What are you thinking about?

94
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:27,540
I'm thinking about whether you behaving like this will make Boss angry.

95
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:30,639
It won't. If it does, it shows he cares about you.

96
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,059
Chen Chen, don't go overboard.

97
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,099
There won't be an effect if I don't agitate him like this.

98
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:36,780
Just listen to me.

99
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:43,400
Stop looking. It's so late and he's not here. He might not come.

100
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,850
Boss.

101
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,599
Jiang Xiaoning, get in the car.

102
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,679
Hello, Boss.

103
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,060
You rushed back even though it is so late?

104
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,319
Okay, Boss.

105
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,299
Jiang Xiaoning, you are not having a late-night snack?

106
00:06:57,299 --> 00:06:59,320
Hurry and go home.

107
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,760
Boss!

108
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,920
Boss, let's have hotpot another day.

109
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,800
Drive carefully.

110
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,120
Boss, why do you bring me here?

111
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,040
There's a project inside which is very important for your future.

112
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,840
Go and take a look.

113
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,240
   

114
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,080
Boss.

115
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,880
Where's Boss?

116
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,580
What did he bring me here to see?

117
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,660
There's nothing.

118
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,400
 Jiang Xiaoning. 

119
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,959
 It turns out that all encounters are long-awaited reunions. 

120
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,120
 Thank you for bringing me so many wonderful days. 

121
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,679
 Jiang Xiaoning, 

122
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:40,719
 did you know that you look the prettiest when you smile? 

123
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,780
 Jiang Xiaoning, 

124
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,799
 your appearance is like a rainbow 

125
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,880
 that brings colors into my monochromatic life. 

126
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,680
 Jiang Xiaoning, 

127
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:03,320
 I realized that when I'm with you, doing anything makes me happy. 

128
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,260
 Thank you for your courage. 

129
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:11,599
 The moment you confessed to me was the moment when I realized 

130
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,520
 both of us actually felt the same way. 

131
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,340
 Because of you, my heart has been beating busily. 

132
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:34,120
 I hope that moving forward, I can bring you happiness. 

133
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,460
 Jiang Xiaoning, 

134
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,360
 I like you. 

135
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,620
Jiang Xiaoning.

136
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,039
How could you do this?

137
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,039
I'm not mentally prepared at all.

138
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,560
Am I dreaming?

139
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,400
I can tell you in all seriousness one more time.

140
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,080
Jiang Xiaoning,

141
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,000
I like you.

142
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,120
There.

143
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,520
But I haven't finished my words.

144
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,039
What else?

145
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,279
Can't you finish what you want to say all at once?

146
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,760
My heart is about to burst.

147
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,820
Although I like you a lot,

148
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:02,000
I can't be with you right now.

149
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,599
I don't understand what you mean.

150
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,400
Why?

151
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:10,480
Can I not tell you the reason for now?

152
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,860
If you're willing,

153
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,140
can you wait for me for three months?

154
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,879
I can.

155
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,280
I can wait, no matter for how long.

156
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,840
If even after three months,

157
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,360
we are unable to be together,

158
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,580
will you blame me?

159
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,680
I won't blame you.

160
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,380
Thank you for telling me these things today.

161
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:38,519
This is the first time in my life someone I like tells me that

162
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,880
he likes me, too.

163
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,940
This is also the most beautiful moment in my life

164
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,400
till this day.

165
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,600
Jiang Xiaoning,

166
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,640
can't you feel a prickling sensation?

167
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,439
I don't feel it.

168
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,320
But I feel comfortably tingly.

169
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,620
Why won't you let me drive you?

170
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,119
You'll drive me around during work hours.

171
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,599
Beyond that, I'll drive you.

172
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,519
But can you drive...

173
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,079
I won't drive for others.

174
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,400
But for you, I will.

175
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,319
Hurry, head home.

176
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,480
I still want a hug.

177
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,340
What's wrong?

178
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,039
I was just thinking that since we're not officially together,

179
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,160
we should still maintain some distance.

180
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,960
This is probably the weirdest confession in the world.

181
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:52,039
Wait for me. Three months.

182
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,560
I'll head up then. Good night.

183
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,779
Good night.

184
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:00,740
I'm really heading up.

185
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,960
Why won't my feet listen?

186
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,919
My feet don't seem to be listening to me either.

187
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,480
Really?

188
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,800
It's like they're glued to the ground.

189
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,800
Well then...

190
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,920
Okay, to save you,

191
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,800
I'll head up first.

192
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,460
- Good night. 
 - Good night.

193
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,160
Jiang Xiaoning, what're you doing?

194
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,820
 Jiang Xiaoning, why are you ignoring me when I'm talking to you? 

195
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,559
Okay, I'll be done right away.

196
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,600
 Hurry, wash up and go to sleep. 

197
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,179
â™«  I can't help but feel a little happy  â™«

198
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:26,759
â™«  I can't help but feel a little nervous  â™«

199
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:29,099
   
   

200
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,499
â™«  Without you, the earth stops  â™«

201
00:17:31,499 --> 00:17:37,140
â™«  You are the rainbow that fills up the black and white  â™«

202
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,700
 Let's have lunch together by noon. 

203
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,839
â™«  I was once obsessed with the legend of the four-leaf clover  â™«

204
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:47,619
â™«  I dreamed of a white-horse carriage and 
you becoming my prince  â™«

205
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,980
â™«  Your gaze is too seducing, please save me  â™«

206
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,819
â™«  Please save me  â™«

207
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:56,460
â™«  I'm turning into a moth, flying towards the fire  â™«

208
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:01,119
â™«  Your smile is dancing on your lips  â™«

209
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:05,779
â™«  Am I the happiness you're looking for?  â™«

210
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:10,339
â™«  The doe inside me is lost  â™«

211
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:15,620
â™«  Holding your hand, let's count down to happiness  â™«

212
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:22,720
â™«  I can't help but be a little fragile  â™«

213
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,339
â™«  I can't help but feel a little gloomy  â™«

214
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,700
â™«  The sky is bright because of you  â™«

215
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,900
â™«  Without you, the sky is grey  â™«

216
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:39,120
â™«  You are the angel who takes away all loneliness  â™«

217
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,539
â™«  The sky is bright because of you  â™«

218
00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:44,019
â™«  Without you, the sky is grey  â™«

219
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:53,340
â™«  You are the angel who takes away all loneliness  â™«

220
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,280
Director Xu, it's rare to see you being so carefree.

221
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,780
You've done such a good job with everything.

222
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,439
Of course, I'd be carefree.

223
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,840
Sit.

224
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,819
I never imagined you would be able to do such a good job

225
00:19:09,819 --> 00:19:12,340
with this branch company.

226
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,919
I was right about you.

227
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,960
I'll tell the board of directors tomorrow to transfer you back.

228
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,400
Tang Xu,

229
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,180
it's time for you to make something of yourself.

230
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:24,420
Rest assured, I won't let you down.

231
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,600
By the way,

232
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,320
Tang Zhengcheng

233
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,999
should be out the next few days, right?

234
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,800
Yes.

235
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:38,180
What are your plans?

236
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,600
I've thought about it.

237
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,280
We still need to go through all the conventions.

238
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,839
If I ignore him completely, others may mock us.

239
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,959
They might feel you haven't taught me well,

240
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,799
so I don't know the manners at all.

241
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,159
Although in my heart, I hate him and despise him,

242
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,120
I still need to help him sort out his life for a bit.

243
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,740
I won't interfere with what you want to do,

244
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,700
but most importantly, your relationship...

245
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,639
You need to manage this relationship well.

246
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,640
Understand?

247
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,879
Actually, I have no relationship with him at all.

248
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,720
I'm just fulfilling my obligation.

249
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,920
How should I put this...

250
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,160
You don't need to be so cruel.

251
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,780
In this world, we need to learn tolerance.

252
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,839
How about this?

253
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:29,879
When he comes out, I'll let my driver drive you there to pick him up.

254
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,640
When I have the time, I'll go and visit him.

255
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,300
Okay, I'll do as you say.

256
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,840
Why did you order so much food?

257
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,279
Your exam is coming up.  I can't help you with anything, 
     

258
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:43,860
so I can only buy you food to help you get refreshed.

259
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,700
Then I'm digging in.

260
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,999
Oh right!  How are Grandma and Aunty?

261
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,559
They're well, don't worry.

262
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,479
Okay. I bought them something.

263
00:20:51,479 --> 00:20:53,080
Bring these to them when you leave.

264
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,519
You don't have to buy anything.

265
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,199
- Auntie... 
 - I know.

266
00:20:56,199 --> 00:20:58,900
Just don't tell her that I bought these.

267
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,199
Brother Xu, I don't know how to express my gratitude.

268
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,940
You're so nice to us.

269
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:09,880
I hope what I'm doing will help resolve their hatred of my dad.

270
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,020
He's almost out.

271
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,319
Really?

272
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,920
In a few days.

273
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,039
He has been refusing to see me during all these years.

274
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,519
I have a lot of questions for him.

275
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,679
I finally get to see him.

276
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,639
Brother Xu, you have to help me.

277
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,799
I understand.

278
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,119
However, he just got out of jail. Let's wait a bit.

279
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:32,860
I understand. I'm not in a rush.

280
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,259
By the way, I've already cleaned up the apartment I rented.

281
00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:36,839
I'll move as soon as possible.

282
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,520
Xiaoning, no need to rush.

283
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,699
I rented him an apartment. You guys can still live there.

284
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:42,980
Cancel the original lease.

285
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,579
Our lease hasn't ended. Canceling it isn't a good decision.

286
00:21:46,579 --> 00:21:49,679
Also, your dad must wish to live in his own house.

287
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,139
- Xiaoning, you really don't have to. 
 - We promised it's temporary.

288
00:21:52,139 --> 00:21:53,479
Then we'll just keep our words.

289
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,260
I insist.

290
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,659
Let's not talk about this right now.

291
00:21:56,659 --> 00:21:58,279
Thank you, Brother Xu.

292
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,739
Why are you being so polite with me?

293
00:21:59,739 --> 00:22:01,440
Thank you indeed.

294
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,380
Eat more.

295
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,120
Come on.

296
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,040
   

297
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,620
Come in.

298
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:22,180
Boss, could I take this afternoon off?

299
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,239
Are you going to cram school again?

300
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,380
No, I'm moving back to my previous apartment.

301
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,539
I'm pretty free this afternoon. Let me help you.

302
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:33,539
It's okay! I can handle the physical stuff.

303
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:35,299
Also, there's not much stuff anyway.

304
00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:39,819
If I really can't handle it, I'll ask my friends who have nothing to do for help.

305
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:45,580
All right! I'm the friend who has nothing to do.

306
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,379
Hi, Boss.

307
00:22:50,379 --> 00:22:52,120
We meet again.

308
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,699
Jiang Xiaoning, I've already asked the movers to come.

309
00:22:55,699 --> 00:22:59,500
Your leisurely friend really doesn't have to come.

310
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,539
I told Chen Chen not to come, butâ€¦

311
00:23:02,539 --> 00:23:04,899
Xiaoning, so you're ditching me after all those years of me helping you?

312
00:23:04,899 --> 00:23:06,799
Jiang Xiaoning didn't need any help.

313
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,780
It's none of your business.

314
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,079
We're all friends.

315
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,040
What are you two doing?

316
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:16,220
If we're friends, do you want to eat hotpot together?

317
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,860
Hotpot is fine!

318
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,499
Wait till we're both free.

319
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:22,200
Okay.

320
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,800
Don't worry about it.

321
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:28,439
Xiaoning, I came here to tell you that I'm moving to another city.

322
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,999
I'm just saying goodbye today.

323
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,399
That's so sudden.

324
00:23:31,399 --> 00:23:34,320
Then we won't be able to meet this easily again.

325
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:39,240
Someone here doesn't want us meeting regularly.

326
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:40,939
Come on.

327
00:23:40,939 --> 00:23:43,659
Give me a hug before I leave.

328
00:23:43,659 --> 00:23:46,900
Come here, I'll hug you for her.

329
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,299
Nice, nice. Let's go.

330
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:52,699
 Jiang Xiaoning, come and check if you still want these. 

331
00:23:52,699 --> 00:23:54,779
Coming. I'm heading upstairs now.

332
00:23:54,779 --> 00:23:56,319
Take care. I hope everything goes well for you.

333
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,920
Bye.

334
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,320
Why aren't you gone yet?

335
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,459
Xiaoning is a good girl. Treat her well.

336
00:24:07,459 --> 00:24:08,860
I know.

337
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,799
I'll stop right here, kid.

338
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,940
Think about it.  If it wasn't for my assist, how can you two progress this quickly?

339
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:17,579
So don't keep everything to yourself.

340
00:24:17,579 --> 00:24:21,739
You've lived for several decades now. There is no need to be so shy about your relationship.

341
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,899
You're too young.

342
00:24:23,899 --> 00:24:25,359
There are a lot of things that you don't understand.

343
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,940
I'll tell you when you grow up.

344
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,540
Just go.

345
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,480
   

346
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,400
Drink some water.

347
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,480
Thank you, Grandma.

348
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,840
Guang Da, you just got off work.

349
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,099
Go and take a shower and rest a little.

350
00:25:02,099 --> 00:25:04,740
I'll make you some dumplings.

351
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,959
You have an idea of how my grandma acts now.

352
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,159
If she sees a young person, she will think that I'm dating too early.

353
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,540
If she sees a mature one, she will call him son.

354
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:22,119
But we don't look that much different.

355
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,120
I look super young.

356
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,420
Why do you care so much about age recently?

357
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,280
I don't.

358
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:36,280
I only care about if we get to eat dumplings tonight.

359
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,739
Auntie, Gu Chuan asks if there'll be any dumplings.

360
00:25:38,739 --> 00:25:40,759
 Of course. Stay for dinner. 

361
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:42,940
 Auntie will make you dumplings. 

362
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,540
Auntie says yes.

363
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:48,280
Guang Da, you like celery dumplings. Right?

364
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,620
Celery.

365
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:54,339
Xiao Mai, we're making celery dumplings.

366
00:25:54,339 --> 00:25:56,620
 Got it, Mom. 

367
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:59,799
Everything for utilities is under the TV stand.

368
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,740
This is my credit card.

369
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,520
There's no password.

370
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,900
Take it.

371
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,080
Xiao Xu,

372
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,140
are you still mad with your dad?

373
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,980
I have nothing to be mad about.

374
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:29,000
We're just strangers who are biologically related.

375
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,280
You should be able to live comfortably with an apartment

376
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:36,019
and my credit card. Right?

377
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:44,000
- Xiao Xu, I... 
 - Don't worry, I know what you mean.

378
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,880
I'm doing well staying with Director Xu, and I've been really busy lately.

379
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,240
Don't come to me except for emergencies.

380
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,459
If you want to make things up for me, just don't let me see you.

381
00:28:52,459 --> 00:28:54,159
And stop causing trouble in my life.

382
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:56,940
That would be the best gift from you.

383
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,260
Let's just end it here.

384
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,000
Xiao Xu!

385
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:10,140
Xiao Xu, don't leave yet.

386
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,759
Stay and chat with me.

387
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,500
I don't have time.

388
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,939
- Or do you want to eat together? 
 - I'm good.

389
00:29:17,939 --> 00:29:20,160
Let go of me.

390
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,920
I'm sorry.

391
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,140
It's all my fault.

392
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,699
Since the day you went to jail,

393
00:29:37,699 --> 00:29:40,960
since the day my mom jumped off of that building,

394
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,640
I swore never to forgive you.

395
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,939
My phone number is in it.

396
00:29:48,939 --> 00:29:51,000
Don't call me unless it's an emergency.

397
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,740
Cantilever beam...

398
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,880
Cantilever beam...

399
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,320
And this is... continuous beam?

400
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,019
You didn't reply to my messages.

401
00:30:38,019 --> 00:30:39,859
Why are you still here at this hour?

402
00:30:39,859 --> 00:30:42,980
I got too busy and didn't hear my phone ring.

403
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,300
Did you run into any problems?

404
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,779
I don't understand these documents.

405
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:49,839
You'll get it if you look it up.

406
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,220
I used to be good at English,

407
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,760
just not as good as you guys.

408
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,019
Let me help you.

409
00:30:56,019 --> 00:30:57,380
That way it would be faster.

410
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,400
If I let you help me with little things like this,

411
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,460
I would feel like that I'm useless.

412
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,599
Helping you is helping myself.

413
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:07,680
If you don't get off work, I'm going to be pretty bored alone.

414
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,020
Here, let me see.

415
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,160
Why do you keep so far away from me?

416
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:35,180
â™«  Cicada chirping at the end of the street  â™«

417
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:39,920
â™«  Two sleeping cats  â™«

418
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:45,180
â™«  Coolness after the rain  â™«

419
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:50,700
â™«  Endless dreams  â™«

420
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:55,680
â™«  Diana pink roses  â™«

421
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:01,380
â™«  Heart wavering like green grass blades  â™«

422
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:05,979
â™«  Time passing by gently  â™«

423
00:32:05,979 --> 00:32:11,220
â™«  Our eyes meet inadvertently  â™«

424
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:16,020
â™«  Do you feel it in your heart  â™«

425
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:20,760
â™«  Open the doors and windows of the new moon  â™«

426
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:26,300
â™«  Embrace the longing for pouring rain  â™«

427
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,259
â™«  You smile and say hello  â™«

428
00:32:28,259 --> 00:32:30,880
- Brother Xu, why are you here? 
 - Xiaoning.

429
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,780
Boss, give me one second.

430
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:35,499
Are you here for me? Why didn't you call me?

431
00:32:35,499 --> 00:32:37,179
I wasn't sure if you were here. I'm just passing by.

432
00:32:37,179 --> 00:32:39,139
I didn't expect to actually see you.

433
00:32:39,139 --> 00:32:42,360
Oh, do you want to get food together?

434
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,900
Director Gu.

435
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:51,219
Brother Xu, I'm driving my boss home today. Next time.

436
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,139
- Bye. 
 - Xiaoning.

437
00:32:52,139 --> 00:32:53,680
Bye.

438
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,440
Why didn't you go?

439
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,800
Work is not done yet. I have to send you back home first.

440
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,580
So is it all about work?

441
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:27,780
Boss, are you being jealous?

442
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,279
Why do we have to wait for three more months?

443
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,660
I can't wait.

444
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:48,559
I think that if you love someone, you should tell them what you really think.

445
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,700
Actually, these three months...

446
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,880
What's up?

447
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,700
Never mind. Let's talk about this later.

448
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:09,119
You can tell me everything.

449
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,479
I can take it.

450
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,839
I've never hated time so much.

451
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,600
It passes too slowly.

452
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:25,360
Me too.

453
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,820
Do you have a fever?

454
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,618
Do you really plan on telling Jiang Xiaoning

455
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,660
about your mechanical heart?

456
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:47,380
Would it be better if I just tell her the reason?

457
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:50,679
If I keep it from her and make her wait for three months,

458
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:54,379
- I'm afraid thatâ€” 
 - But you've been guarding this secret for all these years.

459
00:34:54,379 --> 00:34:57,980
And now, you're just going to let it out this easily?

460
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,880
Easily?

461
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:04,780
Chuan, what if three months later,

462
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:07,719
I'm just supposing, what if the doctor can't fix anything

463
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:10,579
and you still cannot be with Jiang Xiaoning?

464
00:35:10,579 --> 00:35:13,580
Do you still want her to know then?

465
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,320
I think if it's Jiang Xiaoning,

466
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:20,100
it would be okay.

467
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:24,680
You're just blinded by love.

468
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:28,539
If Jiang Xiaoning finds out, but you two never get together...

469
00:35:28,539 --> 00:35:32,499
What if she tells Zhao Yan and Zhao Yan tells other people, and in the end,

470
00:35:32,499 --> 00:35:35,410
everyone knows about your secret?

471
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:38,159
Then they will think you are a weirdo.

472
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,119
You won't be able to live normally ever again.

473
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,820
Do you know?

474
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:45,480
When I look at Jiang Xiaoning's face when she asked me,

475
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,400
I felt so bad.

476
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:54,800
Does it only take one facial expression to make such a big decision?

477
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,500
Isn't this enough?

478
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,659
You're not the Gu Chuan I know anymore.

479
00:36:02,659 --> 00:36:04,859
Let me go grab a drink and chill.

480
00:36:04,859 --> 00:36:06,640
Take care.

481
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,479
 Why do we need to wait for three more months? 

482
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,960
 I can't wait. 

483
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,839
 I think if you love someone, you should tell them what you really think. 

484
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:38,119
 Give me a little more time. 

485
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,279
 I'll be able to solve all the problems. 

486
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:45,440
 From then on, you'll be able to live like a normal person again. 

487
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:50,160
Charging interrupted.

488
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:31,800
 Let's grab lunch together. 

489
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:35,201
 Sure. 

490
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,040
What do you want to eat?

491
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,439
I don't want to eat anything after seeing you.

492
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,640
I forget that I'm hungry.

493
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:01,519
Do you want some burgers or fries?

494
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:02,719
Burgers?

495
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,539
I thought you wouldn't eat such junk food.

496
00:38:05,539 --> 00:38:08,060
I like whatever you like.

497
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,679
I had a great time these past few days.

498
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:16,590
I haven't felt this way.

499
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:22,599
Didn't you say that we shouldn't hide anything from each other

500
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:25,700
when being together?

501
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,520
If you don't want to say it, I won't ask anymore.

502
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,899
Today, you can ask whatever you want.

503
00:38:32,899 --> 00:38:33,959
Really?

504
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,040
That's the reason I asked you out today.

505
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,919
I just want to ask you about the reason why we have to wait

506
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,820
for three more months.

507
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:46,300
I saw this question coming.

508
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:49,179
It's a long story.

509
00:38:49,179 --> 00:38:52,399
It might take a bit of time.

510
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,760
I'm willing to listen for a lifetime, if you're willing to talk.

511
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,299
- Are you all right? 
 - I'm sorry, I...

512
00:39:04,299 --> 00:39:06,119
- Are you all right? 
 - I'm good, I'm good.

513
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:09,179
I'm truly sorry. I'm going to go if you're good.

514
00:39:09,179 --> 00:39:10,800
Be more careful in the future.

515
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,100
Be careful.

516
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,800
What happened?

517
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,639
I'm okay.

518
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,879
Boss, you don't look like you're okay. Should I take you to the hospital?

519
00:39:25,879 --> 00:39:29,459
I'm going home now. I'll call you tonight.

520
00:39:53,990 --> 00:40:02,940
