♫  I can't help but feel a little happy  ♫

3
00:00:18,909 --> 00:00:23,509
♫  I can't help but feel a little nervous  ♫

4
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:26,189
♫  The earth is turning because of you  ♫

♫  Without you, the earth stops  ♫

00:00:28,309 --> 00:00:34,390
♫  You are the rainbow that fills up the black and white  ♫

7
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:39,989
♫  I was once obsessed with the legend of the four-leaf clover  ♫

8
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:44,669
♫  I dreamed of a white-horse carriage and

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,549
♫  I can't help but be a little fragile  ♫

16
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:24,210
♫  I can't help but feel a little gloomy  ♫

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,549
♫  The sky is bright because of you  ♫

18
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:28,869

19
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:33,230
♫  You are the angel who takes away all loneliness  ♫

20
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:37,110
   

21
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:41,110
   

22
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:47,770
   
 Defendant Chen Yun violated the Provisions of Road Transport 

23
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,329
   
 and fled the scene afterward. 

24
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:53,609
  His action resulted in two people dead and one critically wounded. 

25
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:56,790
 He shall be charged for his actions. 

26
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,251
 And because the consequences are severe, he shall be punished according to law. 

27
00:02:00,251 --> 00:02:05,209
 The court will sentence according to Criminal Code of the PRC, Section 133. 

28
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:06,889
 His sentence is as follows, 

29
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:09,729
 Chen Yun is guilty of hit-and-run. 

30
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:12,770
 He will be sentenced to ten years in prison. 

31
00:02:18,351 --> 00:02:20,429
Hello. Where is the chairman's office?

32
00:02:20,429 --> 00:02:23,089
On the 45th floor. Take the elevator, there will be an escort waiting.

33
00:02:23,089 --> 00:02:25,109
- Hello. 
 - Zhao Yan.

34
00:02:25,109 --> 00:02:26,889
It's one floor up, right?

35
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:27,789
Thank you.

36
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,230
   

37
00:02:32,589 --> 00:02:35,670
Not bad. It looks natural.

38
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,190
Without checking the original account,

39
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,030
nothing is suspicious.

40
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,170
Director Xu,

41
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:47,829
I think we will be in serious trouble if our business partner

42
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:49,710
finds out about this.

43
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,810
Working for me,

44
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,910
you have nothing to worry about.

45
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,730
Great undertakings require an unwavering will,

46
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:03,730
a great opportunity, and strong endurance.

47
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:07,610
In my eyes, anything that hasn't happened

48
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:08,909
is not a fact.

49
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:10,150
Is that clear?

50
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,790
Yes.

51
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,989
What conspiracy are you two brewing this time?

52
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:18,109
Older Brother.

53
00:03:18,109 --> 00:03:19,950
What brings you here?

54
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,870
You've barely come after we relocated here.

55
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,970
You pay no attention to our family business

56
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:28,030
but waste your time

57
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,310
on your puny little designing studios.

58
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,669
What's the point?

59
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:34,169
Whose family business?

60
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:35,990
Mine or yours?

61
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:40,670
Who knows if you will give the whole business to me or your godson.

62
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,770
Older Brother, you two carry on.

63
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,670
I should get going.

64
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:57,730
Thank you for your contribution to this family.

65
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,569
You're an adult.

66
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,609
Stop talking like a jealous brat.

67
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:08,470
Tell me what brings you here?

68
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,449
This person. Do you know him?

69
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,530
No.

70
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:22,410
I told you, this was the man who attacked me.

71
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:25,489
- Are you sure? 
 - Absolutely.

72
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,030
All right.

73
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:30,230
If you're sure, I'll send my men to investigate it.

74
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,410
Is that all?

75
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:56,269
My mother asked me to tell you she is coming back next month.

76
00:04:56,269 --> 00:04:59,090
She wants to know your schedules and see whether you need her

77
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:02,209
to attend some social occasions to put up an act or not.

78
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:05,209
If not, she will go straight to Hainan for a vacation.

79
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,810
How should I know about the future?

80
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,850
She can go wherever she wants for a holiday.

81
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,849
She asked you to deliver one message in person?

82
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:16,070
She could've just called.

83
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,590
She said she didn't want to talk to you.

84
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:21,830
She wouldn't let me call you either, insisted that I must come in person.

85
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:29,530
I think she wants you to come here as often as you can.

86
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:33,470
Your mother is... Even now,

87
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:36,929
all her little wit is spent on you and the company.

88
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,690
Silly.

89
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,450
I've brought you the message.

90
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,090
So long.

91
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:09,529
Why was he at the company?

92
00:06:09,529 --> 00:06:12,049
He gambled and lost again so he came asking for money.

93
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,090
But I sent him away.

94
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:17,529
Ran Ran took a photo of you being with him.

95
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:19,969
Don't be so sloppy next time.

96
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:23,670
At this rate, we'll run into trouble.

97
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,489
Figure something out.

98
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,190
Understood.

99
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:34,070
Well? Am I not efficient?

100
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:38,369
The person in the picture you sent me is called Chen Ao.

101
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:42,850
The driver who crashed your car was his twin brother.

102
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:47,710
The twins were both involved in robbery and burglary.

103
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:51,369
The older brother Chen Yun ran away after he hit your car.

104
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,009
But he was arrested soon.

105
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:57,050
He died from illness in prison soon afterward.

106
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:02,890
This means that Chen Ao has nothing to do with my accident.

107
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,150
It seems so.

108
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:09,450
I still need to collect more evidence.

109
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:13,410
This guy Chen Ao may not be involved in my accident,

110
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:16,810
but I can't let him harm Xu Chengran again.

111
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:21,050
Lawyer Huang, do you have Chen Ao's record?

112
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,369
    
 His record, address,

113
00:07:27,369 --> 00:07:30,190
    
 and even his current lifestyle are all here.

114
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,370
No one else must know.

115
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,130
Understood.

116
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:38,710
Well then. I should get going if there's nothing else.

117
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,430
By the way, Lawyer Huang,

118
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,570
how is the progress with the foundation?

119
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:49,090
There are some procedures to follow.

120
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:52,030
Be patient. I'll keep you posted.

121
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,810
Thank you.

122
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:16,430
- Good morning. 
 - Boss, why are you here?

123
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,210
I'm taking care of a patient today.

124
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:22,510
Did you drive here to pick me up?

125
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,049
I'm feeling much better already.

126
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,970
I can drive.

127
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,249
Are you sure?

128
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,790
Do you need another day off?

129
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:31,050
That's not necessary. I'm lively and full of spirit.

130
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,590
Do I look like a patient to you?

131
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,208
Not to mention you took a great risk for me.

132
00:08:35,209 --> 00:08:38,049
The more I think about it, the more I blame myself.

133
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,470
I barely slept last night.

134
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:42,670
Very well.

135
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,689
Let's go. Get in the car.

136
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:55,089
Did you have your breakfast? Let's go get something to drink.

137
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,690
Did I hear it right?

138
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:02,950
You told me a pleasant drink brings a good mood.

139
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,670
Let's go.

140
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,930
Your fruit tea.

141
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,609
I must apologize. The network is broken down.

142
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:14,689
We can't scan your code.

143
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,689
Could you please pay in cash?

144
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,150
Cash? I have some.

145
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,669
There you go.

146
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:25,050
♫  Like feeling the starts  ♫

147
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:27,909
Sorry. I'll have to give you coins for the change.

00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:32,170

151

I want to buy something from you.

162
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:07,509
Such as?

163
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:10,330
Your smile for today.

00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,550
Deal.

166
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:19,430
♫  The brilliant memory  ♫

167
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,609
What is it this time?

168
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:23,550
Your smile for tomorrow.

169
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,570
Deal.

170
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,810
The day after tomorrow.

171
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,350
♫  Colorful rays of light  ♫

172
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:40,110
♫  I can see everything  ♫

173
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,250
Your future smiles!

174
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:48,270
Yes! You should smile more!

175
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:50,190
I still have some coins.

176
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,909
You should smile more often, enough with a long face.

177
00:10:52,909 --> 00:10:54,850
See?

178
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:57,730
I carry all these coins only to purchase your smile.

179
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:01,050
♫  Chase recklessly, long live the young  ♫

180
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:06,390
♫  You are the most perfect when full of vitality  ♫

181
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:09,229
- Xiaoning, morning.
- Good morning. Good morning. Good morning.

182
00:11:09,229 --> 00:11:12,290
Xiaoning, I heard you were ill yesterday.

183
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:14,649
Why were you and Director Gu both absent yesterday?

184
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,449
I... It's nothing.

185
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,850
Don't worry. I'm alive and kicking.

186
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:19,969
Good morning, Sister Manlin.

187
00:11:19,969 --> 00:11:21,489
Are you sure you don't need more rest?

188
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,810
It's okay. I'm feeling very well.

189
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:26,409
Okay. I'll leave these to you.

190
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:39,230
    
 Xiaoning, I'm sorry for the other day.

191
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:43,370
    
 Could we talk?  I'm at the coffee shop downstairs.

192
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:00,310
Director Gu, I need your signature on this.

193
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,710
Okay.

194
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:10,330
You're in a good mood today.

195
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:13,510
Someone actually bought my smile.

196
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:17,950
Bought... your smile?

197
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:25,150
Sister Wenwen.

198
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:32,109
I've explained what happened that day to Gu Chuan.

199
00:12:32,109 --> 00:12:34,549
But all and all, I caused everything.

200
00:12:34,549 --> 00:12:35,770
I must apologize to you again.

201
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:38,209
It's fine, Sister Wenwen. It wasn't your fault.

202
00:12:38,209 --> 00:12:40,630
It was merely my bad luck.

203
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:45,169
A show of goodwill from me.

204
00:12:45,169 --> 00:12:47,449
Never mind. I said you don't have to apologize.

205
00:12:47,449 --> 00:12:49,850
There's no need to send me a gift.

206
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:52,030
It's not exactly a gift.

207
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:55,169
Consider it a souvenir.

208
00:12:55,169 --> 00:12:57,010
A souvenir?

209
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:06,730
This album contains some photos Gu Chuan took for National Geographic ten years ago.

210
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,249
There are also some photos from his younger days.

211
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,369
I don't think I should keep them.

212
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:15,630
I think you should have it.

213
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,989
   

214
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,929
   

215
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,009
He took all these photos?

216
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,450
I hope you can know more about his past.

217
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:30,809
I... Do I have the right?

218
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:34,830
Trust me, no one is more qualified than you are.

219
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,789
I'm leaving for Australia tomorrow.

220
00:13:38,789 --> 00:13:41,809
Many animals there are endangered because of the wildfire.

221
00:13:41,809 --> 00:13:44,169
I want to be there to capture their images.

222
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:48,550
It might not take long, but maybe it'll take quite a while.

223
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,929
Why are you leaving so suddenly?

224
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,109
What about the film festival? Are you giving up on that?

225
00:13:52,109 --> 00:13:56,489
I'm not giving up. When I'm back, you still need to handle the design for me.

226
00:13:56,489 --> 00:14:01,369
The best thing that has happened to me since I came back was meeting you.

227
00:14:01,369 --> 00:14:03,690
Thanks to you, I got to know Gu Chuan again.

228
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:08,850
So... Jiang Xiaoning, take care of him.

229
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:12,710
Sister Wenwen, are you leaving because of me?

230
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:16,210
Don't think so highly of yourself.

231
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:19,790
It was too sudden, so I overthink a little.

232
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:23,929
Gu Chuan is more of a stubborn person.

233
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:26,450
Once he makes a decision, no one can change his mind.

234
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:29,550
But I believe you're the only one that can change him.

235
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,009
You two have something in common.

236
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:33,529
You both have a passionate heart.

237
00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:35,989
I do hope you can be happy together.

238
00:14:35,989 --> 00:14:40,330
If you don't miss the chance, you won't have any regret.

239
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:42,409
I've already found my happiness.

240
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:43,889
Don't forget to work on yours.

241
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:46,450
Thank you, Sister Wenwen.

242
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:57,590
- Thank you. 
 - Enjoy your food.

243
00:14:57,629 --> 00:15:00,790
- We only ordered one can of wine. Please...
- Never mind.

244
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,869
It's not that strong. I can handle it.

245
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:05,009
Don't drink too much. Leave the rest to me.

246
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:06,750
Okay.

247
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:19,309
Boss, I thought you never liked having late-night meals.

248
00:15:19,309 --> 00:15:23,030
I have been feeling hungry at night lately.

249
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,669
The bill is on me to return your favor. Eat as much as you want.

250
00:15:25,669 --> 00:15:27,049
How generous of you.

251
00:15:27,049 --> 00:15:28,729
The food here is incredible.

252
00:15:28,729 --> 00:15:31,129
When I was working part-time, the happiest thing for me

253
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,070
was to eat as I could here on my payday.

254
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,050
The lady here is a great cook.

255
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:38,789
Her cooking is on par with Michelin-starred restaurants.

256
00:15:38,789 --> 00:15:41,069
I've never been to one anyway.

257
00:15:41,069 --> 00:15:43,749
But this restaurant is Michelin-starred to me.

258
00:15:43,749 --> 00:15:45,529
I'll give it three stars. No.

259
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:47,870
Five stars!

260
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,809
They don't give out so many stars.

261
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:52,230
You have a point.

262
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:57,430
Let me ask you something.

263
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:00,770
Are you always so optimistic?

264
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,389
I control my mind with my will.

265
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:07,829
Every day when I wake up, I brush my teeth with positivity;

266
00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:09,569
I finish my meals with positivity.

267
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,269
I work with positivity.

268
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:12,929
I even take showers with positivity.

269
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:14,969
I stack positivity endlessly.

270
00:16:14,969 --> 00:16:18,610
This practice will surely make you happy every day of your life.

271
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:22,450
What about when you're upset?

272
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:25,350
Do you force yourself to smile?

273
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,089
Not really.

274
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:30,230
Maybe I've gotten used to it.

275
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,589
I've always been very unlucky.

276
00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:36,869
I have had many unpleasant memories.

277
00:16:36,869 --> 00:16:41,829
After going through so much, I somehow coped with it.

278
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:45,269
Just as my auntie said, "Every day is a new day."

279
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:48,329
"There is no way for us to turn back time."

280
00:16:48,329 --> 00:16:51,730
When I think about it, I feel much better.

281
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:56,110
Having some wine here makes my life even more enjoyable.

282
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:58,290
Cheers.

283

 Honey, today is your birthday. 

286
00:17:13,268 --> 00:17:16,489
 Stand up, make a wish. Make a wish. 

287
00:17:16,489 --> 00:17:18,089
 Great! 

288
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:19,410
 Happy Birthday! 

289
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:21,610
 Great. 

290
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:24,169
Your birthday is around the corner.

291
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,069
How do you know?

292
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:31,450
I saw your ID card when I got you the boarding pass.

293
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,910
I see.

294
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:38,510
It's been a long time since I last celebrated my birthday.

295
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:40,350
Why?

296
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:44,949
It's just a date, another usual day.

297
00:17:44,949 --> 00:17:47,470
It's not different from other days.

298
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:51,929
What matters the most is to live happily every day.

299
00:17:51,929 --> 00:17:54,070
Do you agree?

300
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,190
You're right.

301
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:03,270
Well, I must try the food you treat me to.

302
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:17,550
 Are you home yet? 

303
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:24,870
   

304
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,950
   

305
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:38,090
Sir, you have a phone call.

306
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,769
Sorry, sir. Did it annoy you?
    

307
00:18:39,769 --> 00:18:42,569
It was my wife. I'll turn off the phone.

308
00:18:42,569 --> 00:18:44,230
It's all right.

309
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,770
Could it be an emergency at home?

310
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:47,769
Perhaps, you should call her back first.

311
00:18:47,769 --> 00:18:49,210
It's nothing serious.

312
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:52,970
Every night when she is going to bed, she will call me.

313
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:56,309
She's been doing that for seven years. I've gotten used to it.

314
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:00,250
You and your wife are very close.

315
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:04,110
I think so. People always joke about the "seven-year itch,"

316
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:07,810
but I think we are closer than we ever were.

317
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:10,170
Did you know? She is five years older than me.

318
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:13,109
I've never felt there's actually an age difference between us.

319
00:19:13,109 --> 00:19:18,529
Sometimes, she would get all clingy like a little girl. Isn't that interesting?

320
00:19:18,529 --> 00:19:21,370
Is that so?

321
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,190
It's just my opinion.

322
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:27,610
I think that to maintain a healthy relationship,

323
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:30,870
men should learn how to give.

324
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,549
We must learn to understand our partners.

325
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:36,690
If our girl is interested in anything,

326
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:39,549
we should try our best to present it to her

327
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:42,770
and let her know we care and that we're willing to give.

328
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:45,791
That's how we maintain a healthy relationship.

329
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:50,349
But surely there are times that we quarrel a little, but I do my best to cheer her up.

330
00:19:50,349 --> 00:19:54,590
When we were still dating, we fought sometimes.

331
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:58,269
My solution back then was to give her a kiss and try to cheer her up,

332
00:19:58,269 --> 00:20:00,650
or maybe give her a hug.

333
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:03,930
Do you know what the best solution is nowadays?

334
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:06,290
Clear out her shopping cart.

335
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:18,089
 I'm home. Boss, you paid behind my back again. 

336
00:20:18,089 --> 00:20:20,889
 So I still owe you a treat. 

337
00:20:20,889 --> 00:20:22,850
 All right. 

338
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:30,889
Sir, you can pull over for a while and answer the call from your wife.

339
00:20:30,889 --> 00:20:33,150
Don't worry. I don't want to take up your time.

340
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,949
It's fine. Answer the call first.

341
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:41,349
Okay. Thank you. I'll pull over.

342
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,150
   

343
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,670
 Ice-cream also wants Jiang Xiaoning 

344
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:40,969
 to spend her every waking moment happily. 

345
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:47,630
Jiang Xiaoning, why are you staying up so late?

346
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,470
Did you take a shower?

347
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,730
I'll go take a shower now.

348
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:53,169
Such a mess! Let me clean it for you.

349
00:21:53,169 --> 00:21:55,490
Don't put the scissors on your bed!

350
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:15,750
Brother. Sister-in-Law.

351
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,529
Xiaoning is all grown up now.

352
00:22:18,529 --> 00:22:20,910
She's become very sensible.

353
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:23,330
Don't you worry.

354
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,470
She is doing well.

355
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:32,110
But this young lady misses you so.

356
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,930
Is she here?

357
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,830
Your hair is a mess.

358
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:18,890
Iced Americano. Thanks.

359
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:20,790
Darling.

360
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:24,929
Darling?

361
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:27,250
Take another bite.

362
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:31,509
No. I'll get fat and you won't like me anymore.

363
00:23:31,509 --> 00:23:33,109
No way.

364
00:23:33,109 --> 00:23:38,390
No matter how you've become, you're the most beautiful lady to me.

365
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,510
Good girl.

366
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:43,990
Delicious.

367
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:47,030
Thanks.

368
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:53,429
Naughty! You and your fancy words!

369
00:23:53,429 --> 00:23:57,129
You're such a nice guy, not to mention you're rich and handsome.

370
00:23:57,130 --> 00:24:00,850
How can I ever leave you?

371
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:04,409
If any woman is foolish enough to ditch you,

372
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:07,769
she must be blind as a bat!

373
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:09,630
You're correct.

374
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:13,390
But not every woman is as brilliant as you.

375
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:17,769
Someone simply doesn't know how to cherish my love.

376
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:19,950
Is this fun, Xu Chengran?

377
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:24,470
I'm dating. Of course, it's fun.

378
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:26,049
Sorry, you wouldn't understand.

379
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:28,030
I don't care if you're dating.

380
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:30,049
But mind your manners. Keep it down.

381
00:24:30,049 --> 00:24:31,830
You're repelling the other customers here.

382
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:34,690
Who's the repulsive one here?

383
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:39,149
Ran Ran! Some single lady is jealous of our love.

384
00:24:39,149 --> 00:24:42,990
Let's go somewhere else.

385
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:46,210
We... should stay.

386
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:49,229
We don't have to hide from her. We'll stay.

387
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,330
Drop the act.

388
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,750
Miss, do you study performance art?

389
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:02,090
We're not acting.

390
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,510
Darling, give me a kiss.

391
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:05,310
Muah!

392
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:09,610
That's all?

393
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:11,689
Fine.

394
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:13,590
Ran Ran.

395
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,320
 What? 

396
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:50,830
How dare you kiss my boyfriend?

397
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:54,610
You study performance art, right?

398
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:56,810
That was a demonstration.

399
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,089
Carry on.

400
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:03,310
Fine! We'll carry...

401
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:06,670
on.

402
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:12,590
Let's save it for another day. That's all for now.

403
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:14,910
I don't... I don't want her to hurt you.

404
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:16,830
I'm not afraid of it.

405
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,710
I can handle this woman.

406
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:21,710
Go on.

407
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,750
I'll leave you be then.

408
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:27,450
Be cautious when you're out there.

409
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:30,409
Got it. Bye.

410
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:34,150
I wasn't acting!

411
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:43,590
Put on a play if you want, but don't drag the girl into it.

412
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:47,430
Who said we were acting?

413
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:49,009
Do you take me as a fool?

414
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:50,310
Even a little kid could tell.

415
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:53,070
A little kid can't have a date.

416
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:59,809
- Hello. 
  - The chairman passed out. 

417
00:26:59,809 --> 00:27:02,590
 He's in the hospital. Come here now! 

418
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:05,669
The hospital? All right, I'll be right there.

419
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:07,769
What is it?

420
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:10,449
My father passed out. He's in the hospital.

421
00:27:10,449 --> 00:27:13,129
- I can drive you there. 
 - Thanks.

422
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,950
How is my father?

423
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:26,729
He pulled through. He's getting some rest.

424
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:30,450
What happened?

425
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:31,649
It was in a project negotiation.

426
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,569
We agreed he wouldn't be drinking.

427
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:36,030
But Director Xu drank too much.

428
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,210
Then he passed out on the table.

429
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:39,550
What were you doing?

430
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:40,969
Why didn't you stop him?

431
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:43,430
I tried but I couldn't.

432
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:46,770
You couldn't? Didn't you know what your job was?

433
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:48,230
Didn't you know he couldn't take it with his health conditions?

434
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:50,030
Get lost!

435
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:53,630
We're in a hospital, calm down.

436
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:22,310
Drink!

437
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:24,050
Keep on drinking!

438
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:26,230
You were always lecturing me,

439
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:29,190
but you can't even look after yourself.

440
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:52,470
If you fail again, hand in your resignation.

441
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:09,410
So Director Xu is your father.

442
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,610
Why didn't you tell me?

443
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:18,670
This isn't something to be proud of.

444
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:21,549
You obviously care about him. Why didn't you stay to keep him company just now?

445
00:29:21,549 --> 00:29:23,849
Maybe you should just move back to your home.

446
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:27,329
Who cares about the old man? I don't care what becomes of him.

447
00:29:27,329 --> 00:29:29,670
You've shown all your love back there.

448
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:31,650
What did I do?

449
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:32,950
You're frustrated when you care!

450
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:35,530
I'm not.

451
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:39,669
Whatever. Trust me, that is a hospital.

452
00:29:39,669 --> 00:29:42,329
Mind your manners when you're there.

453
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:46,270
Agitation can be bad for patients.

454
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:50,150
Even if he wasn't a patient, it wasn't right to talk to him that way.

455
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:54,370
Fine. I got it.

456
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:58,650
He will be fine.

457
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:08,950
Boss, Sister Qihong needs your signature.

458
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:17,409
Boss, I need to answer the call.

459
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:21,550
Hello, Auntie.

460
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,469
 Xiaoning, Grandma... 

461
00:30:23,469 --> 00:30:25,489
Grandma is missing! She went missing again!

462
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,830
 I've searched everywhere for her! 

463
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:31,310
Auntie, calm down. I'll be right back.

464
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:33,969
 Calm down. Wait for me. 

465
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:46,510
Don't worry. We will find your grandmother.

466
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:02,449
Chuan, Xiaoning's grandmother went missing.

467
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:04,350
Help us look for her.

468
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:08,189
All right. I'm with Zhao Yan. We'll go together.

469
00:31:08,189 --> 00:31:10,149
- What's wrong? 
 - Xiaoning's grandmother went missing.

470
00:31:10,149 --> 00:31:11,970
Let's go there and help.

471
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:31,069
Hello. Have you seen an old lady this tall?

472
00:31:31,069 --> 00:31:32,910
Grandma!

473
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:38,650
I'll look over there.

474
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:47,070
Anything?

475
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:50,309
We've contacted the police station.

476
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:53,150
They will inform us if there are any updates.

477
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:54,409
Thanks.

478
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:56,369
Where could she be?

479
00:31:56,369 --> 00:31:58,489
She doesn't have strong legs. Right?

480
00:31:58,489 --> 00:32:01,389
Well... She couldn't have gone too far. Right?

481
00:32:01,389 --> 00:32:03,309
Don't worry, Auntie. Don't worry.

482
00:32:03,309 --> 00:32:08,190
But the old lady is out there all alone. What if something bad happens to her?

483
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:10,569
Don't worry. Take a rest.

484
00:32:10,569 --> 00:32:12,450
Thank you.

485
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:16,090
What is this?

486
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:21,529
Your parents' photo is gone.

487
00:32:21,529 --> 00:32:24,130
I put it in this frame, didn't I?

488
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:29,809
When I was making lunch, someone delivered us some daisies and placed them here.

489
00:32:29,809 --> 00:32:31,610
Those are gone, too.

490
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:34,249
Grandma is at the cemetery. She must be at the cemetery.

491
00:32:34,249 --> 00:32:36,109
Let's look for her there.

492
00:32:36,109 --> 00:32:38,189
Someone must stay here. What if she comes back?

493
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:39,769
I'll stay with Auntie.

494
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:41,909
No. I must go. I must find her.

495
00:32:41,909 --> 00:32:44,030
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

496
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:45,069
- Are you sure? 
 - Okay.

497
00:32:45,069 --> 00:32:48,329
I'll keep you company. Well, Xu Chengran can check with the police station again.

498
00:32:48,329 --> 00:32:50,529
Please. Go on.

499
00:32:50,529 --> 00:32:52,029
Auntie, I'll go with Xiaoning.

500
00:32:52,029 --> 00:32:53,649
- Are you sure? 
 - We can handle it.

501
00:32:53,649 --> 00:32:55,989
- Gu Chuan, take care of her. 
 - Sure.

502
00:32:55,989 --> 00:32:58,409
Auntie, don't worry. They will find her.

503
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:00,590
Get some rest.

504
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:23,190
Grandma.

505
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:25,149
Grandma, you scared me.

506
00:33:25,149 --> 00:33:28,090
I was so worried I couldn't find you.

507
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:30,910
I...

508
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:33,290
I miss them

509
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:36,230
so I came by myself.

510
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:44,069
Grandma, it's a two-hour trip.

511
00:33:44,069 --> 00:33:46,770
How did you get here?

512
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:54,170
I've been keeping this photo.

513
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:58,270
I know I'm forgetful.

514
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:02,650
So I wrote the address on the back. 
    

515
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:07,170
With this, I'll always remember.

516
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,949
I'm sorry, Xiaoning.

517
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:12,409
I'm sorry that I made you worry.

518
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:13,710
It's all right, Grandma.

519
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:17,110
I don't blame you. This isn't your fault.

520
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:22,790
I miss them.

521
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:28,730
I'm worried that one day I might forget them.

522
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,510
All right, Grandma.

523
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,410
All right.

524
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,410
Xiaoning.

525
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:24,170
Grandma.

526
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:26,210
Guang Da.

527
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:30,449
Stay a few days longer this time.

528
00:35:30,449 --> 00:35:33,270
Don't always stay at the construction site.

529
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:43,670
Your wife, why isn't she back with you?

530
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:46,969
I'm here!

531
00:35:46,969 --> 00:35:49,450
My signature dish, Dapanji, is here.

532
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:51,170
It's not spicy.

533
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:54,210
Xiaoning's Dapanji is super delicious.

534
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:56,210
You're lucky today.

535
00:35:56,210 --> 00:36:01,230
Guang Da. See? Xiaoning is already a young lady!

536
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:06,129
Grandma! He is my boss, not your son nor my father.

537
00:36:06,129 --> 00:36:10,650
If we were to be related, he would be my martial uncle.

538
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:17,589
Grandma, who do you think I am?

539
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:27,290
Xiaoning, trust me, no puppy love.

540
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:30,790
The school doesn't allow that, okay?

541
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:36,049
Grandma, he is Sister Yan Yan's boyfriend, not mine.

542
00:36:36,049 --> 00:36:38,789
Don't be silly. He is not my boyfriend.

543
00:36:38,789 --> 00:36:41,810
He's more like a baron's foolish son.

544
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:45,689
Good. That is good.

545
00:36:45,689 --> 00:36:51,290
Guang Da, Xiaoning is a good girl. She is so nice.

546
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:55,960
Yes. Xiaoning is the best daughter in this world.

547
00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:01,660
Here comes the last dish, fish filets in hot chili oil.

548
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:05,099
Guang Da, your wife is such an incredible cook!

549
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:08,750
Mother, stop fooling around. Give me a break.

550
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:12,069
Auntie, this is too much food for us. We don't really need a feast.

551
00:37:12,069 --> 00:37:13,869
That won't do.

552
00:37:13,869 --> 00:37:17,929
See? After Xiaoning met friends like you, she's been so happy. I'm glad for her.

553
00:37:17,929 --> 00:37:19,769
And thank you for helping us today.

554
00:37:19,769 --> 00:37:22,449
Grandma is finally found. Happy! Come on.

555
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:24,769
Let's have a toast to Auntie's feast.

556
00:37:24,769 --> 00:37:26,409
- Thank you, Auntie. 
 - Stop!

557
00:37:26,409 --> 00:37:28,609
I just remembered that I forgot something.

558
00:37:28,609 --> 00:37:31,470
I haven't bought it for ten years.

559
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:40,230
Today is Xiaoning's birthday.

560
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:51,790
Ning Ning, I understand. You feel upset whenever it's your birthday.

561
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:56,350
But you must stop dwelling on the accident from ten years ago.

562
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:59,230
Be grateful.

563
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:01,249
It was a miracle that you survived.

564
00:38:01,249 --> 00:38:04,950
Grandma and I got to see you grow up.

565
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:12,650
By the way, it's been years since your parents' passing.

566
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:14,710
Learn to move on.

567
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:19,549
I think that your life should have a new start.

568
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:21,250
Right?

569
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,950
Come, Xiaoning.

570
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:25,610
Happy Birthday.

571
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:26,650
Thank you.

572
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:27,890
Happy Birthday, Xiaoning.

573
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:29,890
Thank you.

574
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:32,370
Happy Birthday to my dear Xiaoning.

575
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:33,189
Thank you, Grandma.

576
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:34,630
Don't forget about me.

577
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:37,589
My sweet Xiaoning. Happy Birthday.

578
00:38:37,589 --> 00:38:38,770
Happy Birthday.

579
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:40,470
Thank you.

580
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:44,709
Auntie, do you have a lighter?

581
00:38:44,709 --> 00:38:47,589
Sure. I got it ready.

582
00:38:47,589 --> 00:38:50,350
Do the honor.

583
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,509
See?

584
00:38:52,509 --> 00:38:55,649
I was so thoughtful not to show your age by the number of the candles.

585
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:01,330
Make a wish.

586
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:18,529
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ 
 ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

587
00:39:18,529 --> 00:39:26,430
♪  Always stay happy  ♪

588
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:31,050
Come on. Blow the candles.

589
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:50,090

00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:59,789
