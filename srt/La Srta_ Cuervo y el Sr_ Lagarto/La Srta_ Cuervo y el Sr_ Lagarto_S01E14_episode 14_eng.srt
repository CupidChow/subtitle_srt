2
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:18,899
♫  I can't help but feel a little happy  ♫

3
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,480
♫  I can't help but feel a little nervous  ♫

4
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,879
♫  The earth is turning because of you  ♫

5
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:28,279
♫  Without you, the earth stops  ♫

6
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:35,020
♫  You are the rainbow that fills up the black and white  ♫

7
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:39,939
♫  I was once obsessed with the legend of the four-leaf clover  ♫

8
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:44,539
♫  I dreamed of a white-horse carriage and 
you becoming my prince  ♫

9
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:48,739
♫  Your gaze is too seducing, please save me  ♫

10
00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:53,380
♫  I'm turning into a moth, flying towards the fire  ♫

11
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:58,039
♫  Your smile is dancing on your lips  ♫

12
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:02,619
♫  Am I the happiness you're looking for?  ♫

13
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:07,260
♫  The doe inside me is lost  ♫

14
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:15,059
♫  Holding your hand, let's count down to happiness  ♫

15
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,580
♫  I can't help but be a little fragile  ♫

16
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:24,219
♫  I can't help but feel a little gloomy  ♫

17
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:26,579
♫  The sky is bright because of you  ♫

18
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:28,899
♫  Without you, the sky is grey  ♫

19
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:33,440
♫  You are the angel who takes away all loneliness  ♫

20
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,960
   

21
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:41,060
   

22
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,800
Boss.

23
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,820
Gu Chuan.

24
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,479
You know each other?

25
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,420
Come to my office.

26
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,939
Stop standing there. Get back to your work.

27
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:34,420
Yes.

28
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,640
I never thought this would be your company.

29
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,600
I never thought the photographer she mentioned was you.

30
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:02,040
Well? Is everything all right?

31
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,980
Yes.

32
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,040
And your heart condition?

33
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,660
I'm fine now.

34
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,900
I'm glad to hear that.

35
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,439
I never expected to meet under these circumstances.

36
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,940
I don't really know what to say.

37
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,860
Gu Chuan.

38
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,120
Do you resent me?

39
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,940
   

40
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,899
When I got to the hospital, you were in critical condition. 
    

41
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,300
 You must be Wenwen. 

42
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:09,759
♫   My eyes are tearing up   ♫

43
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:14,659
♫   I have so much to tell   ♫

44
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:17,759
 Whenever I went to the hospital, 

45
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,799
you refused to see me.

46
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,639
Auntie told me to give up all hope on you.

47
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,899
 Child, you should go home. 

48
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:29,820
 Xiao Chuan still needs a long time to recover. 

49
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,539
 According to the doctor, even if he recovers, 

50
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:35,120
 he will not have a normal life. 

51
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,559
 You are only 20 years old. 

52
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,499
 There is still a long journey ahead for a young lady like you. 

53
00:04:39,499 --> 00:04:42,200
 You will meet someone better. 

54
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:48,600
 Auntie, I still want to see him again. 

55
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,579
 Don't you understand? 

56
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:53,420
 Xiao Chuan is too prideful. 

57
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,720
 He will never see you again. 

58
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:02,920
♫   Transit when the weight is enough to resist   ♫

59
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,380
♫  The lively boy passes by in the car  ♫

60
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:13,200
♫  The belief when we made our promise  ♫

61
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:18,219
 If you decide to give up, 

62
00:05:18,219 --> 00:05:21,320
 at least give me a proper farewell. 

63
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,380
 I'm ready for your answer. 

64
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,079
 I won't force you, 

65
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,120
 and I don't want to be unjust to myself either. 

66
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,279
 But my life must go on. 

67
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:46,830
 Since, you're unable to say goodbye, 

68
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,080
 then I'll say it. 

69
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,679
 We met during a wonderful time. 

70
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,760
 But we never got the happy ending. 

71
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,960
 I wish both of us to be able to find the one we love. 

72
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,160
 Forget me. 

73
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,090
 Just pretend I was never in your life. 

74
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:17,140
♫   The silent youth with his head bowed all the way   ♫

75
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:22,160
♫  Tomorrow will have the answer  ♫

76
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:28,160
♫  The case will be full of memories  ♫

77
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,759
♫  The meaning will withstand the passage of time  ♫

78
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,940
 I once thought about staying. 

79
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,719
 I would wait no matter how long 

80
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,100
 it would take for you to recover. 

81
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:42,379
 But you refused to open up to me, to see me. 

82
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,680
 In the end, 

83
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,860
 I received the admission notice, 

84
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,380
 so I went abroad. 

85
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:59,660
♫  We'll meet again if there is no farewell  ♫

86
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:04,659
♫  I'll stay here, waiting for you  ♫

87
00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:06,820
Will you resent me...

88
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:10,160
for giving up on you and leaving you?

89
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,600
I've never resented you.

90
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,340
You made the right decision.

91
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,380
You were only 20 years old.

92
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,560
There was no need to stay for anyone.

93
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,640
Besides, you didn't leave without a word.

94
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,900
You did send me the message.

95
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,280
Since you said that, it's a relief.

96
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,200
It's all water under the bridge.

97
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,760
If you feel uncomfortable, I can work with another company.

98
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,599
You don't have to think too much.

99
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,739
I'm not in charge of your project.

100
00:07:50,739 --> 00:07:53,520
If you ever run into any issue, feel free

101
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,830
to ask Jiang Xiaoning or Su Manlin for help.

102
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,460
Do I get a discount?

103
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,700
Of course.

104
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,260
Sister Wenwen, is everything settled?

105
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,239
By the way, do you remember what I told you the other day?

106
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,340
What was it?

107
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,820
Be brave.

108
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,860
You've chosen the right person.

109
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,859
Sure.

110
00:08:29,859 --> 00:08:31,660
Miss Chen,

111
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,619
allow me to treat you to dinner.

112
00:08:33,619 --> 00:08:36,839
We can discuss the design over the meal.

113
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,420
Okay.

114
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,220
Miss Chen, please.

115
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,800
I'll just cut to the chase.

116
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,440
You must be Director Gu's ex-girlfriend.

117
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,760
His first love?

118
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,540
Did you ask me out to dig some gossip up on me?

119
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:07,639
Back in the office, Gu Chuan looked at you in a very different way.

120
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,520
I had guessed who you were.

121
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,400
Are you worried?

122
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,940
About what?

123
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:17,700
That the spark would be reignited between us.

124
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,939
Not at all. I'm just curious.

125
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,479
I've been working for Director Gu since I graduated.

126
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,199
I started as his assistant.

127
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,719
It's been six to seven years.

128
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,879
He was never in love over this time.

129
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,900
All I know is that he had a girlfriend.

130
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,140
He never got into a relationship again.

131
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:42,020
I thought he got hurt too deeply by that relationship.

132
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,880
But judging by your interaction,

133
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,470
you two seemed more like two long-lost friends.

134
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,660
Maybe we're not even friends.

135
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,580
But I must admit.

136
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:02,240
He did have good taste back then.

137
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,740
You don't need to flatter me.

138
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,920
This does not match your incisive talking style.

139
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,759
I'll get to the point then.

140
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:17,420
I can tell you like Gu Chuan.

141
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,040
But he will never choose you.

142
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,559
How can you be certain?

143
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,960
Because I know him better.

144
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,120
It was over ten years ago.

145
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,839
How do you know it was ten years ago?

146
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,880
Were you eavesdropping?

147
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,279
From my understanding, Gu Chuan will never be in love with

148
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,400
someone who is overbearing and wily.

149
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,800
I would choose Jiang Xiaoning if I were him.

150
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,280
Don't eat too much.

151
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,260
It might be bad for your health.

152
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,399
 Remember what I told you the other day? 

153
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,780
 What was it? 

154
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,280
 Be brave. 

155
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,100
 You've chosen the right person. 

156
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,740
Jiang Xiaoning,

157
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,180
why are you being absent-minded again?

158
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,559
I'm not.

159
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,920
I was thinking about work.

160
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,039
 I'll get to the point then. 

161
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,700
 I can tell you like Gu Chuan. 

162
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,079
 But he will never choose you. 

163
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,879
 From my understanding, 

164
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,439
 Gu Chuan will never be in love with 

165
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,080
 someone who is overbearing and wily. 

166
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,420
 I would choose Jiang Xiaoning if I were him. 

167
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,640
Jiang Xiaoning,

168
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,500
is something bothering you?

169
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,260
Actually, it's something good.

170
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,440
However...

171
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,720
What is it?

172
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,920
I'm not ready to tell you yet.

173
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,220
I'll tell you another time.

174
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,360
Okay. You should go to bed early.

175
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,240
Boss.

176
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,940
What is it?

177
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,259
 Jiang Xiaoning, didn't you said that you'd be brave? 

178
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,680
The truth is...

179
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,180
I...

180
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,659
Boss, I need to answer this call.

181
00:13:34,659 --> 00:13:36,620
Please give me a second.

182
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,880
 Jiang Xiaoning, 

183
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,599
 you must be thinking this new friend of yours can help you out 

184
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,399
and bring the company more projects.

185
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,960
I bet you're overjoyed.

186
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,060
I don't understand what you're saying.

187
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,820
 You're shooting yourself in the foot. 

188
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,820
What? I don't get it.

189
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,820
Think about it.

190
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:05,159
She just happened to appear by the lake and took a photo of you.

191
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,059
 She just happened to hold a photography exhibition, asking you to be her designer. 

192
00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:10,300
 So many coincidences. 

193
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:15,340
That's only because she just happened to be Director Gu's ex-girlfriend.

194
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,760
 She was willing to get close to you and become your friend. 

195
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,880
 You must be thinking she is a friend who understands you. 

196
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,480
 Jiang Xiaoning, 

197
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,260
 she is using you and you haven't realized it yet. 

198
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,439
 Try to recall. 

199
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,359
 Her qualification and erudition, 

200
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,159
 her social class and the way she talks, even her past with Director Gu. 

201
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,840
 You're beneath her in every aspect. 

202
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,059
 Jiang Xiaoning, 

203
00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:42,839
 you're so naive. 

204
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:47,620
You're the powder keg to reignite their love, do you get it now?

205
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,880
 It's time to wake up, Jiang Xiaoning. 

206
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,620
Jiang Xiaoning.

207
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,680
What's wrong with you?

208
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,820
It's nothing, Boss.

209
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,020
Auntie?

210
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,719
I'll be right back.

211
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,840
I'll bring you some late-night snacks.

212
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,820
What were you trying to say?

213
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,360
It was nothing, Boss.

214
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,740
I have to go now.

215
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,000
Goodbye, Boss.

216
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,439
What's wrong?

217
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,999
Did someone bully you?

218
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,559
It's nothing, Sister Yan Yan.

219
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,999
I don't want to talk about it.

220
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,019
I'll go home after a while.

221
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:03,019
It's all right. You don't have to tell me.

222
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:05,480
You can stay as long as you want.

223
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,399
♫  Destiny is a little annoying  ♫

224
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,379
♫  It takes those I care about  ♫

225
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:23,140
♫  Away from me  ♫

226
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,979
♫  If memory is bright  ♫

227
00:16:24,979 --> 00:16:28,000
♫  It would hold up a lamp in my heart  ♫

228
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,660
♫  And light up the night  ♫

229
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,760
 What were you trying to say? 

230
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,420
 Nothing, Boss. 

231
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,980
 I have to go now. 

232
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,240
 Goodbye, Boss. 

233
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,560
Charging.

234
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,159
 Say nothing. 

235
00:17:36,159 --> 00:17:37,399
 It's in the bottle. 

236
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,720
 It's inside of me. 

237
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,159
 Say nothing. 

238
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,399
 It's in the bottle. 

239
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,620
 It's inside of me. 

240
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,839
What's wrong, Sister Yan Yan?

241
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,080
Have I been sleeping for a long time?

242
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,079
Something is wrong with Xu Chengran.

243
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,459
What's wrong with him?

244
00:18:08,459 --> 00:18:10,620
Check his Moments.

245
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,159
Nothing special. Just a post.

246
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,319
He seems happy.

247
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,920
Let me see it.

248
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:23,100
   

249
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,399
Do you know where he lives?

250
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,960
Huayi Hotel, Room 3909.

251
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,980
I'm going out.

252
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,560
- Where are you going? 
 - I'll be right back.

253
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,380
Director Xu, I... I'll get help!

254
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,999
No!  Don't get help!

255
00:19:42,999 --> 00:19:44,580
You got it all wrong!

256
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,639
Hold on! Stop!

257
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,660
You got it all wrong!

258
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,019
Don't get help!

259
00:19:50,019 --> 00:19:51,079
Don't...

260
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,199
Come back here. I don't need help!

261
00:19:52,199 --> 00:19:53,900
Xu Chengran.

262
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,640
Xu Chengran!

263
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,799
Sorry. Sorry for the trouble.

264
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:09,680
Have a nice day.

265
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,800
Yan Yan.

266
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,919
Yan Yan, I... It was just a joke.

267
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,140
Please don't be mad.

268
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,560
Don't use violence! The door is still open.

269
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,799
They haven't gone far. It was embarrassing enough just now.

270
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,360
Don't make the situation even worse.

271
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,920
So you know it's embarrassing.

272
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,639
You know it's embarrassing?

273
00:20:47,639 --> 00:20:49,980
You're embarrassing!

274
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,140
It's not that bad.

275
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,079
Xu Chengran,

276
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,679
how can you be so disgusting?

277
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,080
You're the worst!

278
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,700
No. I was just trying to... ease the tension.

279
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,300
Fine.

280
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,319
Yan Yan! You've already seen everything about me.

281
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,639
You can't just leave me.

282
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,580
You must be responsible for my life.

283
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:18,319
Xu Chengran, drop the act.

284
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,061
You should be an actor since you have nothing to do. Back off!

285
00:21:20,061 --> 00:21:22,820
No! It's not about my act. You care about me.

286
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,219
I do hold a place in your heart. Right?

287
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,499
Do you know The Boy Who Cried Wolf?

288
00:21:29,499 --> 00:21:30,519
I'm telling you.

289
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,079
I won't fall for your trick again!

290
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,319
Back off!

291
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,140
Yan Yan!

292
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,520
Yan Yan, sorry!

293
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,279
- Stand up! 
 - No.

294
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,479
There are security cameras here.

295
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,839
Don't you embarrass me again!

296
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,200
- I will kneel forever if you don't forgive me. 
 - Stand up.

297
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,100
- No. 
 - Fine.

298
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,799
Yan Yan! Yan Yan!

299
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,221
Yan Yan, open up!

300
00:21:51,221 --> 00:21:54,040
Yan Yan! It will be embarrassing if someone sees me in the corridor!

301
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,000
Yan Yan? Yan Yan?

302
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,880
Hello, Sir. Do you need help?

303
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,580
I lost my contact lens. I'm looking for it.

304
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,639
- I'll help you. 
 - Never mind. Forget it.

305
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,580
Carry on with your work.

306
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,560
- Very well. 
 - Goodbye.

307
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:13,620
Yan Yan, I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

308
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,739
- Let go of me! 
 - No way.

309
00:22:15,739 --> 00:22:17,920
Don't lock me out.

310
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,160
Yan Yan!

311
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,460
Yan Yan...

312
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,820
Yan Yan!

313
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,360
Yan Yan, I'm sorry!

314
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,720
Yan Yan...

315
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,880
Please let me in, Yan Yan.

316
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,580
I...

317
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,740
Jiang Xiaoning.

318
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,760
Why are you coming home late?

319
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,460
Stop right there!

320
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,699
Are you ignoring your own aunt now?

321
00:23:18,699 --> 00:23:21,920
Are you too mature to talk to your aunt now?

322
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,520
What's wrong?

323
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,360
What happened?

324
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,080
Why did you cry?

325
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,039
No.

326
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,260
It's nothing.

327
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,520
Jiang Xiaoning, you've never lied to me.

328
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,981
Tell me. Who is bullying you?

329
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:37,960
Who is bullying you? I'll make them pay.

330
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,340
I'm smart. No one dares to bully me.

331
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,979
Why were you crying? Come on, tell me.

332
00:23:43,979 --> 00:23:46,560
Don't make me worry.

333
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,020
- What's wrong? 
 - Auntie.

334
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,980
I...

335
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,599
- Don't scold me when I tell you. 
 - I promise you I won't.

336
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,340
I won't scold you.

337
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,760
I'm heartbroken.

338
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,100
When were you in a relationship?

339
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:09,600
It ended before it even began.

340
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,440
He was my...

341
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,079
I admire him.

342
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,720
I realized I didn't deserve him at all.

343
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,360
So it was your idol. Right?

344
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,799
I thought it was much more serious.

345
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,099
Young lady, listen to me.

346
00:24:22,099 --> 00:24:23,539
Don't get carried away.

347
00:24:23,539 --> 00:24:25,019
Live in reality.

348
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:27,719
It's time to abandon your wishful fantasies.

349
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,020
Okay?

350
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,759
Tell me. What kind of actors do you like?

351
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,640
Andy Lau.

352
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,740
Jiang Xiaoning.

353
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,240
Come here.

354
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,599
Do you know who Andy Lau is?

355
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,480
Whether it's the distance or the age, you two...

356
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,520
There is a gap you can't cross.

357
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,959
Trust me. It will never work out.

358
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,840
From now on, Andy Lau is only...

359
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,640
your uncle!

360
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,819
Yes, Auntie.

361
00:25:01,819 --> 00:25:02,999
Don't call me that.

362
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I'm Mrs. Lau.

363
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,500
Mrs. Lau wants to watch TV.

364
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,500
Go get a shower. Don't bother me.

365
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,520
Yes, Mrs. Lau. Rest well.

366
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,440
You too. Don't stay up too late.

367
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,140
 Remember who you are. 

368
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,120
 The work comes first. 

369
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,919
 You can't be in love with him anymore. 

370
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,120
 But you can't lose the job. 

371
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,460
 Keep it up! 

372
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,739
 She was willing to get close to you and become your friend. 

373
00:25:56,739 --> 00:25:59,159
 You think she is a friend who understands you? 

374
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,479
 She is using you 

375
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,520
 and you haven't realized it yet. 

376
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,099
 Her qualification and erudition, 

377
00:26:04,099 --> 00:26:05,679
 her social class and the way she talks, 

378
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,799
 even her past with Director Gu. 

379
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,300
 You're beneath her in every aspect. 

380
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,200
Good morning, Boss.

381
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,500
What's wrong?

382
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,100
Nothing.

383
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,440
Jiang Xiaoning.

384
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,860
You seem a little off lately.

385
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,759
Not at all, Boss.

386
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,599
If you think I'm doing anything wrong, feel free to criticize me.

387
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,500
I can be better.

388
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,080
That's the oddest thing I've heard from you.

389
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,640
Is something bothering you?

390
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,199
I'm always so carefree.

391
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:16,480
What could possibly bother me?

392
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,699
Director Gu, this is your schedule for this week.

393
00:28:14,699 --> 00:28:17,599
The progress chart is synced up with the design team.

394
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,199
I've gathered the slides and sent them to your email already.

395
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,480
And this is the expense claim.

396
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,299
These are all Jiang Xiaoning's jobs.

397
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:31,519
Why are you in charge now?

398
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,759
She is not feeling well.

399
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,480
So I brought the files here to have them signed.

400
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,300
She's not feeling well?

401
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:40,359
By the way, it's Brother Kai's birthday tonight.

402
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:42,220
We want to give him a surprise.

403
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,240
We would appreciate it if you could join us.

404
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,880
Sure.

405
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,959
Invite everyone. The dinner is on me.

406
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,239
Invite everyone in the office.

407
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,840
Yes!

408
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:58,820
- What did the boss say? 
 - Invite everyone.

409
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,420
No one should be left behind. He's treating us to dinner.

410
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,020
For real? I'll make a reservation.

411
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,059
- I'll order a cake. 
 - All right.

412
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:04,239
Use my phone number. I have a membership.

413
00:29:04,239 --> 00:29:06,920
- Okay. 
 - Smart.

414
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,579
   

415
00:29:23,579 --> 00:29:25,060
How is the wine?

416
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,039
 Not bad. 

417
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,119
 It's a little sweet. 

418
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,040
 A little sweet. 

419
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,079
You've been eating the whole time without saying a word.

420
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,479
Are you a hungry ghost or what?

421
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,319
No.

422
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,620
The food is fantastic.

423
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,839
You want some wine?

424
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,240
Just drink if you want to.

425
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,160
Director Gu, Xiaoning wants to have some wine.

426
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,999
You're not going to stop her, right?

427
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,540
That's right, Boss.

428
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,980
Let her have some tonight.

429
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,119
It's a celebration.

430
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,360
I'll call a designated driver for you.

431
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,379
It's a gathering. Make an exception.

432
00:30:01,379 --> 00:30:03,060
Give her a night off.

433
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,540
- Director Gu, let her drink a little. 
 - That's right.  Come on.

434
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,519
- It's just a little. 
 - Just a little. Just a little.

435
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,560
Everyone is having fun tonight.

436
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,720
All right. Don't drink too much.

437
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,739
- Cheers. 
 -  Cheers.

438
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,560
It's sweet and sour. Tastes good.

439
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,859
I think that's enough.

440
00:30:39,859 --> 00:30:41,279
Let's play some games.

441
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,199
- Prepare the stuff. 
 - Okay.

442
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,979
Come on, the usual rules.

443
00:30:44,979 --> 00:30:47,279
Truth Or Dare.

444
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,700
Sit down.

445
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,359
- The bottle is ready. 
 - Okay.

446
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,439
Xiaoning, must be your first time?

447
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,200
I'll explain the rules to you.

448
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,439
We spin the bottle.

449
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,079
Whoever the bottle points to must accept the command.

450
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:01,240
And then whatever command I draw, they must accept it.

451
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:06,679
- Xiaoning. 
 - Let's see what the command is.

452
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:10,959
Confess your love to the second person on your right!

453
00:31:10,959 --> 00:31:12,759
One, two, Cheng Dong, that's you.

454
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,220
That means you.

455
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:17,479
Well... you need to be more specific.

456
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,979
When you're counting the second one, do you count Xiaoning as well?

457
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:22,080
Not to mention she just got here.

458
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,799
- It's you. 
 - You're scaring her.

459
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,239
It's just a game.

460
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,559
You can't break the rules.

461
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,840
Don't twist the rules.

462
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,959
This doesn't count.

463
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,839
The rules weren't clear. Again.

464
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,959
No way.

465
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,940
I think Xiaoning is the chosen one.

466
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,880
I'll drink.

467
00:31:40,201 --> 00:31:41,640
She can hold her bottle! Impressive.

468
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,079
- Sister Hong, it's your turn. 
 - Okay.

469
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,059
- Sister Hong. 
 - Your turn.

470
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,319
Xiaoning, it's you again.

471
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,479
You sure are lucky.

472
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,919
You should buy a lottery ticket.

473
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,960
I'll draw the card.

474
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,279
It's Truth.

475
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:10,320
When did you meet your first love?

476
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,680
- When was it? 
 - First love.

477
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,260
I'll drink instead.

478
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,439
Xiaoning, no.

479
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,679
You can't drink anymore.

480
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,660
You need to answer the question.

481
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,300
Now.

482
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,039
Who is it?

483
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:28,980
Was it the man who came to pick you up, driving a fancy car?

484
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,160
It's a man who doesn't like me.

485
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,900
It has ended... before we even had the chance to start.

486
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,759
It's not making any sense.

487
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,920
Is she drunk?

488
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,600
It's Wang Kai's birthday.

489
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,799
Wine is not everything.

490
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,260
Where is the cake?

491
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,320
The cake!

492
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,320
Cake! The cake!

493
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,839
This is made especially for Brother Kai.

494
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,879
Thank you.

495
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,879
Thank you, Boss.

496
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,840
Thank you, everyone.

497
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,300
Thank you. I have a crown, too?

498
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:00,020
Thank you so much. I...

499
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,519
Why is there only one candle and it has a "three" on it?

500
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,639
 Because you're 3 years old! 

501
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,799
Boss, look at them.

502
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,740
They are so mean.

503
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,960
Let's sing the birthday song for him.

504
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,699
Birthday song. Come on.

505
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:18,759
♪   Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday to you   ♪

506
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:23,080
♪   Happy Birthday to you...   ♪

507
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:35,680
♪   Happy Birthday to you!   ♪

508
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,879
Cut the cake.

509
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,220
 Blow out the candle. 

510
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,020
 Watch out. Blow out the candle. 

511
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,200
 I'll make a wish. Let me make a wish. 

512
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,700
 Make a wish. 

513
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,240
I wish for world peace.

514
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,919
 Great! Cut the cake. 

515
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,399
 Let's cut the cake. 

516
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,679
I'll check on her.

517
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,080
 Okay. 

518
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,159
 You can have the slice you cut. 

519
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,160
 You're making a mess! 

520
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:27,080
Drank too much?

521
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,319
Are you feeling stressed because Director Gu's ex-girlfriend

522
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,639
came out of nowhere?

523
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,800
No.

524
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,300
Just take it as I had too much wine.

525
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,639
Stop pushing yourself.

526
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:48,079
Wenwen is outstanding in every aspect.

527
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:52,639
Not just you, even I would feel the pressure.

528
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,539
Sister Wenwen is a great person.

529
00:34:56,539 --> 00:34:59,160
But it has nothing to do with me.

530
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,760
I don't want you to be like a moth to the flame.

531
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,439
You're facing such a powerful rival.

532
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:10,080
Backing out is not necessarily a bad choice.

533
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,580
Sister Manlin, I'm an adult.

534
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:18,120
As for what's good or bad, I can tell the difference.

535
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,460
Are you saying I'm nosy?

536
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:26,999
Sister Manlin, I got this job at Chuan Studio.

537
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,700
It's all thanks to you.

538
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,960
I'm grateful to you.

539
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,240
I'm grateful to Director Gu, too.

540
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,620
Maybe you wouldn't understand.

541
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:40,920
For me, Director Gu is the starry sky.

542
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:45,479
It's already a miracle for me by only looking at the starry sky.

543
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,960
Not to mention... I became so close to it.

544
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:57,700
Jiang Xiaoning, I know you're going through a rough patch.

545
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:01,380
I know you came to the company because you wanted to be a designer.

546
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:06,999
So... you should focus on your work, not on Director Gu.

547
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,880
Do you understand?

548
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,320
I understand.

549
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:19,400
However, I'm not the only one who likes Director Gu.

550
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,920
You like him, too.

551
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,760
What are you trying to say?

552
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,520
I mean,

553
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,720
maybe my fantasy might lead to a miracle.

554
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:39,320
I'm reminding you for your own good.

555
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:49,140
I admit I got carried away a little.

556
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:52,160
I should thank you for your advice.

557
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,759
Fine.

558
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,600
We should get back.

559
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,999
I need some fresh air.

560
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Sister Manlin, you can head back first.

561
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,840
 I thought it through. 

562
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,960
 Sister Manlin likes Director Gu as well. 

563
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,921
 So I can't fall into the trap that is set by my rival. 

564
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:33,160
 Jiang Xiaoning, since you have already created a miracle 

565
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,879
 and approached the sky, 

566
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,959
 you have all the more reason to get close to that shining star. 

567
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,200
 Are you home yet? 

568
00:38:29,919 --> 00:38:33,239
Stop messing around. You've been doing it the whole night!

569
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,399
What kind of company is this?

570
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,199
How could they let an employee get this drunk?

571
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,239
It's bad enough that they never give you a raise.

572
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,160
Give me your hand.

573
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,460
What's wrong with you? Don't drink if you can't.

574
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,539
You shouldn't push yourself. Give me your hand.

575
00:38:44,539 --> 00:38:46,120
Auntie.

576
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,399
Did I hurt you?

577
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,880
Let me rub it for you.

578
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,820
Auntie.

579
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:55,599
You can't say anything bad about our boss.

580
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:59,359
He is a decent man.

581
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,840
He is a great man.

582
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,100
It's just that he doesn't like me.

583
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,680
Are you that drunk? You are talking gibberish.

584
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,399
You should be glad he doesn't like you.

585
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,580
There will be a problem if he likes you.

586
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,320
Auntie,

587
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:17,159
if he doesn't like me, he won't give me a raise

588
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,559
and he won't give me a bonus.

589
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,199
I won't get a promotion.

590
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,079
I will be miserable!

591
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,119
Baby!

592
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,959
My holy ancestors!

593
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,439
My sweetheart.

594
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,799
Can we just go to sleep first?

595
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,600
Leave the raise and promotion aside.

596
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,940
Save it for another time. Save it for another time.

597
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,839
Come on. Oh my!

598
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:37,980
Lean on my arm.

599
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,560
Slowly, gently.

600
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,120
Right here. Okay.

601
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,990
My back! My back!

602
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:45,160
My goodness.

603
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,239
My boss doesn't like me.

604
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,199
Then leave him be.

605
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,560
He won't give me a raise.

606
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:01,020
I won't get a promotion.

607
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,880
He doesn't like me...

608
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,960
Boss...

609
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:11,280
He must like me.

610
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,740
Like me...

611
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:27,040


612
