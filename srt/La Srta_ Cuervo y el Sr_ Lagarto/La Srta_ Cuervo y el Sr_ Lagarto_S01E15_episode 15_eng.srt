â™«  I can't help but feel a little happy  â™«

3
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,679
â™«  I can't help but feel a little nervous  â™«

4
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,920
â™«  The earth is turning because of you  â™«

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,219
â™«  Without you, the earth stops  â™«

6
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:35,130
â™«  You are the rainbow that fills up the black and white  â™«

7
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,899
â™«  I was once obsessed with the legend of the four-leaf clover  â™«

8
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,609
â™«  I dreamed of a white-horse carriage and 
you becoming my prince  â™«

9
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:48,799
â™«  Your gaze is too seducing, please save me  â™«

10
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:53,300
â™«  I'm turning into a moth, flying towards the fire  â™«

11
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,920
â™«  Your smile is dancing on your lips  â™«

12
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,579
â™«  Am I the happiness you're looking for?  â™«

13
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:07,219
â™«  The doe inside me is lost  â™«

14
00:01:07,219 --> 00:01:12,530
â™«  Holding your hand, let's count down to happiness  â™«

15
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,600
â™«  I can't help but be a little fragile  â™«

16
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,219
â™«  I can't help but feel a little gloomy  â™«

17
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:26,519
â™«  The sky is bright because of you  â™«

18
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,820
â™«  Without you, the sky is grey  â™«

19
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:33,250
â™«  You are the angel who takes away all loneliness  â™«

20
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:37,700
   

21
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,050
   

22
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,060
Boss. I'm sorry, Boss.

23
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,279
I not only got drunk yesterday but also left early.

24
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,159
I went to bed right after I got home.

25
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,920
I only checked my Wechat when I woke up today.

26
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:06,380
I'm used to it.

27
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,440
Are you sober now?

28
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,160
Let's go.

29
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,180
Yes, Boss.

30
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,919
In the design proposal, we should add some features of Chinese gardens.

31
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:39,580
This afternoon, come visit a teacher with me.

32
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,360
Okay.

33
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,539
Just the two of us?

34
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:45,019
Yes. We are going out of town.

35
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,900
We'll fly back at night.

36
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,800
Is there a problem?

37
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,399
No. No problem.

38
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,820
Recently, you're not doing your job very well.

39
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,859
You used to buy me breakfast and drinks.

40
00:03:02,859 --> 00:03:07,100
Now, you just wait for me standing next to the car.

41
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:13,059
These days, I've been thinking about the responsibilities of my position.

42
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:15,260
Did you come up with anything?

43
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,579
I think I'm just a driver and a personal assistant.

44
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:24,340
I shouldn't interfere with your personal business.

45
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:29,260
Moreover, I always lose interest in things quickly.

46
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,539
 Jiang Xiaoning, what the heck are you talking about? 

47
00:03:32,539 --> 00:03:37,299
 You just don't know how to face your feelings for Boss. 

48
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,060
Young people nowadays are all like that.

49
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,280
They lose their passion quickly.

50
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,219
This is urgent. You need to deal with it now.

51
00:03:58,219 --> 00:03:59,919
Make sure it's done as soon as possible.

52
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:01,380
Leave us.

53
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,759
Hello, Director Xu.

54
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,480
Director Xu, what brings you here?

55
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,100
Take a seat.

56
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,860
There is a small problem with money from last time.

57
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:19,760
Accidentally, somebody involved got the goods on us.

58
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,978
He won't say anything, right?

59
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:23,379
No, he won't.

60
00:04:23,379 --> 00:04:25,440
I have seen a lot of people like him.

61
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,910
They only ask for money. You just need to pay them with enough money.

62
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,260
So I've prepared some cash.

63
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,210
Get it solved with Assistant Liu, when it's time.

64
00:04:33,219 --> 00:04:37,200
Director Xu, is it really not going to cause any trouble?

65
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:43,960
Tang Xu, you are the kind of person who will accomplish big things in the future.

66
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,259
You need to be able to stay calm.

67
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:49,379
Don't panic when nothing has happened yet.

68
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:53,340
Otherwise, how can I leave my business to you in the future?

69
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,199
Okay. I understand.

70
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,680
You're seeing someone?

71
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,620
Who is the lucky girl?

72
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,179
No... No, Director Xu.

73
00:05:08,179 --> 00:05:10,060
It's just for a little sister.

74
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,860
Little sister?

75
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,559
It's a good thing.

76
00:05:17,559 --> 00:05:19,179
Why are you nervous?

77
00:05:19,179 --> 00:05:22,759
I'm happy for you. But remember, bring her around.

78
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:25,080
I'll help you find out whether she's a good girl.

79
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,319
- See you. 
 - Director Xu.

80
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,720
Take care, Director Xu.

81
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,760
Brother Xu.

82
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,739
Why did you come visit me at noon?

83
00:05:46,739 --> 00:05:49,839
I'm going on a business trip in a few days. I may be gone for about twenty days.

84
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:51,779
I'm a little worried about you, so I came by to check on you.

85
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:54,659
Oh, right. How's work going for you these days? Is everything going well?

86
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:58,639
No, it's not. I've caused a lot of trouble and always make my boss angry.

87
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,880
I see.

88
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,550
It's all right. My company's door is always open for you.

89
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,110
You're welcome anytime.

90
00:06:05,119 --> 00:06:07,639
It's okay. I'm just venting.

91
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:09,959
I really like my company.

92
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:14,219
Look at you. Asking you to work at my company feels like I'm kidnapping you.

93
00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:18,079
You already helped me so much. I don't want to cause you more trouble.

94
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,939
Brother Xu, you don't look well.

95
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:24,660
Are you working too hard?

96
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,700
I've got too much going on recently.

97
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,820
There are too many things I need to think about.

98
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,359
You've been like this all these years.

99
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,480
You don't look happy

100
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,480
and I can't help you.

101
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,059
I miss the good old days.

102
00:06:36,059 --> 00:06:38,160
We were so carefree back then.

103
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,459
Oh right. This is for you.

104
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:42,799
Your birthday is coming up in a few days.

105
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,659
I'm afraid I can't make it back in time, so I'm giving this to you in advance.

106
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:47,779
You know I never celebrate my birthday.

107
00:06:47,779 --> 00:06:49,800
You don't celebrate your birthday. You don't buy cakes.

108
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,279
You should at least have birthday presents. Take it.

109
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,620
Thanks, Brother Xu.

110
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,739
I'm leaving soon.

111
00:06:57,739 --> 00:06:58,980
You're not going to say goodbye to me?

112
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,180
Have a safe trip.

113
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,320
Jiang Xiaoning.

114
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,779
Boss, when did you come down?

115
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:09,179
I just came down and happened to see you.

116
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:10,039
Why are you still here?

117
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:11,700
If we don't leave now, we'll miss the flight.

118
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,800
Miss the flight?

119
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,039
Brother Xu, I need to go now.

120
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,000
Thanks for your present.

121
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,250
   

122
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,359
   

123
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,400
Hello, Miss.

124
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,980
Hello.

125
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:42,899
Hello. This is the identification card for my mechanical heart.

126
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,420
Okay.

127
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,940
Thank you.

128
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,859
- It's done. 
 - Okay, thank you.

129
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,720
It's sour.

130
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,119
Wang Kai, where is Jiang Xiaoning?

131
00:08:12,119 --> 00:08:13,980
She's on a business trip.

132
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,460
A business trip to where?

133
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,940
She is on a business trip with Director Gu.

134
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:29,060
Why do I always see you in our Design Department?

135
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,299
What do you mean by "your" Design Department?

136
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:37,578
This is our company.

137
00:08:37,578 --> 00:08:38,979
We, the Administrative Department,

138
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:42,860
need to understand every department's daily lives.

139
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,540
To better serve you.

140
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,460
Serve you.

141
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,520
Jiang Xiaoning.

142
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,280
The suitcase.

143
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,060
What's wrong with you?

144
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,240
I just don't understand

145
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,080
why you're bringing me on a business trip?

146
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,759
What do you think?

147
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:31,100
 I hope it's because you like me, 

148
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,540
 but... 

149
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,299
I'm probably the most useless person in the whole company.

150
00:09:37,299 --> 00:09:40,540
Other people have important tasks to complete.

151
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:45,059
Jiang Xiaoning, is there anything wrong with your brain recently?

152
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:47,899
The Jiang Xiaoning I know is always positive

153
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:49,319
and never has low self-esteem.

154
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,240
Not to mention being sarcastic in front of her boss.

155
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,360
I'm sorry, Boss.

156
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,919
I have no filter.

157
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:59,699
I look down on myself.

158
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:01,159
I indulge in fantasy.

159
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:03,780
I do not engage in honest work.

160
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,820
This time, I'm bringing you to visit one of my teachers.

161
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,360
He is very important to me.

162
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,880
Didn't you say you wanted to study architectural design?

163
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,940
I hope this visit will be helpful to you.

164
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,660
Boss.

165
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:28,840
I think you have potential, so I'm willing to help you.

166
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,920
Don't let me down.

167
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,780
Yes, Boss.

168
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:46,460
Mr. Wang is a master of Chinese garden design.

169
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:49,620
We met when we were working on the same project.

170
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,619
We found that we clicked in many aspects,

171
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:54,460
so we became teacher and student.

172
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:59,920
However, for me, we're more like close friends across generations.

173
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,300
In other words, this place is full of Boss's memories?

174
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,000
Yes.

175
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,500
This place feels familiar to me.

176
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,719
Really?

177
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:14,119
Really. I think I've been here before.

178
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,580
Gu Chuan.

179
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,540
Mr. Wang.

180
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,479
Long time no see, Mr. Wang.

181
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,820
Yes, yes, yes.

182
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,679
I've been too busy to come and visit you.

183
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,359
I understand.

184
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,860
People always say that we architects

185
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,580
have no love lives, no friends,

186
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,460
and no families.

187
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,100
But...

188
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,840
This girl is...?

189
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,820
Hello, Mr. Wang. I'm Director Gu's assistant.

190
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,340
I'm Jiang Xiaoning.

191
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,639
Oh, an assistant.

192
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,760
When Gu Chuan came to visit me before, he never brought an assistant along.

193
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,479
You are a big boss now.

194
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,620
You now have a secretary, an assistant, and what else?

195
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,460
Mr. Wang.

196
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,740
When my wife heard you were coming, she regretted it so much.

197
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:22,559
She had just gone to Jiuzhaigou County with a bunch of her friends.

198
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,280
When she saw the video,

199
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,039
she started to complain so much.

200
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:30,000
She had already planned out what good food

201
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,039
she was going to make you once you were here.

202
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,639
Would you look at this?

203
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,199
You've missed each other again.

204
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,559
It's okay, Mr. Wang.

205
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,679
I'll come and visit you more often in the future.

206
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,079
Come on, let's go inside first.

207
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,380
Okay.

208
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,959
I bought you a bunch of delicious fruits.

209
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,300
Mr. Wang, I can help you wash the fruits.

210
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,920
Sounds good.

211
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,440
Mr. Wang, you just have some rest.

212
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,380
I've got this.

213
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,719
Little girl, you're pretty smart.

214
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,460
Really?

215
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,100
But when we were at the airport just now,

216
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,500
Boss said I had become dumber.

217
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,599
Really?

218
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,399
Your boss knows how to make jokes now?

219
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,700
He was very serious.

220
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:17,180
In the past, I was worried that he may develop depression or something else.

221
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,760
It seems like I was worried for nothing.

222
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,880
No way. He scolds me every day and seems to enjoy doing it.

223
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,959
I'll have a talk with him later.

224
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,060
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

225
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,980
Boss, have some fruits.

226
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,700
What are you looking at?

227
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,119
I'm just looking around.

228
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,100
I always do this every time I'm here.

229
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,940
This is me as a kid.

230
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,120
Me and my dad.

231
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,420
You're saying this is your father?

232
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,639
Is this really you?

233
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,220
Yes.

234
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,900
You know my dad? Jiang Guangda?

235
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,900
You-You're Guangda's daughter?

236
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,720
He was my student.

237
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,039
When he first came to the university,

238
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,920
I thought he had great potential.

239
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,639
I really liked him.

240
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:51,760
I invited him to come to my place for meals quite often.

241
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,400
This picture was taken when he came to visit after he had graduated.

242
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,160
It's the only picture I have of us together.

243
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,940
Who would know...

244
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,140
I'm sorry, child.

245
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,600
I brought up your sad memories.

246
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,399
It's okay, Mr. Wang.

247
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,359
It's been many years.

248
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,600
I won't be sad anymore.

249
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,940
On the contrary, I'm very happy to have met you today.

250
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,039
Mr. Wang, when my dad was young, was he handsome?

251
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:31,580
Yes.

252
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,039
A lot of girls were chasing after him.

253
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,180
But my mom got him in the end.

254
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,560
Mr. Wang, is this Boss when he was young?

255
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,380
Yes.

256
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,960
Boss, should I call you Martial Uncle? 
  (T/N: Shi means teacher, Shu means uncle) 

257
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,960
Martial Uncle?

258
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,479
I have something to show you.

259
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,980
Martial Uncle.

260
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,140
This is the work notebook that I've been using for years.

261
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,980
There are a lot of design drawings in it.

262
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,860
Many of them

263
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:26,400
were completed with your dad, Guangda.

264
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,180
Since you are Guangda's daughter,

265
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:34,300
I should give this to you.

266
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,380
Maybe it'll come in handy

267
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,200
for work in the future.

268
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,040
Mr. Wang, this gift is too precious.

269
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,999
I can't take it.

270
00:16:42,999 --> 00:16:45,540
You're Guangda's daughter.

271
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,980
It should be yours.

272
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,079
I hope you will work hard

273
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,060
to become an outstanding architectural designer.

274
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,940
One that's better than Gu Chuan.

275
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,380
No, no, no.

276
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:03,039
Mr. Wang, you're too biased.

277
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,300
I haven't even seen this notebook.

278
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,959
You're already a big boss.

279
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,118
You don't need it.

280
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,460
I do.

281
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,779
Thank you, Mr. Wang. I will work hard.

282
00:17:12,779 --> 00:17:16,178
I don't dare to be compared to Boss, but I will be as excellent as my dad.

283
00:17:16,178 --> 00:17:18,019
Of course, you will.

284
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,399
Come on.

285
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,759
Have some fruits.

286
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,840
Okay.

287
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,240
Help yourself.

288
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,380
Pear? Apple?

289
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,720
Both are fine.

290
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,719
I have some good tea, too.

291
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,680
It's where it always has been. You know the place.

292
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,439
Ah, I see.

293
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,040
I'll go look for it.

294
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:44,439
In a bit, ask Gu Chuan to take you out for a walk.

295
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,919
The view here is gorgeous.

296
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,400
Mr. Wang, which is my dad's handwriting?

297
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,200
Look here...

298
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,620
I just don't understand

299
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,439
why would Mr. Wang give the notebook to you.

300
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,040
I can't help it. I'm a good person.

301
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,439
Boss, I'm in a good mood today.

302
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,780
What do you want to eat? My treat.

303
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,840
Well, I'm not in a good mood.

304
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,399
If you want to buy me something, buy me ice cream.

305
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,199
But you never eat things that are too sweet.

306
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,780
None of your business.

307
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,739
Boss. Yours.

308
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,599
Boss, maybe I've been here too.

309
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,380
Doesn't it say in the movies that "all encounters

310
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,520
are reunions after a long time."

311
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,599
Think about it.

312
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,039
We've both been to Mr. Wang's house, both walked this stone road,

313
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,879
both taken photos in the same room.

314
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,879
Now you've become my boss and we're having ice cream together.

315
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,660
Suddenly, I feel like the ice cream has become special too.

316
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,200
Boss, what's in your mind?

317
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,200
Nothing.

318
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,980
Why did you buy this flavor?

319
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,740
This is the newest flavor.

320
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,560
Do you want to try it?

321
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,100
I mean... this is the newest flavor.

322
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,580
Do you want to smell it?

323
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,400
Nothing more.

324
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,060
Not bad.

325
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,520
 Was that an indirect kiss? 

326
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,620
 This is so awkward. 

327
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,420
 What should I do? 

328
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,960
 Should I bring up some other topic? 

329
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,060
 What to chat about? 

330
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,160
Boss, you looked pretty handsome in that photo

331
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,040
of yours when you were young.

332
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,720
Only when I was young?

333
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,940
No. I mean.

334
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,799
When you were young, there must have been a lot of people who liked you.

335
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,420
Someone who fits you must be talented and beautiful.

336
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,600
Born with natural beauty.

337
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:31,139
 Jiang Xiaoning, what are you saying? 

338
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,700
Chen Wenwen is my ex-girlfriend.

339
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,480
Why are you suddenly talking about this?

340
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,119
I've never asked.

341
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,760
Also, I don't really care about that.

342
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,900
You don't care?

343
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,039
Fine.

344
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,120
I won't talk about it then.

345
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,039
But it's fine if you want to talk about it.

346
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,780
It's raining and we can't leave anyway.

347
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,799
Chen Wenwen and I started dating after graduating high school.

348
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,920
After that, I went to study abroad.

349
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,599
We had been managing a long-distance relationship

350
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,039
in two different countries.

351
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,599
During the summer break of my first year in university,

352
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,260
I came back to China.

353
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,900
However, something happened and we broke up.

354
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,320
After that, we've never contacted each other.

355
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,960
It never occurred to me that you would bring her to the office.

356
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,239
 Yes. It's my fault. 

357
00:21:35,239 --> 00:21:36,839
 It's all my fault. 

358
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,879
 I'm a crow who always brings misfortune. 

359
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,540
But it's fine.

360
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:47,980
I consider it has come to a full stop.

361
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,300
A full stop?

362
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:55,239
Isn't it a comma? Or an ellipsis?

363
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,999
I mean who would be willing to have a full stop

364
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,960
with someone like you who shines this brightly.

365
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,080
Jiang Xiaoning, I just realized that your flattering skills are really

366
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,280
much better than any other people.

367
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,540
I won't decline this honor.

368
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,339
Boss, there's a cat.

369
00:22:28,339 --> 00:22:31,099
Hold this for me. Come on.

370
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,160
It's so cute.

371
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,080
Baby.

372
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:45,020
Boss, it's so cute.

373
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:47,220
Do you want to pet it?

374
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,319
No.

375
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:50,659
I don't like animals that shed.

376
00:22:50,659 --> 00:22:53,319
Trust me, pet it. You'll fall in love with it.

377
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:55,739
Just pet it once. Come on.

378
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,659
How do you feel? Isn't its hair so silky?

379
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,600
What does it mean when it looks at me in this way?

380
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,139
It likes you.

381
00:23:12,139 --> 00:23:15,660
It knows that following the right owner will allow it to eat well.

382
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,940
It doesn't have an owner.

383
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:25,940
It looks like it's a stray cat.

384
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,499
Boss, why don't we take it back and adopt it?

385
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,099
Adopt it?

386
00:23:34,099 --> 00:23:36,039
Boss, look at you.

387
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:39,359
You're handsome, talented, and kind.

388
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,399
Moreover, your apartment is spacious.

389
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,419
If I bring it back, I won't have time to take care of it

390
00:23:44,419 --> 00:23:46,440
since my grandma and auntie are not in good health.

391
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,240
Boss.

392
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,079
- Well, let me think about it. 
 - Okay.

393
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:56,540
If you're thinking about it, I need to make it clear.

394
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,820
If you adopt it, you can't abandon it.

395
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:02,479
You should feed it good food, bathe it, be responsible for it.

396
00:24:02,479 --> 00:24:04,359
Otherwise, you shouldn't adopt it.

397
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:06,540
If it knows how good it feels to be taken care of by an owner,

398
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:09,280
it won't be able to revert back to its current lifestyle.

399
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,079
Temporarily. It can stay at my place temporarily.

400
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:18,839
Then can I go visit it frequently at your place?

401
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,040
Of course, you need to come and visit. Otherwise, am I supposed to raise it by myself?

402
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,599
Great. Thank you, Boss.

403
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:28,340
Should we give it a name?

404
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:31,879
Look, your last name is Gu and my last name is Jiang.

405
00:24:31,879 --> 00:24:33,199
Gu Gu?

406
00:24:33,199 --> 00:24:34,519
Jiang Jiang?

407
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:37,259
- These names don't work. 
 - We can call it Ice Cream.

408
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:39,419
We ran into it while we were having ice cream.

409
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:41,840
Why don't we call it Ice Cream?

410
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,620
Okay.

411
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:49,960
From now on, your name will be Ice Cream.

412
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,760
Ice Cream, Ice Cream.

413
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:57,140
Boss, give it some ice cream. See if it'll have any.

414
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,599
Feed it. Come on.

415
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,219
- Come on. 
 - Do you want to have any?

416
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,280
How about this one?

417
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,500
You can choose.

418
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,019
You should behave, understand?

419
00:25:24,019 --> 00:25:26,299
Adapting to the environment is basic.

420
00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:28,659
Don't think I can't hold you accountable even though you look cute.

421
00:25:28,659 --> 00:25:32,060
If you want to stay at my place, you must have a bath.

422
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,680
Come here.

423
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,200
I asked you to come here.

424
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,279
You're smart.

425
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:40,939
You know this is the bathroom.

426
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:42,419
Come, come, come.

427
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:46,220
From now on, here is where you take baths.

428
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,239
 Ice Cream is so cute. 

429
00:26:27,239 --> 00:26:29,099
 I feel happy when I see you. 

430
00:26:29,099 --> 00:26:30,699
 But what makes me happier 

431
00:26:30,699 --> 00:26:34,359
 is being able to visit you at Boss' place often. 

432
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,620
   

433
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:29,000
 Miss Crow and Mr. Lizard. 

434
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,040
Boss.

435
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,379
Suddenly behaving so well.

436
00:27:46,379 --> 00:27:48,419
I hope you won't lose your passion too fast.

437
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:51,039
Thank you, Boss. I'll try to keep it up.

438
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,819
If there's nothing else, I'll go back to keep reading Mr. Wang's notes.

439
00:27:54,819 --> 00:27:58,119
Okay. When you're done with it, let me take a look at it, too.

440
00:27:58,119 --> 00:28:00,999
Boss, I really do want to let you have a look at it.

441
00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:04,079
However, this is Mr. Wang's private belongings.

442
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:07,160
It's not good to pass it around.

443
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,619
I noticed that after we came back from the business trip,

444
00:28:09,619 --> 00:28:11,520
you've become more and more bold.

445
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,880
Director Gu... Xiaoning is here, too.

446
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,780
I was just looking for you.

447
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,579
This is a critical period for the art gallery.

448
00:28:19,579 --> 00:28:21,799
I'm needed at the site quite frequently.

449
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:26,140
I'm afraid I won't have time for Chen Wenwen's exhibition.

450
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,639
Why don't you let Cheng Dong take charge of it?

451
00:28:29,639 --> 00:28:32,620
Cheng Dong has his own projects to complete.

452
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,779
I'm not quitting.

453
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:37,360
I'm just asking for an assistant.

454
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,100
Who do you think is suitable for the job?

455
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:45,140
After careful consideration, I can only borrow your assistant.

456
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:54,640
I think this is a great learning opportunity.

457
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:59,660
I'm afraid I'm not capable of taking on this role.

458
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,800
You can practice your skills.

459
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,999
Okay. Thank you, Boss, for giving me this opportunity.

460
00:29:06,999 --> 00:29:09,660
Sister Manlin, should I contact Sister Wenwen for anything?

461
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:13,080
Take it easy. I'll let you know in advance.

462
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,799
Jing Xiaoning, you've got this.

463
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,979
Mine is good, too.

464
00:29:28,979 --> 00:29:31,859
- Really? 
 - I'm going to try some.

465
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:52,620
Why did that just feel like a martial arts film?

466
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:57,040
I think something big is about to happen in the martial arts world.

467
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:01,000
A reign of terror is inevitable.

468
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:10,040
No matter what happens, no matter how many years have passed,

469
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,900
no matter who the leader is,

470
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,380
I only follow my own path.

471
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:17,620
This hero, would you mind me asking you what path?

472
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,180
The path in your heart.

473
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,019
You can't walk the path in my heart.

474
00:30:23,019 --> 00:30:25,179
To you, there will always be road traffic control.

475
00:30:25,179 --> 00:30:26,899
Why?

476
00:30:26,899 --> 00:30:29,819
Look, you're Empress Dowager.

477
00:30:29,819 --> 00:30:31,659
I'm Commander Ju.

478
00:30:31,659 --> 00:30:34,179
Even our snacks look like a couple.

479
00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:35,839
We were born for each other.

480
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:38,840
We'll talk once you've become extremely rich.

481
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,300
Can you not act like this?

482
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,480
- What did I do? 
 - Why are you discouraging me?

483
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,979
Is Gu Chuan in his office?

484
00:30:42,979 --> 00:30:45,460
Yes, yes, yes.

485
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,800
Jia Jia, Jia Jia, Jia Jia.

486
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,419
Jia Jia, don't think about it.

487
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,319
All the girls in this building want to marry him.

488
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:57,679
There are too many wolves and too little meat.

489
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,460
Nothing is impossible.

490
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,920
Why leave me hanging?

491
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:08,240
My Chuan.

492
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,179
Who bought this for you?

493
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:13,819
It doesn't look delicious at all.

494
00:31:13,819 --> 00:31:19,039
I bought you fresh-from-the-oven cakes and it's your favorite flavor, vanilla.

495
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:24,640
When did I start liking vanilla?

496
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,600
You don't?

497
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,660
It's not important.

498
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:31,859
These are fresh from the oven, way more delicious than this, which clearly looks stale.

499
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,500
Do you have a favor to ask me?

500
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:39,020
Hey, do I need a reason to come visit my Chuan?

501
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:43,099
Me buying cake for you. Isn't it normal?

502
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:48,640
Of course, there is a small favor I'd like to ask.

503
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,840
Get to the point.

504
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,540
I want to borrow someone from you.

505
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,660
Borrow a person?

506
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:01,939
What's with today? Why is everyone asking to borrow people from me this morning?

507
00:32:01,939 --> 00:32:04,199
Other people asked to borrow people from you, too?

508
00:32:04,199 --> 00:32:09,319
But the person I'm asking to borrow shouldn't be very important to you.

509
00:32:09,319 --> 00:32:11,520
Who is it?

510
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,440
How are we supposed to work?

511
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,000
Meng Jia.

512
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,659
Director Xu, why are you here?

513
00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:21,400
I thought I just saw a ghost.

514
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,500
Well.

515
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,339
Be my girlfriend.

516
00:32:27,339 --> 00:32:29,640
Be your girlfriend?

517
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,080
Come with me.

518
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,639
Get on with your work. Do your work. Nothing is happening here.

519
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,579
- Today... 
 - Brother Kai.

520
00:32:44,579 --> 00:32:45,919
Brother Kai, what's the matter?

521
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:47,919
Brother Kai. Mr... Mr. Cheng.

522
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:50,439
- Brother Kai. 
 - Brother Kai.

523
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:02,720
Director Xu, I'm not ready for this.

524
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,920
This is too sudden.

525
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,299
Calm down.

526
00:33:07,299 --> 00:33:08,440
I'll explain everything to you.

527
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,940
Don't touch me.

528
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:15,900
What... Give me three seconds to calm down first.

529
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,580
I can do this.

530
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:25,980
Director Xu, although I'm not fully prepared,

531
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:29,320
go ahead and say it.

532
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,300
Look.

533
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,230
- Can I... 
 - You can.

534
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,799
- Can you...
 - I can.

535
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,880
Wait until I finish my sentence.

536
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:46,720
Can I ask you to pretend to be my girlfriend?

537
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,760
Pretend?

538
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,160
- It's fake? 
 - It's fake.

539
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:54,599
I know it's not good to ask anyone to do this.

540
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:57,599
At least you are the company's employee and we've known each other for a while.

541
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:01,560
I also believe that you can play the role well. Right?

542
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,221
I can make our fake relationship look real.

543
00:34:04,221 --> 00:34:05,719
Let's start with the first ploy of the play.

544
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,000
We'll start with how the role and the actor should...

545
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,399
Okay, okay, okay.

546
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,678
We can talk about it next time.

547
00:34:10,678 --> 00:34:12,380
So... you're in?

548
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,618
I am.

549
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:15,119
Great.

550
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,679
Do you need me to prepare any costumes or props?

551
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,499
No. I have everything.

552
00:34:19,499 --> 00:34:21,659
- You do? 
 - I do!

553
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:24,219
I'll ask Gu Chuan to assign you less work later.

554
00:34:24,219 --> 00:34:26,039
Thank you in advance.

555
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:28,259
No problem. I'm more than willing to do so.

556
00:34:28,259 --> 00:34:31,519
I won't waste too much of your time. I need about two episodes.

557
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:33,320
Two episodes?

558
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,120
I can do more.

559
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,379
We can discuss this later.

560
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:39,499
You need to go out with me this afternoon.

561
00:34:39,499 --> 00:34:41,079
I've got you on leave.

562
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,699
Go get ready. I'll wait for you downstairs.

563
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,520
No problem.

564
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,959
Fake.

565
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:56,020
I forgot to talk about the pay.

566
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,339
Not important.

567
00:34:57,339 --> 00:34:59,700
Not important, not important.

568
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,840
Brother Kai.

569
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,260
What's wrong with you?

570
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,740
You've been lost in thought for a while.

571
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:10,500
Get up. It's my seat.

572
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,899
What's actually going on?

573
00:35:18,899 --> 00:35:20,720
Someone's life is at risk.

574
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,879
Director Xu asked me to pretend to be his girlfriend.

575
00:35:23,879 --> 00:35:27,040
I finally have a chance to get into acting.

576
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,000
- Really? 
 - Really.

577
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,280
So it's actually fake?

578
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,680
It's fake.

579
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,499
Yes!

580
00:35:33,499 --> 00:35:35,979
I knew Director Xu couldn't be this blind.

581
00:35:35,979 --> 00:35:38,979
No, no, no. A slip of the tongue. He has sharp eyes.

582
00:35:38,979 --> 00:35:40,540
Great taste.

583
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,039
- You're good now? 
 - I'm good, I'm good.

584
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:43,639
- Are you all right? 
 - Go back to work. It's fine, it's fine.

585
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:46,159
Everything is fine. Go back to work.

586
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,159
Let me tell you. Don't be so happy this early.

587
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:50,820
What did I say?

588
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:55,300
- Everything is... 
 - Impossible. Impossible.

589
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,419
Come on, come on, come on.

590
00:35:57,419 --> 00:35:59,020
Eat, eat, eat. This, this, this.

591
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,640
 Pretending to be his girlfriend. 

592
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,700
 Sister Yan Yan has met her match. 

593
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:14,259
Manger Wei, please sign this.

594
00:36:14,259 --> 00:36:15,279
Did you review it?

595
00:36:15,279 --> 00:36:16,780
Yes, there are no issues.

596
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,880
Wait until I have time.

597
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,379
Manager Wei, are you busy right now?

598
00:36:23,379 --> 00:36:25,060
Did you knock?

599
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:29,519
If you're in a rush, go ask your boyfriend who acted crazy after getting drunk to sign it for you.

600
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:31,759
He's not my boyfriend.

601
00:36:31,759 --> 00:36:35,380
And it was our fault last time.

602
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,380
My apologies.

603
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:42,380
This is going to benefit our company.

604
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,240
Thank you.

605
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,619
Zhao Yan, let's go have lunch together.

606
00:36:57,619 --> 00:36:59,280
I'm on a diet.

607
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,840
So aggressive.

608
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,259
 If she doesn't want to go, let's go together. 

609
00:37:02,259 --> 00:37:03,080
 Cool, let's go. 

610
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,880
 Your treat? 

611
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,699
 Do you want us to bring you some food? 

612
00:37:07,699 --> 00:37:09,440
 Zhao Yan? Zhao Yan? 

613
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,839
 Just leave her alone. Let's go. 

614
00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:12,540
 Let's go. 

615
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:22,170
   

616
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:39,040
 Yan Yan, what a coincidence. 

617
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,830
 What a coincidence. Were you waiting for me? 

618
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:44,859
 I just got here. I was just passing by. It was a coincidence. 

619
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,880
 So you like acting? 

620
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,260
 Let me tell you about acting. 

621
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,679
- Hello. 
 - Iced Americano, thank you.

622
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:11,219
 Okay. It tells you about the rhythms in the performance. 

623
00:38:11,219 --> 00:38:12,780
 Do you know the categories of rhythms in performance? 

624
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,959
Internal rhythm and external rhythm,

625
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:16,099
and the relationship between internal rhythm and external rhythm.

626
00:38:16,099 --> 00:38:17,220
Don't you think it's amazing?

627
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,660
 Guess what internal rhythm is. 

628
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,460
 Your lipstick. 

629
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,420
Is it ready?

630
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,940
It's ready. Your coffee.

631
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,740
Thank you.

632
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:48,120
- That's the girl? 
 - Huh? Yeah.

633
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:53,600
She doesn't seem to be better than me.

634
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,959
All right. Today's work is done.

635
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:58,540
We're done?

636
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,399
I haven't even started to act.

637
00:39:00,399 --> 00:39:03,299
I... I changed into a dress for this.

638
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,900
Director Xu, let's do it again.

639
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,439
- I'll do better. 
 - Next time. We'll have other opportunities.

640
00:39:08,439 --> 00:39:09,760
Do we have other opportunities?

641
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,659
There is no next time. Today's work is done. Let's go. I'll walk you back.

642
00:39:12,659 --> 00:39:14,480
Director Xu.

643
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,300
Director Xu.

644
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,379
Boss, I'll leave first.

645
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,160
Are you going to leave just like that?

646
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,880
I'll pick you up on time tomorrow.

647
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,420
Do you want to go up and visit Ice Cream?

648
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,379
It has been having a poor appetite recently.

649
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:42,080
I don't know why.

650
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,099
How can it have a poor appetite? What did you feed it?

651
00:39:45,099 --> 00:39:47,840
I don't know what I gave it.

652
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,600
I'll go take a look.

653
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,779
Ice Cream.

654
00:39:54,779 --> 00:39:56,600
Ice Cream.

655
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:00,479
Come. How come you have a poor appetite?

656
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:06,360
Having a poor appetite while gaining weight?

657
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:10,100
It looks chubbier.

658
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:13,320
Did it become chubbier?

659
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,639
I was busy revising design drawings. I didn't see it eat.

660
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:21,000
You didn't see it eating doesn't mean it didn't eat.

661
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,900
I see.

662
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,840
Its fur is so soft. Feels so nice.

663
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,259
It also smells good.

664
00:40:29,259 --> 00:40:31,540
Of course. I bathe it every day.

665
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,380
Cats can't take baths every day.

666
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:37,400
How can it come onto the couch without being bathed? How can it come into my bed without being bathed?

667
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:41,539
Ice Cream, rooming with him must be hard for you.

668
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:43,180
How come it's hard for it?

669
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,839
It's hard for me.

670
00:40:44,839 --> 00:40:48,179
Okay, okay, okay. Boss, you also worked hard.

671
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,860
Let me tell you.

672
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:53,119
I didn't treat your VIP poorly.

673
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,260
I prepared a room only for it.

674
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,999
How nice!

675
00:40:57,999 --> 00:40:59,519
I want to see it.

676
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:01,220
Let's go.

677
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:05,380
Ice Cream, you're so happy.

678
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:12,460
This is too luxurious.

679
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,519
Some other stuff is on the way.

680
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,039
These are all based on my drawings.

681
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,440
I also bought some small furniture for Ice Cream.

682
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,060
I have a question.

683
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:27,560
Why are all its toys pink?

684
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,700
Don't girls like pink? Don't you like pink?

685
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:33,540
But Ice Cream is a boy.

686
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,680
You bought pink stuff when you don't even know its sex.

687
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,500
Are you sure?

688
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,780
Isn't... isn't it...

689
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,080
At least they look cute.

690
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:51,019
Ice Cream. Ice Cream.

691
00:41:51,019 --> 00:41:54,900
Ice Cream, why are you so lazy?

692
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,220
Come on, come on, come on.

693
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,060
Hello?

694
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,639
 Hello. Is this Mr. Gu Chuan? 

695
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:12,999
Yes.

696
00:42:12,999 --> 00:42:15,519
 I'm the person in charge of the Jin An Award in the Greater China region. 

697
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:18,720
 Did you see our email? 

698
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,880
Email?

699
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,920
Let me take a look now.

700
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:40,960
 (T/N: "Jin" means "Golden", "An" means "Shore")  
    

701
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:44,740
 Mr. Gu? 

702
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:47,300
 Mr. Gu, are you there? 

703
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,419
Yes, I am.

704
00:42:50,419 --> 00:42:53,620
I just finished reading the email you sent.

705
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:57,539
 Congratulations on winning the Annual Design Award of the Jin An Award. 

706
00:42:57,539 --> 00:42:59,439
Pardon me, I have a question.

707
00:42:59,439 --> 00:43:02,540
This design is from three years ago, so...

708
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:04,920
is it possible that you guys made a mistake?

709
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:07,270
 Because that project has only been completed this year, 

710
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:10,979
 it is still on our nominee's list for this year. 

711
00:43:10,979 --> 00:43:14,199
 We have already sent out the official notice and the awards ceremony invitation. 

712
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:15,859
 You should be receiving them shortly. 

713
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:20,339
 I called to congratulate you and also to confirm 

714
00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:23,700
 whether you will be able to attend the awards ceremony. 

715
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:28,440
 Mr. Gu, will you be able to attend the ceremony? 

716
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,020
Yes.

717
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:32,019
 Great. Congratulations again. 

718
00:43:32,019 --> 00:43:36,259
 Our staff will be in contact with you shortly to confirm the details of the awards ceremony with you. 

719
00:43:36,259 --> 00:43:39,239
 I won't bother you any longer. Goodbye. 

720
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:41,780
Goodbye.

721
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:07,060
