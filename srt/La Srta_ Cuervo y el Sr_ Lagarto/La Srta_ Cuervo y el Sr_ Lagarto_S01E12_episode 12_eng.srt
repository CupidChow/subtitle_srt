00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:41,060
   

22
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,120
Boss, what's wrong?

23
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,360
Did I say something wrong?

24
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,020
You didn't.

25
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,640
Where are we going now?

26
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,239
You'll know once we get there.

27
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,719
   

28
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,579
Ski resort?

29
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:34,639
Boss, why is there a ski resort?

30
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,620
This place was designed by the studio.

31
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,959
We happened to be nearby. So I brought you here to have a study tour.

32
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,199
Thank you, Boss.

33
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,359
Director Gu, long time no see.

34
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,359
It's been a while.

35
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,839
Are you here today for skiing?

36
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,039
Please let me know if you need any help.

37
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,319
I'm always ready to assist you.

38
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,479
No, thanks.

39
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,339
I'm just here to show my assistant around.

40
00:02:51,339 --> 00:02:53,599
All right. Let me get you two jackets.

41
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,119
It's chilly inside.

42
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,520
Okay.

43
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,039
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

44
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,940
If you need any help later, feel free to let me know.

45
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,960
- Thank you. 
 - I'll get back to work.

46
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,019
A castle!

47
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:22,159
It's so beautiful!

48
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,880
Boss!

49
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,140
It's magnificent.

50
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,940
Boss, please help me take some photos.

51
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,240
Just a few will do, Boss.

52
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,860
Boss, do I look like Cinderella who's going to the castle for the ball?

53
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,060
Please make me look taller.

54
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,099
Lower the phone a bit. And don't shoot those words.

55
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:58,120
Have you struck a pose?

56
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,080
Yes, I'm ready.

57
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,299
Do I look good?

58
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,300
Yes, you do.

59
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,999
â™«  Those blazing dreams, follow my command  â™«

60
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:09,179
Done.

61
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,520
Take some more, Boss.

62
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,460
I brought you here to have a study tour, not to have fun.

63
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,720
Let's go.

64
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,840
Boss! Wait for me, Boss.

65
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,040
Boss, do you know conservation of luck?

66
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,279
I don't know.

67
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,439
It means if you've always been lucky,

68
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,179
bad luck will approach you not long after.

69
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:41,479
On the other hand, if you've always been unlucky,

70
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,680
something good is going to happen.

71
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,439
Which phase are you in now?

72
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,099
After I met you, a long streak of bad luck I've been having

73
00:04:50,099 --> 00:04:52,160
has finally turned into good luck.

74
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,319
Do I have such great capacity?

75
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:55,759
Of course, you do.

76
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,979
You provided me such a good job.

77
00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:00,060
You even gave me a chance to learn.

78
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,360
It seems that I started to have good luck after I met you.

79
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,219
Should I take it as you're actually flattering me now?

80
00:05:09,219 --> 00:05:12,360
I'm expressing my gratitude sincerely.

81
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,199
We gain success and luck through hard work.

82
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,580
You don't have to give me all the credit.

83
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,159
Actually, you have a strong comprehension of design.

84
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,799
And you're very talented.

85
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,900
It's just you lacked chances and learning.

86
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,139
Boss, don't worry.

87
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:34,279
I'll double my efforts.

88
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,220
Thank you, Boss.

89
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,260
Let's go. Let's get to the front and check it out.

90
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,680
Okay.

91
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,080
Awesome.

92
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,559
Boss, I don't know how to ski.

93
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:53,039
But I really admire those who can ski.

94
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,980
Do you know how to ski?

95
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,239
I used to ski in Switzerland.

96
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,559
Really?

97
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,979
Isn't it exciting?

98
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:05,679
It must feel like you're traveling through snowy mountains and woods.

99
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,780
As if you're flying.

100
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,239
I haven't skied for a long time.

101
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,440
I've forgotten what it feels like.

102
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,220
I see.

103
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,159
Since you haven't been skiing for so long, do you want to

104
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,220
relive the past experience?

105
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,760
Boss.

106
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,919
It's fine.

107
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,560
I'm not interested in it anymore.

108
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,040
What a pity.

109
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,780
I don't get to see Boss's graceful skiing posture.

110
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,620
Look at these.

111
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,199
Here looks even more beautiful.

112
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,020
Boss.

113
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,380
Over here.

114
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,580
Boss, say cheese.

115
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,240
Over here.

116
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,959
Give it to me. Let me take photos for you.

117
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:15,620
Thank you, Boss.

118
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,480
Wait for a second, Boss.

119
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,580
Boss, please make me look like I'm actually skiing.

120
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,940
Come on.

121
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,320
I'm ready.

122
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,800
One, two, three.

123
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,779
Boss, do I look like I'm skiing?

124
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:31,040
- Yes. 
 - Do I?

125
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,060
Hold on.

126
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,059
Shoot the backdrop as well.

127
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:41,279
As I throw the snow up, press the shutter.

128
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,780
I'll count to three.

129
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,740
Here we go. One, two, three.

130
00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:00,710
â™«  I can't help but feel a little happy  â™«

131
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:05,390
â™«  I can't help but feel a little nervous  â™«

132
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,750
â™«  The earth is turning because of you  â™«

133
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,049
â™«  Without you, the earth stops  â™«

134
00:08:10,049 --> 00:08:16,090
â™«  You are the rainbow that fills up the black and white  â™«

135
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:21,420
â™«  I can't help but feel a little happy  â™«

136
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:26,360
â™«  I can't help but feel a little nervous  â™«

137
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,760
â™«  The earth is turning because of you  â™«

138
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,040
â™«  Without you, the earth stops  â™«

139
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,660
â™«  You are the rainbow that fills up the black and white  â™«

140
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:40,359
â™«  I can't help but be a little fragile  â™«

141
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:45,000
â™«  I can't help but feel a little gloomy  â™«

142
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,219
â™«  The sky is bright because of you  â™«

143
00:08:47,219 --> 00:08:49,640
â™«  Without you, the sky is grey  â™«

144
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:56,660
â™«  You are the angel who takes away all loneliness  â™«

145
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,020
â™«  The sky is bright because of you  â™«

146
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,640
â™«  Without you, the sky is grey  â™«

147
00:09:04,481 --> 00:09:07,040
- Just give it to me. 
 - Thank you.

148
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,520
Boss, are you really okay?

149
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,100
I'm okay.

150
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,919
I felt as if I got an electric shock.

151
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,439
My body felt a bit numb.

152
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,480
Did you feel that?

153
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,919
I didn't.

154
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,160
Maybe you fell down.

155
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,900
I guess so.

156
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,219
Director Gu, could you please fill out this questionnaire?

157
00:09:34,219 --> 00:09:35,740
If you have any comments or suggestions,

158
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,060
please let us know so that we can improve.

159
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,400
Okay.

160
00:09:54,447 --> 00:09:56,599
   

161
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,840
   

162
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,359
Done.

163
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,679
Thank you.

164
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,319
Thank you so much for your cooperation.

165
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,479
Since Director Gu rarely comes here, we are giving away dolls.

166
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,659
- You can pick some you like over there. 
 - No, thanks.

167
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:13,519
Yes, yes, yes. You don't always have free gifts. How could you not get one?

168
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,639
Thanks.

169
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,799
My pleasure.

170
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,300
Thank you.

171
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,240
There are so many dolls.

172
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,220
Boss, have you ever played a claw machine?

173
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,680
You're always busy. You must have never played it before.

174
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,039
I played it before.

175
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:34,580
But due to my bad luck, my favorite doll had always been caught by others.

176
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,720
Today, I want to make it up for myself.

177
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,180
Boss, doesn't it look like you?

178
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,480
Does it look like me?

179
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,980
Yes.

180
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,400
Angry crow.

181
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,580
Do you think it looks like you?

182
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,719
Why would I look like a crow?

183
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,999
I think you do.

184
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,680
Let's go back.

185
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,339
 How could he give me a crow? 

186
00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:24,040
 That's too much. 

187
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,520
Boss, are you really not going to sing karaoke later on?

188
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,819
If I don't attend, all of you can have a better time.

189
00:11:29,819 --> 00:11:30,819
Not necessarily.

190
00:11:30,819 --> 00:11:33,320
Think about it again.

191
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,340
What is this used for? What is this used for?

192
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,280
 Wow, it can record sounds. 

193
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,599
Boss, Boss.

194
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,380
Don't always pull a long face.

195
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,060
What are you laughing at?

196
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,559
Nothing.

197
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:11,020
Boss, I'll give this to you.

198
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,240
You're back.

199
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,720
Sister Manlin, are you going to the karaoke party?

200
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,140
Director Gu is not going, right?

201
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,479
I'll go.

202
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,759
Great!

203
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,519
Let me put this doll in the room first.

204
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,720
Sister Manlin, give me a minute.

205
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,920
I'll put it in the room as well.

206
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,399
Why didn't I record it while Boss was talking?

207
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:20,120
Why did I record my own voice?

208
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,300
Jiang Xiaoning, you fool!

209
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,519
Fool. Fool.

210
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,050
Fool. Fool.

211
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,200
It can record sounds, too?

212
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,119
Jiang Xiaoning,

213
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,160
you either work hard or just leave.

214
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:43,280
Jiang Xiaoning, you either work hard or just leave.

215
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,999
 Boss, Boss. 

216
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,780
 Don't always pull a long face. 

217
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,239
 Boss, Boss. 

218
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,160
 Don't always pull a long face. 

219
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,639
Jiang Xiaoning,

220
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,420
may all your wishes come true.

221
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,379
â™«  One, two, three, count with me  â™«

222
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:28,059
â™«  If the youth is precious, then cheers  â™«

223
00:14:28,059 --> 00:14:30,979
â™«  Those blazing dreams, follow my command  â™«

224
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,199
â™«  Four, five, six  â™«

225
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,300
Boss, you're here.

226
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,400
- Director Gu. 
 - Director Gu.

227
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,839
I'm sorry, Boss.

228
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,360
We started first.

229
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,040
It's fine. Just have fun.

230
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,139
Move over, move over.

231
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:44,439
Sit over, quick.

232
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,360
Just continue singing.

233
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,199
Why do you sit there?

234
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,280
Jia Jia, Jia Jia.

235
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,859
- Come on, come on. 
 - Here, here.

236
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:55,680
Sit down quickly.

237
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,060
Well. Boss, sing a song!

238
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,800
Boss, sing a song!

239
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,580
Boss, sing a song! Boss, sing a song! Boss, sing a song!

240
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,019
Boss, sing a song! Boss, sing a song!

241
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:09,920
All right, stop.

242
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,519
Director Gu doesn't want to sing. Don't force him then.

243
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,759
Jiang Xiaoning.

244
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,199
It's your first time singing karaoke with us, right?

245
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,019
How about you sing a song first?

246
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:18,580
Yeah, Xiaoning.

247
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,119
Sing a song first before everyone.

248
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,439
We... haven't heard you singing before.

249
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,020
Brother Kai, I can't sing well.

250
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,959
If you don't sing, it'll be awkward.

251
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,240
Never mind, I'll pick a song for you.

252
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,159
All right, then!

253
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,639
I'll sing a song to all.

254
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,900
But I'll get a bit out of tune.

255
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,439
That's right. Everyone will get out of tune when singing.

256
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,419
Right?

257
00:15:39,419 --> 00:15:40,359
We're not professional singers.

258
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,299
I'll sing this song.

259
00:15:41,299 --> 00:15:43,920
- This song is okay. 
 - All right.

260
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:55,199
â™ª   I can't help but feel a little happy   â™ª

261
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,899
â™ª   I can't help but feel a little...   â™ª

262
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:00,619
Why did she force herself?

263
00:16:00,619 --> 00:16:02,800
She could have just said she can't sing.

264
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,719
Now it's really awkward.

265
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,999
She did say just now.

266
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,040
But no one cared about that.

267
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,159
â™ª   I can't help but feel a little happy   â™ª

268
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,520
â™ª   I can't help but feel a little nervous   â™ª

269
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,039
Boss's holding the microphone.

270
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,879
You...

271
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,279
Is it the so-called

272
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,679
"hero saves a beauty"?

273
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,879
Record it, quick.

274
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,359
- So charming. 
 - Quick!

275
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,320
- Quick. 
 - Come on!

276
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,719
â™ª   The red apple on the tree fell off and hit me   â™ª

277
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,520
â™ª   Newton's laws of motion...   â™ª

278
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,520
Well.

279
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,400
I should stop recording.

280
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,500
Is this how the song was originally sung?

281
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,479
I guess this is the original version.

282
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,719
Now I know what it meant by

283
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,680
no matter how good you are there's always someone better.

284
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,759
Based on the data, there are not many people who'll get out of tune.

285
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:57,519
I didn't expect there were two of them in our company.

286
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,719
Zip it!

287
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,360
What are you saying?

288
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,999
Director Gu finally is fitting in with us.

289
00:17:02,999 --> 00:17:05,299
We have to pull ourselves together. Pull ourselves together.

290
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:06,520
Right? We have to get high-spirited.

291
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,460
- Right. 
 -  Come on. 
 -  Nice.

292
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,459
Very nice.

293
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:13,560
â™«  I can't help but be a little fragile  â™«

294
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:18,200
â™«  I can't help but feel a little gloomy  â™«

295
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,519
â™«  The sky is bright because of you  â™«

296
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,840
â™«  Without you, the sky is grey  â™«

297
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:28,240
â™«  You are the angel who takes away all loneliness  â™«

298
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,380
â™«  The sky is bright because of you  â™«

299
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,840
â™«  Without you, the sky is grey  â™«

300
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:44,040
â™«  You are the angel who takes away all loneliness  â™«

301
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,560
Boss, your luggage.

302
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,519
Where's your crow?

303
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,160
It's here.

304
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,160
Let me have a look.

305
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,800
This is for you.

306
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,119
No. We both own one.

307
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,399
I can't take this lizard.

308
00:18:08,399 --> 00:18:10,199
I have one in my house already.

309
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,679
So you can take this.

310
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,439
I think this crow and my lizard are quite compatible.

311
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,140
That's it.

312
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:20,020
Bo... Boss. Bo... Boss.

313
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,599
Oh, crap.

314
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,840
There's my recording in the crow.

315
00:18:51,456 --> 00:18:54,179
   

316
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,860
 What a wonderful day. 

317
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:02,599
â™«  Cicada chirping at the end of the street  â™«

318
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,039
 Boss hasn't found out 

319
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,479
 the recording function, right? 

320
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,180
â™«  Two sleeping cats  â™«

321
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:12,719
â™«  Coolness after the rain  â™«

322
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,719
 Jiang Xiaoning, 

323
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,925
 you either work hard or just leave. 

324
00:19:15,926 --> 00:19:18,880
â™«  Endless dreams  â™«

325

326
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,039
 Jiang Xiaoning, 

327
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,357
 you either work hard or just leave. 

328
00:19:25,358 --> 00:19:28,366
â™«   Heart wavering like green grass blades   â™«

329
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,760
 Jiang Xiaoning, 

330
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,260
 may all your wishes come true. 

331
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:38,679
â™«  Our eyes meet inadvertently  â™«

332
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,119
 Jiang Xiaoning, 

333
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:44,200
 may all your wishes come true. 

334
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:48,900
â™«  Open the doors and windows of the new moon  â™«

335
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:54,420
â™«  Embrace the longing for pouring rain  â™«

336
00:19:54,420 --> 00:20:00,020
â™«  You smile and say hello  â™«

337
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,980
   

338
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:12,080
â™«  Cicada chirping at the end of the street  â™«

339
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,880
    
 â™«  Two sleeping cats  â™«

340
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,860
â™«  Coolness after the rain  â™«

341
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,079
 Jiang Xiaoning, 

342
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,660
 may all your wishes come true. 

343
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:32,860
â™«  Diana pink roses  â™«

344

00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,199
â™«  Time passing by gently  â™«

346
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,199
 Jiang Xiaoning, 

347
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,219
 you either work hard or just leave. 

348
00:20:43,219 --> 00:20:46,980
â™«  Our eyes meet inadvertently  â™«

349
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,919
 Did I really treat you that bad? 

350
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,940
â™«  Do you feel it in your heart  â™«

351
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:55,240
- Good night. 
 - Good night.

352
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,780
Good night.

353
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:03,320
â™«  Embrace the longing for pouring rain  â™«

354
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:08,580
â™«  You smile and say hello  â™«

355
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:17,919
Boss.

356
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,900
Here you go.

357
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,940
You went to buy juice tea early in the morning?

358
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,759
I went for a walk and passed by.

359
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,680
So I stopped by and bought it.

360
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,980
Let's go.

361
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,279
Good morning, Boss.

362
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,580
Good morning.

363
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,100
Boss just smiled at me.

364
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,820
Boss just smiled at me.

365
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,160
As for personnel aspects...

366
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,320
In this case...

367
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,980
Did you see that?

368
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,359
It's hard not to see it.

369
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,960
What's going on?

370
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,279
Do you know that?

371
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,879
Boss just smiled at me.

372
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,999
It's frightening.

373
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,319
It's been two years since I started working here.

374
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,860
Boss smiled at me for the first time ever.

375
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:31,160
It sent chills down my spine.

376
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,719
Boss must have eaten something... No.

377
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,039
I mean Boss has changed a lot recently.

378
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,180
Did you see what Jiang Xiaoning posted on Moments yesterday?

379
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:42,280
- No. 
 - Did she go skiing with Boss?

380
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:46,700
- My goodness. 
 - I've been working here for many years.

381
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,600
Director Gu had never talked to me personally except when he scolded me.

382
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,519
But she went skiing with Director Gu.

383
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,079
I'm jealous.

384
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,520
She must be getting a raise soon.

385
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,300
I've told you there's no chance for you.

386
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,099
Stop talking nonsense.

387
00:23:03,099 --> 00:23:05,360
Just telling the truth.

388
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:06,939
I'm late.

389
00:23:06,939 --> 00:23:09,160
All right, let's get back.

390
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:21,060
Director Gu, do you need something?

391
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,720
Where's Jiang Xiaoning?

392
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,340
She went out.

393
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,920
Went out?

394
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,979
Where did she go?

395
00:23:26,979 --> 00:23:28,599
She went for a meal with someone.

396
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,860
With her childhood sweetheart.

397
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,920
Childhood sweetheart?

398
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,879
The one we met at the hospital last time.

399
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,139
I was afraid she'd be late. I even asked her to leave earlier.

400
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,459
Director Gu, is there anything you need? I can help you.

401
00:23:44,459 --> 00:23:46,920
No, thanks.

402
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,519
It's just lunch. Don't you think it's too grand?

403
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:58,860
Don't care much about it. Just order.

404
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:01,519
Oh right, Xiaoning. How was the team-building event?

405
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,420
It was fun. I had a good time.

406
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:07,280
It's great then. You do need to unwind.

407
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,280
My boss is such a good boss.

408
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:15,639
He taught me how to design and also enlightened me.

409
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:20,380
When I'm with him, I'll feel like I'm growing up and learning.

410
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,719
And I'm so lucky to join this company.

411
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,400
He's very talented as well.

412
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,599
Speaking of which, I do have a project that I want to cooperate with your studio.

413
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:33,560
I also admire Gu Chuan's talent a lot.

414
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,959
If we work together on it, does it mean that

415
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,919
I can see you, a busy bee, every day?

416
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,399
Well, I don't know.

417
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,599
I don't take part in the early stage.

418
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,839
I don't accept the order.

419
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,279
I'm not the designer.

420
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,839
I'm just learning.

421
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,039
If you want to cooperate with our company, you can go and ask.

422
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,679
Through cooperation, the relationship between you and Director Xu

423
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,800
may be thawing.

424
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,719
All right. Let's eat first.

425
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,439
I'll starve to death waiting for you to order.

426
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,940
Waiter.

427
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,200
That's all.

428
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,599
 Next time when you go out, you have to ask me for leave 

429
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:37,180
 and get my permission. 

430
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:40,200
- What's the matter? 
 - I shouldn't have praised him.

431
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,900
Your boss?

432
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,219
I didn't inform him before leaving.

433
00:25:44,219 --> 00:25:45,879
I thought it'd be fine.

434
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,799
Every boss picks on their assistants.

435
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,199
Don't take it to heart.

436
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,800
It's my problem. I was careless.

437
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,120
If he's as good as you say,

438
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,399
he won't make such a thing difficult for you.

439
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,639
He didn't.

440
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,999
He said if I go out again, I need to

441
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,380
get his permission first to leave.

442
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,719
Oh, no. I've got to go.

443
00:26:07,719 --> 00:26:09,660
He hasn't eaten yet for sure.

444
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,519
He hasn't eaten. Why would you be so nervous?

445
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,701
You haven't eaten yet either.

446
00:26:12,701 --> 00:26:14,440
I'll be leaving, Brother Xu. Let's eat together next time.

447
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,280
- Enjoy your meal. Goodbye, Goodbye. 
 - Xiao Ning.

448
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,560
Did he really get mad?

449
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,359
Jia Jia, have you seen Boss?

450
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,759
He left a while ago.

451
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,519
Maybe he went for a meal.

452
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,640
Didn't he tell you?

453
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,800
All right, thank you.

454
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,300
Coming.

455
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,120
Why are you here?

456
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,459
Hurts, it hurts.

457
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:08,440
Let go of it.

458
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,479
A fortune-teller told me that I have to stay with

459
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,999
someone who's Virgo for at least eight hours today.

460
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,800
That's why I'm here.

461
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,720
A fortune teller

462
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,719
said you need to stay with someone who's Virgo for at least eight hours?

463
00:27:21,719 --> 00:27:24,519
Yan Yan, why are you so serious?

464
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,720
I'm just saying.

465
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,940
You! Get out of here.

466
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,040
Get out? Okay.  
  (T/N: Has the same meaning as "roll") 

467
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,980
Xu Chengran, let me tell you.

468
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,900
I should have recorded this and let everyone in the world see how foolish you are.

469
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,800
- No need. 
 - Roll again.

470
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,839
Dear fans, hello all.

471
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,719
Today, let me tell you how it feels to sleep on the sofa

472
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,220
at your girlfriend's place.

473
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,720
This is my girlfriend's house.

474
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,920
This is my girlfriend.

475
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,880
Are you insane? Get out of here quickly.

476
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,840
There's someone coming over later.

477
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,839
Who's coming over at this late night?

478
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,040
It's none of your business.

479
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,320
I'll ask just one question.

480
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:13,060
Is it a man or a man?

481
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,799
Jiang Xiaoning.

482
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,399
Do you think she's a man or a man?

483
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,580
Oh, Jiang Xiaoning.

484
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:23,400
Why is she coming? I'm telling her not to come.

485
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,399
Because the epiphyllum I've been longing for

486
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,680
is finally going to bloom today.

487
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,159
It vanishes as soon as it blooms. 
  (T/N: Something wonderful won't last long) 

488
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,439
It's such a romantic matter.

489
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,999
How could you exclude me?

490
00:28:33,999 --> 00:28:37,060
Besides, you'll need professional photography equipment.

491
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,560
I have it.

492
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,559
Hello?

493
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,320
Chuan, do you want to see blooming flowers?

494
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,439
At this late of night?

495
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,380
Are you drunk?

496
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,579
I didn't drink anything. I'm serious.

497
00:28:57,579 --> 00:29:00,320
We haven't seen blooming flowers at night ever, have we?

498
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,280
If I become rich...

499
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,199
No.

500
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,639
If I become as rich as you are, I will definitely take you

501
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,520
to the best brain surgeon.

502
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,559
I'm hanging up.

503
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,400
 Don't hang up yet. 

504
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,439
Listen. It's not the other types of flowers.

505
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,799
It's epiphyllum.

506
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,839
You've never seen it, right?

507
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,879
Neither have I.

508
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,260
It vanishes as soon as it blooms. Aren't you curious about it?

509
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:22,860
I'm not interested in it. Bye.

510
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,519
Let me finish.

511
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,199
I'm at Yan Yan's place.

512
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,959
Jiang Xiaoning will come over later.

513
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,479
She's such a third wheel.

514
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,140
Come here quickly and take her away.

515
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,880
I need quality time with Yan Yan. Do you get it?

516
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,359
Since you're begging me sincerely, I'll reluctantly agree then.

517
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:39,519
I'll check it out.

518
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,159
I know you love me.

519
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,240
Bring your camera here quickly. Be quick.

520
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,679
The epiphyllums are not waiting for us.

521
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,360
But my happiness is waiting for you.

522
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,360
Coming.

523
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:59,259
I asked you to bring me some professional equipment. Why are you just here?

524
00:29:59,259 --> 00:30:01,880
All the flowers are going to bloom.

525
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,720
Boss? Why are you here?

526
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,120
He forced me to come.

527
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:14,220
Yes. I threatened him with a knife on his neck to force him.

528
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,799
Why are you still standing there?

529
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,780
Come in and help me bring out the drinks quickly.

530
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,480
I'm going to get the drinks.

531
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,000
Boss, please come in.

532
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:29,319
Boss, are you still mad at what I did during the day?

533
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,959
I promise I won't do it again.

534
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,000
I'll tell you right away if there is anything.

535
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,179
Okay.

536
00:30:35,179 --> 00:30:38,260
You're the most generous boss ever.

537
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:41,000
It's a bit too much.

538
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,800
Let me help you.

539
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,980
Where's the professional equipment I asked you to bring?

540
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,279
Are you insane?

541
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,379
What kind of professional equipment is that?

542
00:31:00,379 --> 00:31:02,039
Everyone has it.

543
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,479
The professional one, do you understand?

544
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,999
Professional.

545
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,399
Just kidding.

546
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,359
Why would I ask Gu Chuan to come over?

547
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,159
He used to take pictures for National Geographic Magazine.

548
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,399
He climbed Mount Everest.

549
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,359
He's been to the South Pole and the North Pole.

550
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,239
He also took pictures of lions in the African savanna.

551
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,480
Most of all, his equipment is very professional.

552
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,860
I got this. Rest assured.

553
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,360
 Sister Yan Yan, the flowers are about to bloom. 

554
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,559
Amazing!

555
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,199
Let's all take a photo.

556
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,800
Come here.

557
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,700
Here we go.

558
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,860
Get ready.

559
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,319
Both of you. One forsook a friend for love. One left a friend in the lurch.

560
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:53,559
Just sat by and watched me get beaten.

561
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,000
Don't get in touch anymore. Bye!

562
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,900
Boss.

563
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,720
Is Director Xu really mad?

564
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,759
It's fine. Just get used to it.

565
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,360
The one who should be mad is Zhao Yan.

566
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,519
Certainly.

567
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,100
It's rare for epiphyllums to bloom.

568
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,680
Boss, I'll drive you home first.

569
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,999
It's been so late.

570
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,720
I'll drive you home first.

571
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,639
All right then.

572
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,199
Thank you for your hard work, Boss.

573
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,180
Mighty Boss.

574
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:46,840
Director Gu, that's all for this week.

575
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,259
It's done for Cheng Hai Apartment.

576
00:33:49,259 --> 00:33:50,719
The handover has started.

577
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,439
Besides, there's an internet-famous cafe that wants Manlin

578
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,520
to take on their project.

579
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,759
We haven't taken on the project of a cafe for two years,

580
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,319
but this cafe is very famous.

581
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,719
It's a lakeside cafe.

582
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,780
Many tourists consider it as a snap-worthy cafe.

583
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:09,300
It's not a big project. It's just renovation.

584
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:12,099
There's no need to mention this small project.

585
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:17,519
Cheng Dong, are you interested in this project?

586
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,359
It's fine for me.

587
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,200
But they requested Director Su to take on.

588
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,700
I'll handle this.

589
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,638
An internet-famous cafe is well-known already.

590
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,780
Everyone must be looking forward to the renovation.

591
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:35,300
If you need more helpers, you can take Jiang Xiaoning with you.

592
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,839
All right.

593
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,519
Jiang Xiaoning is pretty smart.

594
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,879
The proposal of the art gallery was suggested by her.

595
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,679
I think it's good.

596
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:46,719
As they've requested, I'll take it then.

597
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,818
With Jiang Xiaoning as well.

598
00:34:48,818 --> 00:34:50,199
Thank you, Sister Manlin. Thank you, Boss.

599
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:52,139
I'll work hard.

600
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:55,279
Take a good look at Su Manlin's design proposal

601
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,760
to get to know her style.

602
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,040
Okay. I've read it already.

603
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,320
I'll read it again.

604
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,039
 Internet-famous cafe. 

605
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,039
 That's great. 

606
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,960
 I didn't expect to get such a good chance. 

607
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,639
Set aside your work first.

608
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,800
Follow me to the site.

609
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,815
   

610
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:42,063
   
   

611
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,040
How is it?

612
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,060
Your idea is going to be presented.

613
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,500
How do you feel?

614
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,900
It gives me a sense of achievement.

615
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:17,520
It's the greatest charm of being a designer.

616
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,480
I believe there'll be more buildings designed by you.

617
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,020
You're so confident in me?

618
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:26,520
I'm confident in myself.

619
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:30,120
I want to take a photo with this sense of achievement.

620
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,800
My phone really ran out of battery this time.

621
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,500
I'll help you then. Where?

622
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,600
Thank you, Boss. Here.

623
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,640
Get ready.

624
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:51,140
- Done. 
 - Let me have a look.

625
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,340
Thank you, Boss.

626
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:56,360
It's awesome.

627
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,560
I like it very much.

628
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,599
I'll send the photo to you later.

629
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,320
Thank you, Boss.

630
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:14,639
Boss, you look different today.

631
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:16,340
Let's go.

632
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:19,280
You look like a teenage boy today.

633
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,420
Why would you have time to come over?

634
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,039
Mom called me yesterday.

635
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,679
She told me to visit you often when I have time.

636
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,799
Or else we'll gradually drift apart.

637
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,220
And you won't let me inherit family possessions.

638
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,040
See?

639
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,040
Now you know why I'm not with your mom anymore.

640
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,639
Because the only thing she cares about is money.

641
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,740
Not me.

642
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:51,060
If money doesn't matter,

643
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,439
why don't you just get a divorce?

644
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,760
You've been living separately for so many years.

645
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,120
Oh, right. I just saw Assistant Liu leaving.

646
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,940
He was here just now.

647
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:07,060
There's someone with him who looks familiar.

648
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,840
Do you know him?

649
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,780
No.

650
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:13,780
 You come with me and everything will be fine. 

651
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:17,979
But I recognize his eyes. It reminds me of the one who tried to rob me.

652
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:26,780
What did you say? Someone tried to rob you?

653
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:29,920
Maybe it's because I have an outstanding appearance.

654
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,720
You'd better be careful.

655
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,980
If such a situation happens again, let me know right away.

656
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,680
Okay?

657
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:44,079
Are you afraid that the robber would demand a ransom?

658
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,439
- You... 
 - All right, the visiting task is over.

659
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,440
I'll leave now.

660
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:51,799
Leave all your money to my mom, not me.

661
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,400
I don't like it, but she does.

662
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,839
The two owners of the cafÃ© used to pursue studies in Britain.

663
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,439
Small events are organized on the first floor.

664
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,479
There's a brand experience platform integrating catering, retails,

665
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,360
and lifestyle on the second floor.

666
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,519
Next to it is the lounge.

667
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,060
Before this, it was a Scandinavian design.

668
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,239
Okay, I got it.

669
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,560
You can send me the documents.

670
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,120
- Jiang Xiaoning. 
 - Boss.

671
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,660
You need to go out with us. You'll drive.

672
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,260
Okay.

673
00:41:37,719 --> 00:41:39,859
Pardon me. I'm a photographer.

674
00:41:39,859 --> 00:41:41,719
I saw you staring blankly here.

675
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,660
And it matches the scenery.

676
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,600
So I took some photos of you. Is that okay?

677
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,239
Me? But I'm not good-looking.

678
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,700
You are good-looking.

679
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:53,980
Don't worry. These photos are not for commercial purposes.

680
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,959
I didn't bring my employee ID card with me.

681
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,259
But I don't have any bad intentions.

682
00:41:57,259 --> 00:42:00,359
I think it looks good, so I wanted to snap it for you.

683
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,660
Look.

684
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,159
It looks great indeed.

685
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,319
Thank you.

686
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,159
It's nothing.

687
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,400
It's because you're good-looking.

688
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,879
Could you give me your email?

689
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,880
I'll send the photos to you.

690
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,639
Or we can add friends on WeChat? What do you think?

691
00:42:16,339 --> 00:42:17,839
Okay.

692
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,580
Okay.

693
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,199
I'm Chen Wenwen.

694
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,100
I'm Jiang Xiaoning.

695
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,899
I'll get going. I'll send the photos to you.

696
00:42:27,899 --> 00:42:29,500
Okay.

697
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:38,000
Why is there such a beautiful and talented fairylike girl?

698
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:48,990
