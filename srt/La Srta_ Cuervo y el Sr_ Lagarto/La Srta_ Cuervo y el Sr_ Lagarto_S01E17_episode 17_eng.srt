00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,859
♫  I can't help but feel a little happy  ♫

3
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:23,459
♫  I can't help but feel a little nervous  ♫

4
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,840
♫  The earth is turning because of you  ♫

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,260
♫  Without you, the earth stops  ♫

6
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:34,340
♫  You are the rainbow that fills up the black and white  ♫

7
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,939
♫  I was once obsessed with the legend of the four-leaf clover  ♫

8
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:44,619
♫  I dreamed of a white-horse carriage and 
you becoming my prince  ♫

♫  Your gaze is too seducing, please save me  ♫

10
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:53,420
♫  I'm turning into a moth, flying towards the fire  ♫

15
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,499
♫  I can't help but be a little fragile  ♫

16
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,160
♫  I can't help but feel a little gloomy  ♫

17
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,600
♫  The sky is bright because of you  ♫

18
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,819
♫  Without you, the sky is grey  ♫

19
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:33,379
♫  You are the angel who takes away all loneliness  ♫

20
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:37,060
   

21
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,160
   

22
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,080
Hello?

23
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,420
Thank God. You finally picked up.

24
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,420
We got so worried when we couldn't reach you.

25
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,700
Everyone is looking for you.

26
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,640
I left early.

27
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,540
That's okay. As long as you're okay.

28
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,519
By the way, I have some things to deal with.

29
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,359
I won't be going to the office for a while.

30
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,500
Help me take care of things.

31
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,919
Chuan, you don't sound okay.

32
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,440
How about I get Jiang Xiaoning to keep you company?

33
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,280
Or else I'll worry.

34
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,580
 No need. 

35
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,500
I'm fine.

36
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,980
If something happens, I'll call you.

37
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,580
 Okay then. 

38
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,700
Wang Kai, why would Boss skip work for no reason?

39
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,319
This is the first time.

40
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,400
He has never even been late before.

41
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,159
You don't get it.

42
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,100
If you don't come to work, it's called skipping work.

43
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,480
If Boss doesn't come to work, that's just called...

44
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,959
just called not coming to work.

45
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,120
I'm just curious.

46
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,600
I'll ask around for you.

47
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,999
Xiaoning, you're on good terms with Director Gu.

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,759
Do you know why he didn't come?

49
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,060
No, I don't.

50
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,820
She doesn't know.

51
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,399
 Is it because of me? 

52
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,899
 Did he not come to work because he didn't want to see me? 

53
00:03:28,899 --> 00:03:31,620
Jiang Xiaoning, come over here and take notes.

54
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,920
Okay.

55
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,380
Tell me your thoughts.

56
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,040
She wants to do the exhibition on the top floor

57
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,039
mainly because of the night scenery.

58
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,439
So I intend to turn the east-facing side

59
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,199
into a one-way mirror completely.

60
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,599
That way the inside is see-through and the exterior is glass.

61
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,760
This way, we can ensure privacy and...

62
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,600
Jiang Xiaoning, did you take down what we just discussed?

63
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,260
I...

64
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,160
Where was I just now? Oh yes, about the direction.

65
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,760
Sorry, Sister Wenwen is calling me. Can I take the call?

66
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,820
Of course. A venture capitalist is calling, of course, you need to pick up.

67
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,999
Hurry up, don't make her wait.

68
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,940
Take the call. It's okay.

69
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,239
Hello, Sister Wenwen.

70
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,879
 Hello, Xiaoning, are you busy? 

71
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,078
Sorry to disturb you.

72
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,679
I have something to talk to you about.

73
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,239
How about we have lunch together during your lunch break?

74
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,180
 My treat. 

75
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,420
Sure. I'll bring you the design proposal then.

76
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,099
Okay. I'll send you the address in a bit.

77
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,560
See you at noon.

78
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,780
Chen Wenwen asked you out?

79
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,680
For a meal.

80
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,860
Just you alone? Without Chen Dong?

81
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,040
I want to eat with a pretty girl, too, but she didn't ask for me.

82
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,159
I'm not too sure either.

83
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,980
But don't worry, I can explain our proposal to her thoroughly.

84
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,500
- Let's continue. 
 - Okay.

85
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,360
So it's all about the night scenery. It's super beautiful.

86
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,120
It sets a certain kind of mood.

87
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,759
Sorry, I got caught up sorting out some files.

88
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,519
It's okay.

89
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,319
You'll improve very quickly working at Gu Chuan's studio.

90
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,760
And I'm very confident about leaving this project to you.

91
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,119
I can't compare with you guys.

92
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,439
I'm sometimes still not used to interacting, getting to know,

93
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,520
and working with you guys.

94
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,279
You have your own strengths.

95
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,540
You're warm and cheerful, persistent, and hardworking.

96
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,440
Everyone can see that.

97
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,800
I like you a lot. I think you're very sincere and cute.

98
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,319
From the first time I saw you, I thought you were really pretty.

99
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,599
After spending time with you, I think you're really outstanding.

100
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,719
Not arrogant and very empathetic.

101
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,559
I'm a girl and I like you.

102
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,700
But if I were a boy, I would definitely like a girl like you, too.

103
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,540
You want to talk about Gu Chuan, right?

104
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,439
You don't need to have your guard up against me.

105
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,260
I'm not your enemy.

106
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,800
Su Manlin told you, right?

107
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,020
I don't want to comment on people I don't know,

108
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,180
but I'm not sure why she told you about something

109
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,200
that happened so long ago.

110
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,999
I'm Gu Chuan's ex-girlfriend. I don't deny that.

111
00:06:11,999 --> 00:06:16,079
But when I first met you, I really didn't know about your relationship with him.

112
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,700
I also never expected that it would cause you trouble.

113
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,119
Sister Wenwen, you didn't cause any trouble.

114
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,320
It's my problem.

115
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,380
I can feel your sincerity towards him.

116
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,759
I can't really get involved with the two of you.

117
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,740
But if you were affected by me, I hope to clear things up with you.

118
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,340
No, I'm not.

119
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,319
Should I show you the blueprint now or later?

120
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,839
Let's go to the site later.

121
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,319
You can explain it to me while we're there.

122
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,959
It's easier to understand this way.

123
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,359
My imagination isn't great.

124
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,460
Maybe that's why I can only do photography and not design.

125
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,060
Okay.

126
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,559
Hello, your food.

127
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,860
Thank you.

128
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,399
Let's talk while eating.

129
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,080
See if the food here suits your appetite.

130
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,480
Okay.

131
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,040
I initially didn't want to take on your case.

132
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,140
Is it because of who I am?

133
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,239
I don't have animosity towards you.

134
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,140
I'm just slightly afraid to see you.

135
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,480
Simply put, I'm running away.

136
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,500
I don't deny that I once loved him.

137
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:40,279
Actually, after so many years, I still admire and respect him.

138
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,400
I hope we can all find our own happiness.

139
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,740
This is me being open with you.

140
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:54,420
I did once regret leaving him, leaving this city,

141
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,860
during his darkest days.

142
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:01,320
But now that I think about it, maybe this was all meant to be.

143
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:05,800
We cannot accept each other as we are right now,

144
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,660
do you know what I mean?

145
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,160
How's your relationship with your ex-boyfriend?

146
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,279
I don't have an ex-boyfriend.

147
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,540
I haven't dated anyone yet.

148
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,460
Then let me share a secret with you.

149
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,999
Don't fall in love with a man because he loves you.

150
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,820
What does that mean?

151
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:37,199
If a man, by nature, is cold, emotionless, and hot-tempered,

152
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,798
or has some flaws which you cannot accept,

153
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:43,420
but he temporarily disguises them because of you,

154
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,479
don't ever be with him.

155
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,999
If there's another guy,

156
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,359
whom you feel even if you're not in a relationship with,

157
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,839
or if you were dating and you went your separate ways,

158
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:56,679
but you still admire him, respect him, and don't regret loving him,

159
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,160
then that is a relationship worth having.

160
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,879
Sister Wenwen, you put it so well.

161
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,260
I almost fell for you.

162
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,740
I hope Gu Chuan can find his happiness.

163
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:13,180
When I was in my 20s, I didn't fight for my love.

164
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,519
It took me a while to get over that.

165
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,279
But I don't have any regrets.

166
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,780
I hope you won't miss it.

167
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,599
Fight for what you want.

168
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,959
You're already doing great.

169
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,060
No one can stop you.

170
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,540
Hello, Lawyer Huang, are you busy?

171
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,800
 Yes, I'm sorting out the documents you gave me previously. 

172
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,820
I want to set up a fund.

173
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,220
For yourself?

174
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,100
 There are a lot of outstanding university students 

175
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,839
 who are unable to attend university for various reasons. 

176
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,740
I want to set up a fund to help these underprivileged students

177
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,399
finish their studies.

178
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,340
Of course, I know our country is doing a lot on this front,

179
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,279
which is why I want to set up this fund

180
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,620
for the architectural industry.

181
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,719
Okay, I'll look into it for you.

182
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,400
Also...

183
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,540
my will.

184
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,999
I've discussed this matter with you every single time.

185
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,439
I already know that you won't change your mind.

186
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,700
I'll follow your instructions.

187
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,480
I want to make some changes to my will.

188
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,380
You don't need to notarize it for now.

189
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,759
Let me think about it.

190
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,919
I'll give you a call once I've thought about it.

191
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,140
 Sure, contact me anytime. 

192
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,540
 Bye-bye. 

193
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:06,680
Actually, I've already confessed to Boss.

194
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,080
And?

195
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,600
And then he asked me to stop talking.

196
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:19,780
This is tricky.

197
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,260
It doesn't sound like him...

198
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,000
but it also sounds like something he would do.

199
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,639
But I think you need to trust him.

200
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,640
Believe that the man you love is someone who is mature.

201
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,559
He has his considerations.

202
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:45,020
When the time is right, he will share his thoughts with you.

203
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,319
Thank you, Sister Wenwen. Really.

204
00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:49,959
I feel really lucky to have met you.

205
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,860
Well then, cheers!

206
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,039
- Keep pushing. 
 - Absolutely.

207
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,720
Xiaoning?

208
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,880
Xiaoning,

209
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,400
we're here.

210
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,919
Sorry, Sister Wenwen.

211
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,099
I didn't sleep well last night. I'm too tired.

212
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,699
How could I fall asleep while going to the site with a client?

213
00:12:43,699 --> 00:12:45,639
I'm sorry. That's so unprofessional of me.

214
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,900
It's okay.

215
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,439
It shows that you really trust me.

216
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,399
- For sure. 
 - Let's go.

217
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,920
Okay.

218
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,439
This place is going to be renovated too, right?

219
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,459
Yes, it will be renovated.

220
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:16,960
I heard Sister Manlin and Brother Dong talking about it at the office.

221
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,400
Okay.

222
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,200
Be careful.

223
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,920
We're here.

224
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,399
I want to shoot the night scenery here tonight to give the designers a reference.

225
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:43,679
Their design incorporates the night scenery here.

226
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,079
I think it's great.

227
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,439
Sure. Need me to help you take pictures?

228
00:13:47,439 --> 00:13:51,780
It's okay, Even having you press the shutter would cost a lot.

229
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,960
It's so high up. I feel a little scared standing up here.

230
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,600
Are you scared of heights?

231
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,099
Not really. Compared to heights, darkness is even scarier.

232
00:14:05,099 --> 00:14:07,899
- It's lit at night. 
 - Okay.

233
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,340
Hello?

234
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,000
What happened?

235
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,359
Wait for me. I'll head over to pick you up.

236
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,859
My cellphone is running out of battery.

237
00:14:31,859 --> 00:14:34,720
Send me your location, so I can tell the driver.

238
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,279
It's going to rain soon. Wait for me.

239
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,780
Okay.

240
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,000
Xiaoning, my husband's car got submerged under the bridge.

241
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,179
I have to go pick him up.

242
00:14:46,179 --> 00:14:48,719
I'll leave the keys at the door. Remember to lock the door when you leave.

243
00:14:48,719 --> 00:14:50,179
Sure, don't worry. I'll lock the door.

244
00:14:50,179 --> 00:14:52,179
- Be careful. 
 - Okay.

245
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,699
No way. Such bad luck?

246
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,500
 Hello, the number you've just dialed is switched off. 

247
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,780
Sister Wenwen.

248
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,720
Is anyone there?

249
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,480
Is… Is anyone there?

250
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,159
Pick up the phone, pick up the phone.

251
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,980
Hello?

252
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,560
Boss, can you come over to open the door for me?

253
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,360
 I didn't want to bother you initially, 

254
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,100
but I really couldn't find anyone else.

255
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,699
What's going on? Where are you?

256
00:18:13,699 --> 00:18:15,480
An Tai Building.

257
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,079
I came here with Sister Wenwen.

258
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,839
She left first because she had something to do.

259
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,119
 I… I'm stuck on the roof. 

260
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,400
I can't get out.

261
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,479
You're on the rooftop while it's raining? That's too dangerous.

262
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,780
Find shelter and wait for me.

263
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,560
Wait for me.

264
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,380
Okay, I'll wait for you.

265
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,880
 Hello, the number you've just dialed is switched off. 

266
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,460
 The phone you are calling... 

267
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,619
   

268
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:46,940
Hello, Sir. How may I help you?

269
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,939
Hello. My friend is stuck on the roof.

270
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:50,559
Please go up and take a look immediately.

271
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,140
- Are you sure it's this building? 
 - I'm sure.

272
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,640
Follow me.

273
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,899
- Where's the key? 
 - It was at the security office.

274
00:20:19,899 --> 00:20:22,979
But the roof was rented out, it should be with the tenant.

275
00:20:22,979 --> 00:20:24,679
Isn't there a spare?

276
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,699
That's at the headquarters. But it's too far from here.

277
00:20:26,699 --> 00:20:28,320
We can't deliver it here.

278
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,960
Hurry, call the police now.

279
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:53,119
We've already called the police. They should be here soon.

280
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,660
We don't have enough time.

281
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,459
Could you please lock the elevator on the first floor and make sure it stays there?

282
00:20:57,459 --> 00:20:59,019
Don't let anyone touch the elevator.

283
00:20:59,019 --> 00:21:00,459
Sir, you're...

284
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,259
Every elevator has a maintenance floor.

285
00:21:02,259 --> 00:21:03,779
I can enter from the elevator shaft

286
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:05,139
and exit from the maintenance floor.

287
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:07,200
I can reach the rooftop this way.

288
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,319
That's too dangerous, Sir. If anything were to happen to you, I can't take responsibility.

289
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:11,859
If something were to happen to the person on the roof, will you take responsibility then?

290
00:21:11,859 --> 00:21:14,499
That's not what I meant. What I meant was the firemen are coming soon.

291
00:21:14,499 --> 00:21:17,060
I can't wait any longer.

292
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,299
I'm sorry.

293
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:24,719
I'm an architectural designer, so I'm very familiar with the whole structure of this building.

294
00:21:24,719 --> 00:21:27,960
As long as you keep a lookout for the elevator, nothing will happen to me.

295
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,180
The most important thing right now is to save that person.

296
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,679
That girl is very important to me.

297
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,620
Please.

298
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,039
Okay, Sir.

299
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,619
Be careful. I'll keep a lookout for the elevator.

300
00:21:41,619 --> 00:21:43,260
Thank you.

301
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,960
Jiang Xiaoning!

302
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,019
Boss!

303
00:22:59,019 --> 00:23:00,439
Are you okay?

304
00:23:00,439 --> 00:23:03,479
I'm fine. The door is locked.

305
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,500
Get out of the way.

306
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,440
No, Boss. You'll hurt yourself.

307
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,500
Stay away.

308
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,380
Now.

309
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,000
No.

310
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,520
No.

311
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,920
Are you okay?

312
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:06,719
Boss, I knew you'd come.

313
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:22,800
Jiang Xiaoning! Jiang Xiaoning!

314
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,819
This bag is for Jiang Xiaoning.

315
00:25:56,819 --> 00:25:59,440
Ask her to drink one when she wakes up.

316
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,440
Now, you know how important it is for me to stay with you.

317
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,619
Thanks.

318
00:26:05,619 --> 00:26:07,880
Knock it off.

319
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,020
How is she?

320
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,060
It's all my fault.

321
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:16,399
She got scared and got an electric shock.

322
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,319
You saved her, okay?

323
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:22,800
If you weren't there, the thunderbolt might have struck her directly.

324
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,019
Strangely enough,

325
00:26:24,019 --> 00:26:26,319
Jiang Xiaoning always gets involved in accidents when there is a thunderstorm.

326
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:29,100
You two make quite a match.

327
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,900
I'm just kidding.

328
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,439
Are you thinking about something weird again?

329
00:26:35,439 --> 00:26:38,160
What weird things can I think about?

330
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:42,139
Once you're fully charged, go back and reset.

331
00:26:42,139 --> 00:26:43,719
I'll take care of her.

332
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,019
I want to stay with her.

333
00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:49,159
Your body won't be able to go on like this.

334
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:50,339
It's okay.

335
00:26:50,339 --> 00:26:52,300
I know what I'm doing.

336
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,000
What are you doing?

337
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,960
Do you know what people need the most when they catch a cold?

338
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,580
What?

339
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,680
Cold medicine.

340
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,420
Do you know what you need the most right now?

341
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,060
Cold medicine?

342
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:23,240
You need me.

343
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,800
You stay with her. I stay with you then.

344
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,540
I owe it to you. 
   (T/N: in a sarcastic way) 

345
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,900
Boss.

346
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,660
You're awake.

347
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,339
Boss, are you okay?

348
00:28:07,339 --> 00:28:09,040
I'm okay.

349
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,139
Don't move.

350
00:28:12,139 --> 00:28:13,299
Your fever was just reduced.

351
00:28:13,299 --> 00:28:15,399
The doctor said you need to rest.

352
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,360
I'm fine.

353
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,239
I told you not to move.

354
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,420
Why don't you listen to me?

355
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:25,520
Boss, I just want to drink some water.

356
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,660
I'll get it for you.

357
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,520
Have I been paralyzed by the electric shock?

358
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,699
Boss, did you stay with me this entire time?

359
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,819
How do you feel now?

360
00:28:59,819 --> 00:29:02,039
Does it hurt?

361
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,839
No.

362
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:06,140
I'm just a little weak.

363
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,100
You should rest for a couple more days.

364
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:13,840
Boss, do you have superpowers?

365
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,799
What do you mean?

366
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:20,459
People around you will get hit by thunderbolts when there is a thunderstorm.

367
00:29:20,459 --> 00:29:23,040
Last time, He Sheng got hit too.

368
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,879
Maybe, I'm a human lightning conductor.

369
00:29:26,879 --> 00:29:29,300
My body produces a greater amount of power.

370
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,420
Maybe I swear too much?

371
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:39,560
You flatter more than you swear.

372
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,619
♫   His hair was for you   ♫

373
00:29:42,619 --> 00:29:44,600
Thank you, Boss.

374
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,339
♫   But there was nothing to do   ♫

375
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,499
♫   You will throw away all your worries   ♫

376
00:29:48,499 --> 00:29:49,479
 I'm at the hospital. 

377
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,680
 Which room is Xiaoning in? 

378
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,779
You should rest a bit. I'm going to get you some food.

379
00:29:54,779 --> 00:29:56,880
Thanks, Boss.

380
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:08,540
You don't think I intentionally locked her up on the rooftop, do you?

381
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,019
I know you.

382
00:30:10,019 --> 00:30:12,440
You wouldn't do anything like that.

383
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,719
I'm responsible though.

384
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,919
I shouldn't have left her there by herself.

385
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,439
I was answering a call.

386
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,079
I don't remember too much detail.

387
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:23,199
But I'm certain I didn't lock the door.

388
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,240
I also left the key at the door.

389
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,620
It's okay. Don't blame yourself.

390
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:36,000
Oh, did you mention what happened to my heart to her

391
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,280
when you were eating together?

392
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,000
No.

393
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,620
You should tell her about these things yourself.

394
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,060
Thank you.

395
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,660
You like her. Right?

396
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,780
Right.

397
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,000
Then, why did you turn her down?

398
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,160
She's a very simple girl.

399
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,760
You'll hurt her.

400
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,400
Don't say I'm overstepping.

401
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,580
I just want you to be happy.

402
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:14,210
But you look really terrible.

403
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:18,539
You isolate yourself by running away from your true feelings

404
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:20,740
and hurting others.

405
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,700
Maybe I'm wrong.

406
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,560
But you look exactly the same

407
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,640
as you were ten years ago.

408
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,760
You want to leave this world.

409
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,780
Gu Chuan,

410
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:42,180
don't let Jiang Xiaoning become a second me.

411
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,560
You need her.

412
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,820
You need this relationship.

413
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,279
You should trust her.

414
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:54,420
Trust that she'll stay with you no matter what happens.

415
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:00,000
It has been ten years.

416
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,200
Although I'm still alive, I'm just staying alive.

417
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,339
It's not that I want it this way.

418
00:32:07,339 --> 00:32:11,480
It's because I just can't live like a normal person.

419
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:16,220
I gave up all my hobbies

420
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:20,520
and even you for this mechanical heart.

421
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,080
To live with it,

422
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,059
I can't laugh out loud when I'm happy.

423
00:32:25,059 --> 00:32:26,899
I can't drink when I'm upset.

424
00:32:26,899 --> 00:32:30,759
When I'm angry, I can't touch anyone or anything.

425
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,340
I've been controlling my emotions all this time.

426
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:38,740
However, it still reminds me all the time that

427
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:41,460
I don't have the ability to love anyone.

428
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:50,140
Now, this mechanical heart is performing worse and worse.

429
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:56,060
The pain it brings me makes me feel that every day is so long.

430
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:00,100
I certainly had thought of...

431
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,160
ending it.

432
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,280
What about Jiang Xiaoning?

433
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,320
What about you two?

434
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,480
Jiang Xiaoning.

435
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,820
She is a real accident.

436
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:19,360
She interrupted all my plans.

437
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:24,720
The old me never expected the next day to come.

438
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,880
Ever since she came into my life,

439
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,580
I started to look forward to going to work.

440
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,720
I look forward to seeing her.

441
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,179
I look forward to listening to her nonsense.

442
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:39,199
I look forward to seeing her following me around

443
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,440
and flattering me every day.

444
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,380
What will you do?

445
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:55,520
I'm in a dilemma.

446
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:01,840
Ten years ago, you insisted on pushing me away.

447
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,140
Ten years later,

448
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:08,980
you want to do the same to another girl?

449
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,560
   

450
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:29,800
   

451
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,480
Yan Yan.

452
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,239
You're here.

453
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,080
Why are you here?

454
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,559
They both got hurt last night.

455
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,660
I'm worried.

456
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:44,699
I was going to call you, but I was afraid you would worry.

457
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:47,859
The doctor said they're both fine.

458
00:34:48,579 --> 00:34:51,219
Then you should have called me last night.

459
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:54,780
If you were worried, we should be here together.

460
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,900
I didn't stay up all night for nothing.

461
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,080
So Gu Chuan climbed from the elevator shaft and

462
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,279
crashed through the glass door to save you?

463
00:35:16,279 --> 00:35:17,959
It was super scary.

464
00:35:17,959 --> 00:35:19,039
I still get scared even by thinking about it.

465
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,979
If anything had happened to him, I don't want to live either.

466
00:35:20,979 --> 00:35:22,779
Stop it. What are you talking about?

467
00:35:22,779 --> 00:35:25,040
You're all good now.

468
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:30,720
What he has done has proved that you're important to him.

469
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,860
This is different from what you had told me before.

470
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:37,000
He still turned me down.

471
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,259
This is odd.

472
00:35:39,259 --> 00:35:42,419
First of all, he's not a playboy.

473
00:35:42,419 --> 00:35:45,260
My playboy radar didn't go off.

474
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:49,580
Also, he hasn't been in contact with other girls, right?

475
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,619
If he sees you as a backup,

476
00:35:51,619 --> 00:35:54,300
he wouldn't have risked his life to save you.

477
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,600
Then, why did he turn me down?

478
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,979
Maybe he's inexperienced?

479
00:36:00,979 --> 00:36:02,159
He doesn't look that way.

480
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,620
He is the owner of a big company after all.

481
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,480
I think you should be more proactive.

482
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,120
Jiang Xiaoning.

483
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,759
You've already done something, right?

484
00:36:22,759 --> 00:36:24,239
No, don't just make a wild guess.

485
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:25,959
You lied.

486
00:36:25,959 --> 00:36:27,399
I know every single thought of yours.

487
00:36:27,399 --> 00:36:28,939
Don't think you can hide things from me.

488
00:36:28,939 --> 00:36:30,779
Confess right now.

489
00:36:30,779 --> 00:36:32,299
Did you kiss him?

490
00:36:32,299 --> 00:36:33,439
Hug him?

491
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,279
- Or you guys have already... 
 - No.

492
00:36:36,279 --> 00:36:39,119
But this time I learned one thing.

493
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,719
Just like what you and Sister Wenwen had said.

494
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,379
First, he is someone worth loving.

495
00:36:44,379 --> 00:36:47,319
So I need to work hard to shorten the distance between us.

496
00:36:47,319 --> 00:36:49,019
Even if nothing happens in the end,

497
00:36:49,019 --> 00:36:52,459
that would be because I'm not the right fit or I'm not good enough.

498
00:36:52,459 --> 00:36:53,619
It would have nothing to do with him.

499
00:36:53,619 --> 00:36:56,859
But if I give up now, I'll regret it for sure.

500
00:36:56,859 --> 00:37:01,320
So I plan to go with the flow and deal with things as they happen.

501
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,739
Look at you. Spewing out words of wisdom.

502
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:07,860
Looks like love does make people grow.

503
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,619
What if he is a playboy?

504
00:37:09,619 --> 00:37:11,739
Didn't you say your playboy radar didn't go off?

505
00:37:11,739 --> 00:37:13,759
I... I... I'm not omnipotent.

506
00:37:13,759 --> 00:37:15,559
How can I be a hundred percent accurate?

507
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,139
Then, you were wrong about Director Xu?

508
00:37:17,139 --> 00:37:18,379
I wasn't wrong about him.

509
00:37:18,379 --> 00:37:20,120
Let me tell you something.

510
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,880
Am I interrupting?

511
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,980
No. Oh right. I have something to do.

512
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,420
I'm leaving Xiaoning to you.

513
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,159
 Do you want to eat something? 

514
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:43,879
We will do one more examination.

515
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,379
If nothing is wrong, you can go home.

516
00:37:45,379 --> 00:37:47,140
Thank you, Boss.

517
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,160
Going home?

518
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,499
I'll drive you home.

519
00:38:05,499 --> 00:38:06,920
No, thanks.

520
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,060
Did you drive?

521
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,720
No.

522
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,139
If you want to call a cab, you'd better go across the street.

523
00:38:18,139 --> 00:38:20,360
It's hard to park in front of the hospital.

524
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,560
Bye-bye.

525
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,359
It's really hard to ask you out.

526
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,279
Why are you here?

527
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,300
Recently, I've been...

528
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,280
out of luck.

529
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,020
Come with me.

530
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,879
Director Xu just gave you money not long ago.

531
00:39:13,879 --> 00:39:15,299
And his son almost found out about it.

532
00:39:15,299 --> 00:39:17,599
My brother went to prison for you guys.

533
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,639
He ought to give me money.

534
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:22,499
Don't waste my time. I'll leave once you give me the money.

535
00:39:22,499 --> 00:39:25,460
It won't look good if other people see us.

536
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,120
What now?

537
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,139
You don't want to give me money?

538
00:39:32,139 --> 00:39:33,179
All right.

539
00:39:33,179 --> 00:39:34,519
I'll ask Director Xu.

540
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,880
Come back.

541
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:49,660
You cannot come here anymore. Do you hear me?

542
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,339
Okay. I'll follow your orders.

543
00:39:51,339 --> 00:39:52,760
Follow your orders.

544
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:56,400
Chen Ao, if I see you here again,

545
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,480
things won't end well for you.

546
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,539
Get in.

547
00:40:12,539 --> 00:40:14,139
Shouldn't I drive?

548
00:40:14,139 --> 00:40:15,540
I'll drive today.

549
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:18,180
Boss, although I got scared a little bit,

550
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,730
I should still do my job.

551
00:40:20,739 --> 00:40:21,939
Just do as I say.

552
00:40:21,939 --> 00:40:23,319
I'll drive today.

553
00:40:23,319 --> 00:40:25,999
Get in. Come on.

554
00:40:25,999 --> 00:40:27,780
Take it easy.

555
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,400
Sit still.

556
00:41:04,279 --> 00:41:06,779
 Chuan, do you remember me telling you 

557
00:41:06,779 --> 00:41:08,239
 that someone attacked me? 

558
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,040
 I was able to take a photo of that person today. 

559
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:36,060
   

560
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:02,000
Hello, Lawyer Huang. Please do me another favor.

561
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,159
 What is it? 

562
00:42:03,159 --> 00:42:04,219
Look into a person for me.

563
00:42:04,219 --> 00:42:05,559
Find out as much detail as possible.

564
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:10,120
This person is the truck driver who hit me back then.

565
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:14,040
Didn't he die in prison?

566
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,980
My friend took a photo of him.

567
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:18,439
What? No way.

568
00:42:18,439 --> 00:42:20,199
I'm surprised as well.

569
00:42:20,199 --> 00:42:21,880
I'll send you the photo now.

570
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,119
 Okay. I'll look into him as soon as possible. 

571
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,520
Okay.

572
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:45,040
   

573
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:54,980


574
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,299
♫  Destiny is a little annoying  ♫

575
00:43:05,299 --> 00:43:08,260
♫  It takes those I care about  ♫

576
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:11,900
♫  Away from me  ♫

577
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:13,740
♫  If memory is bright  ♫

578
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:16,820
♫  It would hold up a lamp in my heart  ♫

579
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:20,260
♫  And light up the night  ♫

580
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,839
♫  Sunshine alternates with moonlight  ♫

581
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:44,819
♫  Returning to life in time  ♫

582
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:48,220
♫  Gift me with a dream  ♫

583
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:52,500
♫  A dream with you in it  ♫

584
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:21,639
♫  The one who caught me off guard  ♫

585
00:44:21,639 --> 00:44:25,980
♫  Steps foot into my life...  ♫

586
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:34,620
♫  It's you...  ♫

587
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:38,900
♫  If it weren't for parting  ♫

00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:52,720
♫  It's you...  ♫

00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,759
♫  Exchanging sunshine for moonlight  ♫

591
00:44:54,759 --> 00:44:57,839
♫  Exchanging fortune for the past  ♫

592
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:02,500
♫  Exchanging my heartbeat for you  ♫
