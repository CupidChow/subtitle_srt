1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You don't understand to say you want to be apart from me

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
In my arms, you are asleep

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
How can you hide in my soft heart?

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I want to be closer to you, be your little star

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm always around you, never leaving you, never leaving you

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I want to be closer to you, protect your secret

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I will always look for you

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm waiting for you

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I want to be closer to you, be your little star

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm always around you, never leaving you, never leaving you

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I want to be closer to you, protect your secret

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I will always look for you

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I will always be with you

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Protect you

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yufan

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Yufan

17
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Thank you

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
For what?

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Thank you for changing so much for me

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Did you drink?

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What are you talking about?

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Nanxi told me a lot today

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Thank you for the change you made for me

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Let's play over there

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Hello, I'm here in Nanxi

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Come and pick me up

27
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Why did you go there again?

28
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's a long story

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I had a stomachache yesterday

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I was brought back by Nanxi

31
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But now I'm better after a break

32
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Come and pick me up

33
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What did you say?

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm not going to the hospital

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm going to the hospital

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm going to the hospital

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm going to the hospital

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What did you say?

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I said I had a stomachache

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm better now

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Come and pick me up

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Okay, wait a minute

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'll be right there

44
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You're so ridiculous

45
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It stinks

46
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
What stinks?

47
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You're good

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The door is finally open

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What do you mean?

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The light is on

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Look, you've cleaned up

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You're so shameless

53
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
What are you talking about?

54
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It was an accident last night

55
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So you're saying you're going to use this accident?

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
What are you doing?

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
What are you doing?

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Don't worry

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
What?

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
No, I don't want to drink anything

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
This is

62
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
What are you doing?

63
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
My legs are so thin

64
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
This cup is not expensive, right?

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Not expensive

66
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
What are you doing?

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Open your phone

68
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Hurry up, don't be in a hurry

69
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Camera

70
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Okay

71
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
One person is okay

72
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Okay?

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Okay

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Then we'll open the countdown now

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
We'll wait for 15 minutes

76
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
If the phone rings

77
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It means you two are okay

78
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
If it doesn't ring

79
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Then you don't think about it

80
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Wait

81
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
No

82
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
15 minutes

83
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
15 minutes

84
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
15 minutes

85
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I think there's no hope

86
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Let's open it

87
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Open it

88
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Phone

89
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'll pick it up

90
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Hello

91
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Hello, Shiqi

92
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm Yan Yan

93
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yan Yan?

94
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Shiqing broke her leg

95
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Broken leg?

96
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
How is she now?

97
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
She's fine

98
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Her legs are a little weak

99
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I've seen the doctor

100
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
The doctor treated her

101
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
How can she be broken?

102
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
What did the doctor say?

103
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
The doctor said

104
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's nothing

105
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Just need to be in good health

106
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yes, need to be in good health

107
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Then I'll call Yufan now

108
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Don't call Yufan

109
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Shiqi said she didn't want to worry about Yufan

110
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Then wait for me

111
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'll go now

112
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Okay

113
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You're back

114
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Success

115
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Let me see how you play

116
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Come on, play

117
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Sit down

118
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
No

119
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You can't touch the ground, you know?

120
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You can't touch the ground

121
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yes, that's true, you know?

122
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Yes, very good

123
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
The target has appeared

124
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
The target is back, come back

125
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Hurry up

126
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
What are you doing?

127
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Hurry up

128
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Hurry up

129
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Change it

130
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Come on, hurry up

131
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Shiqi

132
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Shiqi

133
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Sister Meng

134
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Shiqi

135
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What's wrong with you?

136
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Are you okay?

137
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Why are you so bad?

138
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Sister Meng, why are you here?

139
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Why do you bother?

140
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Yan Yan, help me up

141
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm leaving

142
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'll go back

143
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Lie down and don't move

144
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
What's wrong with you?

145
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's all my fault

146
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I accidentally broke my leg

147
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Let's go back

148
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Don't bother people here

149
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Where are you going?

150
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Or I'll send you to your sister's

151
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
My sister must be close to Leran

152
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,420
I don't want to be a

153
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,000
Then you stay at my house first

154
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Thank you, Sister Nanxi

155
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You're so nice, Sister Nanxi

156
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
What's wrong with you?

157
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I have something to do in the company

158
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm leaving

159
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Go, go, go

160
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It hurts

161
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
What's wrong with you?

162
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Why are you so careless?

163
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It hurts

164
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I have found her information

165
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
She sent it to your mailbox

166
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Okay, I see

167
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Let me have a look

168
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Stomach infection

169
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
and disorder

170
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Why is Gu Nanxi like this?

171
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Is the contract of physical rent

172
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
related to this?

173
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You said you were fine

174
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Why are you doing this?

175
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You had a bad stomach

176
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Now you're fine

177
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You're completely fine

178
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Thank you, Sister Nanxi

179
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
What's wrong?

180
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Nothing

181
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Don't care about anything now

182
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Your health is the most important

183
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Yes

184
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You're really fine without your sister?

185
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm fine

186
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
She must not have time to talk to me now

187
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Okay

188
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Then you listen to me

189
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I put water here

190
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
and the remote control here

191
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'll go to work first

192
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'll cook dinner for you when I come back

193
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Cook?

194
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Sister Nanxi is going to cook?

195
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Sister Nanxi

196
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Well

197
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You've had a hard day

198
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
We just order take-out

199
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Don't cook

200
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
How can that be?

201
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Why do you come to my house

202
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
and eat take-out?

203
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It's settled

204
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm leaving

205
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm busy now

206
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You can talk to me on WeChat

207
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Qin Shiqi

208
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
If you don't come today

209
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
you will regret it

210
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm leaving

211
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Shiqi

212
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You're here

213
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
What's up?

214
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Why do you ask me out in such a hurry?

215
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Sit down

216
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
We can talk here

217
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Look

218
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I ordered your favorite fish

219
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
and this cold skin

220
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm not eating, Coco

221
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm busy later

222
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You can talk directly

223
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Shiqi

224
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
We haven't sat down

225
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
and talked for a long time

226
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So I asked you here today

227
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
to talk about my fish

228
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
to you

229
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You know

230
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I've always liked you

231
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
But

232
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I can feel it clearly

233
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:59,420
your

234
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Coco

235
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I've told Mr. An

236
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
about this

237
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
We're just working friends

238
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
and friends in private

239
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
As for you like me

240
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I already have someone else in my heart

241
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
We can't be together

242
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Shiqi

243
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
But we were good before

244
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Do you remember

245
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
when you were in the fan meeting

246
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I sent you flowers

247
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
and you didn't refuse me

248
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
We also held a press conference

249
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
We were all good at that time

250
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I don't know why

251
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
it suddenly became like this

252
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Coco, you know

253
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
these things are fake

254
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Don't take it seriously

255
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's not fake for me

256
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I knew you would blame me

257
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I knew you would misunderstand

258
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
So I've been reminding you

259
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Is it because of him?

260
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Who?

261
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Gu Nanxi

262
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Shiqi

263
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
If it wasn't for him

264
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
would you be with me?

265
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Would you pretend to be true?

266
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Would you like me?

267
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
We're talking about our business

268
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It has nothing to do with Nanxi

269
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It has something to do with him

270
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You weren't like this before he came back

271
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Everything is fine

272
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You must have liked me

273
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Right?

274
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You see, he

275
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It's all because of him

276
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Right?

277
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So what the hell are you doing?

278
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I just want to hear you say you like me

279
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Qin Shiqi

280
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I want you to like me

281
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Me?

282
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Coco

283
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
The person I like is Gu Nanxi

284
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
What a fool

285
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
The person who really likes you is only me

286
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Gu Nanxi is using you

287
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Do you know?

288
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
What are you talking about?

289
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Do you know?

290
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Gu Nanxi, who you miss so much

291
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I know you

292
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You can see what you're doing behind your back

293
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I know her very well

294
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I support her unconditionally no matter what she does

295
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
As for you

296
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Don't be investigated by others

297
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I investigated her because I found out that she was lying to you

298
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Enough

299
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I'll leave if there's nothing else

300
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Qin Shiqi

301
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Gu Nanxi has a mental disorder

302
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
She signed a contract with you

303
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
To use you to cure her disease

304
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I know you don't believe me

305
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
But the person who really likes you is only me

306
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I can't lie to you

307
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
This is her medical record of mental disorder abroad

308
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You don't believe me, you see it yourself

309
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Thank you for letting me know about this

310
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I've made it very clear

311
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I support her unconditionally no matter what she does

312
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm sorry

313
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Shiqi

314
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Sister

315
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Why are you here?

316
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Did you make an appointment?

317
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
No

318
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I just met a director nearby

319
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm going back

320
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
That's good

321
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Go home for dinner

322
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'll call Nanxi

323
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
No, no, no

324
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Don't call Nanxi

325
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
She's busy with work recently

326
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Don't make it a mess for her

327
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
She's busy

328
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Why didn't I hear about it?

329
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
She told me when the dinner was over

330
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Okay, I have an appointment tonight

331
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'll go first

332
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Don't go

333
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You haven't eaten at home for a long time

334
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
You bought all the food you like

335
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Your brother-in-law hasn't seen you for a long time

336
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
He misses you

337
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Don't be so quiet

338
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Okay, okay

339
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Here comes the fish

340
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Okay

341
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I have a cold dish

342
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You guys talk first

343
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Thank you, brother-in-law

344
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It's okay

345
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Sister

346
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Just tell me what's wrong

347
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Why do you look like a red-haired man?

348
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
What red-haired man?

349
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It's good that your brother-in-law is here today

350
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I just want to talk to you

351
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Sister, are you okay?

352
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You said it

353
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I can't be nice to you

354
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
If you have nothing to do, I'll go first

355
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I have something to do later

356
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Shut up

357
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Yes, that's my sister

358
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Do you think you're gentle?

359
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Say it

360
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
What's the matter?

361
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Shiqi

362
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You're not young anymore

363
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I have found Mr. Leng now

364
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I don't have time to take care of you now

365
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Sister, brother-in-law

366
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
You two are happy

367
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
You don't have to worry about anything else

368
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I don't need words

369
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I'll go

370
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I will go

371
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Sister Nanxi

372
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Still working?

373
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
When will you get off work?

374
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It's a bit busy today

375
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It's late

376
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
You take care of your health at home

377
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Okay

378
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I'll wait for you to come back for dinner

379
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I'm fine.

380
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I'll continue to discuss.

381
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,760
Put down your phone.

382
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Shiqi,

383
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,920
I just want you to find your own happiness.

384
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,880
Don't worry, sister.

385
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,000
I'll tell you as soon as possible

386
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
if I have a suitable candidate.

387
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,400
A suitable candidate?

388
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,480
Then what about Keke?

389
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,480
She's not suitable.

390
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,480
She's not suitable.

391
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,480
She's not suitable.

392
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,480
She's not suitable.

393
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,480
She's not suitable.

394
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,080
Then Keke is suitable for you.

395
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,960
Look,

396
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,960
you've known each other for so long.

397
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,360
And she's so good to you.

398
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,320
We all see it in our eyes.

399
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,320
Right?

400
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,920
Yes, yes, yes.

401
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,120
Sister, I've told you many times.

402
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:31,920
Keke and I

403
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,720
are brothers and sisters.

404
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,360
We have nothing else.

405
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,840
How old are you?

406
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,000
You're just a kid.

407
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,120
You're still a brother and sister.

408
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,480
Can you be a good brother?

409
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,760
Well, Yufan,

410
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,160
Shiqi is not young anymore.

411
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,360
She knows what she should do in love.

412
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,360
She knows?

413
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,640
She knows such a good girl.

414
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,960
She's so ungrateful.

415
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,640
Have a good talk.

416
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,640
We'll be fine soon.

417
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,160
Sister,

418
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,760
you and my brother-in-law

419
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,160
can be happy together.

420
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,000
I have something to do.

421
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,680
I have to go now.

422
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,760
Now is not the time to escape from the problem.

423
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,760
I'll ask you today.

424
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,440
What do you and An Keke

425
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,440
think about?

426
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,520
Don't bother me.

427
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,520
Qin Shiqi,

428
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,600
I'm your sister.

429
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,880
Your parents told me when they left.

430
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,560
They told me to take good care of you.

431
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,960
Do you think I want to control you?

432
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,920
If you dare to leave this door today,

433
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,400
I'll treat you as my brother.

434
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:22,600
Whatever.

435
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,400
You...

436
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,400
You two

437
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,040
care about each other.

438
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,560
You made me...

439
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,040
I didn't prepare the food well.

440
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,400
You two should cool down first.

441
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,120
All right, don't be angry.

442
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:34,760
I'll go and have a look.

443
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,560
I'll go and have a look.

444
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,360
Shiqi.

445
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,200
Shiqi.

446
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,800
Walk slowly.

447
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,200
Don't be angry.

448
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,240
You know

449
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,440
what kind of temper your sister has.

450
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,440
It's okay, brother-in-law.

451
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,920
I just don't want to talk to her.

452
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,280
I know.

453
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,160
You have something in your heart.

454
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,800
Brother-in-law,

455
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,720
what do you mean?

456
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,400
Don't hide it from me.

457
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,760
I've seen it.

458
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:04,800
What...

459
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,920
What do you mean?

460
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,240
Gu Nanxi.

461
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,600
Brother-in-law, you know it.

462
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,760
Shiqi,

463
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,840
fight for what you like.

464
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,960
I support you.

465
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,080
What about my sister?

466
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,920
Don't worry.

467
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,840
Only I know.

468
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,720
Your sister is still in the dark.

469
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,720
But brother-in-law,

470
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,600
you know

471
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,400
my sister and Nanxi's relationship.

472
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,080
I know.

473
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,280
I'll try to convince your sister.

474
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,200
You

475
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,360
can do it yourself.

476
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,960
Thank you, brother-in-law.

477
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,920
All right.

478
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,400
It's all your fault, brother-in-law.

479
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,120
I'll go now.

480
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:44,560
Okay.

481
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,160
Okay.

482
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,200
Be careful.

483
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,080
Shiqi.

484
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,240
Why are you back so late?

485
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,400
I had something to do today.

486
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,200
I'm late.

487
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,200
What are we going to eat tonight?

488
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,960
I was in a hurry.

489
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,880
I forgot to buy it.

490
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,600
I'll cook it.

491
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,200
No.

492
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,440
I'll cook it.

493
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,480
How can you cook it?

494
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,440
I'm in a hurry.

495
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,200
Wait a minute.

496
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,640
Nanxi.

497
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,160
You've worked hard all day.

498
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,400
How about we go out and eat?

499
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,680
Don't you want to eat

500
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,600
my cooking?

501
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,720
No.

502
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,440
I really care about you.

503
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,760
Sit tight.

504
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,640
Don't move.

505
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,320
Okay.

506
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,040
Try it.

507
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,120
Nanxi.

508
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,120
You really didn't let me down.

509
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,240
What do you mean by that?

510
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,720
I'm telling you.

511
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,720
After going abroad,

512
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,000
my cooking has improved a lot.

513
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,600
You try it first.

514
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:01,840
Come on.

515
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,360
Try a rib first.

516
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,240
Okay.

517
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,240
I'll try it.

518
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:05,920
Okay.

519
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,680
Try it.

520
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,480
Okay.

521
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,280
Try it.

522
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,040
Okay.

523
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,840
Try it.

524
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,680
Okay.

525
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,520
Try it.

526
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,200
Okay.

527
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,400
Try a rib first.

528
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,200
It's not dry.

529
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,520
Okay.

530
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,720
Then eat more.

531
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,440
Okay.

532
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,360
Who is it?

533
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:45,920
Nothing.

534
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,840
The staff

535
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,480
knows that my leg is injured.

536
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,280
They want to see me.

537
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,320
I didn't ask them to come.

538
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:51,960
Right.

539
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,840
Your leg

540
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,240
has been delayed a lot recently.

541
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,160
It's natural.

542
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:57,760
It's okay.

543
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,640
It depends on the situation.

544
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,240
You have to get well soon.

545
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,520
Don't be lame.

546
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,360
You won't be able to find a girlfriend by then.

547
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,240
Nanxi.

548
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,680
Call me sister Nanxi?

549
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,280
No.

550
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,600
I just want to call you Nanxi.

551
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,360
Call me whatever you want.

552
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,360
Eat some more.

553
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,600
Don't just give me the money.

554
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,280
You should eat too.

555
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:15,720
Here.

556
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,120
I just ate this afternoon.

557
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:17,920
Try it.

558
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,320
Why are you going so late?

559
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:42,960
Why

560
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,560
haven't you

561
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,600
slept yet?

562
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,800
I woke up.

563
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,960
I found you were not here.

564
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,040
So I wanted to wait for you.

565
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,520
I'm not finished with my work.

566
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,080
I can't sleep.

567
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,280
You should sleep first.

568
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:08,920
Okay.

569
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,120
Then don't be too late.

570
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,760
Sleep early.

571
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,080
Okay.

572
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:42,920
Good morning.

573
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,080
Keke.

574
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,000
You're so early today.

575
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,720
Did you stay up all night yesterday?

576
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,520
No.

577
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,080
I just didn't sleep well.

578
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,080
What's wrong?

579
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,520
Something on your mind?

580
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,280
Nothing.

581
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,960
It's about my grandpa.

582
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,480
Let's not talk about it.

583
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,640
Be happy.

584
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:17,920
It's the weekend.

585
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,520
I'll take you and Nanxi to a spa.

586
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,120
Relax yourself.

587
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,600
Okay.

588
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,680
It's been a long time

589
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,600
since I saw sister Nanxi.

590
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,120
It's a deal.

591
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,320
See you on the weekend.

592
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,880
Nanxi, you're here.

593
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,880
Chief Editor Lan has been waiting for you for a long time.

594
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,200
Chief Editor Lan,

595
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,080
why didn't you send me a message before you came?

596
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,920
Sorry to keep you waiting.

597
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:53,880
It's okay.

598
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,480
Chief Editor Lan came here

599
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,560
to talk to you

600
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,400
about the new jewelry style.

601
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,520
See if you can give us some advice.

602
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,560
Since Nanxi is here,

603
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,960
I won't bother you.

604
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:07,840
Okay.

605
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,120
Nanxi,

606
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,760
you have to work hard.

607
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Our company is counting on you.

608
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,360
Your team is under a lot of pressure.

609
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,360
You have to work hard.

610
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,440
Okay, thank you, Chief Editor Lan.

611
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,280
Okay.

612
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,320
Thank you.

613
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,160
Let's talk in my office.

614
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:22,880
Okay.

615
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,360
Okay.

616
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,040
Come in.

617
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:37,760
Sit.

618
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,280
Sit.

619
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,240
It's nice.

620
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,120
How is it?

621
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,640
What do you think about the new jewelry style?

622
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,680
You're asking me like this,

623
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,800
I'm still under pressure.

624
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,120
I'm still in the selection process.

625
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:50,760
It's okay.

626
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,320
I didn't come here on purpose today.

627
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,520
I have an appointment with someone nearby.

628
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,960
I just wanted to come and see you.

629
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,000
I didn't expect to be caught by Linda.

630
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,600
I'm fine.

631
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,600
It's just that there are a lot of things.

632
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,760
And there's a period

633
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:04,960
that makes people worry.

634
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,080
Period?

635
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,920
I'm telling you, don't tell Yufan.

636
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,400
He broke his leg.

637
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,960
He's been in my house for two days.

638
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,240
He broke his leg?

639
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,440
I wanted to tell Yufan.

640
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,800
But Chiqi didn't let me.

641
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,800
I see.

642
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,680
If it's serious,

643
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,040
we have to go to the hospital first.

644
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,920
Chiqi, this kid.

645
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,120
Sometimes,

646
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,360
his maturity

647
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,440
is far beyond his actual age.

648
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,520
Indeed.

649
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,200
This time back,

650
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,840
I feel he's grown a lot.

651
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,960
Maybe he's experienced a lot in his age.

652
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,400
I think

653
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,920
you should

654
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,960
relax properly

655
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,960
and give yourself a vacation.

656
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,720
Find a suitable person

657
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,800
to fall in love.

658
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,840
Fall in love?

659
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,320
It's not that easy to say.

660
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,160
Where can I find a suitable person?

661
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,680
Sometimes,

662
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,200
the right person is by your side.

663
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,800
But you didn't notice it.

664
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,880
By my side?

665
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,560
That's what I said.

666
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,560
It's late.

667
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,320
I'll leave first.

668
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,000
Get back to your work.

669
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,440
Okay.

670
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,440
Here.

671
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,280
Where are you going?

672
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,520
Don't worry.

673
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:07,840
My sister is here.

674
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,840
Go to your room.

675
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,000
Thank you for picking me up last night.

676
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,400
But only for last night.

677
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:18,920
Where are you going?

678
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,520
What does it have to do with you?

679
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,520
What can we talk about?

680
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:26,960
Keep looking for a place

681
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,160
and keep talking nonsense.

682
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,400
Stop talking nonsense to me.

683
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,720
You caused me to be like this.

684
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,280
Where can I go now?

685
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,000
I was really a terrorist.

686
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,480
I was too cruel.

687
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,960
If I had talked to you,

688
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,760
we wouldn't be like this now.

689
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,120
So you can talk nonsense.

690
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,760
Sit down and talk.

691
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,120
Tell me.

692
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,200
What do you want to talk about?

693
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,000
Before you find a job,

694
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,200
just stay here.

695
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,400
Where else can I find a job?

696
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,560
Do you know Yi Hai?

697
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,600
I know Yi Hai.

698
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,760
Although he's not as famous as Kai Ge,

699
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,320
he has a lot of influence.

700
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,160
I'll arrange for you to work in Yi Hai.

701
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,160
As a compensation for you.

702
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,320
Qiang Rui.

703
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,280
Qiang Rui.

704
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,000
Do you think I'll believe what you said?

705
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,480
Whether you believe it or not,

706
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,000
I think

707
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,200
we can be a real designers

708
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,320
very soon.

709
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,880
I didn't expect

710
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,160
that I could enjoy

711
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,160
the care of Sister Nan Xi one day.

712
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,960
I lived with her without any fear.

713
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:15,560
I enjoyed her tenderness without any worries.

714
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,040
In this world,

715
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:22,800
there's nothing more happy than being with Sister Nan Xi.

716
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,400
Hello, Yan Yan.

717
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,200
I tell you.

718
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,920
This trick is really useful.

719
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,920
And I have good news for you.

720
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:41,760
Now,

721
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,680
my brother-in-law has agreed to me to pursue Gu Nan Xi.

722
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,400
And he's standing on my side

723
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,720
and trying to persuade my sister.

724
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,880
That's great.

725
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,400
But I tell you something.

726
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,400
The company has arranged a new movie for you.

727
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,120
Now you can come and meet the director.

728
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,760
Another day.

729
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,280
If I go now,

730
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,480
Sister Nan Xi will be off work and won't see me.

731
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,040
Now, the matter between me and Sister Nan Xi

732
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,240
is very important.

733
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,680
I'm sorry.

734
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,680
I'm sorry.

735
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,680
I'm sorry.

736
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,680
I'm sorry.

737
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,680
I'm sorry.

738
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,680
I'm sorry.

739
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,680
I'm sorry.

740
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,680
I'm sorry.

741
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,680
I'm sorry.

742
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,680
I'm sorry.

743
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,680
I'm sorry.

744
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,680
I'm sorry.

745
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,680
I'm sorry.

746
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,680
I'm sorry.

747
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,680
I'm sorry.

748
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,680
I'm sorry.

749
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,680
I'm sorry.

750
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,680
I'm sorry.

751
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,680
I'm sorry.

752
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,680
I'm sorry.

753
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,680
I'm sorry.

754
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,680
I'm sorry.

755
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,680
I'm sorry.

756
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,680
I'm sorry.

757
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,680
I'm sorry.

758
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,680
I'm sorry.

759
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,680
I'm sorry.

760
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,680
I'm sorry.

761
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,680
I'm sorry.

762
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,680
I'm sorry.

763
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,680
I'm sorry.

764
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,680
I'm sorry.

765
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,680
I'm sorry.

766
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,680
I'm sorry.

767
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,680
I'm sorry.

768
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,680
I'm sorry.

769
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,680
