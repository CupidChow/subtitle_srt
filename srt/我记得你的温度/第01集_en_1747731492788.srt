1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,060
I worked hard to get my first place.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,320
It really was indeed an honor.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,120
It really is an honor to have you.

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,100
I'm a little worried.

5
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,880
How can I be worried,

6
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,520
I want to be closer to you, but your little stars

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,320
are always around you, never leaving you

8
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,040
I want to be closer to you, to guard your secret

9
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,520
I will always look for you

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,280
I want to be closer to you, to protect you

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,280
I will always look for you

12
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,680
I want to be closer to you, to protect you

13
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,680
I will always look for you

14
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,680
I am waiting for you

15
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,680
I want to be closer to you, but your little stars

16
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,680
are always around you, never leaving you

17
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,680
I want to be closer to you, to guard your secret

18
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,680
I will always look for you

19
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:34,680
I want to be closer to you, to protect you

20
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,680
Thank you!

21
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,680
Thank you!

22
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,680
Thank you!

23
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,680
Thank you!

24
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,680
So handsome!

25
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,680
Thank you!

26
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,680
Let me through!

27
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,680
Let me through!

28
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,680
Thank you!

29
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,680
Thank you!

30
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,680
It's too late.

31
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,680
I have to get more than a dozen phones to get tickets to see her.

32
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,680
I have to get more than a dozen phones to get tickets to see her.

33
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,680
Yes, she was popular online before.

34
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,680
So beautiful!

35
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,680
I am so happy!

36
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,680
What's going on?

37
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,680
She is so beautiful!

38
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,680
Gu Nanxi!

39
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,680
I taught you such a little thing and you can't even do it well.

40
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,680
What are you doing?

41
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,680
I am sorry, director. It's all my fault.

42
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,680
Please give me a chance to make up for it.

43
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,680
Let me fix this bracelet.

44
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,680
You are still fixing it?

45
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,680
Who do you think you are?

46
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,680
You are just a designer assistant.

47
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,680
Don't think you are the designer.

48
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,680
I am the designer.

49
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,680
I have been following this bracelet from the beginning to the end.

50
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,680
Believe me.

51
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,680
I can make it perfect.

52
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,680
Gu Nanxi, do you know?

53
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,680
It's worth a hundred thousand.

54
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,680
If you can't fix it, can you compensate?

55
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,680
If you really think you have the ability,

56
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,680
why don't you be a jewelry designer?

57
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,680
Why are you still my assistant?

58
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,680
This bracelet is not made of natural red gems.

59
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,680
It's made of some broken diamonds.

60
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,680
It costs less than ten thousand.

61
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,680
Shut up!

62
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,680
Are you really crazy?

63
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,680
Believe it or not, I will fire you right now.

64
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,680
I will make you disappear in this circle forever.

65
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,680
Okay.

66
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,680
Please remember that I resigned.

67
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,680
You...

68
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,680
You are a coward!

69
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,680
I really like this photo.

70
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,680
Really, you are the most beautiful, right?

71
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,680
Right?

72
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,680
Let's go.

73
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,680
Are you okay?

74
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,680
Aunt, you don't even have eyes when you walk.

75
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,680
My butt hurts.

76
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,680
Aunt?

77
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,680
I am 29 years old, and you call me aunt?

78
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,680
Aunt, you are already 29 years old.

79
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,680
You are so rude.

80
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,680
Don't you know how to apologize to someone you bump into?

81
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,680
That's right.

82
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,680
You don't know how to apologize to someone you bump into.

83
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,680
That's right.

84
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,680
I clearly saw you bump into this sister.

85
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,680
This sister didn't say anything.

86
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,680
You are still a bad person.

87
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,680
You are still a bad person.

88
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,680
You are still a bad person.

89
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,680
And you.

90
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,680
You didn't even know the source of the story.

91
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,680
You are just making up stories.

92
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,680
I think you need to talk to the president of the fan club.

93
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,680
You need to talk to the president of the fan club.

94
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,680
Who are you?

95
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,680
Why are you here talking nonsense?

96
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,680
Actually, the wedding is coming soon.

97
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,680
Hurry up and make the wedding.

98
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,680
Hurry up.

99
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,680
Are you okay?

100
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,680
Thank you for helping me get married.

101
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,680
It's okay.

102
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,680
I saw your hand was cut by the light.

103
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,680
Please deal with it.

104
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,680
Please.

105
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,680
Look at this side.

106
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,680
Shi Qi,

107
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,680
this is for you.

108
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,680
She is An Ke Ke?

109
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,680
Qin Shi Qi's roasted girlfriend.

110
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,680
Roasted girlfriend?

111
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,680
This An Ke Ke

112
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,680
is the daughter of Yi Hai Group.

113
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,680
She is my chief designer.

114
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,400
This looks familiar.

115
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,840
Is that him?

116
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:44,960
Take photo.

117
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,920
Come, look at me!

118
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,480
Make a pose!

119
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,440
Get ready!

120
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,600
One! Two! Three!

121
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,440
Flame Goddess!

122
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,000
Which star did Shi Qi pick?

123
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,080
Shi Qi,

124
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,280
what's going on?

125
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,160
What's the problem?

126
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,280
Nothing.

127
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,080
I just felt that there was a shadow that looked like my friend.

128
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,400
Really? Do you want to go back and look for it?

129
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,720
Forget it. He's in abroad now.

130
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,280
I think I must have seen it wrong.

131
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,200
留灯

132
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,800
People will visualise this world

133
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,840
with their bare hands from birth.

134
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,440
치가 bir ''

135
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,840
Pain will make people painful

136
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,160
it will also make people to stay away from the things that hurt themselves

137
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,720
What is cold-and-hot feeling?

138
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,600
What is it like to water your skin

139
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,040
I haven't第一airly felt

140
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:48,680
From all the data, you can see that your other physical abilities have recovered from that car accident.

141
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:56,680
But I'm very sorry to tell you that after half a year of treatment, your nervous system still doesn't work normally.

142
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,680
We can't use scientific methods to explain your current situation.

143
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,680
Now, we can only hope that you will succeed and wish you good luck.

144
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,680
If you really think that you have the ability, why don't you become a jewelry designer?

145
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,680
Yes, I can't be a jewelry designer because I don't have a sense of purpose.

146
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,680
Believe it or not, I will fire you immediately and make you disappear from this circle forever.

147
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,680
So what if you don't have a sense of purpose?

148
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,680
Instead of being a little assistant here, I might as well try again.

149
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,680
I'm sorry.

150
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,680
Please help me find the surveillance footage of this morning.

151
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,680
Boss, something bad happened.

152
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,680
What are you looking at? Do you have any rules? Get out.

153
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,680
Boss, what's wrong?

154
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,680
Did you find the surveillance footage?

155
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,680
It's like this. The hotel said that we have to call the police to check the surveillance footage.

156
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,680
But there is one thing that is very important. You are on the hot search again.

157
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,680
You can be on the hot search at a meeting?

158
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,680
But this time it's different. This time it's like this.

159
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,680
It's because your fans are too wild.

160
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,680
They accidentally broke the wrist of a passerby.

161
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,680
It was solved by Coco Chu.

162
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,680
It really is her.

163
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,680
Boss, don't worry.

164
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,680
I'll definitely remove this hot search.

165
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,680
I promise with my professional career.

166
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,860
Do you know

167
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,160
that Mr. Yao

168
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,560
has been pestering me

169
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,140
to sell my demo in the internet

170
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:18,400
and to become a pilot

171
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,560
for Sun Yihua's T-shirt?

172
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,720
Something like this?

173
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,460
You're unbelievable.

174
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,220
That is true.

175
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:33,560
You know

176
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,200
much better than I do

177
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,400
I can take a picture with you.

178
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,040
Sure.

179
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,000
Oh, right.

180
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,800
This is the morning surveillance.

181
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,440
Here you go.

182
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,200
Thank you.

183
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,000
You're welcome.

184
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,040
You're here to check on him?

185
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,080
He

186
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,200
has been

187
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,200
beaten up.

188
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,400
He's been beaten up?

189
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,400
He's been beaten up?

190
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,400
He's been beaten up?

191
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,800
He's been fired.

192
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,600
And

193
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,000
we'll continue to investigate

194
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
the compensation fee for this bracelet.

195
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,400
How much is this bracelet?

196
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,000
200,000 yuan.

197
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,800
How much?

198
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,000
It's not impossible to get 20,000 yuan.

199
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,000
Okay.

200
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,600
I'll buy it.

201
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,800
Don't ask him for any more responsibilities.

202
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,600
No problem.

203
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,800
Wait a minute.

204
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,600
Here.

205
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,600
Here.

206
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,400
Here's his contact number and address.

207
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:42,800
Hello.

208
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,800
I'd like to ask

209
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,200
how to get to the 21st floor.

210
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,800
That way.

211
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,600
That way?

212
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,200
Thank you.

213
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,400
It's okay.

214
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,200
Okay.

215
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,600
Who are you looking for?

216
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,600
Is the girl who lives here home?

217
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,800
She moved out.

218
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,600
She's walking on the front.

219
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,800
You're walking on the back.

220
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,800
Mr. Qin.

221
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,600
If you don't go back,

222
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,000
I can't find the way to the company.

223
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,800
There are many activities behind us.

224
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,800
Okay.

225
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,800
Hello.

226
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,800
Hello.

227
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,800
Hello.

228
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,800
Hello.

229
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,800
Hello.

230
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,800
Hello.

231
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,800
Hello.

232
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,800
Hello.

233
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,800
Hello.

234
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,800
Hello.

235
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,800
Hello.

236
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,800
Hello.

237
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,800
Hello.

238
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,800
Hello.

239
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,800
Hello.

240
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,800
Hello.

241
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,800
Hello.

242
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,400
Yes.

243
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,600
Okay.

244
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,000
I'll be in Chunzhou tomorrow.

245
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,200
Bye, Binghai.

246
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,200
Chunzhou, I'm back.

247
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,800
Yi Hai Jewelry.

248
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Wait for me.

249
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,800
Hello, I'm here for the interview.

250
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,800
This way.

251
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,800
Thank you.

252
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,800
I've seen your resume.

253
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,800
To be honest,

254
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,400
your current work experience

255
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,000
isn't suitable for our company.

256
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Although I'm not good enough,

257
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,400
as long as the company wants me,

258
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,200
I'm willing to start from the bottom.

259
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,600
Besides,

260
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,800
Mr. Zhang introduced me.

261
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,200
He's a good friend of mine.

262
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,800
I can't let him down.

263
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,800
I'm willing to do everything for him.

264
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,800
I'm willing to do everything for him.

265
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,800
I'm willing to do everything for him.

266
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,200
Mr. Zhang introduced me.

267
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,000
You can ask Mr. Zhang directly.

268
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
There's no need to waste time here.

269
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,800
Mr. Qin, we have

270
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,200
seven or eight interviews in the afternoon.

271
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,000
Let the people behind me

272
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
come to my office directly.

273
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Let's make a quick decision.

274
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Okay.

275
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,400
Come in.

276
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,000
Hello, I'm here for the interview.

277
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,200
Yufan?

278
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,200
Nanxi?

279
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,200
Let me see how you're recovering.

280
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,400
It's been a long time.

281
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,800
I've recovered long ago.

282
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,600
If it weren't for that car accident,

283
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,000
you would have been in the hospital.

284
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,600
But that car accident,

285
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,400
you would have been in the jewelry design contest.

286
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,200
Let's not talk about that.

287
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,600
I've forgotten how long it's been.

288
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,800
Nanxi,

289
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,000
I'll invite you to be our company's

290
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,600
big designer.

291
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,200
I came back to Chenzhou

292
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,400
to see

293
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,000
where I can

294
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,600
take the path of jewelry design

295
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,000
to.

296
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,800
Come.

297
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Bye.

298
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Bye.

299
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,200
Shiqi,

300
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,000
my grandpa is preparing a dinner at home.

301
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,600
Do you want to go back after dinner?

302
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,600
Forget it.

303
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,600
I just came back to Chenzhou

304
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,800
and want to see my sister.

305
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,600
You're right.

306
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,600
You've been on a business trip for so long.

307
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,400
My sister must miss you a lot.

308
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,800
Go back now.

309
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,400
Be safe.

310
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,400
Okay.

311
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,400
Be careful.

312
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,000
We haven't seen each other for five years.

313
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
From now on,

314
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
you can live in my house.

315
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,000
I'll listen to you.

316
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,600
It's been so long.

317
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,000
Your house hasn't changed at all.

318
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,800
It's all because of you.

319
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,000
I can remember you

320
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
when I see these decorations.

321
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,400
Do you know that?

322
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,600
I've been thinking about you

323
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,000
for so long.

324
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I've been thinking about you

325
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
for so long.

326
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I've been thinking about you

327
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,400
for so long.

328
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,800
When you went abroad,

329
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,400
I thought I'd never see you again.

330
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,600
No way.

331
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,800
I'm back.

332
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,600
You're still so shy to say that?

333
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,200
I haven't contacted you for five years.

334
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,800
You don't even know how to contact me.

335
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,000
I'm sorry, mom.

336
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,800
But

337
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,200
it's good that you're back.

338
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,800
We've known each other for so long.

339
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,200
There's only one photo.

340
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,800
After dinner,

341
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,600
we'll take a good picture.

342
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,000
So that we won't have to

343
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,600
look for each other again.

344
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,000
No way.

345
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,600
Don't worry, honey.

346
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,600
I really miss the past.

347
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,400
If it weren't for my brother,

348
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,000
you wouldn't have met that man.

349
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Maybe you would have been saved long ago.

350
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,400
It's in the past.

351
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,600
Why mention him?

352
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,000
Besides, I'm not too old to be saved.

353
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Of course.

354
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,600
We're both young.

355
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,200
By the way,

356
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,600
where's Yu Qi?

357
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,800
He...

358
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,400
He's amazing now.

359
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,400
He's a national idol now.

360
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,400
He even changed his name.

361
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:39,800
Sister.

362
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,800
His name is...

363
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,600
Sister Nanxi.

364
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,400
You're back.

365
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,600
You brat.

366
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,200
You even came back to see me.

367
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,400
Nanxi.

368
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,400
Let me introduce you again.

369
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,800
This is

370
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,800
the new national idol,

371
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,600
Mr. Qin Shiqi.

372
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,000
Qin Shiqi?

373
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,200
You don't know him?

374
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,600
He's so popular now.

375
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,200
He's a big fan of his.

376
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,000
He even has a name.

377
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,800
I've seen his fan skills today.

378
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,400
Sign my name later.

379
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,200
It'll be convenient for me to travel the world.

380
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,200
Don't laugh at me.

381
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,200
I'm just an ordinary actor.

382
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,200
You're lucky.

383
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,200
Let's have hot pot tonight.

384
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,200
Okay.

385
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,400
Grandpa.

386
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,200
Why are you so quiet?

387
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,200
I didn't see you.

388
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,000
Grandpa, what are you doing?

389
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Go away.

390
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,200
I just came here for the design.

391
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,200
Brother.

392
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,000
I have a question.

393
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,200
You've been with Shiqi for a long time.

394
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,800
What's your plan?

395
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,000
Grandpa.

396
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,800
Shiqi and I

397
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,800
are just working partners.

398
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,200
What's your plan?

399
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,100
What?

400
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,400
Working partners?

401
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,200
I'm your grandpa.

402
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,800
I know your mind.

403
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,200
I know.

404
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,000
You've made a great effort

405
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
to sign a new idol.

406
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,200
I'm your new idol.

407
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,200
Grandpa.

408
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,400
I can't do it because

409
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,000
Shiqi's temperament

410
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,800
is very suitable for my design.

411
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,400
Enough.

412
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,400
I don't understand what you're thinking.

413
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,800
But

414
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm satisfied

415
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,400
with Shiqi.

416
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,800
But

417
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:48,800
I agree to be my granddaughter-in-law.

418
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,000
Really?

419
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Grandpa.

420
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You're great.

421
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
If you have time,

422
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
let her come to my house for dinner.

423
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,600
If you want to be my granddaughter-in-law,

424
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,800
you have to do some research.

425
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,800
Yes.

426
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,000
You go out first.

427
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I have to work.

428
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,800
Go.

429
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,200
You have to knock on the door

430
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,000
to get the door.

431
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,600
Okay.

432
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,600
Bye.

433
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,800
Sister.

434
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,600
I'm sorry to apologize to you

435
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,600
for my fans.

436
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,400
It's okay.

437
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,000
Let me sign the poison for you.

438
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I've already disinfected it.

439
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
You don't have to bother.

440
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,400
It's okay.

441
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,000
I didn't feel the pain.

442
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Now I have to

443
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
put on the medicine.

444
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,400
Your wound is a little deep.

445
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,400
I'll be gentle.

446
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,000
You can bear it.

447
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I actually feel the pain.

448
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,600
Is it...

449
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,200
The current situation

450
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,400
may be a psychological problem.

451
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,000
Simply put,

452
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,200
the brain is unwilling to

453
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,600
awaken your nervous system.

454
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,800
Dinner is ready.

455
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,000
What's going on between you two?

456
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,600
Come here.

457
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,800
Coming.

458
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,600
Cheers.

459
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,000
Nanxi.

460
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,600
So this is how you got hurt.

461
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,600
I didn't expect Yuqi...

462
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,400
No.

463
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,800
Mr. Qin Shiqi

464
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,200
is so popular now.

465
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,200
This little thing

466
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,200
is going to be posted online.

467
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,600
Look.

468
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,400
Nanxi.

469
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,800
This is the scene

470
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,800
that made Shiqi

471
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,000
the idol in the hearts of thousands of girls.

472
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
How is it?

473
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,400
Is he handsome?

474
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,200
I think

475
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,600
he's a little worse than me.

476
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,200
How can you say that?

477
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,000
My brother is an actor.

478
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,800
How can you say he's worse?

479
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,000
I mean

480
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,800
I've always thought that Shiqi

481
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,800
is very handsome

482
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,200
and suitable for being an actor.

483
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,200
I've never heard you say that.

484
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,000
I'm a person

485
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,200
who hides the truth in my heart.

486
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,000
I don't usually say it.

487
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Nanxi.

488
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Don't listen to my sister.

489
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,600
I'm just a little actor

490
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,400
and I'm still working hard.

491
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,000
Come on.

492
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,200
Let's drink another one.

493
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,000
Come on.

494
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,600
Cheers.

495
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,200
What a bad luck.

496
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,800
I'm so unlucky.

497
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,800
You're just trying to

498
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,600
get rid of this, right?

499
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,400
Someone broke your door

500
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,800
at midnight.

501
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,200
Who's not afraid?

502
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Shiqi.

503
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,800
You must not

504
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,200
drink anymore.

505
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,200
Is it Keke?

506
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,200
Yes.

507
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,800
We came here for sisterhood.

508
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,400
She was wrong.

509
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,000
She's drunk.

510
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,600
She's not smart.

511
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,200
You can't even...

512
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,400
You should call her here.

513
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,600
Don't get involved in

514
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,000
our sister's business.

515
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Nanxi.

516
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,200
Shiqi's girlfriend.

517
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,800
The daughter of our boss,

518
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,800
the young designer.

519
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,200
She's your girlfriend?

520
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,800
Sister, don't talk nonsense.

521
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,400
You don't admit it?

522
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,600
Look at the media

523
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,800
reporting you.

524
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,400
You didn't refute it.

525
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,200
Why is Nanxi here?

526
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,800
You're embarrassed to admit it?

527
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,400
Are you...

528
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,000
Qin Yifan.

529
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,800
Why are you

530
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,000
making jokes on me?

531
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,800
Shiqi.

532
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,800
The girl you like

533
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,800
is very good.

534
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,400
Come on.

535
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,000
Sister Nanxi.

536
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,400
Why are you

537
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,600
making a fuss?

538
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,200
We are all

539
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,400
friends arranged by the company.

540
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,400
I understand.

541
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,800
We are just friends.

542
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,400
Yifan.

543
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,000
Are you still eating?

544
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,800
I just said

545
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,800
we should take a photo together.

546
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,800
Nanxi.

547
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,400
Come here.

548
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,400
Shiqi will take a photo for us.

549
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,600
I want to take one too.

550
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,400
Okay.

551
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:24,600
Come on.

552
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,800
What's the matter?

553
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,600
Nanxi.

554
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,000
Take one for me and Nanxi.

555
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,400
Hurry up.

556
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,000
Take one.

557
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,800
Sister.

558
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,000
I'm in the front.

559
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,200
I'm a little embarrassed.

560
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:37,800
You take me.

561
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,400
I'll be in the back.

562
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,800
Come on.

563
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,000
Come on.

564
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,400
Is my nervous system

565
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,600
starting to recover?

566
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,200
Nanxi.

567
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,200
Look at the camera.

568
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,400
Three, two, one.

569
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,400
Why doesn't Shiqi

570
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,800
answer my call?

571
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,400
He keeps calling me.

572
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,800
Is it not good to call him?

573
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,000
It makes me look so reserved.

574
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,800
Shiqi.

575
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,800
Do you have time?

576
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,800
I want to invite you

577
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,000
to my house for dinner.

578
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Shiqi.

579
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I have some new design inspirations.

580
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
It suits your style

581
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,400
for the next activity.

582
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,800
If you have time,

583
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,200
let's discuss it together.

584
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,400
Sister Nanxi lives here.

585
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,000
We can meet every day.

586
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,400
We meet every day.

587
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,600
It has nothing to do with you.

588
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,600
Go back to your home.

589
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,600
I'm looking for a house these days.

590
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,200
I'll stay at Yu Fan's house for now.

591
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,400
It's been a long time.

592
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,400
Nanxi.

593
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,400
Do you know

594
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,200
what happened

595
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,600
in the past five years?

596
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,400
There are several shops

597
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,400
nearby our house.

598
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,000
I'll answer the phone.

599
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,800
Let me tell you.

600
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,400
And that brand.

601
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,400
It's very good.

602
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,200
Hello?

603
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,000
Yan Yan.

604
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,800
Keke sent me a message today.

605
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,400
What?

606
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,600
You can't get through?

607
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,400
How did you become an assistant?

608
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Forget it.

609
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,600
You work so hard.

610
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,600
I can only stay at my sister's house

611
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,800
for tonight.

612
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,200
Bye.

613
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,800
What's going on?

614
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,000
You're drunk?

615
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,400
What?

616
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,000
Thank you.

617
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I'm so happy to be your assistant.

618
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Is it useful?

619
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Yes.

620
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,400
I couldn't protect you before.

621
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,400
But now,

622
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I won't let you suffer anymore.

623
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,400
The next day

624
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Good morning.

625
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,800
Come here.

626
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,400
You don't want coffee?

627
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,600
Okay.

628
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,400
I don't feel anything.

629
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,400
I'm not afraid of you.

630
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,800
I just went to see you.

631
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,400
I can't get through.

632
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,800
It's so nice to have you.

633
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,000
You can't leave again.

634
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,400
Let's drink.

635
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I have an interview later.

636
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,200
What time is it?

637
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,600
Stay with me for a while.

638
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,800
I have to wash my face.

639
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,200
I'm too hungry.

640
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,200
No.

641
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,400
I'm leaving.

642
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,800
Nanxin.

643
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,800
Play by yourself.

644
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,400
How can I live without you?

645
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,200
It's good.

646
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,200
Your design draft

647
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,600
is eye-catching.

648
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,600
But our company

649
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,600
has another requirement for designers.

650
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,400
It's the jewelry confirmation.

651
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,600
I understand your company's requirement.

652
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,400
Jewelry confirmation

653
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,400
is a must-have for jewelry designers.

654
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,800
Because when drawing design drawings,

655
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,200
choose different raw materials

656
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,200
and different drawings.

657
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,000
The jewelry in front of you

658
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
is real and fake.

659
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,400
If you can tell,

660
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,800
you can pass the first round of the interview.

661
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,600
This diamond.

662
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,600
Some fake diamonds are made with fake needles.

663
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,600
But the testing method is very simple.

664
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,800
Draw a line on the paper.

665
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,200
It can only show the line.

666
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,200
It's fake.

667
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,800
If it's completely covered with heart,

668
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,600
it's real.

669
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,200
For example, this blue gem

670
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,400
can see it's crystal clear.

671
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,000
So it's fake.

672
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,400
Because the real blue gem

673
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,400
has some small flaws.

674
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,200
Look at this jade.

675
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,400
Look at the color and pattern.

676
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,600
It's also fake.

677
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,600
Yes.

678
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,600
You're right.

679
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,400
But this jade is so fake.

680
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,400
You can tell it's made of plastic.

681
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,200
You need to look at the pattern.

682
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,600
Sorry.

683
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,200
Thank you for coming today.

684
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,600
Sorry.

685
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,800
Because you're late,

686
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,200
the interview is cancelled.

687
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,600
I hope you can find

688
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,600
a job that suits you.

689
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,800
Sorry.

690
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,800
Your design doesn't suit our company.

691
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,600
The heart shape of the cold feet

692
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,600
is my look.

693
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,000
How about it?

694
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,000
If you have no problem,

695
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
we can start tomorrow.

696
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,800
I think I'm not suitable for your company.

697
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,000
Sorry.

698
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,800
Your design doesn't suit our company.

699
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,000
You think I'm old

700
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
and I'm a coward?

701
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,600
They're so blind.

702
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,600
It's their loss

703
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,600
to not use you.

704
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,800
It's okay.

705
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,800
Don't worry.

706
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,200
I can handle this.

707
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,200
I'm not that fragile.

708
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,600
Good for you.

709
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,800
But

710
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,200
I've been bothering you.

711
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,000
I'll go out to find a house tomorrow.

712
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,400
Don't talk nonsense.

713
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,200
Even if you live here for a lifetime,

714
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,600
I don't mind.

715
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,600
Right.

716
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,600
What if you meet a bad person

717
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,200
when you rent a house?

718
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,600
No. I won't give up.

719
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,000
How come?

720
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,200
I've made an appointment with an agent.

721
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,200
Tomorrow.

722
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,600
And it's close.

723
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,200
You're so disobedient.

724
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,200
No problem.

725
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,200
Hello?

726
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,200
Boss Qin.

727
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,800
I've got news from the person you asked.

728
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,800
Gu Nanxi is in Chunzhou now.

729
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,400
I've met Nanxi.

730
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,400
Wait.

731
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,000
I have something more important

732
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,600
to help you.

733
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
What?

734
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I'm sorry.

735
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I'm sorry.

736
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I'm sorry.

737
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,800
I'm sorry.

738
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,800
I'm sorry.

739
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,800
I'm sorry.

740
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,800
I'm sorry.

741
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,800
I'm sorry.

742
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,800
I'm sorry.

743
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,800
I'm sorry.

744
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,800
I'm sorry.

745
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,800
I'm sorry.

746
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,200
You've rented all the houses?

747
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,600
They're too popular lately.

748
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,400
I can't give you my rent

749
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,400
if you don't call me.

750
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,200
What about the others?

751
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,400
Not only us,

752
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,000
but seven, eight houses around here

753
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
are gone.

754
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,800
Hello, Shiqi.

755
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,560
Really?

756
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,280
Yes.

757
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,720
Send me your address.

758
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,720
I'll be there right away.

759
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,240
Thank you.

760
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,640
What's wrong with Boss Qin lately?

761
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:55,960
He always makes me do

762
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,040
some dirty work.

763
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,640
I'm sorry.

764
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,720
It's this neighborhood.

765
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,320
Isn't this the Yufan Village?

766
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,120
You'll know when you get in.

767
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:09,840
Let's go.

768
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,400
Come in.

769
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:24,880
How is it?

770
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,360
This is a nice place.

771
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,560
Look.

772
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,680
That's the balcony.

773
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,200
This house...

774
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,040
This kind of decoration

775
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,040
is very expensive

776
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,040
in this neighborhood.

777
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,360
It's not expensive.

778
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,920
It's free.

779
00:32:59,200 --> 00:32:59,960
Free?

780
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,320
Is it your house?

781
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,200
Yes.

782
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,840
But because of work,

783
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,640
the company found me another apartment.

784
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,640
So this house is empty.

785
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,760
You can live here.

786
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,760
No.

787
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,560
Isn't it like living in Yufan's house?

788
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,800
It's a hassle for you.

789
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,320
This painting is very abstract.

790
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,000
What is this?

791
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,000
This is a random gift

792
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,240
I bought

793
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,200
when I was in Italy.

794
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,440
Sister Nanxi.

795
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,840
This is close to my sister's house.

796
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,920
You can live here.

797
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,720
You can take care of each other.

798
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,440
I'll accept your kindness.

799
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,920
Forget about the house.

800
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,840
Sister Nanxi.

801
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:53,960
I...

802
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,760
I have a hunch again.

803
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,720
You are like a heart that is filled with love

804
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,160
Let all the things disappear

805
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,560
I don't want time to keep me from you

806
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,480
You are the most brilliant in the world

807
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,840
You are the best in the universe

808
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:08,320
You are the best in the world

809
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,240
Day and night I miss you

810
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,640
Only because I walk forward

811
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,880
My world is because of you

812
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,880
The snow is falling

813
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,920
The galaxy is lit

814
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,800
Let the whole world have romance

815
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,640
And I'm more greedy at the moment

816
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:31,440
I turn around and kiss you

817
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,440
You are the most brilliant in the world

818
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,680
You are the best in the universe

819
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,280
The calm sea also raises waves

820
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,200
Day and night I miss you

821
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,600
Only because I walk forward

822
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:47,080
My world is because of you
