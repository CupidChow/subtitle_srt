1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,240
You don't understand the separation with me

2
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,600
In my arms, who are you talking to?

3
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,000
How come you're hiding in my soft heart?

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,360
I want to get closer to you, be your little star

5
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,760
I'm always around you, never leaving you

6
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,120
I want to get closer to you, protect your secret

7
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,720
I will keep looking for you

8
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:04,720
I'll be with you for the rest of my life

9
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,720
I want to get closer to you, be your little star

10
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,720
I'm always around you, never leaving you

11
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:18,720
I want to get closer to you, protect your secret

12
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,720
I will keep looking for you

13
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,720
I will be with you for the rest of my life

14
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,720
I will keep looking for you

15
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,720
I will protect you

16
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:42,720
The Long Ballad

17
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,720
Episode 2

18
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,720
Oh, right. Can we get the sample soon?

19
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,720
Half a month is too short.

20
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,720
Besides, we've received dozens of orders.

21
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,720
You only have about a thousand.

22
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,720
So it's not enough?

23
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,720
Yes. It's only half a month to make the sample.

24
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,720
This amount is not worth it for us.

25
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,720
How about you give us more?

26
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,720
We can consider it.

27
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,720
Okay. Thank you for your suggestion.

28
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,720
A thousand? That's not enough.

29
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,720
Yes. After all, we're going to get the sample.

30
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,720
How about we find a smaller factory?

31
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,720
But we don't know how to make a good match with this one.

32
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,720
And they're all the best.

33
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,720
If we find a new one,

34
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,720
the time cost will come up again.

35
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,720
If we delay the pre-sale,

36
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,720
will it be called buying a family appetite and then being returned?

37
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,720
Yes. And it's also possible to be considered a hunger strike.

38
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,720
Let's think of another way.

39
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,720
I'll go.

40
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,720
Mom, I'm back.

41
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,720
You're back.

42
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,720
Here you are.

43
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,720
Here.

44
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,720
This is the midnight snack I made for you.

45
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,720
Mom, I've gained 3 pounds since you've been home.

46
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,720
You're so small.

47
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,720
You're not fat.

48
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,720
But I found a problem.

49
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,720
You've been a little abnormal lately.

50
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,720
How?

51
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,720
You've been back too late these days.

52
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,720
I'm busy with my work.

53
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,720
Mom, you don't know.

54
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,720
I'm so annoyed with the order.

55
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,720
It's good to be busy with work.

56
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,720
But there's a saying,

57
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,720
make a family and then make a business.

58
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,720
You have to make a family first and then make a business.

59
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,720
Do you know?

60
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,720
Again?

61
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,720
I'm too busy now.

62
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,720
I'm not free to make a family.

63
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,720
I'm full of orders.

64
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,720
You're a kid.

65
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,720
Why don't you worry about your life?

66
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,720
Then tell me,

67
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,720
is the man you saw in the movie your boyfriend?

68
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,720
Didn't you say that day?

69
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,720
No.

70
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,720
He's like this.

71
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,720
Who is that man?

72
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,720
You really didn't see it clearly?

73
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,720
I just saw a back.

74
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,720
I didn't see the image clearly.

75
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,720
Who is it?

76
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,720
Anyway, as long as it's not that man, it's Qi.

77
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,720
Mom, why are you talking about him again?

78
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,720
Qi is pretty good.

79
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,720
What's good about him?

80
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,720
Mom, what's the kitchen doing?

81
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,720
Is it burnt?

82
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,720
This kid.

83
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,720
Hello, Qi.

84
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,720
What?

85
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,720
Did you have a blind date again?

86
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,720
Blind date?

87
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,720
What blind date?

88
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,720
Every day.

89
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,720
It's good that there's no blind date.

90
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,720
Are you done reading the script?

91
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,720
So idle.

92
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,720
I can't see it.

93
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,720
Recently, you should work hard.

94
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,720
Don't be distracted.

95
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,720
When will auntie go back?

96
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,720
She won't go back.

97
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,720
She won't go back?

98
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,720
What do you mean?

99
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,720
I'll find a time tomorrow morning to tell you.

100
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,720
What?

101
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,720
Wait for me.

102
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,720
Hello?

103
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,720
Hello?

104
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,720
Mom, I'm going out.

105
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,720
Nanxi, it's late. Where are you going?

106
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,720
I'll be back soon.

107
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,720
I'll be back soon.

108
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,720
You kid.

109
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,720
You're so mysterious.

110
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,720
I've been waiting for you.

111
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,720
I tried to hide all the feelings.

112
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,720
Can I be true?

113
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,720
Love is about you.

114
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,720
When I was being surrounded,

115
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,720
I only see you.

116
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,720
You've been my wish and my words too.

117
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,720
Nothing where my name and fear comes to you.

118
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,720
Comes to you.

119
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,720
With you.

120
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,720
I didn't expect you to come back so late.

121
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,720
What's wrong?

122
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,720
Are you unhappy?

123
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,720
Of course not.

124
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,720
I just thought you were busy with work.

125
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,720
So I fell asleep.

126
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,720
Speaking of work,

127
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,720
I do have a headache.

128
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,720
I don't want to accept orders for less than 2000 pre-sale.

129
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,720
But if I keep waiting for pre-sale,

130
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,720
I'm afraid it'll be too high.

131
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,720
Isn't that a worry of happiness?

132
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,720
Now everyone is worried about it.

133
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,720
But we worry about how to sell more.

134
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,720
How about I help you?

135
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,720
No.

136
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,720
You've helped me a lot.

137
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,720
I don't want you to be unhappy with your company.

138
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,720
I'm sorry.

139
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,720
I have an idea.

140
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,720
How about we do live streaming?

141
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,720
I've thought about it before.

142
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,720
But now the live streaming is almost done.

143
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,720
I think we don't have any traffic.

144
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,720
No advantages.

145
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,720
Look.

146
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,720
Now they're all about face.

147
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,720
But we're different.

148
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,720
We can rely on talent.

149
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,720
We can compete with each other.

150
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,720
I don't know how to do that.

151
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,720
I can do it.

152
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,720
What can you do?

153
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,720
But I really have an idea.

154
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,720
It has nothing to do with you.

155
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,720
Live streaming?

156
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,720
Sister Nan, is it like this?

157
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,720
No 998.

158
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,720
No 998.

159
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,720
9.9 yuan.

160
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,720
It's free.

161
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,720
The price we pay is 998 yuan per piece.

162
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,720
No.

163
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,720
I want to give my family 998 yuan.

164
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,720
Ten pieces.

165
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,720
No.

166
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
The price is really too high.

167
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,720
I want to give my family a benefit.

168
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,720
No.

169
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,720
Go to the street.

170
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,720
No.

171
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,720
You two know a lot.

172
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,720
You've seen a lot of it before.

173
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,720
Not doing this kind of live streaming.

174
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,720
I think we should do a live streaming of stories.

175
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,720
Now we rely on content to attract people.

176
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,720
While talking about the legend of jewelry.

177
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,720
While showing our new series.

178
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,720
In the jewelry industry.

179
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,720
There are three diamonds full of legends.

180
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,720
One of them is called the sea star.

181
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,720
Another one is called the African star.

182
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,720
Another one is called the angel.

183
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,720
The most famous one is the sea star.

184
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,720
Why?

185
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,720
Because she is a good woman.

186
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,720
You can.

187
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,720
You even made props.

188
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,720
But when she becomes the sea star.

189
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,720
These props.

190
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,720
And the background of the live streaming room.

191
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,720
I've been doing it for days.

192
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,720
This is the style.

193
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,720
At first, she has a white shell.

194
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,720
Our old designer is getting better.

195
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,720
She can design jewelry.

196
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,720
And design the live streaming room.

197
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,720
Even the sales.

198
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,720
The sales are over a thousand.

199
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,720
Amazing.

200
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,720
Amazing.

201
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,720
It's not as good as those big V.

202
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,720
But for us just started.

203
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,720
I'm still a little satisfied.

204
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,720
We are just starting at this stage.

205
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,720
I believe.

206
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,720
Our studio will get better and better.

207
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,720
Hello, mom.

208
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,720
I'm outside.

209
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,720
I'll be back soon.

210
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,720
Okay, okay.

211
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,720
Since your mom came.

212
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,720
We haven't been together.

213
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,720
I'll go back first.

214
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,720
What's wrong?

215
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,720
It's late.

216
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,720
I'll send you.

217
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,720
I...

218
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,720
Okay, go back.

219
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,720
It's almost dawn.

220
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,720
I'll send you back.

221
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,720
No.

222
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,720
What if my mom sees me in the window?

223
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,720
I almost saw it in the cinema.

224
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,720
You said we were secretly.

225
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,720
When will it be?

226
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,720
Just these days.

227
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,720
I'll find a chance to tell her.

228
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,720
Don't worry.

229
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,720
Really?

230
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,720
Okay, I'll go.

231
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,720
Go.

232
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,720
I'm really leaving.

233
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,720
Don't go.

234
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,720
I'm leaving.

235
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,720
Don't let your mom see me.

236
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,720
Nanxi.

237
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,720
You're back.

238
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,720
Mom, you didn't sleep?

239
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,720
If you don't come back, I'll be restless.

240
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,720
Right.

241
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,720
Mom, let me show you this.

242
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,720
Uncle Zhao introduced this to you.

243
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,720
How is it?

244
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,720
See it?

245
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,720
You can order it.

246
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,720
Take a look.

247
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,720
I'm sleeping.

248
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,720
I don't want to see it.

249
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,720
I really don't want to see it.

250
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,720
I'm sleepy.

251
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,720
I'll go to sleep.

252
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,720
I'll go to sleep.

253
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,720
I'll go to sleep.

254
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,720
I'll go to sleep.

255
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,720
I'll go to sleep.

256
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,720
I really don't want to see it.

257
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,720
I'm sleepy.

258
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,720
I'll go to sleep.

259
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,720
No, you can see it.

260
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,720
I'll go to sleep.

261
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,720
I'll arrange it.

262
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,720
I'll arrange it.

263
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,720
Good growth.

264
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,720
Good morning, my goddess.

265
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,720
Why are you up so early?

266
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,720
I didn't sleep all night yesterday.

267
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,720
Why?

268
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,720
Since you left,

269
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,720
I've been very lonely at home alone.

270
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,720
Do you know that

271
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,720
if I didn't have a strong heart,

272
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,720
I would have depression?

273
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,720
Depression?

274
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,720
If you could have depression,

275
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,720
I guess there would be no depression in this world.

276
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,720
How can you say that about me?

277
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,720
I sent you home yesterday.

278
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,720
You're ungrateful.

279
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,720
I'm not telling you.

280
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,720
I have work.

281
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,720
I'm hanging up.

282
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,720
You're hanging up now?

283
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,720
Hello?

284
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,720
Sister Na Xin,

285
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,720
look at this.

286
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,720
What is this?

287
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,720
This is the online matching room

288
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,720
I found a friend to develop.

289
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,720
It can be matched with jewelry

290
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,720
according to the image or different services of the buyer.

291
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,720
Interesting.

292
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,720
What's interesting?

293
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,720
Lin Yong, you have more ideas.

294
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,720
I didn't expect you to develop software.

295
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,720
No, I did it with a friend.

296
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,720
I hope it can help our studio.

297
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,720
It must be helpful.

298
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,720
I'm glad that

299
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,720
the user can see the effect of matching directly.

300
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,720
When can I go online?

301
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,720
Anytime.

302
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,720
That's great.

303
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,720
That's good.

304
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,720
This is our studio's

305
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,720
exclusive service.

306
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,720
Na Xin, I have something to tell you.

307
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,720
Let's talk downstairs.

308
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,720
Okay.

309
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,720
You can go back to your work.

310
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,720
Look at these first.

311
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,720
This is...

312
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,720
I thought it was strange

313
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,720
when you said you were plagiarizing.

314
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,720
I found these

315
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,720
from Chen Zhe.

316
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,720
He actually has your design draft.

317
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,720
And he built the project later than you.

318
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,720
He later modified the work.

319
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,720
All things are based on these drafts.

320
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,720
Nan Xin,

321
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,720
these are the most useful evidence

322
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,720
you can prove.

323
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,720
Yes, Nan Xin.

324
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,720
Maybe he got these drafts

325
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,720
through some dirty tricks.

326
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,720
Maybe.

327
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,720
How did you get these?

328
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,720
It's none of your business.

329
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,720
Now that you have these evidences,

330
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,720
you can sue him.

331
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,720
As long as you can prove that you didn't plagiarize,

332
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,720
you can stay in the high-end jewelry.

333
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,720
What do you mean, Nan Xin?

334
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,720
These are not the most direct evidences.

335
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,720
If I continue to sue,

336
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,720
it will waste more time and energy.

337
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,720
But now I just want to use my energy

338
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,720
on the things I love.

339
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,720
They have registered the copyright.

340
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,720
I don't have much advantage.

341
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,720
But the most direct evidence is

342
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,720
that I, Gu Nan Xi,

343
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,720
can design more and better jewelry.

344
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,720
But I don't have the right to do so.

345
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,720
I can't do that.

346
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,720
I can't do that.

347
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,720
I can't do that.

348
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,720
I can't design more and better jewelry.

349
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,720
But Chen Zhe can't do that.

350
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,720
I'll manage my studio.

351
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,720
Thank you for helping me.

352
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,720
Okay.

353
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,720
I've made an appointment with you.

354
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,720
I won't bother you.

355
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,720
Just do your best.

356
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,720
Good luck.

357
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,720
Nan Xin.

358
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,720
When are you going to tell

359
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,720
your relationship with Shiyi?

360
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,720
It's not good to have blind dates all the time.

361
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,720
I should have told my mom

362
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,720
at the beginning.

363
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,720
Now it's so embarrassing.

364
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,720
Darling.

365
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,720
I want to discuss something with you.

366
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,720
What is it?

367
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,720
The jewelry of the new department

368
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,720
has entered the critical stage.

369
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,720
The design department's personnel

370
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,720
are not enough.

371
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,720
Just find someone

372
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,720
to do the recruitment.

373
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,720
I mean

374
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,720
can we report it to other companies?

375
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,720
Report?

376
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,720
Anyway, the design is ours.

377
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,720
The title will be Kaige Jewelry.

378
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,720
It's like finding a factory.

379
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,720
You can decide

380
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,720
the small things by yourself.

381
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,720
Shi Qi.

382
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,720
Why are you here?

383
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,720
Are you off work?

384
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,720
I'll take you to a good place.

385
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,720
I have something to do at night.

386
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,720
What?

387
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,720
My mom...

388
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,720
Your mom is going to take you to a blind date again?

389
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,720
I can't take her.

390
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,720
You can't take her?

391
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,720
Okay.

392
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,720
You go. I'll go too.

393
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,720
I'll go to a blind date tomorrow.

394
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,720
No, I...

395
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,720
It's just that we...

396
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,720
We didn't make a good store.

397
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,720
Are you really angry?

398
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,720
Don't be angry.

399
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,720
How can you not be angry?

400
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,720
Fine.

401
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,720
You have a good attitude.

402
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,720
I'll take you there.

403
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,720
You take me there?

404
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,720
I happen to see your mom's beauty.

405
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,720
Let's go.

406
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,720
Hello, Mom.

407
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,720
I'll send you a call.

408
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,720
I'm here.

409
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,720
Go in.

410
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,720
I'll wait for you outside.

411
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,720
Why do I feel strange?

412
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,720
I finally met him today.

413
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,720
He is not my family.

414
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,720
I can understand him.

415
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,720
What about Jingjing and Ban Ban?

416
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,940
J kommt zu

417
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,720
Welcome.

418
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,720
Thank you.

419
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,720
Sit down.

420
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,920
Gu Nanxi.

421
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,920
Hao Wei.

422
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,120
I heard from the introducer that you are a jewelry designer.

423
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,520
We are not young anymore.

424
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,920
So I think we should just open our eyes and see the world.

425
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,920
Okay.

426
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,320
I am 38 years old.

427
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,320
I am Li Yi.

428
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,920
I have a 7-year-old daughter.

429
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,120
I am now a technology company's real shareholder.

430
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,720
And I have three investment companies.

431
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,120
It's awkward. I want to leave.

432
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,920
Call me.

433
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,320
I will hear how awkward it is.

434
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,520
Miss Gu.

435
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,520
Are you listening to me?

436
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,520
Wait for me to continue.

437
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,120
It's like this.

438
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,320
After we are together,

439
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,520
I hope you can put all your energy into the family.

440
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,720
That is, go back to the family.

441
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,520
Take care of my daughter and my family.

442
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,920
Besides, as the old saying goes,

443
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,520
a man and a woman are better than a man and a woman.

444
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,520
So you must give me a boy.

445
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,320
This is my condition.

446
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,920
Do you think it's okay?

447
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,520
No, no, what are you doing?

448
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,920
Why are you here?

449
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,520
I asked you to stay here all night.

450
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,520
It's not good to be at home.

451
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,120
Take care of the child and date with the man.

452
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,120
What? What are you pretending?

453
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,320
Li Yi has been married so many times.

454
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,320
Go, go, go.

455
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,520
What are you doing?

456
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,320
Sorry, sorry.

457
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,520
Well, let me disturb you.

458
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,520
It's like this.

459
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,720
This is the first time I meet this lady.

460
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,920
If you have any misunderstandings,

461
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,720
I hope you two can solve it alone.

462
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,320
I have something to do, so I'll leave you two alone.

463
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,920
Waiter, pay the bill.

464
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,920
She will pay for this.

465
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,520
Okay.

466
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,920
How is it? Is it awkward?

467
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,720
A little.

468
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,320
Will you still date in the future?

469
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,120
Tomorrow, go to my house.

470
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,120
Why?

471
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,520
Introduce you to my mother in person.

472
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,120
Really?

473
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,320
Of course.

474
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,920
I think so.

475
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,920
Today.

476
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,320
Today?

477
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,920
It's so late, are you crazy?

478
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,720
Okay, I'll listen to you.

479
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,920
Tomorrow.

480
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:43,920
Tomorrow.

481
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,120
Come tomorrow morning.

482
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,120
Don't be too early.

483
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,520
Okay.

484
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,720
Silly.

485
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,320
Impossible.

486
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,920
It must be a mistake.

487
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,320
My daughter is not married yet.

488
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,920
Where did she get the child?

489
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,520
Lao Ze.

490
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,720
We have known each other for so many years.

491
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,120
You are the one who begs me.

492
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,520
I am embarrassed this time.

493
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,720
Wait a minute, Nanxin.

494
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,720
Don't be angry.

495
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,120
When I ask her about this,

496
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,120
if it doesn't work,

497
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,320
I'll go to her face to face.

498
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,120
Hello?

499
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,720
Hello?

500
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,320
You are so good.

501
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,320
You have embarrassed yourself.

502
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,120
Mom, I have something to tell you.

503
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,120
Say it.

504
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,120
What is it?

505
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,120
I have a boyfriend.

506
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,520
The one who watched the movie with you?

507
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,320
How long has it been?

508
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,120
A while.

509
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,120
Why don't you tell me about it?

510
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,920
I am still here.

511
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,320
I am worried about introducing you to someone.

512
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,720
What does he do?

513
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,920
What does he do?

514
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,120
Where does he live?

515
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,320
Stop looking for clues, mom.

516
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,320
I'll bring you to see him tomorrow morning.

517
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,920
You will know everything then.

518
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,920
You know him.

519
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,720
I know him?

520
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,920
Okay, I'll go to sleep.

521
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,920
You should rest early.

522
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,320
Don't wake me up tomorrow morning.

523
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,320
I know him.

524
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,120
Hello.

525
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,320
Please hold these.

526
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,920
Thank you.

527
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:36,920
Thank you.

528
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,120
Please hold these.

529
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:43,920
Okay.

530
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,320
Okay.

531
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,920
These should be enough.

532
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,520
Mom.

533
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,720
Why are you staring at me?

534
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,720
You are all ready to go?

535
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,520
Of course.

536
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,720
Can you be more serious about your boyfriend?

537
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:15,920
How is he?

538
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,520
He is beautiful.

539
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,520
Xiaorui.

540
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,720
I am sorry.

541
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,320
I didn't know he is so handsome.

542
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,720
You are beautiful.

543
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,920
I didn't know you are handsome.

544
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,920
You are beautiful.

545
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,320
You are so beautiful.

546
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,720
You are so beautiful.

547
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,120
I really didn't expect it was you.

548
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,520
How long have we not seen each other?

549
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,120
Many years, ma'am.

550
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,920
But after so many years,

551
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,320
you are still so beautiful.

552
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,320
Mom, wait.

553
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,920
Where do you work now?

554
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,520
The director of the design of the Kaige Jewelry?

555
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,720
You're right.

556
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,800
Nanxi is to blame for this.

557
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,760
She even hid it from me.

558
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,160
If you had told me it was Xiao Xiao,

559
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,640
I wouldn't have been so worried.

560
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,080
I didn't...

561
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:19,600
Miss.

562
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,320
When did you come?

563
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,480
If I knew you were here,

564
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,280
I would have come to see you.

565
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,280
It's okay.

566
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,560
You've been together for so long.

567
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,640
What are your plans?

568
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,440
Miss.

569
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,520
Well...

570
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,240
Look.

571
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,000
Time flies.

572
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,120
You graduated from college.

573
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,160
You're 30 years old.

574
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,840
I'm 32.

575
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,400
You're 32?

576
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,440
You have time to work hard.

577
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,240
But if you miss your marriage,

578
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,120
you won't be able to come back for two years.

579
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:52,960
Right?

580
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,600
Miss.

581
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,800
Don't give up. I understand.

582
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,480
Enough, Mom.

583
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,040
No, Mom.

584
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,440
Do you know what's going on?

585
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,320
Did I introduce you?

586
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,200
You're talking nonsense.

587
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,600
What are you talking about?

588
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,880
We didn't talk about anything.

589
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,920
Xiao Rui is not my boyfriend.

590
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,960
We broke up long ago.

591
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,640
And he has a fiancee now.

592
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,840
My boyfriend is Qin Shiqi.

593
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,280
You have a fiancee?

594
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,360
Then why did you come to our Nanxi?

595
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,360
You're not welcome here.

596
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,480
Miss.

597
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,040
Xiao Rui.

598
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,440
Why don't you take something with you?

599
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,400
Miss.

600
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,640
Sorry.

601
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,200
Sorry to bother you.

602
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,800
What did you say?

603
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,360
Your boyfriend is Qin Shiqi?

604
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,400
Mom.

605
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,040
I know you're worried.

606
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,880
But Shiqi is really nice.

607
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,920
You must be hoping that I'll be happy.

608
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,240
I feel very happy

609
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,600
when I'm with Shiqi.

610
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,320
Anyway, no matter what you think,

611
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,440
I'm sure it's him.

612
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,920
Hello, aunt.

613
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,520
My name is Qin Shiqi.

614
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,520
I'm an actor.

615
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,120
I've known Nanxi since we were kids.

616
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,200
You're here.

617
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,560
I've been waiting for you.

618
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,640
Come on.

619
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,200
Why are you here?

620
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,600
Why are you here?

621
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,280
Look at you.

622
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,520
Is this a secret place?

623
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,880
I can't come.

624
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,800
Shiqi.

625
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,760
You're about to join the team.

626
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,000
Get ready.

627
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,680
You don't have to remind me of that.

628
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,240
I'm a member of the product company.

629
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,880
I think I have a duty to remind you.

630
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,160
Thank you for reminding me.

631
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,320
I'm so scared.

632
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,240
I want to go home.

633
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,800
I'm scared.

634
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,240
I'm afraid I can't do anything now.

635
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,040
You're good at our future plan.

636
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,280
Now,

637
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,400
I'm afraid it's hard to achieve.

638
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,400
You've changed.

639
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,440
No.

640
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,520
You said you can't be a little low-key.

641
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,680
What's wrong with you, Nanxi?

642
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,640
My mom is in a bad mood today.

643
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,080
Don't mind what I say.

644
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,800
Don't worry. I'll be careful.

645
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,880
I understand.

646
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,000
But I hope you can go back to that

647
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,400
positive and previous Gangliuzi.

648
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,200
Don't worry.

649
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,720
I'm willing to be with you.

650
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,080
I'm willing to wait for you.

651
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,080
Auntie.

652
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,320
Don't worry.

653
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,840
I...

654
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,680
Put it down.

655
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:59,200
I can't answer this question right away

656
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,120
But I like all of Nanxi

657
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,800
I like her serious work

658
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,720
I like her strong-willed

659
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,080
I like her pure in life

660
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,520
I also like her lying

661
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,200
As long as it's Nanxi

662
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,600
I like everything about her

663
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:22,000
Maybe you think

664
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,760
I'm just saying some big words

665
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,200
Something unrealistic

666
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,640
But from the moment I reported Nanxi University

667
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,840
I saw her

668
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,200
I fell in love with her

669
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,480
Today, I have something to tell you

670
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,480
Just one word

671
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,480
Gu Nanxi, I love you

672
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,720
I think she's my whole world

673
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,080
No matter where she goes

674
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,640
She's always in my heart

675
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,360
These times will prove it

676
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,360
How old are you this year?

677
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,320
I'm 24 this year

678
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,120
Do you know how old Nanxi is?

679
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,120
29

680
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,600
You have time

681
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,000
But Nanxi's best time

682
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,400
Is the time you spend with her

683
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,040
That's why I want her to wear wedding dress

684
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,880
In this beautiful year

685
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,800
And with me

686
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,720
You want to marry Nanxi?

687
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,600
Yes

688
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,280
Marrying Nanxi is my biggest dream

689
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,040
Arrangement

690
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,200
What should I do?

691
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,880
No, aunt

692
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,480
What do you mean?

693
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,360
Are you stupid?

694
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,560
Passed the test

695
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,520
Passed the test

696
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,760
Where did you copy that line?

697
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,640
I don't know

698
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,200
I just said it when I was nervous

699
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,240
Nervous?

700
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,280
Nonsense

701
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:09,920
I'm not

702
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,120
I'm telling the truth

703
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,240
Trust me

704
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,320
Who are you two?

705
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,000
Come and help me

706
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,000
I'm coming, aunt

707
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,720
