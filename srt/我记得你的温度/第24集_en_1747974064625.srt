1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
I thought you would be more capable of this.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,000
Well, that's good.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,400
Hurry up.

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,900
I will watch your video.

5
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,380
When I pass by or you are tired from talking,

6
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,580
I will warn you.

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:15,980
Sister Li,

8
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,280
I need to see you at home.

9
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,160
Sister Li,

10
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,100
I think your filming time has come to an end?

11
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:25,640
Xiao Cay,

12
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,080
I have paid off my debts for your 과 with your stalling deals.

13
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,480
Do you understand?

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,880
You have to tell me.

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,080
In my arms,

16
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,280
who are you?

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,680
How can you hide in my soft heart?

18
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,880
I want to keep you close to me.

19
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,080
Be your little star.

20
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,880
I will always be by your side.

21
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,480
I will never be too close to you.

22
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,680
I want to keep you close to me.

23
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,880
I will keep your secret.

24
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,880
I will always look for you.

25
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:04,480
I will always be waiting for you.

26
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,880
I want to keep you close to me.

27
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,080
Be your little star.

28
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,080
I will always be by your side.

29
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,480
I will never be too close to you.

30
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,680
I want to keep you close to me.

31
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,880
I will always be by your side.

32
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,480
I will always look for you.

33
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:31,480
I will always be by your side.

34
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,480
I will protect you.

35
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,680
Hello?

36
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,080
I didn't expect that I would meet you here.

37
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,080
I am so angry.

38
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:08,080
I said that I would make you lose your heart and mouth.

39
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,880
What's the point of being angry?

40
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,680
But I don't think I have any loss.

41
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,080
Really?

42
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,080
It was a matter of being angry.

43
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,480
It was a matter of giving you surprises in the competition.

44
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,680
But I can't bear to see you anymore.

45
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,080
Are you upset?

46
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,080
I should say that I am worried.

47
00:02:53,080 --> 00:03:00,080
I am a little bit depressed.

48
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,080
Is this your good friend who gave it to me personally?

49
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,080
Lu Lu.

50
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,080
From Lu Lu?

51
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,080
But Lu Lu is such a liar.

52
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,080
I gave her some useless things.

53
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,080
She would do this for me.

54
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,480
What are you talking about?

55
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,080
I just came out of your mouth.

56
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,080
What a waste.

57
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,680
Do you still want to defeat me?

58
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,680
Then defeat yourself with your own fault.

59
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,080
I am so shy.

60
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,080
Hello, everyone.

61
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,080
Welcome to the third season of the jewelry market competition.

62
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,080
You can see that our four players are on the stage.

63
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,080
Now I announce that the competition starts now.

64
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,080
Let's look forward to the performance of the four players.

65
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,080
Your находry.

66
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,080
Oh my god in the μποre game.

67
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,080
The duet event is anxious.

68
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,080
Who does it up to?

69
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,280
Ruan Xiao Κ Dieter.

70
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,480
Please have the chance to ask your way.

71
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,700
Do you remember this ?

72
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,220
Yes.

73
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,300
Not me.

74
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,680
Don't talk.

75
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:20,860
All right.

76
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,600
How did Nan Qi's draft

77
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,520
get into Xiao Rui's hands?

78
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,920
I don't know.

79
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,600
It must be because of Lulu.

80
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,920
After this design draft was lost,

81
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,320
Lulu was left to nothing.

82
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,680
Lulu?

83
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,200
What did Lulu do?

84
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,000
Why would she do it?

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,200
It must be because of money.

86
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,160
She doesn't have to think about it.

87
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,480
Xiao Rui must have given her a lot of money.

88
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,760
Okay, stop talking.

89
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,120
Let's watch the game first.

90
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,640
The game is over.

91
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,200
I'm going to play the game.

92
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,280
I'm going to play the game.

00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,520

00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,360
I'm going to play the game.

97
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,640
I'm going to play the game.

98
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,840
I'm going to play the game.

99
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,080
I'm going to play the game.

100
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,200
I'm going to play the game.

101
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,360
I'm going to play the game.

102
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,400
I'm going to play the game.

103
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,520
I'm going to play the game.

104
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,680
I'm going to play the game.

105
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,840
I'm going to play the game.

106
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,920
I'm going to play the game.

107
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,040
I'm going to play the game.

108
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,320
I'm going to play the game.

109
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,640
I'm going to play the game.

110
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,800
I'm going to play the game.

111
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,240
I'm going to play the game.

112
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,760
I'm going to play the game.

113
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,440
I'm going to play the game.

114
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,920
I'm going to play the game.

115
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,840
I'm going to play the game.

116
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,080
I'm going to play the game.

117
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,140
I'm going to play the game.

118
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,900
Give up.

119
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,840
No matter how hard you try,

120
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,740
you won't beat me.

121
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,400
It's all my own work.

122
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,040
Aren't you the same as me?

123
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,240
Do you have your own work to participate in?

124
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,240
It's about time.

125
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,440
Now, the time for the competition

126
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,040
is running out.

127
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,040
We can see that

128
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,240
the players of Gu Nanxi

129
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,040
are still working on it.

130
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,240
Can Gu Nanxi do it?

131
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,040
I don't know.

132
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,440
I feel a little nervous.

133
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,240
Yes, it's you.

134
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,640
Now, we'll tell you.

135
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,440
Five,

136
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,040
four,

137
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,840
three,

138
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,440
two,

139
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,440
one.

140
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,640
Time's up.

141
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,440
Yi Ni,

142
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,240
what does Qing look like for her?

143
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,440
Please focus on the performance

144
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,600
That was a beautiful performance.

145
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,360
I think I did quite well this time.

146
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,560
Just as i am,

147
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,640
but i can still hold the seperti de..

148
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,360
Not at all,

149
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,880
The Ration soon has appeared

150
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,880
in many years.

151
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,260
Maybe your Zhendong Wuji

152
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:20,620
knows how lucky you are

153
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,560
waiting for you.

154
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,480
Tell me.

155
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,200
You think a designer without a sense of smell

156
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,520
is a judge?

157
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,320
What kind of judge will you give?

158
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,240
It seems you really don't know about this.

159
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,560
I'm completely fine.

160
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,320
I'm so nervous.

161
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,360
Yes.

162
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,640
Let's see who kap this gift will be.

163
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,360
Wait a minute.

164
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,420
spoons否

165
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,280
Except this much handsome man

166
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,380
Simple after

167
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,040
Yes.

168
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,880
When do they apply the emergency medicine?

169
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:14,880
gorgeous

170
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,140
is the REALruck

171
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,080
has done

172
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:17,760
means

173
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,320
Mushroom

174
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,280
is small

175
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,440
and sweet

176
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,660
Fake

177
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:21,960
so

178
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:22,240
Don't gossip W제가

179
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:28,160
You can see that every player's head has a light

180
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,360
Later, I will open the envelope

181
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,160
The light on the player's head will be extinguished

182
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,560
The last player who has not been extinguished

183
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,880
is the last champion

184
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,880
Let's look forward to it

185
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,800
This result really surprised me

186
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,640
We can see that there are two champion candidates in the arena

187
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,760
This is the first time I have seen such a fair autumn game

188
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,880
Now, let's welcome our four judges to discuss the last name

189
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,720
And then everyone, please welcome the two powerful players

190
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,320
Ladies and Gentlemen,

191
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:24,540
please welcome O Tang

192
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,040
Please welcome O Tang

193
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,180
Ladies and Gentlemen, please welcome O Tang

194
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,720
Ladies and Gentlemen, please welcome O Tang

195
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,540
Please welcome O Tang

196
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,800
O Tang

197
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,840
After theuelas,

198
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,700
Please invite

199
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,900
and then decide

200
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,540
to tell the story

201
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,180
of the game

202
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,860
by the two players.

203
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,260
What's the story?

204
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,420
I don't know.

205
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,300
I'm really curious

206
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,340
about the story.

207
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,980
Then let's invite Mr. Xiao Rui

208
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,620
to tell us

209
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,420
the story behind you.

210
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,260
In a birthday banquet,

211
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:31,820
half a year,

212
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,060
there was a beautiful music.

213
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,660
In the middle of the dance,

214
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,500
there was a beautiful princess

215
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,100
who attracted everyone's attention.

216
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,500
Who is it?

217
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,900
Who is it?

218
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,220
Who is it?

219
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,700
I can tell

220
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,220
it was a peaceful young day.

221
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,460
Though the design was so elegant,

222
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,620
it didn't apply on me.

223
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,140
How could

224
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,380
Zhang Chenqiu came here?

225
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,700
I lamp it

226
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,880
for the design

227
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,800
of the royal flower

228
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,440
and the Empress of Fire and

229
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,300
Cloud of Happiness.

230
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,460
Which isСyne Princess,

231
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,460
Her Chinese is

232
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,960
bright, pure,

233
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,960
elegant, and modern.

234
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,960
Thank you.

235
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,960
Xiao Rui's speech is very brilliant.

236
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,460
Let's invite Ms. Gu Nanxi to tell us

237
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,960
her behind-the-scenes story.

238
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,960
I want to talk about a long-term love story of 11 years.

239
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,960
At that time, she was still young.

240
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,960
When she first saw her,

241
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,960
she fell in love with her.

242
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,460
After she was born,

243
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:59,460
she did everything she could

244
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,960
to protect her.

245
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,960
Even a word she didn't know,

246
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,960
she would try to pursue her dream.

247
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,960
She experienced the joy of being a girl.

248
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,960
In the 11 years,

249
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,960
Nanhe's love for her has never changed.

250
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,960
That's how she fought with girls.

251
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,960
They got together.

252
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,460
From the dream,

253
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,460
Nanhe took out a straw can

254
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,960
and put the straw can on the girl's finger.

255
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,460
We all know that

256
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:41,460
it may represent the persistence of love for a while.

257
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,960
But is it not the case

258
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,960
that Nanhe loves girls?

259
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,960
Even if she doesn't need too much effort,

260
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,960
she's just a straw can

261
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,960
and she's very serious.

262
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,960
This is the meaning of my creation.

263
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,960
Thank you.

264
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,960
Both of you are very brilliant.

265
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,960
I believe you can all agree.

266
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,960
Let's give the four judges

267
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,960
the final result.

268
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,460
I think so too.

269
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,460
This story of Gu Nanxi

270
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,460
is very good.

271
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,460
I'm so touched.

272
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,460
After the judges' decision,

273
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,460
the judges will decide

274
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,960
that the final result

275
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,960
is the result of the judges' consideration.

276
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,960
Then the final winner

277
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,960
of this competition is

278
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,960
Gu Nanxi.

279
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,960
Come on.

280
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,960
I'm so touched

281
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,960
about the story you told today.

282
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,960
What's your relationship with you?

283
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,960
I have a feeling that I can't do it.

284
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,960
Gu Nanxi!

285
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,960
Regarding the face,

286
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,960
I feel various.

287
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,960
I love dreams.

288
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,960
But I'm not well.

289
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,960
I'm at the top.

290
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,960
Oops!

291
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,960
Both of you are so good at Rowan!

292
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,960
You'll never succeed!

293
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,960
What's your last name?

294
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,800
It's okay.

295
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,320
Yufan, let's go first.

296
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,320
What else do you want to say?

297
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,640
You won this time.

298
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,440
Remember.

299
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,320
Next time,

300
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,960
you won't be so easy.

301
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,520
Do you still think there's another chance?

302
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,680
What do you mean?

303
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,080
I've been thinking

304
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,280
why you would do this.

305
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,480
You stole everything from me.

306
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,120
Those are not for you.

307
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,080
So you're afraid of losing.

308
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,840
So you don't want to do anything.

309
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,720
But do you think it's meaningful?

310
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,800
Stop being a star!

311
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,520
Don't use the face of the winner

312
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,680
to say it's okay.

313
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,680
Winner?

314
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,240
Do you think this is okay?

315
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,960
I really don't think it's important.

316
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,400
I think it's important

317
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,560
to be with the one you love.

318
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,160
You can't get this.

319
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,320
Qin Shiqing,

320
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,960
I think you can still be a star.

321
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,160
Anyway, the show is about to start.

322
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,440
You're the one who's got a lot of people.

323
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,600
You're the one who's got a lot of people.

324
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,760
I know.

325
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,880
Can I arrange for you to get ready?

326
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,880
I'm doing this because you're giving up

327
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,800
and I'm willing to give you a full...

328
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,800
Sure.

329
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,960
I'll reward you with a gift

330
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,640
for your hard work.

331
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,840
What do you reward me for?

332
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,000
Why don't you buy me a car?

333
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,400
Come out.

334
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,040
You're so mysterious.

335
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,640
Hello, Grandpa.

336
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,800
Thank you for your love for me.

337
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,240
Can I have a drink with you?

338
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,040
A drink?

339
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,800
I'm so happy to see you.

340
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I'm so happy.

341
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,800
You didn't have to go yesterday.

342
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,800
Don't worry.

343
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,040
I have time.

344
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,040
I'll talk to you later.

345
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,880
You go ahead.

346
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,680
I'll come later.

347
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,680
See you later.

348
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,880
Sir, can you give me a rabbit sign?

349
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,840
A rabbit.

350
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,840
A color.

351
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,840
A language.

352
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,040
Thank you.

353
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,840
Come on.

354
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,840
Thank you.

355
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,640
I'll do my best.

356
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,400
Okay.

357
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,440
Go back to your work.

358
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,440
Yes.

359
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,040
Mr. Zhao, I'll go first.

360
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,840
Okay.

361
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,640
Come on.

362
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,640
Okay.

363
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,040
Come on.

364
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,040
Xiao Yang.

365
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,040
Interesting.

366
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,640
Hello.

367
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,240
I'll see you later.

368
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,440
Sister Kela.

369
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,240
I'm so curious.

370
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,840
What's your relationship with Sister Kela?

371
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,840
It's about the martial arts.

372
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,040
Don't mention it.

373
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,840
I know you and Shi Qi are in love.

374
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,840
I can tell.

375
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,840
After Shi Qi gave you a chance,

376
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,240
she changed a lot.

377
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,040
Mr. Liu,

378
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,840
you especially asked me to talk to you

379
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,040
to say this.

380
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,040
I...

381
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,840
am a businessman.

382
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,240
I signed with Shi Qi.

383
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,240
Actually, I didn't make money.

384
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,840
To be honest,

385
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,640
after the show ended today,

386
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,240
she didn't propose to you.

387
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,640
Shi Qi

388
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,440
is very talented

389
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,040
in the acting industry.

390
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,240
I believe

391
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,240
she will go far away.

392
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,040
But

393
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,640
I don't want you to

394
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,040
get involved with me now.

395
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,840
This will definitely ruin the thing.

396
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,440
Definitely.

397
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,840
I'm not against you.

398
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,840
Nan Xi,

399
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,840
I

400
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,840
will give Shi Qi

401
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,040
and me

402
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,840
some time.

403
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,440
In five years,

404
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,240
I promise that in five years,

405
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,640
I will make Shi Qi

406
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,640
become a famous star.

407
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,440
Definitely.

408
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,040
Just like today's first day,

409
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,640
this is the beginning.

410
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,240
Gao Gao.

411
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,440
Of course, I'm willing to wait for her for five years.

412
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,840
But your character in Shi Qi,

413
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,840
I know.

414
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,840
Let me think about it.

415
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,840
Thank you.

416
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,840
I'm not going to be a star.

417
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,840
I'm not going to be a star.

418
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,840
I'm not going to be a star.

419
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,840
I'm not going to be a star.

420
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,840
I'm not going to be a star.

421
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,840
I'm not going to be a star.

422
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,840
I'm not going to be a star.

423
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,840
I'm not going to be a star.

424
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,840
I'm not going to be a star.

425
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,840
I'm not going to be a star.

426
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,840
I'm not going to be a star.

427
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,840
I'm not going to be a star.

428
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,840
I'm not going to be a star.

429
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,840
I'm not going to be a star.

430
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,840
I'm not going to be a star.

431
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,840
I'm not going to be a star.

432
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,840
I'm not going to be a star.

433
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,840
I'm not going to be a star.

434
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,840
I'm not going to be a star.

435
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,840
I'm not going to be a star.

436
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,840
I'm not going to be a star.

437
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,840
I'm not going to be a star.

438
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,840
I'm not going to be a star.

439
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,840
I'm not going to be a star.

440
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,840
I'm not going to be a star.

441
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,840
I think of your essence job.

442
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,840
I mean your secret.

443
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,840
I will keep looking for you.

444
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,840
I'm just waiting for you.

445
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,840
I'm so stupid.

446
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,840
I am so stupid.

447
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,840
cruel

448
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,640
Anxi!

449
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:56,840
Shiqi.

450
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,640
I'm happy to see you succeed today.

451
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:01,840
Congratulations.

452
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,840
I've thought about the relationship between us carefully.

453
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,640
You're still so young.

454
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,640
There's still a lot of space for you to develop.

455
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,240
And I can't have you so selfishly

456
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,840
and not care about your development.

457
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,440
So I decided to let go.

458
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,640
Because if I see you,

459
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,040
I really don't know what to say.

460
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,440
Maybe after I see you,

461
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,240
I can't say anything.

462
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,040
So I can only leave a letter to you.

463
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,440
The ring I designed

464
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,440
is the first one I made for you.

465
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,840
It's also the last one.

466
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,240
It belongs to the two of us.

467
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,440
A common memory.

468
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,840
Don't ask me where I went.

469
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,840
I think we won't see each other again.

470
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,040
Thank you for your love for me.

471
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,240
Thank you for appearing in my life.

472
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,800
Thank you for this

473
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,840
most beautiful memory.

474
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,240
Anxi!

475
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,840
Anxi!

476
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,440
I've heard your feelings.

477
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,040
I'm afraid I'll fall in love with you.

478
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,040
The past is a secret.

479
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,040
I won't know you.

480
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,040
I used to love you.

481
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,040
But I regretted it the most.

482
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,440
Anxi.

483
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,440
I'm afraid I'll be hurt.

484
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,040
I'll be done with you.

485
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,440
He left.

486
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,440
He left me.

487
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,840
He left me.

488
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,840
He left me.

489
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,040
A year has passed.

490
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,040
I've never heard from him.

491
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,040
It's like he never appeared in my life.

492
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,640
But I don't think

493
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,640
other people's life has changed.

494
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,440
Old man!

495
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,840
Old man!

496
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,240
You're so messy.

497
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,640
Don't you know how to clean up?

498
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,840
I work 12 hours a day.

499
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,440
You don't know how to help me.

500
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,440
You don't know how to love me, do you?

501
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,440
I'm talking to you.

502
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,440
What's wrong with you?

503
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,440
I'm getting married to you.

504
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,440
What do you mean?

505
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,440
Are you tired now?

506
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,040
Listen.

507
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,440
If you're like this,

508
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,640
I'll be like Anxi.

509
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,840
I'll be like a Buddha.

510
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,240
My sister is still the same.

511
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:50,840
What are you looking at?

512
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,640
She's so lively.

513
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,440
You've been calling me that?

514
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,440
She's still a good girl.

515
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,240
I'll let her sit here.

516
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,040
I think this is the love between them.

517
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,240
I'll talk to you.

518
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,040
Oh, right.

519
00:25:59,240 --> 00:25:59,640
Money!

520
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,040
The business in the West is getting better.

521
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,040
Lin Yong, come here.

522
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,040
This product is the best I've ever sold.

523
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,440
Yes.

524
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,440
Then our customer order will be increased.

525
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,840
I'm going to work overtime tonight.

526
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:22,640
Xiaoru.

527
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,840
Can't we work overtime today?

528
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,040
Let's go to the movies.

529
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,440
Okay.

530
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,240
You can go on.

531
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,240
You can go alone.

532
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,440
I mean,

533
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,040
where are we going?

534
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,840
It seems that this studio has magic power.

535
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,040
People who are in the studio

536
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,640
are all in love with me.

537
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,040
I'll leave the rest to them.

538
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,240
I also wish them a happy life.

539
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,240
As for me,

540
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,440
although I still think of her,

541
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,640
this feeling is like a dream.

542
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,040
It's so real.

543
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,440
I can't catch it.

544
00:26:59,040 --> 00:26:59,640
Forget it.

545
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:00,640
Don't think about it.

546
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,040
As long as she lives well,

547
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,440
I'll buy her a new family.

548
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:04,640
Oh, right.

549
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,040
For the dream between us,

550
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,640
I wrote our story into a web novel.

551
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,440
I didn't expect that the click rate on the Internet is good.

552
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,440
Is this a ending?

553
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:22,840
Yes.

554
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,640
But I don't know how to write this ending.

555
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:26,640
I don't know.

556
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,640
Just control it.

557
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,040
Leave some space for the reader.

558
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,840
I always want to give our story

559
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,440
a beautiful ending.

560
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,040
But I don't know how to do it in the end.

561
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,040
Shiqi.

562
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,640
Maybe it's because of her.

563
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:48,840
How is it written?

564
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,240
My nightmare is not in the end.

565
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,240
Tell me.

566
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,040
I'm waiting for the news.

567
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,040
I'm waiting for the boss.

568
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,040
If you don't come to disturb me,

569
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,240
I might write it faster.

570
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,240
I'm here to tell you about the wedding.

571
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,040
I haven't finished writing it.

572
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,640
I'll leave as you say.

573
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,440
Okay.

574
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,440
Thank you.

575
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,040
Thank you.

576
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:22,840
Okay.

577
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:23,440
Coming.

578
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,840
Okay.

579
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:25,640
Long time no see.

580
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,440
You're here too.

581
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,440
Long time no see.

582
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,440
You're finally here.

583
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,840
I'll be back soon.

584
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,840
Why are you not happy with your wedding?

585
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,440
Why are you still here?

586
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,040
The wedding is about to start.

587
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,040
Go back.

588
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,640
Go back.

589
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,240
Dear guests,

590
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,840
welcome to the wedding of Mr. Leng and Miss Qin

591
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,440
during the 100-day engagement.

592
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,040
Before the wedding,

593
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,640
we'd like to thank Miss Qin

594
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,840
for giving us a round of applause.

595
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,240
Okay.

596
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,440
Okay.

597
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,040
Thank you for taking part in my wedding.

598
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,840
And thank you, Mr. Leng.

599
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,640
Before my wedding,

600
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,040
my brother has something to say.

601
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:41,840
Okay.

602
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:42,640
Okay.

603
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,440
Let's go.

604
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,640
Hurry up.

605
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,440
Hurry up.

606
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,440
If you don't say it,

607
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,040
I won't take the wedding.

608
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,240
Don't worry about me.

609
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,640
Hurry up.

610
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,640
Come on.

611
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,840
Today is a big wedding day.

612
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,840
I want to take my sister

613
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,840
and my brother-in-law's wedding scene

614
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,840
and let her wash the wedding.

615
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,040
I want to chase back

616
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,440
the love I lost a year ago.

617
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,640
Good.

618
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,840
Good.

619
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,440
Nanxi,

620
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,440
I lost you a year ago.

621
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,640
Thank you for letting me meet you again.

622
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,040
I don't want to lose you again.

623
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,640
It's 365 days in a year.

624
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,440
I want to be with you

625
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:58,640
in spring, autumn, winter, summer, and every day.

626
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,440
Some people say

627
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,240
marriage is the grave of love.

628
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,240
But I don't think so.

629
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,440
I think marriage is the power of love.

630
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,040
This ring

631
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,440
is a little bit low-key for our love.

632
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,840
I hope you can accept it today.

633
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,640
Accept my love.

634
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,240
Nanxi,

635
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,840
can you marry me?

636
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,840
Marry her.

637
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,840
Marry her.

638
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,840
Marry her.

639
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,840
Marry her.

640
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,840
Marry her.

641
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,840
Marry her.

642
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,840
Marry her.

643
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,840
Marry her.

644
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,840
Great!

645
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,840
You said you'd meet her

646
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,840
in a shooting star.

647
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,840
You gave me a red heart.

648
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,840
I hold my hands

649
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,840
holding the sky.

650
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,840
Every wish I made

651
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,840
is easy to fulfill.

652
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,840
I have a child

653
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,840
who doesn't know me.

654
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,840
I take away

655
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,840
the things I've taken away

656
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,840
with me.

657
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,840
I don't care.

658
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,840
I can't keep flying.

659
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,840
I want to fly further.

660
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,840
I hold your little heart.

661
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,840
I can't use the whole sky

662
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,840
to wander around.

663
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,840
Why are you back suddenly?

664
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,840
I'm not back.

665
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,840
How do you want to write your ending?

666
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,840
There's no ending story.

667
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,840
It's really bad.

668
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,840
Have you thought about

669
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,840
the ending of the good story?

670
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,840
Thank you

671
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,840
for giving me the best ending.

672
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,840
I love you.

673
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,840
Congratulations on your first gold medal.

674
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,840
You're now seven years old.

675
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,840
Shiqi,

676
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,840
give her a name.

677
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,840
Let's call her Qiqi.

678
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,840
Why Qiqi?

679
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,840
Because this is the 14th year

680
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,840
I love you.

681
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,840
I love you.

682
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,840
I love you.

683
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,840
I love you.
