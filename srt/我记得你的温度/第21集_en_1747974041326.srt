00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,500
Are you angry or not? You have to say goodbye to me

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,500
In my arms, who are you?

10
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:41,500
How can you hide in my soft heart?

11
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,500
I want to be closer to you, from your little heart

I'm always gentle, I can't use you

00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:20,500
I want to be closer to you, to protect your secret

19
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,500
I will always look for you

20
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:30,500
I want to be closer to you, to protect your secret

21
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,500
I will always look for you

22
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,500

26
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,500
You're awake?

27
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:10,500
You sleep for a while, I'll let you go to the scene to see it

28
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,500
You're going to the shooting?

29
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,500
Why don't you let Yan Yan go to the shooting today? I'll be your assistant

30
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,500
No, assistant is too tired

31
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,500
But I want to see you in the shooting

32
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,500
Really?

33
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:35,500
Then I can only give you 20 minutes of time to clean up

34
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,500
Enough

35
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,500
Episode 1

36
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,500
Slow down

37
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,500
Here, don't throw it

38
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,500
It's okay

39
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,500
Look at that

40
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Is this the crew?

41
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,500
How many people?

42
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,500
Right, go get it

43
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,500
Okay

44
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,500
It's such a hot day, it's hard to clean up

45
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,500
Yes

46
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,500
Police car, ambulance

47
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,500
Morning, director

48
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,500
Morning, Zhixi

49
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,500
I told you to have dinner yesterday, why didn't you go?

50
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,500
You're here to be friends?

51
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,500
Hello, I'm Qin's new assistant

52
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,500
What assistant? Don't talk nonsense

53
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,500
I'll introduce you to him

54
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,500
He's my girlfriend, the designer Gu Nanxi

55
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,500
The designer

56
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,500
The designer alone?

57
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,500
Not bad

58
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,500
He's a good actor

59
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:53,500
Zhixi, listen to me, if you have a boss to work today, you have to prepare

60
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,500
Don't worry, director, no problem

61
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,500
Please

62
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,500
I'll go over there

63
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,500
Okay, got it

64
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,500
Go ahead

65
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,500
Let's go, we'll go there

66
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,500
You said I'm the assistant, why are you so full?

67
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,500
Why, you're embarrassed?

68
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,500
I'm a girl who has worked hard to find a girlfriend

69
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,500
You don't want me to learn it?

70
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,500
Okay, you do

71
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,500
You stay here and rest

72
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,500
You just...

73
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,500
What are you doing?

74
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,500
Sister

75
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,500
Sit here

76
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,500
Sit, sister

77
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,500
Are you tired?

78
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,500
I'm fine

79
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,500
Sister, there's snacks and drinks here

80
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,500
You can have whatever you want

81
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,500
Teacher Jiang, the show is ready, we can start

82
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,500
Okay, you go first

83
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,500
Okay

84
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,500
I'm going to work, wait for me to come back

85
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,500
You rest here

86
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,500
Okay

87
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,500
You rest here

88
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,500
Bye, Yan Yan

89
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,500
Bye, sister

90
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,500
Boss is here

91
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,500
Hello, sit down

92
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,500
I'll go over there

93
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,500
Okay, sit down

94
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,500
I'll go over there

95
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,500
Okay

96
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,500
You look fine

97
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,500
Boss, you get it

98
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,500
What do I know?

99
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,500
I can see it

100
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,500
You look fine

101
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,500
Especially today

102
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,500
Your girlfriend is here

103
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,500
Girlfriend?

104
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,500
Over there

105
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:06,500
冷象

106
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:07,980
Lina

107
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,420
Long time no see

108
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,800
Why are you here?

109
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,420
Well, I'm a special guest

110
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,060
no honor

111
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,860
not like that

112
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,760
All I felt was

113
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,400
nice to meet you here

114
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,300
Makes me very Boom

115
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,640
Be cool

116
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,760
Okay, I got them

117
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,060
How was it?

118
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:27,960
scientific pressure

119
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:28,940
Good

120
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,420
Let's go

121
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,260
Okay.

122
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,980
What have you been up to lately?

123
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,580
I haven't heard from you.

124
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,420
I opened

125
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,780
my own jewelry studio.

126
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,580
There are quite a lot of things.

127
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,060
Not bad.

128
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,380
Did I help you

129
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,940
with anything?

130
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,660
I'm on my way to Pingping Hua.

131
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,180
There's no need to worry about

132
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:54,700
anything between you and Kaige.

133
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,100
Fine.

134
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,260
Actually, since you left,

135
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,140
I've always felt that I'm very grateful to you.

136
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,500
What are you talking about?

137
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,820
You helped me

138
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,980
pay 200,000 yuan for the deposit.

139
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,420
I feel very grateful to you.

140
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,740
Lan Xi.

141
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,660
Thank you.

142
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,380
When I didn't know you before,

143
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,060
I was quite impressed by you.

144
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:20,980
Because Xiaorui,

145
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,900
you know that, right?

146
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,460
I understand.

147
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,100
You're a good friend.

148
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,100
Actually,

149
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,340
since I first started working at the shop,

150
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,860
I've been working with you for a long time.

151
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,900
I found that your work is very powerful.

152
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,580
Everyone is clear about it.

153
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,340
If it weren't for that,

154
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,100
I would have worked with you all the time.

155
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,780
But

156
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,580
Kaige has so many shareholders.

157
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,180
I have to be responsible for them.

158
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,740
So I sincerely hope

159
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,020
you can understand me.

160
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,180
Of course I do.

161
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,940
You don't have to say so much to me.

162
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,860
At that time, things didn't happen

163
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,980
in our design department.

164
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,980
It had a big impact on the company.

165
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,220
I feel very sorry.

166
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,260
And

167
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,220
if I hadn't left Kaige,

168
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,420
I might have forgotten

169
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,540
my original ideal.

170
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,900
So it must not be a bad thing.

171
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,540
It seems that

172
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,460
you've found your own life goal.

173
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,540
How are you and Qin Shiqi?

174
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,420
I'm fine.

175
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,140
Fine.

176
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,340
I'm so happy

177
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,100
that you're so happy now.

178
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,140
Alright.

179
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,340
I won't be in your shoes.

180
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,020
If you need me in the future,

181
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,260
remember to look for me.

182
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:41,580
Okay.

183
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,540
I will.

184
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:45,660
Alright.

185
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,660
Go back.

186
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,540
Shiqi is in a hurry.

187
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,260
I'll go now.

188
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:52,660
See you.

189
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:53,940
Bye.

190
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:57,780
Xiaobai.

191
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:12,780
hidding.

192
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:17,940
Sun Y shuttle.

193
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,020
transcendence of Samiry Duелаki,

194
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:58,780
I'll go ask myself first.

195
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:23,780
Did it come with

196
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:24,940
I'll show her my lowly genius.

197
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,460
You're useless.

198
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,420
I proved myself through the crimes.

199
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,780
I put on make-up for her with my mouth shut.

200
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:36,940
T какой?

201
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:37,780
Why?

202
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:39,500
Do you think that

203
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,700
you have too many secrets in your life?

204
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,740
Since you can truthfully find out

205
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,100
there were so many secrets in your life

206
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,180
by any means.

207
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,060
You can't lie to me.

208
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,420
Forgive heric to me,

209
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,460
she might be their source

210
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,140
if she can prove her innocence.

211
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,780
I can't bear to see

212
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,780
what you're planning to do.

213
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,780
I can't bear to see it anymore.

214
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,780
I've heard your recent expression.

215
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,780
You're a very good brother.

216
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,780
I'll plan it out

217
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,780
when you leave.

218
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,780
Okay?

219
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,780
Xiao Ru, I'm begging you.

220
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,780
I only have time.

221
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,780
I'm begging you.

222
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,780
Please help me.

223
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,780
I can't do anything about it.

224
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,780
Please help me.

225
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,780
Wait a minute.

226
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,780
Wait a minute, okay?

227
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,780
Keke, I can't stay here for too long.

228
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,780
I'm leaving.

229
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,780
I'm sorry.

230
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,780
Aujourd i farver

231
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,780

00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:52,260
I'm a

233
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,020
Something bad is going to happen to you, right?

234
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,300
Hurry up.

235
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,580
You won't have it.

236
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,700
Don't.

237
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:01,700
I won't have it.

238
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,700
You...

239
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:03,780
You can take a shower.

240
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:04,700
It's hot.

241
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,140
Thank you.

242
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:08,540
Do you want some water?

243
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,060
No.

244
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,460
Keke,

245
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,780
why are you here?

246
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:22,500
What?

247
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,540
Can you stay here?

248
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,340
Can't I?

249
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,460
I don't mean that.

250
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,620
You don't have to be so considerate of me.

251
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,620
What if you want me to treat you?

252
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,500
Keke,

253
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,620
you're the first friend I've ever met

254
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,820
after I went back to Chunchou.

255
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,420
I didn't expect that we'd be like this now.

256
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:46,700
Friend?

257
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:49,980
Gu Nanshi.

258
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,180
If you hadn't come back,

259
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,540
things wouldn't have changed.

260
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,660
I wouldn't have been like this now.

261
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,540
It's all because of you.

262
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,700
I'm not like that.

263
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,460
Actually,

264
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,580
even if it wasn't for me,

265
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,420
you and...

266
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,540
You don't have to

267
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,980
tell me

268
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:11,980
what you want to say to me.

269
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,020
I hate you.

270
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,220
I'm worried about you, too.

271
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,900
You don't have to pretend to be a good person.

272
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,420
Aren't you two

273
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,220
joining forces

274
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,260
to lie to me?

275
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,700
One of you said

276
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,020
he wanted to help me catch up with the situation.

277
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:30,780
The other said

278
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,940
he wanted to secretly seduce me.

279
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,980
If I hadn't seen

280
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,380
you two being together,

281
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,700
I wouldn't have believed

282
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,100
my good friend, Gu Nanshi.

283
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,300
You'd treat me like this.

284
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,580
Now, I think about it.

285
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,420
I think I said

286
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:51,660
I liked Shiqi

287
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,260
so much in front of you.

288
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,020
It's so ridiculous.

289
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,740
I'm not lying to you.

290
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,660
Yufan and I

291
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,140
really wanted to help you

292
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,340
and Shiqi.

293
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,180
But then...

294
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,620
I'm sorry.

295
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,340
I'm sorry.

296
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,540
My heart is very anxious.

297
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,500
I don't even know

298
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,540
how to face Yufan.

299
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,180
I don't know

300
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,140
how to face you.

301
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:21,860
Gu Nanshi.

302
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,940
I really love Shiqi.

303
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,900
I love her very much.

304
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:28,860
But what about you?

305
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,620
Aren't you using her

306
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,780
to cure your mental illness

307
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,260
and get rid of the symptoms of love?

308
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,260
Are you really in love with her?

309
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:38,540
Yes.

310
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,500
I really love her.

311
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,420
Shiqi and I

312
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,820
knew each other very long.

313
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,820
I treated her as my younger brother.

314
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,500
But I really can't explain

315
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,700
the relationship.

316
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,700
No matter what you think,

317
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,180
I still treat you as a friend.

318
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,100
I hope you're fine.

319
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,780
I hope you can find your own happiness.

320
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,820
But you need to think it through.

321
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,340
I hope you can get out of it.

322
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:18,740
I'm sorry.

323
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,340
I'm going back now.

324
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,100
Call me if you need anything.

325
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,020
I'm back.

326
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,700
Why is it so dark?

327
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,100
I booked the ticket for tomorrow.

328
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,260
What happened?

329
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,260
Why did it happen so suddenly?

330
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,540
I've been out for many days.

331
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,700
I'm not going back.

332
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,020
Yufan is not happy.

333
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,300
But I still have a lot of time.

334
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,300
I'm not going back.

335
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,300
I'm not going back.

336
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,300
I'm not going back.

337
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,300
I'm not going back.

338
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,300
I'm not going back.

339
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,500
But I haven't enough time for you.

340
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,620
I'm so thirsty today.

341
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,140
Nianxi, listen to me.

342
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,900
I didn't tell you that I was worried about you.

343
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,380
I swear I really didn't know

344
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,180
he was in this group before I joined the team.

345
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,300
He's in trouble for you today.

346
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,300
What did he tell you?

347
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,060
Okay.

348
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,460
I'm so weak in your eyes.

349
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,380
I was kidding you.

350
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,420
I can understand your work.

351
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,740
Can you not go tomorrow?

352
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,700
Shiqi,

353
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,900
my career has just started.

354
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,860
I promise you

355
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,500
I'll come to see you when I'm free, okay?

356
00:17:59,100 --> 00:17:59,900
Really?

357
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,100
I'll go to the station tomorrow.

358
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,900
Then you can have a good time.

359
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,900
Okay.

360
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,900
I'll wait for you here.

361
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,100
Hello, sister.

362
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:18,900
Mr. Gu.

363
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,700
Nianxi.

364
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,900
I brought you a gift.

365
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,100
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

366
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,100
Have a seat.

367
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,100
Here.

368
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,300
Happy.

369
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,300
Nianxi,

370
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,500
tell us what the group looks like.

371
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,500
Exactly.

372
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,500
There are many stars.

373
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,900
Are they fierce?

374
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,500
Actually, they're good.

375
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,900
They're almost like our work.

376
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,500
The only difference is that

377
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,900
they're not as fierce as you.

378
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,300
The only difference is that

379
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,700
they're much more hardworking than us.

380
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,300
They only work for half an hour.

381
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,500
They don't have time to work.

382
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,300
Really?

383
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,500
I can't do that.

384
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,500
You have to have a chance to do it.

385
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,300
Don't say that.

386
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,300
When I was young,

387
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,100
there was a detective who looked for my mom.

388
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,500
But my mom didn't agree.

389
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:05,700
It's so pretty.

390
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,100
Otherwise, I'm afraid you'll be hungry.

391
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:09,900
Okay, okay.

392
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,700
Don't make trouble.

393
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,900
You've also received the gift.

394
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,900
Come on.

395
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,700
Let's report to our director Gu.

396
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,700
I'll go first.

397
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,700
You're pretending to be strong.

398
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,900
I see that you've understood everything.

399
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,100
What expression?

400
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,300
You wrote three words clearly on your face.

401
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,500
You're so talented.

402
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,700
You're so obvious.

403
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,900
I guess I'm right.

404
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,500
I'm so good at this.

405
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,900
I'm so good at this.

406
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,100
I'm so good at this.

407
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,500
I'm so good at this.

408
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,900
I'm so good at this.

409
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,300
I'm so good at this.

410
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,500
I'm so good at this.

411
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,500
I'm so good at this.

412
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,700
I'm so good at this.

413
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,900
I'm so good at this.

414
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,900
I'm so good at this.

415
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,900
I'm so good at this.

416
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,900
I'm so good at this.

417
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,900
I'm so good at this.

418
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,900
I'm so good at this.

419
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,900
I'm so good at this.

420
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,900
I'm so good at this.

421
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,900
I'm so good at this.

422
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,900
I'm so good at this.

423
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,900
I'm so good at this.

424
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,900
I'm so good at this.

425
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,900
I'm so good at this.

426
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,900
I'm so good at this.

427
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,900
I'm so good at this.

428
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,900
Here's the 36 liter drinking.

429
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,900
Okay.

430
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,900
I'm going to take a rest.

431
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,900
We should have a dinner.

432
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,500
Team B's Meal With B without agent commander.

433
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,500
Alright.

434
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,500
Let's find two people with the sauce.

435
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,400
Please.

436
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,600
We go together.

437
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,500
Let's bring them worse.

438
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,420
No, no, no.

439
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,400
Three meals a day.

440
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,400
There's no one out there can't drink alcohol.

441
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,500
Two boys alone aren't that hot.

442
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,900
vezes can't drink alcohol,

443
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,400
but people drink so much,

444
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,800
and now we record and order.

445
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,300
The hell is coming up?

446
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,120
The thing about filming of a 我們不愛漂亮 他也不 cry ま好 and cry 哎 university to hear the advantages of the people

447
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:33,640
is the sad part of the music.

448
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,800
We are not allowed to stop.

449
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,900
We must leave this around about ten times.

450
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,940
I'll take care of Doing this

451
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:37,980
The camera in our factory.

452
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,980
Thank you.

453
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,980
Thank you for your support for our film.

454
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,980
I will make a film for our film.

455
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,980
Thank you.

456
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,980
Guys, I'll say a few words.

457
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,980
Thank you for your support for the film.

458
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,980
To be honest, this is also my first time to invest in film.

459
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,980
I'm very happy to work with you.

460
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,980
I've seen the hope of this industry

461
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:14,980
not only in your business, but also in your professionalism.

462
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,980
I'm a little bit of a good-looking.

463
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,980
I hope you can eat well and drink well.

464
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:25,980
If you have any questions, please call me.

465
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:26,980
I'm Kai Ge.

466
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,980
Let's toast to you.

467
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,980
Thank you.

468
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,980
Brother, brother.

469
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,980
Boss, I toast to you.

470
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:42,980
Thank you.

471
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:48,980
Boss, thank you for your support for our film.

472
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,980
I will make a film for our film.

473
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,980
I'll be back to Kai Ge and you.

474
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,980
Thank you.

475
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,980
Thank you, boss.

476
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,980
Director, I'm going out.

477
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,980
Go out today.

478
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,020
Go out.

479
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:09,020
Director, come on, let's drink first.

480
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,020
Cheers.

481
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:18,020
Shiqi, where's your girlfriend?

482
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,020
She has something to do in the company, so she's going back first.

483
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,020
I'm thinking of inviting you two to dinner.

484
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:27,020
We can have dinner early and late.

485
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:30,020
Boss, I just want to ask you for a favor.

486
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,060
It's okay.

487
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,060
Then you have to drink.

488
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,060
Okay.

489
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,060
This one.

490
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,060
Just now, boss.

491
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,060
You've worked hard, boss.

492
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,060
What's the matter?

493
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,060
Say it.

494
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,060
You say yes first.

495
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,060
If you don't say it, I'll say yes.

496
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,060
No, you say yes first.

497
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,060
Okay, okay, okay.

498
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,060
You say it.

499
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,060
I'll say it.

500
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:59,060
It's just our film's big plan.

501
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,100
You don't say it.

502
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,100
Boss, how did you give Shiqi the plan?

503
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,100
Director, it has nothing to do with the director.

504
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,100
The plan is really tight these days.

505
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,100
Thank you.

506
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,100
Director, you misunderstood.

507
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:17,100
I mean, I think we should stop playing the role these days.

508
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,100
Stop playing the role?

509
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,100
Can you stand it?

510
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:24,100
I want to go back to Chunzhou for two days.

511
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,100
Your girlfriend just left.

512
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,100
You miss her now?

513
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,100
Yes.

514
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,100
Director, Shiqi.

515
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,100
Please.

516
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,100
Boss.

517
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,100
Come on, Shiqi.

518
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,100
Let's go to the first place together.

519
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,100
Thank you, boss.

520
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,100
Wait.

521
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,100
Let's drink again.

522
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,100
Drink slowly.

523
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,100
It's okay.

524
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,100
Come on.

525
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,100
Come on.

526
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,100
I'm going to drink this one.

527
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,100
I'm going to drink it.

528
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,100
It's okay.

529
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,100
It's okay.

530
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,100
Come on.

531
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,100
Don't eat it.

532
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,100
It's a radish.

533
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,100
It's a radish.

534
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,100
Director, don't drink it.

535
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,100
I'll drink it.

536
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,100
I'll drink it.

537
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,100
Drink it.

538
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,100
Come on.

539
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,100
Are you okay, Shiqi?

540
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,100
I'm okay.

541
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,100
Drink slowly.

542
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,100
It's okay.

543
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,100
Daqi.

544
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,100
Shiqi is a little drunk.

545
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,100
It's okay.

546
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,100
I'll take her back first.

547
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,100
I'm okay.

548
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,140
Is it not comfortable?

549
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,140
Director,

550
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,140
how about I send Shiqi back?

551
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:41,140
My leg is almost healed.

552
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,140
I'll go back and rest early.

553
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,140
Okay.

554
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,140
Okay.

555
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,140
Ge Ge, are you okay?

556
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,140
I'm fine.

557
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,140
I'm fine.

558
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,140
Where's the fresh one?

559
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,140
I'll go.

560
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,140
It's safe.

561
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,140
Okay.

562
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,140
Come on.

563
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,180
Slow down.

564
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,180
Be careful.

565
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,180
Slow down.

566
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,180
Brother Zhuang,

567
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,180
thank you for your hard work.

568
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,180
Thank you for your hard work.

569
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,180
Brother Zhuang.

570
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,180
Okay, what are you doing?

571
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,180
Shiqi, are you okay?

572
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,180
I'm okay.

573
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,180
I'm okay.

574
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,180
Ge Ge,

575
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,220
I'm here.

576
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,220
Ge Ge,

577
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,220
I heard from Nan Xi

578
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,220
that you two met.

579
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,220
How did he get over me?

580
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,220
Ge Ge, don't think like that.

581
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,220
Don't think like that.

582
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:48,220
Actually, I've been thinking

583
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,220
to have a chance to talk to you.

584
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,220
But I don't have the courage.

585
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,220
I'm good.

586
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,260
I'm good.

587
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,260
I'm good.

588
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,260
I'm good at the wine ceremony today.

589
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,260
I want to tell you.

590
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,260
Actually,

591
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:06,260
the whole thing is not what you think.

592
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,260
Before we met,

593
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,260
I knew Nan Xi.

594
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,260
But I've never told you.

595
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,260
It's because...

596
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:21,260
It's because I'm already filled with him.

597
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,260
There's no one else.

598
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,260
Why didn't I tell you this?

599
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,260
It's because

600
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,260
I don't know how to tell you.

601
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:33,260
I don't know what to say.

602
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:36,260
The company also let us cooperate and promote.

603
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,260
I even let you misunderstand.

604
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,260
I'm really sorry.

605
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,260
I'm really sorry, Ge Ge.

606
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,260
I was wrong.

607
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,260
Shiqi,

608
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:51,260
you didn't like me at all.

609
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,300
I'm sorry.

610
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,300
I'm sorry.

611
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,300
Ge Ge,

612
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,300
I really didn't.

613
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:04,300
It's not because you're not excellent.

614
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:08,300
It's because I really have someone else in my heart.

615
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,300
Don't say it. I know.

616
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,300
Don't cry.

617
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,300
I know you really didn't say it.

618
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,300
I know you don't have to say it.

619
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,340
Ge Ge,

620
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,340
you really don't understand.

621
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,340
We really don't want to see you like this.

622
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,340
Yes.

623
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,340
I was wrong before.

624
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,340
I blacked your WeChat.

625
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,340
But I think if there's a chance,

626
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:36,340
I think I, you,

627
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,340
Nan Xi,

628
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,340
and my sister

629
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,340
are still good friends.

630
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,380
Are they still good friends?

631
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,380
Do you think there's a chance?

632
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,380
As long as you think there's a chance,

633
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,380
there must be a chance.

634
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,380
I'm sorry.

635
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,380
I'm sorry.

636
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,380
I'm sorry.

637
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,380
I'm sorry.

638
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,380
I'm sorry.

639
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,380
I'm sorry.

640
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,380
I'm sorry.

641
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,380
I'm sorry.

642
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,380
I'm sorry.

643
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,380
I'm sorry.

644
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,380
I'm sorry.

645
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:33,380
I'm sorry.

646
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:36,380
I'm sorry.

647
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:39,380
I'm sorry.

648
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,420
I'm sorry.

649
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,420
I'm looking forward to the new project.

650
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:14,240
If you say that her Montreal actually attendedPress Conference in beer for more than a month

651
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,720
then everyone will react differently

652
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,340
You have greater courage than Cheng Jing

653
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:28,260
and we have quite more

654
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:36,900
Your decision of being an actress has not been かっかなめもで start from out то

655
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,700
OK.

656
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,860
I'll be pushed out

657
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,420
from the building soon.

658
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:10,660
You'll do better after half an hour after paying the bill.

659
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,640
In fact,

660
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,280
it was my fault.

661
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,280
All the time,

662
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,700
she should have seen how no one wants.

663
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,400
Thus,

664
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,200
I'm yet to thank you for shining the shining shining.

665
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,240
This is Our Ziyou.

666
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:29,560
Vice President Xiao.

667
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,500
We've finally finally connected with him.

668
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:35,860
Miss Gu.

669
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,860
I'm so glad to hear that.

670
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:41,860
Doctor, what should we do now?

671
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,860
You should do what you want to do.

672
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,860
You should do more than you can do.

673
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,860
I said before that

674
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:51,860
his condition is psychological.

675
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,860
He can't be cured by himself.

676
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:54,860
He needs your help.

677
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,860
How?

678
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,860
He needs your help to find the root of the disease.

679
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,860
The root of the disease?

680
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:01,860
Yes.

681
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,860
You should find the cause

682
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:04,860
to close the part of the exit

683
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:05,860
by temporarily

684
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,860
choosing your brain.

685
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:09,860
Doctor,

686
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:10,860
is it possible that

687
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,860
the car accident was caused by the car accident?

688
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:15,860
It's possible.

689
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,860
Let's go.

690
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:30,860
Where are you going?

691
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,860
I'm looking for Nanxi and my sister.

692
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:33,860
They're not here.

693
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:35,860
They're not here?

694
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,860
Where are they?

695
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:38,860
They went to the hospital.

696
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:39,860
Don't you know?

697
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:40,860
What happened to them?

698
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:41,860
Which hospital?

699
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,860
I don't know either.

700
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,860
Wait a minute.

701
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,860
The hospital seems to be...

702
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,860
Wait a minute.

703
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,860
Here.

704
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:51,860
It seems to be the house.

705
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:54,860
Okay.

706
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:59,860
Don't worry, Nanxi.

707
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:01,860
It's not possible.

708
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,860
Let's pretend to make a car accident.

709
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:04,860
As long as we can recover,

710
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,860
we'll have to try it.

711
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:07,860
Are you crazy?

712
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,860
Car accident?

713
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,860
Can we control it?

714
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:11,860
And the doctor said

715
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,860
it's just a possibility.

716
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:14,860
What if it doesn't work?

717
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,860
What do you say?

718
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:18,860
Don't worry.

719
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,860
We'll talk about it later.

720
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:23,860
Nanxi.

721
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,860
Nanxi.

722
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,860
Are you okay?

723
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,860
Is your body okay?

724
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:28,860
No problem.

725
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,860
I'm here to check my body.

726
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:31,860
Is there any problem?

727
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:32,860
Why are you here, Shiqi?

728
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:33,860
You came to the hospital

729
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,860
and didn't tell me.

730
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,860
You really worried about me.

731
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,860
You scared me.

732
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:40,860
Okay.

733
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:41,860
Shiqi.

734
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:46,860
You think I'm a vacuum cleaner?

735
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:48,860
You're here, too.

736
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:49,860
What a coincidence.

737
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:00,860
What are you doing here?

738
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:01,860
Yan Yan.

739
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:02,860
Is Shiqi inside?

740
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,860
I... I...

741
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:04,860
I need to talk to her.

742
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:05,860
She's not here.

743
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:06,860
I'm really looking for her.

744
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,860
She's not here.

745
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,860
She's back to Spring.

746
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:09,860
Back to Spring?

747
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,860
When will she come back?

748
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,860
Maybe the day after tomorrow.

749
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,860
Okay, I know.

750
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:21,860
You're not sweet at all.

751
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:24,860
I'm not sweet at all.

752
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,860
I'm not sweet at all.

753
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,860
I'm not sweet at all.

754
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:27,860
I'm not sweet at all.

755
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:28,860
I'm not sweet at all.

756
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,860
Why are you back suddenly?

757
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:33,860
You're not busy this time?

758
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,860
I want to come back to see you

759
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,860
after a day of rest.

760
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:38,860
But can you tell me

761
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:39,860
what's going on?

762
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,860
I only know that you're going to the hospital today.

763
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,860
It's not a serious matter.

764
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:45,860
That's not possible.

765
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,860
There must be something

766
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,860
to tell you in the future, okay?

767
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,860
I know.

768
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:54,860
Are you going to stay

769
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:56,860
for a few days?

770
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,860
I'm going to stay for a few days.

771
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,860
Don't be so hard on yourself.

772
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,860
We still have a lifetime to live together.

773
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:06,860
I know.

774
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,860
But I really miss you.

775
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:09,860
I miss you, too.

776
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:57,860
I miss you, too.

777
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:29,860
My world is because of you.

778
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,860
The snow is slowly falling.

779
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,860
Who is so sweet?

780
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:37,860
Let the whole world have romance.

781
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:41,860
But I'm more greedy now.

782
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:45,860
I'm not so good at acting.

783
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,860
You're the most cruel in the world.

784
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,860
The world is cruel.

785
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:52,860
The mountains and seas are also very noisy.

786
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,860
I miss you so much.

787
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,860
I only miss you.

788
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:00,860
The world is because of you.

789
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,860
It's warm.
