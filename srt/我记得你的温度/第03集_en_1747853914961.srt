1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Don't you understand that you have to say you want to be apart from me

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
In my arms, you are asleep

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
How come you are hiding in my soft heart

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I want to be closer to you

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But your little stars

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Always circling you, never leaving you, never leaving you

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I want to be closer to you

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
To protect your secret

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I will keep looking for you

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I am waiting for you

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I want to be closer to you

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
But your little stars

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Always circling you, never leaving you, never leaving you

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I want to be closer to you

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
To protect your secret

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I will keep looking for you

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I want to be closer to you

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
To protect your secret

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Brother, between you two

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We have nothing

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Xiao Han, all my thoughts are in the company

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I really don't want to be followed by Li Na

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Everything is in the way of my success

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I want to get rid of it

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I know brother

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
But you recruited Hu Nanxi to the company

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You are not afraid of Li Na

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I have my own plan

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
My own plan

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
This is an important case

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You shouldn't be together with Gu Nanxi

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You and me can't make it

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Don't you understand I've been thinking of him

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I would be useful if you stay with him

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Go live at his home

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I really don't want to be near him

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,840
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:53,960
Brother,

39
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,600
I'm just worried about Ye Chang and Meng Duo.

40
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,560
It's too risky for you to

41
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,440
hire Gu Nuan Xi.

42
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,920
If anything happens,

43
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,400
all our efforts will be in vain.

44
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:04,840
Then we...

45
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,840
I have to keep her by my side.

46
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,160
Otherwise,

47
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,360
if she finds out,

48
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,680
all our efforts will be in vain.

49
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,640
Are you Xiao Rui?

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
This is your dad's IOU.

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
We can't find him now.

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,440
So we have to come to you.

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,520
This...

54
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,000
This is my dad's.

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'll call him.

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
White paper, black paper,

57
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
and signature.

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You can't get rid of them.

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Brother,

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I just graduated

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
and came out to work.

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I don't have much money.

63
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You can't get it?

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Do you have a sister?

65
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
No.

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
No, brother.

67
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Brother,

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm begging you.

69
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
My sister is still young.

70
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
She's still a kid.

71
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
She's very good.

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I don't want it.

73
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'll figure something out.

74
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I...

75
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Half a month.

76
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Just half a month.

77
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'll get a bonus if I take part in the competition.

78
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'll pay the money back.

79
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm begging you.

80
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Don't take my sister, okay?

81
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I beg you.

82
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Ten days.

83
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'll give you ten days.

84
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
If you can't get 200,000,

85
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
we'll go to your sister.

86
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'll give you ten days.

87
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'll give you ten days.

88
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'll give you ten days.

89
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'll give you ten days.

90
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'll give you ten days.

91
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'll give you ten days.

92
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'll give you ten days.

93
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'll give you ten days.

94
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'll give you ten days.

95
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'll give you ten days.

96
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'll give you ten days.

97
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'll give you ten days.

98
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'll give you ten days.

99
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'll give you ten days.

100
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'll give you ten days.

101
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'll give you ten days.

102
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'll give you ten days.

103
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'll give you ten days.

104
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'll give you ten days.

105
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'll give you ten days.

106
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'll give you ten days.

107
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'll give you ten days.

108
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'll give you ten days.

109
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'll give you ten days.

110
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,560
How did he make it

111
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,560
for his half- ì«“ game against White.

112
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,680
Right.

113
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,600
I was thinking.

114
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:07,620
I could haveeso found his

115
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,860
women's style.

116
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,020
I took my time.

117
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:11,460
Perhaps these women

118
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,000
aren't as tough as the old strangers.

119
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,940
When youamed father, you're setting up your daughter, Li Nanen,

120
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,620
and helping her by waking her up from her sleep?

121
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,500
It was a dream come true.

122
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,580
That's right.

123
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,500
You're paying dad's debt

124
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,500
to make up for it.

125
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,580
You can't let her

126
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,100
join the company, brother.

127
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,100
She may even help us

128
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,100
to avoid it.

129
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,220
But Li Na is a person with a good heart.

130
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,220
This matter

131
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,940
must not be known to her.

132
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,820
Absolutely not.

133
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,540
Why not?

134
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,460
Think about it.

135
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,740
Your recent work

136
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,820
is in the East.

137
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,660
Why do you have to

138
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,340
go to your own house in the West?

139
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,540
The company is for you.

140
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,220
Don't go on the road and rest more.

141
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,700
I specially arranged an apartment for you.

142
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,780
It's only an hour

143
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,860
after coming back.

144
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,380
I mainly want to

145
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,380
go with my sister.

146
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,380
Which sister?

147
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,380
Sister Nanxi?

148
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,500
You seem to be lost recently.

149
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,500
You used to

150
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,460
get annoyed when you see

151
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,580
the work information.

152
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,420
Now you are always

153
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,300
looking at your phone.

154
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,300
You are really a fool

155
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,780
to fall in love with someone.

156
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,020
I don't know what Nanxi

157
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,820
feels to me now.

158
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,140
When I rented the apartment,

159
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,820
I accidentally touched her shoulder.

160
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,860
She would be very unhappy.

161
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,060
But she was so worried

162
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,180
and asked me to help her.

163
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,540
She even asked me to be her model.

164
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,860
Do you think she likes me?

165
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,540
Is she waiting for me to confess to her?

166
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,220
You know, your state

167
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,820
is like An Keke's

168
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,820
attitude towards you.

169
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,100
You are exactly the same.

170
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,100
You are self-righteous.

171
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,900
Let me tell you.

172
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,620
When you are particularly

173
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,020
concerned about someone,

174
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,540
you will always

175
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,700
have unlimited possibilities.

176
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,260
You shouldn't be like this.

177
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,340
What is your name?

178
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,180
It's called a dog-eating behavior.

179
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,260
In fact, when you two

180
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,300
get together,

181
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,340
you will be

182
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,340
passive.

183
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,060
If you need help,

184
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,420
you two should be together.

185
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,700
You are right.

186
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:21,900
Hello.

187
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,820
This is our new

188
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,820
new pudding.

189
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,460
It's free.

190
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,020
Let me tell you.

191
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,900
You should use your own strengths

192
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,820
and your own charm to attract her.

193
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,820
Charm?

194
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,620
You can seduce her

195
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,620
in the male room.

196
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,300
I didn't realize it before.

197
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,540
You have been single

198
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,180
and you are still

199
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,820
chasing after girls.

200
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,500
Of course.

201
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,220
Show off my charm.

202
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,020
Women,

203
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,020
you are playing with fire.

204
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,860
Is it a bit

205
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,460
unstable?

206
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,620
This is a good one.

207
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,020
This is a stable one.

208
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,620
Wait and see.

209
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,620
I'm not sure

210
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,620
if I can get her.

211
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,620
I'm not sure if I can get her.

212
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,620
I'm not sure if I can get her.

213
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,020
I said I would never see her again.

214
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,020
But now,

215
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,420
I'm not seeing her.

216
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,420
I'm feeling down.

217
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,220
Oh, no.

218
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,620
I totally forgot about it.

219
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,820
Nanxi.

220
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,620
Why is there no one here?

221
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,620
Maybe my sister's home.

222
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,620
I'll go find her.

223
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,420
It's beautiful.

224
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,420
It's very talented.

225
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,420
Let me introduce you.

226
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,420
Yufan.

227
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,420
Nanxi.

228
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,220
It's you.

229
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,220
That's great.

230
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,220
You are so beautiful.

231
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,620
I didn't expect

232
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,020
you two to be so fated.

233
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,220
I really want to thank you that day.

234
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,420
If you hadn't helped me out,

235
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,620
I would have been in trouble.

236
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,220
You are so hardworking.

237
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,820
You can't stand people being wronged.

238
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,220
Oh, right.

239
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,020
I heard from Yufan that you moved.

240
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,820
This is for your wedding.

241
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,420
Thank you.

242
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,020
Sister.

243
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,420
Sister.

244
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,420
It's Qi.

245
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,420
Sister.

246
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,420
You're not home.

247
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,020
I'm eating out.

248
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,620
Why are you going to my place again?

249
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,620
I just happened to pass by

250
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,020
and came up to see you.

251
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,220
When will you be back?

252
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,420
I'm with Nanxi.

253
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,020
Later.

254
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:01,820
Where are you?

255
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,420
I'm going too.

256
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,620
This is our store's treasure.

257
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,220
It's not for sale. Please enjoy.

258
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,620
Why are you coming

259
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,620
to our women's wedding?

260
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,620
Play by yourself.

261
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,620
Thank you.

262
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,620
I'm going to the wedding.

263
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,620
I'll be back soon.

264
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,620
I'll be back soon.

265
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,620
I'll be back soon.

266
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,620
I'll be back soon.

267
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,620
I'll be back soon.

268
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,620
I'll be back soon.

269
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,620
I'll be back soon.

270
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:18,820
Okay.

271
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,820
If you don't tell me,

272
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,820
I'll go there myself.

273
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,820
Bye.

274
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,420
What's going on?

275
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,220
Is it Shiqi?

276
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,020
She's coming.

277
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:29,620
I told her

278
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,220
this is a dinner for women.

279
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,220
She didn't let me come.

280
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,820
Try the signature dish of her house.

281
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,020
Keke.

282
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,020
Try it too.

283
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,020
Thank you.

284
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,020
Nanxi.

285
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,420
I've read your design draft.

286
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,420
In the end,

287
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,820
you can see many thoughts in it.

288
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,820
I'm more

289
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,820
confident in details.

290
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,820
So...

291
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,820
Are you willing to come to my company?

292
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,620
I...

293
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,620
I've found a job.

294
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,020
Sorry, Yufan.

295
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,620
I haven't had time to tell you.

296
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,020
Which company

297
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:05,820
is so good

298
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,220
that you're so polite to be chosen?

299
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,220
Nanxi.

300
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,220
What company?

301
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,420
Is it reliable?

302
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,020
Kaige Jewelry.

303
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,020
Kaige?

304
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:16,020
It's a well-known jewelry company.

305
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,020
It's a rare opportunity.

306
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:18,820
Nanxi.

307
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,820
Congratulations.

308
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,620
I'll find a chance to ask you for advice.

309
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,620
I don't agree.

310
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,020
I've agreed.

311
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,620
Gu Nanxi.

312
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,620
How did you agree to me?

313
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,620
You're driving me crazy.

314
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,220
Yufan.

315
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,220
Actually,

316
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,220
Kaige is really good.

317
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,020
You don't know.

318
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,420
Many people want to get her autograph.

319
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,420
But they have no chance.

320
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,020
Any company can do it.

321
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,020
But Kaige can't.

322
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,220
I have my reasons.

323
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,220
What reasons?

324
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,820
Ma Tilian.

325
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,420
So childish.

326
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,220
You know what Ma Tilian means to me.

327
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,220
I've been obsessed for years.

328
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,620
I want to make her.

329
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,420
Ma Tilian's copyright

330
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,620
belongs to Xiaorui and me.

331
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,820
And you know

332
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,420
Kaige Jewelry is the only company

333
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,220
that can meet Ma Tilian's production requirements.

334
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,220
Nanxi.

335
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,420
I know what you're worried about.

336
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,820
But don't worry.

337
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,420
I'm not the same as before.

338
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,220
I know you're obsessed with Ma Tilian.

339
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,620
But you have to promise me.

340
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,420
No matter what happens in the future,

341
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,620
you have to tell me.

342
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,820
And

343
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,820
that person

344
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,220
must keep a distance.

345
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,220
Alright, Yufan.

346
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,220
Let's congratulate Nanxi

347
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,820
for finding a new job.

348
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,020
Cheers.

349
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,820
Cheers.

350
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,020
Cheers.

351
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,820
You're not a man of your word.

352
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,020
Yan Yan really

353
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,820
picked a good place for me.

354
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,620
Yufan.

355
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,420
You can't do it.

356
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,620
You have to practice.

357
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,420
I can do it.

358
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,020
I'm not drunk.

359
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:02,620
Drink.

360
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,420
I'm drinking.

361
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,220
Drink.

362
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,620
Brother.

363
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,220
Why do I feel

364
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,420
that this house is spinning?

365
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,420
It is spinning.

366
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,820
The faster it spins, the faster it is.

367
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,220
If one person

368
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,820
thinks it's spinning,

369
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,820
then he's drunk.

370
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,820
If three people think they're spinning,

371
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,620
then it's the earth spinning.

372
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,620
Shiqi.

373
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,220
Shiqi.

374
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,820
I was so anxious

375
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,420
that I pinched you.

376
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,020
Shiqi.

377
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:48,420
Stop it.

378
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,020
Stop drinking.

379
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,420
I'm thirsty.

380
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,820
It's true.

381
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,020
Why do the three of you

382
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,020
drink so much?

383
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,820
Shiqi.

384
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,420
You're finally here.

385
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,820
If you don't come...

386
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,020
I'm sorry.

387
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,220
I'll leave right away.

388
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,220
I didn't...

389
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,820
You make me worry.

390
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,820
It's true.

391
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,820
I didn't...

392
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,020
You're not a good drinker.

393
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,420
Why do you drink so much?

394
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,820
Be good.

395
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,020
Okay.

396
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,620
I didn't expect that An Keke

397
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,620
to be so good at drinking.

398
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,620
He drank the wine like juice.

399
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,020
Nonsense.

400
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,620
I'm the worst drinker.

401
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,420
You pushed me down.

402
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,620
I'm the worst drinker.

403
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,820
I sent you back.

404
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,620
Why are you here again?

405
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,220
I'm angry.

406
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,220
Where are you going?

407
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,620
Why do you go to Kaige?

408
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,420
Wait.

409
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,620
Sister Nanxi, you went to Kaige?

410
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,020
Don't believe him.

411
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,020
Don't believe Xiao.

412
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,020
And you.

413
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,820
You send Nanxi upstairs later.

414
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,420
Go back to your apartment.

415
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,620
Okay, I know.

416
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,820
I'm leaving.

417
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:02,620
Bye.

418
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,220
Be careful.

419
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,620
Bye.

420
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,220
Be careful.

421
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,420
Be careful, Nanxi.

422
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,620
Let's go.

423
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,220
Let's go.

424
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,420
Be careful.

425
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,420
Be careful.

426
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,820
Why do you drink so much?

427
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,620
Horse's trotter.

428
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,820
Horse's trotter?

429
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,820
Is it worth it?

430
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,020
He left without saying goodbye.

431
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,020
I

432
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,620
waited for you for five years.

433
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,620
Five years.

434
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:45,620
Sister Nanxi.

435
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,420
Sister Nanxi, get in the car.

436
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,220
Hello.

437
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,620
Do you have an appointment?

438
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,820
I'm a new designer.

439
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,820
My name is Gu Nanxi.

440
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,220
Wait a minute.

441
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,620
Sorry, I'm late.

442
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,620
Sorry, I didn't receive your information.

443
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,020
How could it be?

444
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,020
Hello.

445
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,020
Xiao Han?

446
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,220
Miss Gu was hired by Mr. Xiao.

447
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,420
Give her to me.

448
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,020
Okay.

449
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,820
Our Kaige Jewelry is one of the top brands.

450
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,220
After you come in, the work pressure will be higher.

451
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,620
Because we value the quality of our employees.

452
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:12,020
It's common to stay up late.

453
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,420
Behind me is the marketing department.

454
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,020
In front is the design department.

455
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,820
Over there is the advertising department.

456
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,820
Xiao Han,

457
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:24,220
it's been a few years since we last met. Are you okay?

458
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,820
This is the company.

459
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:28,820
Besides, we're not close.

460
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,620
We're just colleagues.

461
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,620
Please be at ease.

462
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,820
Xiao Hu has a different effect.

463
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,620
Look at this.

464
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,620
But the design is completely different.

465
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,620
This is...

466
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,220
Nanxi.

467
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,020
Let me introduce.

468
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,620
This is the new designer.

469
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,620
Miss Gu Nanxi.

470
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,220
Miss Gu Nanxi

471
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:03,220
has advanced design ideas and design ideas.

472
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,820
I hope that in the future,

473
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:08,420
we can learn from each other and grow apart.

474
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,420
Nanxi, say hello.

475
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,820
Hello, everyone. My name is Gu Nanxi.

476
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,020
I'm very happy to meet you.

477
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,220
Sit.

478
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,420
Based on the company's discussion,

479
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,220
we've decided on the design basis of the new season.

480
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,620
We'll use Gu Nanxi's horse-drawn chain as the design concept.

481
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:33,220
Miss Gu Nanxi will be fully responsible.

482
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,420
Thank you.

483
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,220
Mr. Cao.

484
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,620
I'm responsible for designing the new season's jewelry.

485
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,420
The change is too fast.

486
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:49,020
This is the company's decision.

487
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,020
And Gu Nanxi's horse-drawn chain

488
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,820
perfectly matches the trend of our new season.

489
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:57,820
The cold-blooded lead of Lisa magazine is also very satisfied with the horse-drawn chain.

490
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,820
Gu Nanxi just joined our team.

491
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,820
I hope that the designers of Chengda will take good care of it.

492
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,420
Which are the top-level designers?

493
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,820
Or is it just your boss's ungrateful behavior?

494
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,420
He was eliminated by me when he was interviewed.

495
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:13,420
With his qualifications, he doesn't deserve to join our team.

496
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,420
Why should he design the new season?

497
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,620
May I ask you, Mr. Xiao?

498
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,420
Which point do you value more?

499
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:23,020
Or is there any difference between you two?

500
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,020
I don't know what I'm talking about.

501
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:32,620
Mr. Xiao, it seems that the relationship between you two is really extraordinary.

502
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,020
This Gu Nanxi, Miss Gu,

503
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:38,020
is the one who came in from the back door.

504
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,620
I think you've been a designer for too long.

505
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:45,420
You've been doing a lot of free things.

506
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:50,020
You've taken our platform freedom as your own.

507
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,420
If there's nothing else, then let's call it a day.

508
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,620
The new season is over.

509
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:00,620
The new season has improved our lives.

510
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:03,220
I hope that everyone here

511
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,420
will do their best.

512
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,820
Hello?

513
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:30,020
Zou Zou, when will you be in the studio?

514
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,220
Hurry up and film it!

515
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,420
What filming? How come I don't know?

516
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,020
Oh my god.

517
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:37,220
The cover for the last time was already popular.

518
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,820
The company wants to take advantage of it.

519
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,420
While you're at it, take more photos and post them online.

520
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,620
You have to know that you're an idol.

521
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,020
An idol is a person who is very popular.

522
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,820
You have to know that you're an idol.

523
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,020
You have to know that you're an idol.

524
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,220
You have to know that you're an idol.

525
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,020
You have to know that you're an idol.

526
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,020
You have to know that you're an idol.

527
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,020
What does an idol want?

528
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,020
He wants popularity and popularity.

529
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,420
Okay, okay, I know. I'll go over now.

530
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,420
Okay, okay, hurry up.

531
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:08,420
Master, let's go to the filming site.

532
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,220
Okay.

533
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,620
Designer Gu.

534
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,820
This is the design department's personnel information.

535
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,020
I'll leave it here for you.

536
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,020
Thank you.

537
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,420
If there's nothing else, I'll go now.

538
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,020
Go.

539
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,220
Okay.

540
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,220
Hello?

541
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,820
Hello, your takeaway is here.

542
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,620
Delivery?

543
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,420
I've put it on the front desk. You can take it.

544
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,220
Okay.

545
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,620
The company has never had this precedent.

546
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,420
No matter how old the designer is,

547
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:28,020
he has to start from the bottom to get a few years to have a chance to make a living.

548
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,220
Look at Chen Zhe.

549
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,820
He's been working for so many years to have a chance to design independently.

550
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,620
No wonder he's so angry.

551
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,820
I heard that he's in a private relationship with Chen...

552
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,220
Hello?

553
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:55,620
I became the new main designer as soon as I got in.

554
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,020
Everyone has a bias against me.

555
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,820
But this is the end.

556
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,620
I can't be an escapee.

557
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:06,220
You're going too far, Xiao Rui.

558
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:10,220
I've been in this company for so many years and I started from the bottom.

559
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,820
Now, this project, just change it.

560
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,220
This is the company's decision.

561
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,420
And you have the rights to participate in the design.

562
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,620
Participate? You mean...

563
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,620
I don't even have a title for this project?

564
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,020
Xiao Rui, you've gone too far.

565
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,220
Nina will know.

566
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:27,220
I'm the CEO of this company. I think I have the right to do this.

567
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,820
Xiao Rui, don't get ahead of yourself.

568
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:32,220
This project is called the Shun.

569
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,940
I'll tell Li Na about this.

570
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,780
Of course you have the right.

571
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:38,820
But the company's interests

572
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,220
are in front of your personal interests.

573
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,500
I think Li Na will choose Chen Zhe

574
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,140
without hesitation.

575
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,940
Tell her to be more understanding.

576
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,940
You and me.

577
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,220
What will she choose?

578
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,220
Chen Zhe.

579
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,940
I really feel sorry for you.

580
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,620
Don't talk nonsense with me here.

581
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,900
No one in the company knows

582
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,340
you and your brother are in a relationship.

583
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,060
Don't say you don't know about this.

584
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,060
Chen Zhe,

585
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,780
you are a smart person.

586
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,380
You should know

587
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,900
what the company's name is.

588
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:27,940
My brother,

589
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,300
he's a good man.

590
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,340
What do you mean?

591
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,660
He's just

592
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,620
trying to keep

593
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,020
his job.

594
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,780
You should understand it.

595
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,940
The contract seems to be terminated today.

596
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,860
What excuse will I have to find a way to get Na Xi married?

597
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:04,980
Mr. Qin,

598
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,620
I don't think we're in the right state.

599
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,620
Let's do it again.

600
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,420
Relax a little.

601
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,180
Come on.

602
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,340
Na Xi.

603
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:21,660
Sit down.

604
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,340
Are you still used to the office environment?

605
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,140
Mr. Xiao,

606
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,180
why is my office

607
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,780
the director's office?

608
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,020
I believe

609
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,620
there must be a good environment

610
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,060
for good works.

611
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,020
Does this meet the company's rules?

612
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,060
The company's rules are that

613
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,060
people who leave behind

614
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,620
people who are helpful to the company

615
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:42,860
are worth it at all costs.

616
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,340
But...

617
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,060
Na Xi,

618
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,220
you shouldn't want us to work hard

619
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,620
to make others finish the work.

620
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,300
You can ask me anything.

621
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,620
As long as I can do it,

622
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,100
I will do my best.

623
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,300
But my only request to you

624
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,180
is time.

625
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,060
Half a month.

626
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,060
I want to see Ma Ti Lian in half a month.

627
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,340
Ten days.

628
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,700
Give me ten days.

629
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,820
This is the Gu Na Xi I know.

630
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,820
Ma Ti Lian's design concept

631
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,940
is very mature.

632
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,540
And when I was abroad,

633
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,460
I had completed the whole creative drawing.

634
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,980
Now the most important thing is the material.

635
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,500
This work must be based on the right material

636
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,020
to present the best effect.

637
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,260
But I haven't found a good choice yet.

638
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,500
I'm going to arrange the company

639
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,100
to send all the jewelry samples

640
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,140
to your office.

641
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,220
Take your time.

642
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:37,660
I'm Xiao Rui.

643
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,820
I'm sending all the jewelry samples

644
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,220
to Gu Na Xi's office.

645
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,260
Thank you.

646
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:47,100
Any other requests?

647
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:48,580
No.

648
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,500
I'm going to work then.

649
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:51,500
Na Xi,

650
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:55,220
do you have time to have dinner with me tonight?

651
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,660
Did you forget what you said?

652
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,740
Time is running out.

653
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,220
I want to borrow your body.

654
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:29,940
Don't talk.

655
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:31,620
I know everything.

656
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,780
Puppy Maison

657
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,860
I think we have a wrong answer

658
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,100
on today's subject.

659
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,540
We should give aburger subject to each other.

660
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,460
One saying goes like

661
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,500
Linglong's head, red bean,

662
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,060
and bone-in silk.

663
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,180
Do you want it?

664
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,820
Enough. Don't make fun of me.

665
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,620
Do you know what the head means?

666
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:39,820
It means the silk that goes deep into the bone marrow.

667
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,300
I got it.

668
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:42,780
You...

669
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:43,420
Look. Look.

670
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:43,940
What's wrong?

671
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,420
I'm still in Nanxi's heart.

672
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,260
Shi Qi.

673
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:48,500
Ke Ke.

674
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,060
Shi Qi.

675
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:53,220
Thank you for taking me home last night.

676
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,460
You're welcome.

677
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,060
Shi Qi.

678
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:02,220
Do you want to have dinner with me tonight?

679
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,100
I'll say thank you.

680
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:04,540
Okay.

681
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,580
Sure.

682
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,420
Hello?

683
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,540
Shi Qi.

684
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,500
Are you free tonight?

685
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,860
I have something to talk to you.

686
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:15,980
Okay.

687
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:16,900
I'm free.

688
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,780
See you tonight.

689
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,060
Shi Qi.

690
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:23,300
Let's have dinner at 7 p.m.

691
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:25,980
Ke Ke.

692
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:28,140
I have something to talk to you tonight.

693
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,780
You can have dinner with Yan Yan.

694
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:32,980
Ke Ke.

695
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,300
Send me the location.

696
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,140
We'll have dinner together.

697
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,380
You're a big-headed man.

698
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,140
I...

699
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,940
I'm a big-headed man?

700
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,340
Are you going to eat or not?

701
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,540
It's already July.

702
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,540
What should I do?

703
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,060
Nanxi.

704
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:56,820
Nanxi.

705
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,140
Nanxi.

706
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,740
This is the contract.

707
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,500
I can't.

708
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,980
How can I forget it?

709
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,180
I have to sign it.

710
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:21,980
I'll sign it now.

711
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:30,660
This stone is too high.

712
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,980
It will make it easier to locate me.

713
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,540
Nanxi.

714
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,660
You can't get better

715
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,260
if you lean on me.

716
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,500
Of course I can.

717
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,700
It's better than leaning on the sofa.

718
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,700
I feel much better.

719
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,260
Nanxi.

720
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,580
A jewelry designer

721
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,300
has to set materials?

722
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,660
Yes.

723
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:54,300
Designers start with selection

724
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,660
and present their works

725
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,260
step by step.

726
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,460
It's very fulfilling.

727
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,940
This piece

728
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,460
shouldn't be suitable.

729
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:09,260
You haven't chosen the one you like yet.

730
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,340
By the way...

731
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,060
I'm sorry.

732
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,420
It's a bit late.

733
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,260
I'll go to rest.

734
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,860
Well...

735
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:30,860
Bye.

736
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,020
Why does Shi Qi

737
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,060
look at me like that?

738
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,380
No.

739
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,300
It must be my illusion.

740
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,020
We have a new designer.

741
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:57,980
Look.

742
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:00,220
Is she similar to the style of your magazine?

743
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:06,500
It's a clever design.

744
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,500
But who is this designer?

745
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,060
You know,

746
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,980
in our industry,

747
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,900
if you're talented,

748
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,140
but you're not famous,

749
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,780
you'll be buried.

750
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,940
You want to see me?

751
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,020
Nanxi.

752
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:18,820
Sit.

753
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:19,980
Let me introduce.

754
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:20,740
This is

755
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,900
the designer of our Ma Ti Lian series,

756
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,900
Gu Nanxi.

757
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,340
Nanxi.

758
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,140
This is the editor-in-chief

759
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,140
of Lisa magazine,

760
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,140
Mr. Leng Ran.

761
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,980
Thank you for your cooperation

762
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:38,140
with the magazine of the IT team.

763
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,580
Hello, editor-in-chief.

764
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,740
Lisa magazine

765
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,620
is the top one

766
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,340
in the domestic fashion industry?

767
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,340
Yes.

768
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,020
It's the most popular magazine

769
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,020
in the world.

770
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,580
The most top one in the world?

771
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,540
Xiaorui.

772
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,220
I haven't agreed

773
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,020
to use the company's magazine

774
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,780
on the headboard.

775
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,620
It's a big deal for you.

776
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,340
Is it because our tea is not good,

777
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,940
or the designer is not good enough?

778
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,180
I'm not kidding.

779
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,700
Can we cooperate?

780
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,100
Don't forget the second condition.

781
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,820
I understand.

782
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,620
Hello,

783
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,740
designer Gu.

784
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,860
I just saw your work.

785
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,540
Very good.

786
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,980
If Mr. Xiao gives you the chance,

787
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:17,940
I'm willing to

788
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,940
cooperate with you.

789
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,620
Thank you for your recognition.

790
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,620
I don't know what the second condition is.

791
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,140
We will try our best to complete it.

792
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,940
Are you sick?

793
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,540
I'll get you some medicine.

794
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,900
I should be fine.

795
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,260
I guess my sister

796
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,580
is talking bad about me.

797
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,260
Yes, she is.

798
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,460
She is scolding me.

799
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,460
I have good news for you.

800
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,580
Come and sit.

801
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:03,940
You won't give

802
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,300
that to sister Nanjing, will you?

803
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:06,780
Forget it.

804
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:07,780
I won't tell you now.

805
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,420
I'm embarrassed.

806
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,660
Can you help me?

807
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,980
It's fake.

808
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,060
Why not do it then?

809
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,660
But it burned.

810
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:35,540
Stiff and your eyes,

811
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:40,460
exhausted and interrupting my mind.

812
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:44,580
The pale moon illuminates my life.

813
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:48,500
The firework is suddenly blue

814
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,380
Light scatters in the darkness

815
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:56,180
The youth that is in love

816
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:59,580
How soft is your heart

817
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,580
You are the most brilliant in the world

818
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,780
The best man in the universe

819
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:07,380
The calm deep sea also makes waves

820
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,220
You are like a heart-shaped fan

821
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,700
Let the rain and fog dissipate

822
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:15,100
I don't want time to protect my weakness

823
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,100
You are the most brilliant in the world

824
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,300
The best man in the universe

825
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:22,900
The best hope in the world

826
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,700
Day and night, the longing

827
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:27,100
Only leads me forward

828
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:30,500
My world is because of you

829
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,500
The snow is slowly falling

830
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,500
The galaxy is lit

831
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:38,300
Let the whole world have romance

832
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:42,100
And I am more greedy now

833
00:35:42,100 --> 00:36:05,880
Surrounding the
