4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I don't understand what you're saying to me

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,500
In my arms, who are you?

6
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,000
How can you hide in my soft silence?

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I miss you more

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I give you a little heart

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The whole sky is around you

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I can't help it

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I miss you more

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I protect your secret

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I will always look for you

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I am waiting for you in this life

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I miss you more

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I give you a little heart

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The whole sky is around you

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I can't help it

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I miss you more

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I protect your secret

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I will always look for you

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I will always look for you

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I protect you

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000

The End

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Episode 1

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Mom, you really don't have to stay for days

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I won't stay anymore

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I won't bother you

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What are you talking about?

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yes, mom

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm going to be a group

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You can stay here and accompany Nanxi

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
No one is in charge of the flowers in my house

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I have to go back

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Come in

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
As long as you two are fine

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You can do anything

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I will leave Nanxi to you

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Okay, don't worry, mom

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Let's go

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Finally I can be in love with you

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's too hard

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What do you mean?

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I've been wronged by you before

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
No, no

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
When you go to the crew

51
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Are they all young and beautiful actors?

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Gu Nanxi, who do you think I am?

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I just know

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Okay, wait

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Is this my design?

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yes, I bought it

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Why did you buy it?

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'll bring it to you

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I have no time

60
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You can bring it to him

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You can't worry about it

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm just kidding

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You can't talk to a company person like this

64
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
As long as your sister agrees with your mom

65
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I can control her

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Why don't you go to the crew with me?

67
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Why should I go to the crew?

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You can see the environment

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And you can accompany me

70
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You are going to work

71
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I have work here

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I can't go

73
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I can't see you for months

74
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
What do you want me to do?

75
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'll go to see you as long as I have time

76
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Really?

77
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Pull the hook

78
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You have no right to pull the hook

79
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
No, I just want to pull the hook

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
The environment is good

81
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Hello, Mr. Qin

82
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I am the crew's life

83
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Mr. Qin, we have arranged your room

84
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You can stay here until you get in

85
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Mr. Qin, can we stay on the floor with Mr. Qin?

86
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I can take care of him

87
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm sorry

88
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Mr. Qin has already been in the room

89
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
But the room I arranged for you

90
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
is in my room

91
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Mr. Qin is also very close and convenient

92
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I think...

93
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's okay, we can stay here

94
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Let's go, Mr. Qin

95
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Okay

96
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Stop

97
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Okay, you can go to rest

98
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'll call you later

99
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Okay

100
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Bye

101
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Look, this is the environment I live in

102
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
This is the living room

103
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
This is the bedroom

104
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
How is it?

105
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Is the environment okay?

106
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'll have to stay here for months

107
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'll clean this place up

108
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
When you come, you'll feel like home

109
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Why are you here?

110
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I think you're looking for trouble

111
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You're lost, right?

112
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
What nonsense?

113
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Nothing

114
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Nothing?

115
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You don't have any work to do now

116
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You're still here

117
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'll take a break

118
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Okay

119
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Mr. Qin

120
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Why did you come here?

121
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Why are you here?

122
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Don't you have any work to do?

123
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I don't know

124
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I just want to take a break

125
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,720
I don't have any mood for work.

126
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,400
I think

127
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,160
the job is basically stable now.

128
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,120
You go to the crew.

129
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,440
Why should I go to the crew?

130
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,160
I'll do it if I have to work.

131
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,880
You're so thoughtful.

132
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,400
You must have been tired.

133
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,120
Comrade Qin Yufan,

134
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,720
are you not doing your job well?

135
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,000
I'll arrange some more for you.

136
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm quite busy.

137
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,640
I'll go to my Mr. Leng.

138
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,480
Bye.

139
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:27,160
Miss Liu,

140
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,000
you have to partner up.

141
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,640
Then...

142
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,520
don't do this.

143
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,640
liver detinnation.

144
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,180
pioneer of the.

145
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:33,900
Let me introduce you.

146
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,900
Shiqi, you're here.

147
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,420
Keke, why are you here?

148
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,020
Look at what you said.

149
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,620
I'm the chief designer of your team.

150
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,100
Since you know each other,

151
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,340
let's talk.

152
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,660
I'll go first.

153
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,460
Okay.

154
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,180
Mr. Qin Shiqi,

155
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,900
I hope we can meet in a few months.

156
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,140
Shiqi,

157
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,340
Mr. Shen said he wants you to go there

158
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,180
and see your angle.

159
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,580
I'll go first.

160
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,020
Mrs. Shen,

161
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,020
there's a girl in Investig speaking members.

162
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,460
There is hope in the future.

163
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,900
After all this,

164
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,460
we're good friends.

165
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:29,700
Right.

166
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,380
Shiqi has entered the group.

167
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,180
Sure.

168
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,140
We should be happy together.

169
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,980
You said that Nanxi is sick.

170
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,860
She's not sick.

171
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,860
It's so hard to let people know.

172
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,300
I asked some experts.

173
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,860
They thought

174
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,900
it's not a problem in life.

175
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,380
It's a mental illness.

176
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,100
So I think

177
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,620
we should care more about Nanxi.

178
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,500
Especially when things are not going well.

179
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,300
I know.

180
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,380
But

181
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,580
it's all my fault.

182
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,220
If I didn't give up,

183
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,420
Nanxi wouldn't have been in trouble.

184
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:13,900
Okay, okay.

185
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,420
We're not responsible.

186
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,180
Let's try to help Nanxi recover, okay?

187
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:23,900
No.

188
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,620
Lu Ran,

189
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,660
you're not responsible?

190
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,500
I... I'm not.

191
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,820
You didn't say I'm not.

192
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,020
You don't know she's our assistant director?

193
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,060
I don't know.

194
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:49,820
I swear.

195
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,300
I just got to know.

196
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:52,900
Okay.

197
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,740
Don't let Nanxi know.

198
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,260
Okay.

199
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,180
But Nanxi has been here for a few days.

200
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,620
I think she can't stay for a few days.

201
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,420
But you should be careful.

202
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,700
I know.

203
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,460
Just keep your mouth shut.

204
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,580
My mouth?

205
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,980
How can I keep my mouth shut?

206
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,060
You're funny.

207
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:17,740
Okay.

208
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,460
Give me your script.

209
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,180
You can go back.

210
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,780
Okay, I'm leaving.

211
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,500
Bye.

212
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,500
See you tomorrow.

213
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,020
Okay.

214
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:25,660
Bye.

215
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,020
Shiqi,

216
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,460
why are you still awake?

217
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,180
You're still in the studio?

218
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,140
Yes.

219
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,780
I have to finish my work.

220
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,620
I miss you.

221
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,300
Then think about it.

222
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,580
Really?

223
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,380
I can't see you now.

224
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,660
I can't sleep.

225
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,220
Okay.

226
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,180
I'll finish these work

227
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,180
and go to see you.

228
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,100
Really?

229
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,140
Yes.

230
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:16,900
I'm lying to you.

231
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:19,940
Nanxi,

232
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,100
I have something to tell you.

233
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,420
What is it?

234
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,020
Nothing.

235
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:25,580
What?

236
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,500
You're so annoying.

237
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,460
I'll read your script.

238
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,420
Take a good look.

239
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,020
No.

240
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,300
I want to watch you

241
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,540
playing the video.

242
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,100
But I have to do my homework today.

243
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,020
Do your homework?

244
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,180
Then we

245
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,100
can't hang out

246
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,660
and play the video with each other.

247
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,380
Then let's play the video like this.

248
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,340
No one will disturb us.

249
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:48,900
Okay?

250
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,020
Yes.

251
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,580
Shiqi.

252
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:26,700
Shiqi.

253
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,580
Shiqi.

254
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:31,860
You're asleep.

255
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,620
Why don't you go to bed?

256
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,940
No.

257
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,180
I'm just feeling uncomfortable.

258
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,340
I'm afraid of falling asleep.

259
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,180
You're uncomfortable.

260
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,540
I see you have a lot of pressure on your face.

261
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:44,900
Really?

262
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:47,940
Okay.

263
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,220
I'm almost done.

264
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,420
Go to bed and rest.

265
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:52,980
Then...

266
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,220
Do you want to go home?

267
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,780
I'm not tired.

268
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,300
I'll rest at the studio.

269
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,300
I'm so tired.

270
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:02,580
Don't talk.

271
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,820
Go to bed.

272
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,660
Don't be noisy.

273
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,340
Listen to me.

274
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,340
Wait.

275
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,420
What's wrong?

276
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,980
Before we hang up,

277
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,900
let's kiss again.

278
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,060
Okay?

279
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,140
Okay, hang up.

280
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:25,980
Okay.

281
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,420
Morning.

282
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:31,860
Yufan.

283
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,220
Why are you here so early?

284
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,940
You're not early than me.

285
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,980
I'm not early.

286
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,220
I didn't leave at night.

287
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,620
You didn't leave?

288
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,820
Are you crazy?

289
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,820
You can stand such a noisy body?

290
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:44,980
I can stand it.

291
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,980
I'm so energetic.

292
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,900
Love is really great.

293
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,540
You talk too much.

294
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,540
But why are you here now?

295
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,580
Weiya is on the line today.

296
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,700
I came here early.

297
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,340
I need help.

298
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,300
But...

299
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,340
they haven't come yet.

300
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,780
I'm a little excited.

301
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,340
They're here.

302
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,180
Go to breakfast.

303
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,580
Let me rest.

304
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,820
I'm hungry.

305
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,580
Let's go.

306
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,420
What are you doing?

307
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,020
I didn't expect that you

308
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,340
brought me here.

309
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,980
I didn't bring you here.

310
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,900
Stop being jealous.

311
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,580
Why did you order so much?

312
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,500
Let's finish it.

313
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,300
I brought some for them.

314
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,860
They said we'd come out for breakfast

315
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,140
when we came out.

316
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,940
You're right.

317
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,180
Eat.

318
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,140
Lanxin.

319
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:48,740
What?

320
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,460
What?

321
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,220
What different places have you been?

322
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,300
How many?

323
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,060
Is something on your mind?

324
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,220
What's this?

325
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,040
Flick-ион killers.

326
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:22,840
bajia

327
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:23,980
I don't know you.

328
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,180
How can I not know you?

329
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,380
I've been looking for you

330
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,460
when I was abroad.

331
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,660
I know

332
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,700
my illness very well.

333
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,300
I'm relieved.

334
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,780
I was thinking

335
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,380
that you're worried

336
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,620
and annoyed.

337
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,740
How could I be?

338
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,140
It's actually a mental problem.

339
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,900
I've been thinking about it

340
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,060
and how to tell you.

341
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,860
Thank you for your concern.

342
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,020
You're the best.

343
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:47,980
Actually,

344
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,220
I've been thinking that

345
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,540
if I could help you

346
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,060
after you come back,

347
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,500
my illness would be better.

348
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,580
It's like I've been arranged for heaven.

349
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,180
I believe

350
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,060
as long as Shiqi continues to be with me,

351
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,900
I'll be fine.

352
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,420
It's mainly because of you

353
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,220
that you're the best to me.

354
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,740
You're so considerate.

355
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:11,700
Don't forget

356
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,780
the clinic.

357
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,580
Don't worry.

358
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,460
I'll go find time to see it.

359
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:16,820
Let's eat.

360
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,220
Thank you for your coldness.

361
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:18,660
Don't worry.

362
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,580
Don't worry.

363
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,780
Look at what you've done.

364
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,580
It's so messy.

365
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,620
It's like a whole night.

366
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,140
It's not good to do it.

367
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,100
You're here to do it yourself.

368
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,860
You're really a big lady.

369
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,180
It's a crew.

370
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,220
We're busy too.

371
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,900
It's good to come and help you.

372
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,060
But it's better for you to not help.

373
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,100
Ma Yanxiu is here.

374
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:39,660
Go.

375
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,460
You do it yourself.

376
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,060
This is the rules of the crew.

377
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:42,500
Let's go.

378
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,100
I'll take care of her.

379
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,220
Why are you two men

380
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,620
talking to girls like that?

381
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:46,860
Mr. Qin.

382
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,300
Shiqi.

383
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,740
Since you're helping,

384
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,020
you should help her.

385
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,140
Or else, don't help her.

386
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,740
You're helping her.

387
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,180
Mr. Qin.

388
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,300
We'll do it now.

389
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,460
Forget it.

390
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,860
You have so much to do.

391
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,780
Go ahead.

392
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:00,740
Okay.

393
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,180
Let's go.

394
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,580
Shiqi.

395
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,180
Thank you.

396
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,380
You're welcome.

397
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,940
I'll do the same to others.

398
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,460
How about I help you?

399
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:17,820
No.

400
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,540
Go and do your work.

401
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,740
I can do it myself.

402
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:21,860
Okay.

403
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,420
Shiqi.

404
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,260
How come it's you?

405
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,820
I'm here to thank you.

406
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:55,980
For what?

407
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,340
You helped me out.

408
00:17:59,060 --> 00:17:59,700
No need.

409
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,580
You'd better take it.

410
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,540
Don't you invite me in?

411
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,380
I'm afraid it's not convenient.

412
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,220
Let's keep it a secret.

413
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:25,020
I will arrange for you to sponsor me.

414
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,900
But remember

415
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,580
not to oversälle the time giving out at the late moment.

416
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,740
Why?

417
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,140
Qin Shiqi coussssing you.

418
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,620
If your passion for them is his,

419
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,140
he'd lottaShould object.

420
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,540
What you wanna do

421
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:42,540
is often audience in his

422
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,940
and then be nice

423
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,580
and polite.

424
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,380
What's next?

425
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,540
Keke.

426
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,600
I finished

427
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:52,400
holding the front guards!

428
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,260
Let's take a look.

429
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,700
What are you looking at?

430
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,500
Let me think.

431
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,700
I had a .

432
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,820
I didn't expect

433
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,780
the effect of software

434
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,940
can surpass usaka.

435
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:52,820
Yeah.

436
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,060
With this kind of software

437
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,860
we are so great impartial.

438
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,700
I wanted to try several things at the start.

439
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:58,220
I didn't expect

440
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,740
the effect is so great.

441
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:00,780
I suppose

442
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,300
we have all worked hard today.

443
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,180
Let's do a day off today.

444
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,080
Get some rest.

445
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:04,980
a holiday?

446
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,900
Then we can't clear that issue tank.

447
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,300
I can't.

448
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,260
I talked about someone.

449
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,260
About whom?

450
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,580
I bestow her at SOLO.

451
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,980
What are you thinking about?

452
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,500
I have a friend who is in the hospital.

453
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,820
Okay, I won't tell you.

454
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,660
I'm leaving now.

455
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,060
I'll go with you.

456
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,420
No need.

457
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,700
I'll go with you.

458
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:23,540
I'm leaving.

459
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,100
Bye.

460
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,580
Good luck.

461
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,140
Bye.

462
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:26,940
Bye.

463
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,620
Miss Gu, to be honest,

464
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,180
I've never met

465
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,500
a patient like you before.

466
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,460
I understand.

467
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,540
I'm prepared.

468
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,820
But when I was in abroad,

469
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,700
I heard from my mentor

470
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,380
about some related cases.

471
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,180
You are indeed a mental illness.

472
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,900
Maybe in your inner body,

473
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:51,860
there are things

474
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,260
you don't want to think about.

475
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,140
Or you feel uncomfortable.

476
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,220
Plus, you have a car accident.

477
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,620
It's your brain

478
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,340
that temporarily closed

479
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,540
some of the senses

480
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,500
to cause a heart attack.

481
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,900
I mentioned in the previous

482
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,820
foreign doctor

483
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,820
the psychological problem.

484
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,140
Do I have any treatment methods?

485
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,620
You've recovered

486
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,940
a short time ago, right?

487
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,180
But the method you used

488
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,500
is no longer useful.

489
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,220
Yes.

490
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,380
Because your brain

491
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,060
has adapted to the previous reaction.

492
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,780
So if you want to

493
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,420
re-challenge your appearance,

494
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,580
you may have to find a problem from the start.

495
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,300
From the start?

496
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,660
How about this?

497
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,980
I'll call my mentor

498
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,020
and see if he has any good treatment methods.

499
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,740
Thank you.

500
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,340
You're welcome.

501
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,260
If you can really resist me,

502
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,620
I should thank you.

503
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,060
Cut!

504
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:00,940
Shiqi,

505
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,380
you look great.

506
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,500
Let's keep it up.

507
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,340
One more.

508
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:05,540
Sir,

509
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,980
I just checked.

510
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,260
The scene is not in the front and back.

511
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,380
Shiqi's clothes

512
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,740
are not in the right size.

513
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,780
Can I change it?

514
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:12,500
It's okay.

515
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,700
We don't take pictures of the characters.

516
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,020
No, sir.

517
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,220
I'm responsible for the company.

518
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:20,820
Okay.

519
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,060
Now it's adjusted.

520
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:22,860
You should go now.

521
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,780
Thank you, sir.

522
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,060
We didn't change the location.

523
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,140
No need to change it.

524
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,420
It's very good.

525
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,860
We'll keep it up.

526
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,260
What are you doing here?

527
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,180
Your ring

528
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,180
doesn't match your clothes.

529
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,100
I'll change it for you.

530
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:38,940
No need.

531
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:39,540
What are you doing?

532
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,620
I'm doing this for work.

533
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,540
No,

534
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,340
there's nothing in here.

535
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,220
I'll change it for you.

536
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:56,820
Cut!

537
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,500
Okay, sir.

538
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,540
Everyone, good job!

539
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,900
Good job!

540
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,500
Thank you!

541
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,660
Thank you, sir.

542
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,260
Sir,

543
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:09,940
thank you.

544
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,580
Shiqi.

545
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,460
Thank you, sir.

546
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,220
You're the future's wife.

547
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,500
Thank you, sir.

548
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,500
How do I look today?

549
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,540
You look good today.

550
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,340
I'm the future's wife.

551
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,180
Thank you, sir.

552
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,180
And

553
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:30,860
you must act

554
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,460
weak in the team.

555
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,420
The best thing is

556
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,940
to create a small accident.

557
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,020
Accident?

558
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,420
What does it mean?

559
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:42,900
It means

560
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,100
you're in a relationship

561
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,020
between you two.

562
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,500
The most important thing

563
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:46,780
is to

564
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:47,260
link

565
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,340
the relationship between you two

566
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,020
so that

567
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,500
it can develop into the next one.

568
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:06,820
Are you okay?

569
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,460
Are you okay, Keke?

570
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:07,940
Where are you hurt?

571
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,460
What's wrong?

572
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:09,660
Are you hurt?

573
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,740
Keke, are you okay?

574
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:11,860
I'm fine, sir.

575
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,580
I don't love you.

576
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,020
You...

577
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:13,660
You're busy, right?

578
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,300
Come on.

579
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,380
Come on. You're brothers.

580
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,420
Send Keke to the hospital.

581
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,180
Sir, no need.

582
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:17,860
I'll go with him.

583
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,580
I'll send him off.

584
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,380
Okay.

585
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,380
I'll help you get up.

586
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,220
Take care.

587
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:21,740
Take care.

588
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,300
Grandpa,

589
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:23,980
go to the car.

590
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,780
Go!

591
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,580
This is medicine.

592
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,780
You can apply it yourself today.

593
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,060
Shiqi.

594
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,620
Can you help me apply it?

595
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:53,340
Let's go.

596
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,740
Shiqi.

597
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,900
Grandpa, you go back first.

598
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,700
I just talked to Keke.

599
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,060
I'm"...

600
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,260
Bro.

601
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,020
You're here.

602
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,700
Don't be nervous.

603
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,140
You can go back to work.

604
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,060
It's Hahah...

605
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,420
Thank you.

606
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,420
Everything's okay.

607
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,660
Please take good care of everything in future.

608
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,620
Fine.

609
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,640
How long are you going to stay here?

610
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,980
I'm not sure.

611
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,840
The company has at least

612
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:05,380
the team to arrange all of this.

613
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,340
Didn't our jewelry sponsor

614
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,340
always be Kai Ge?

615
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,540
How come he has become a rock?

616
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,100
I don't know about this either.

617
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,220
After all, it's all a decision of the top class.

618
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,840
But Shi Qi,

619
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,100
I swear to you.

620
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,060
I really don't know what you're doing here.

621
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,380
I'm here simply for work.

622
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,540
I understand.

623
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,900
Take good care of yourself, sister.

624
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,700
Shi Qi.

625
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,900
We're close.

626
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,340
We're good.

627
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,060
We love each other.

628
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,220
It's her.

629
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,660
It's none of your business.

630
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:08,420
Your wound is almost healed.

631
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,660
Take a good rest today.

632
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,940
I'll apply it again tomorrow.

633
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,460
I'm leaving.

634
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,220
Shi Qi, I...

635
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,380
What should I do?

636
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,620
Qi Yan.

637
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,100
Jiayuan.

638
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,900
Hello?

639
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:01,540
You're home.

640
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,040
Shi Qi just came back from work.

641
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,440
Why did you come so late?

642
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,240
Are you tired today?

643
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,560
How could I be tired?

644
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,840
Guess what I'm doing.

645
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,160
You're designing a new jewelry.

646
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,920
I'm checking the tickets for you.

647
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,080
Really?

648
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,240
You're coming?

649
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,480
You're not busy lately?

650
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,680
Why do you listen to your tone?

651
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,080
Don't you miss me?

652
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,880
No.

653
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,920
I don't want you to come here.

654
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,720
You called me.

655
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,040
I'll tell you later.

656
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,240
Hello, Lan Xi.

657
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,080
I've been filming at home these days.

658
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,840
So I didn't have time to tell her.

659
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,040
I'm sorry.

660
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:10,520
It's okay.

661
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,280
What's the matter?

662
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,400
Go back to your work.

663
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,040
Shiqing said

664
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,600
she said she'd come back when I was with you.

665
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,680
Why would you come with me?

666
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,440
I'm afraid I'll cause you trouble.

667
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,040
What's the matter?

668
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,560
If that's the case,

669
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,840
I'll go back.

670
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,640
I'll put the card here.

671
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,600
If you need anything, just contact me.

672
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,920
I'll stay in the five-story building.

673
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:39,720
Okay.

674
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,400
I'll go first.

675
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,080
Go ahead.

676
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,160
Go back.

677
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,520
Sit down.

678
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,760
Chairman,

679
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,040
come here.

680
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,560
I'm going to roast a horse.

681
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,080
Keep untukd that side

682
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,560
and set up the fire.

683
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,200
Sir,

684
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,560
thanks for your hard work.

685
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,360
Siqi.

686
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,280
I might have to leave today.

687
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,160
Let's find a place.

688
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,000
Let's have a drink.

689
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,080
Director, we can't do it tonight.

690
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,080
We have a plan.

691
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,080
I want to talk to you about the script.

692
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,080
Director, he really can't do it tonight.

693
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,080
Okay, we'll talk another day.

694
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,080
Sorry, director. We'll talk next time.

695
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,080
Go back and have a rest.

696
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,080
Okay. Bye, director.

697
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,080
We'll go now, director.

698
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,080
Wow, which one of you is here?

699
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,080
Miss Luo is here.

700
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,080
I almost don't know who cleaned this room.

701
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,080
Who do you think is Miss Luo?

702
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,080
I said.

703
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,080
How many days are you going to stay here?

704
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,080
I can't stay for a few days.

705
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,080
After all, I have a lot of work.

706
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,080
I can't leave everything to you.

707
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,080
I'll let her be happy.

708
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,080
Stay here for a few more days.

709
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,080
We've agreed.

710
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,080
We don't want to work together.

711
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,080
Okay.

712
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,080
I'm so tired from seeing you like this.

713
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,080
It's so late.

714
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,080
Go and take a rest.

715
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,080
Go.

716
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,080
Go.

717
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,080
Go.

718
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,080
Go.

719
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,080
Go.

720
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,080
Go.

721
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,080
Go.
