00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm waiting for you

3
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I want to be closer to you

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Be your little star

5
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Always around you

6
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Never leave

7
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I want to be closer to you

8
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The secret of protecting you

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I will keep looking for you

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I want to be with you forever

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
To protect you

Episode 2

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Drink some water.

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You look so bright.

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You've been doing well lately.

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Xiao Rui, don't make fun of me.

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What's the matter?

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Look at you.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We can't meet if I'm not busy.

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
No.

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's just that I haven't been in touch for a long time.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You suddenly called me.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It makes me very nervous.

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
All right, stop it.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I came to see you today

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
to talk to you about the magazine's continued cooperation.

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I knew you were busy.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Since the public relations department left,

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
our cooperation has become less and less.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Zhen Ran, look at the new magazine.

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Can you leave a copy for our Brother Kai?

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Xiao Rui, you know that.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Our cooperation is based on the premise of the work.

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Don't worry.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I will definitely guarantee the work.

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And our brother Kai's sales in the market has always been good.

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You know that.

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Xiao Rui, do you know why Lisa can do well in the industry?

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's because we only focus on product design

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
and don't care about the market.

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I understand.

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Look at these.

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Are you interested?

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm not interested.

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Since Nanxi left,

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
your Brother Kai

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
is really hard to produce

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
a work that is eye-catching.

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You know that.

51
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
A good designer is hard to find.

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And I am more interested in managing the company

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
than in the company.

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
This design is not bad.

55
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Xiao Rui, you should put more effort into it.

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I can also try to get you the original.

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Okay.

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Then we will continue with the design.

59
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Xiao Rui,

60
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
whether we can cooperate or not,

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
we still need to talk about the work.

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Don't worry.

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

64
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Let's have a drink together.

65
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I can't today.

66
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I have to go to the hospital later.

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Hospital?

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
What's wrong with your body?

69
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's not me. It's Gu Nanxi.

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
He is in the hospital.

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
What's wrong with Gu Nanxi?

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Which hospital?

73
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Zhongqi Hospital.

74
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
He has a little problem.

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But it's nothing.

76
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Shi Qi is with him.

77
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Don't worry.

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Okay.

79
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'll go first.

80
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Okay.

81
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'll see you off.

82
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Shi Qi,

83
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
you should go back and rest early today.

84
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You've been tired all day.

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
No need.

86
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You can go back later.

87
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'll stay here for a few days.

88
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I have nothing to do today.

89
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'll take care of Nanxi.

90
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Don't argue.

91
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I have nothing to do.

92
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Don't stay here.

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Go back.

94
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
No.

95
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You have to be taken care of.

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I don't have to take care of.

97
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I can't be selfish.

98
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Then I'll take it as you can't be selfish.

99
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I have to take care of you for a lifetime.

100
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I said you two are almost done.

101
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You really think I'm not existent?

102
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Hurry up.

103
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You...

104
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Hello.

105
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Now?

106
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Okay.

107
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Nanxi,

108
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Leng Ran wants to talk to me.

109
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Go.

110
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Go.

111
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I can see it.

112
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You two think I'm here to have a little trouble, right?

113
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Okay.

114
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Nanxi.

115
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
This annoying woman finally left.

116
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Don't say that about my little sister.

117
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Didn't you have something to tell me?

118
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I thought about it.

119
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I think about Nanxi.

120
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Should we tell her parents?

121
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I know Nanxi's character.

122
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
She definitely doesn't want her parents to know.

123
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Let's respect her.

124
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That's what she said.

125
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
But Nanxi's situation is special now.

126
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
If you don't say it,

127
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm afraid there will be some problems.

128
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What problems can there be?

129
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Think about it.

130
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
That car accident.

131
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It was so serious.

132
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Her parents didn't know.

133
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I think

134
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
you friends have problems.

135
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I know.

136
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You and Nanxi don't want to cause trouble for your family.

137
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
But you know.

138
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
If your family knows,

139
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
it will be more sad.

140
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What do you mean?

141
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I mean

142
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
to let her family know.

143
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'll talk to Nanxi.

144
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Don't.

145
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You told her about this.

146
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
She must be against it.

147
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
We can't

148
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
contact her parents behind her back.

149
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It's not appropriate.

150
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I've thought about it for you.

151
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Let Nanxi tell her family.

152
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
She?

153
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You think Nanxi is stupid?

154
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
We need to ask Shi Qi to help us.

155
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
She?

156
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Can she be reliable?

157
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Sister.

158
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Let's talk about this with Nanxi.

159
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Stop talking.

160
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Do you want to see your mother-in-law?

161
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Okay.

162
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'll listen to you.

163
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Wait.

164
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Hello, mom.

165
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Baby.

166
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Baby.

167
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
What are you doing?

168
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You haven't called your family for a long time.

169
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I have nothing special to tell you.

170
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I didn't tell you.

171
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You're a child.

172
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You only report to the department, but not to the state.

173
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You really have nothing to worry about.

174
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Don't worry.

175
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Don't worry, mom.

176
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
How are you recently?

177
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm fine.

178
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yichuang, it's time to change the medicine.

179
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Change the medicine?

180
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
What medicine?

181
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Tell me the truth.

182
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Is there anything to stop me?

183
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I don't understand.

184
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
No, you wait.

185
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'll go there right now.

186
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Do everything according to the plan.

187
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I know you're sad.

188
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You're so serious.

189
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Serious?

190
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I've always been like this.

191
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Yufan, how is Nanxi?

192
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Don't worry, aunt.

193
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Nothing serious.

194
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Nanxi is a child.

195
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
She doesn't tell us anything.

196
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
She's really worried about Siwen.

197
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Aunt, Nanxi is afraid that you will worry.

198
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Let's go. The car will stop over there.

199
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Let's walk and talk.

200
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Okay.

201
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Aunt, let me help you.

202
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
No need.

203
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's okay.

204
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Aunt, do you remember me?

205
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I don't remember.

206
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Aunt, take a good look.

207
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You forgot me.

208
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I really have no impression.

209
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yufan, how far is it?

210
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Almost, aunt.

211
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Just ahead.

212
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Aunt, he's my brother.

213
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You've seen him in college.

214
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Yes, yes, yes.

215
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I have a little impression.

216
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yufan, let's go.

217
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Go.

218
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Aunt.

219
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Nanxi.

220
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Mom.

221
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Hurry up.

222
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Tell mom where you are hurt.

223
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
No.

224
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I said I'm fine.

225
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It's troublesome to come here.

226
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
What troublesome?

227
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Am I your mom?

228
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You don't tell your family

229
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
such a big thing.

230
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Let mom see.

231
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's okay.

232
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Aunt, it's getting late.

233
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Do you want to eat something at night?

234
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm not hungry.

235
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm here with my daughter.

236
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Aunt, I'll go out with Shiqi

237
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
to buy some food.

238
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You just arrived.

239
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Talk to Nanxi.

240
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Okay.

241
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Then...

242
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Shiqi, let's go.

243
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Tell mom.

244
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Hurry up.

245
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Is there anything wrong?

246
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You make me worried.

247
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Tell mom the truth.

248
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Where are you hurt?

249
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Did you do it to send Nanxi to the hospital?

250
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
What do you mean?

251
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's not the best thing you did.

252
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You asked me to come here today

253
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
just for this?

254
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Of course not.

255
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I got a new message.

256
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Li Na is going to invest in

257
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Qin Shiqi's company.

258
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
What does it have to do with me?

259
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Our goal is to reform and Qin Shiqi.

260
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
So?

261
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm going to use this as a breakthrough.

262
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You just need to cooperate with me.

263
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Okay, I'll listen to you.

264
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And

265
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
don't do anything bad.

266
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'll be a boss.

267
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Otherwise,

268
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I can't help you.

269
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You've been

270
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
very competitive since you were a kid.

271
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You just don't care about the good news.

272
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
In the future,

273
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
you must tell your family

274
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
if you have any problems.

275
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You can't do that.

276
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
What if

277
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
something bad happens?

278
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
What should I do?

279
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm fine, mom.

280
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm fine, too.

281
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Yes, you're fine.

282
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Okay,

283
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
go to bed.

284
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's getting late.

285
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Yes, yes, yes.

286
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Aunt, it's getting late.

287
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'll send you back.

288
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Send me back?

289
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I mean, it's getting late.

290
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You should go back.

291
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'll stay here with my daughter.

292
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
No, aunt.

293
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
The environment is not good here.

294
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You don't feel comfortable sleeping here.

295
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'll take care of Nanxi.

296
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You'll take care of her?

297
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You're a lonely girl.

298
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You can't do that.

299
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'll stay here.

300
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You should go back.

301
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Thank you for these two days.

302
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Sister,

303
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
you should go home first.

304
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Yes.

305
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Okay,

306
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'll go back.

307
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Take care.

308
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Nanxi,

309
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
why is she so ungrateful?

310
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Hurry up, lie down and rest.

311
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Go to bed.

312
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Oh my god,

313
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm so tired, too.

314
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I didn't expect that

315
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm the ugly one.

316
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I have tile debt now.

317
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I madeольше coordinate for this business.

318
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I'm so relieved.

319
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Well,

320
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm afraid that

321
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I don't have much other work to do.

322
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,160
I don't have the time

323
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,000
to think about my future.

324
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'd do better

325
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
if you give me time.

326
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm sorry.

327
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,040
Mr. Liu, this is the contract we had to modify.

328
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,000
Please have a look.

329
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,600
If there's nothing wrong,

330
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,800
we can sign the contract.

331
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,400
OK.

332
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,200
Regarding the design,

333
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,480
we'll make it for Shi Qi.

334
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,040
We'll also launch new jewelry endorsements in the future.

335
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,480
Shi Qi,

336
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,000
the company has high expectations of you

337
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,160
in this drama.

338
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,640
I hope you can put some effort into it.

339
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,200
OK.

340
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,320
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

341
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,120
I hope you can put some effort into it.

342
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,560
You've seen it.

343
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,520
All of us

344
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,480
put all our energy on you.

345
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,120
Don't lose the chance

346
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,560
at the critical moment.

347
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,200
OK.

348
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,720
Don't worry, Mr. Liu.

349
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,160
I'll do my best.

350
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,480
OK.

351
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,840
Let's sign the contract.

352
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,280
OK.

353
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:26,960
Let's go.

354
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,360
Nanxi,

355
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,560
check it carefully.

356
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,840
Don't leave anything behind.

357
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,280
Nanxi.

358
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,680
Aunt.

359
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,880
You're here.

360
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,160
Yifan, why are you here?

361
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,280
I'm asking you this.

362
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,720
Why didn't you come to the hospital today?

363
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,560
Don't look at me.

364
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,520
I have something to do today.

365
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,680
Nanxi,

366
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,640
let's not use this patient's uniform.

367
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,760
It's too dirty.

368
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,360
OK.

369
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,360
Have you thought about what to tell me?

370
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,720
We have to find a chance.

371
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,400
There's a chance.

372
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,440
Let's go.

373
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,440
It's ready.

374
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:14,920
Come on, aunt.

375
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,560
Let me help you.

376
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,000
OK.

377
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,080
Thank you.

378
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,000
Come on, slow down.

379
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,600
I admit

380
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,440
that I called to inform aunt.

381
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,360
I swear

382
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,760
I'm really doing this for your good.

383
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,120
Besides,

384
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,680
Leng Ran asked me to do this.

385
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,760
You know

386
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,560
I don't want my mom to come.

387
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,520
You don't know her.

388
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,320
I have a lot of things to do.

389
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,360
It's not necessary.

390
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,320
It's not necessary.

391
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,360
Wait and see.

392
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,520
I'll go check on her.

393
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,120
OK.

394
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,720
OK.

395
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,320
OK.

396
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:52,960
OK.

397
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,480
OK.

398
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,080
OK.

399
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,560
OK.

400
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,160
OK.

401
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,160
Coming.

402
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,080
Shi Qi is here.

403
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,080
Come in.

404
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,800
Sister.

405
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,720
Just in time for dinner.

406
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,160
Qin Shi Qi.

407
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,600
I have something to ask you.

408
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,240
Aunt.

409
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,600
I'm starving.

410
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,720
How much did you

411
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,800
participate in the dinner?

412
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,160
I'm just a tool man.

413
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,440
My sister and my brother-in-law

414
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,800
supported me.

415
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,880
You know I don't want my mom to come.

416
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,280
I don't want to do it.

417
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,320
No, I don't want to do it.

418
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,480
I don't know what to do.

419
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,320
So...

420
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,560
Stop talking.

421
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,960
Come and eat.

422
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,440
Mom.

423
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,200
What time is it?

424
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,520
Why are you in a hurry?

425
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,640
I have something to do tonight.

426
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,160
What's the matter?

427
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,760
I'm going on a blind date with you.

428
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,720
Blind date?

429
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,240
Why are you so surprised?

430
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,920
This Michele Giro

431
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,400
is a great painter, sculptor

432
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,200
during the Renaissance of Italian culture.

433
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,200
He is also an architect.

434
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,560
In 1505,

435
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,880
he was invited to the second city of Liuzi

436
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,840
to Rome

437
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,360
to build a tomb

438
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,360
for the Pope in St. Petersburg.

439
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,640
But the art director of the Pope

440
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,120
was very jealous of him.

441
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,200
He asked Michele Giro

442
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,320
to draw the ceiling paintings of the Sistine.

443
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,320
As a result,

444
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,480
he spent four years

445
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,840
to complete the ceiling paintings

446
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,360
of the Sistine.

447
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,440
It's the largest painting in the world.

448
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,680
Great.

449
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,960
I didn't expect you to be so good at it.

450
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,040
You even remember these details so clearly.

451
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,800
You've learned so much.

452
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,640
Unlike you young people

453
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,720
who accept new things so quickly,

454
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,000
you can find it on your phone.

455
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,640
By the way,

456
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,080
do you know how Mendelssohn

457
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,480
found Bach's music score?

458
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,320
I really don't know.

459
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,560
Let me tell you.

460
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:11,960
Mom,

461
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,160
I'm going out to answer a call.

462
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,120
Come on.

463
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,280
Let me tell you.

464
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:19,880
Okay.

465
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,040
Hello, Shi Qi.

466
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:22,880
Hello, what's going on?

467
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,800
Are you home yet?

468
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,640
No.

469
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,000
I just got here.

470
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,480
Gu Neng Qi, you're serious.

471
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,520
What serious?

472
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,440
You're the ones

473
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,520
who made my mom come here.

474
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,440
That's why.

475
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,240
I'm not going to tell you now.

476
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,960
I'll send you a message later.

477
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,520
That's it.

478
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,240
Bye.

479
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,240
Qin Yu Fan.

480
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,160
You did all the good things.

481
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,320
What should we do now?

482
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,880
How would I know?

483
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,480
I...

484
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,600
I didn't expect it to be like this.

485
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,040
How can you

486
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,120
watch your girlfriend

487
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,440
have a blind date with someone else?

488
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,520
Shi Qi,

489
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,040
don't worry.

490
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,760
You have to trust Nan Xi.

491
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,160
Don't worry.

492
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,960
Drink it.

493
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,680
Okay.

494
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,240
I've already

495
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,280
examined her for you.

496
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,640
She's not bad.

497
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,080
She's also cultured.

498
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,040
You'll be the only one

499
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,520
who can control the rest.

500
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,600
Well,

501
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,120
I'll leave the rest

502
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,920
to you young people.

503
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,080
I'm an old man.

504
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,840
I won't bother you anymore.

505
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,600
Mom, I...

506
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,320
Take your time to talk to him.

507
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,720
Mom, I...

508
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,320
Auntie, take care.

509
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,600
Take your time.

510
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,080
Go home if you're free.

511
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:41,960
Okay.

512
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,480
Mom, wake up late.

513
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,800
When mom was not at home...

514
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,480
Baseот

515
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,600
Mom, you haven't slept yet?

516
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:09,880
Hey,

517
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,960
come here.

518
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,000
I'm here to tell you something.

519
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:13,840
What's wrong?

520
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,280
I've been thinking about it for a day.

521
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,720
I think

522
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,520
Yu Fan's brother

523
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,680
is not right for you.

524
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,360
Stay away from him.

525
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,600
Why should I stay away from him?

526
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,800
Look.

527
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,480
He's wearing a dress

528
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,040
and he's so cool.

529
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,160
He's so elegant.

530
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,440
He even wears a chain.

531
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,920
He doesn't look like a good person.

532
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,160
He's more of a considerate person.

533
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,240
Then let me ask you.

534
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,360
What does he do?

535
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,320
A doctor,

536
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,840
a lawyer

537
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,320
or a teacher?

538
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,160
None of them.

539
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,520
He's a...

540
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,800
He's looking for a boyfriend.

541
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,440
He must find someone who has a serious job.

542
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,320
Otherwise,

543
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,720
it's hard for two people to be together.

544
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,920
He's a very good person.

545
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,040
Mom, you don't know.

546
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,400
After I came back,

547
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,200
he and Yu Fan have been taking care of me.

548
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,520
Look, I'm sick this time.

549
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,440
They both ran ahead and ran back.

550
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,440
I know.

551
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,920
It's okay to take care of each other.

552
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,920
But if you find a boyfriend

553
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,400
who doesn't have a serious job,

554
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,360
what's the point of having a relationship?

555
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,000
If two people are together,

556
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
it's like a fire.

557
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,920
If he doesn't have a good job,

558
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,200
and he has a child,

559
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,320
it's all a problem.

560
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,040
They fight all day and night.

561
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,200
No matter how good the relationship is,

562
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,360
it's all gone.

563
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,240
Look.

564
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,720
Look.

565
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,680
Your god-slaying aunt

566
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,040
is worrying about you.

567
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,440
What's this, mom?

568
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,880
You've only been here for a few days.

569
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,040
Why did you collect so much?

570
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,880
Who said that?

571
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,800
Since you came back,

572
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,160
I've been looking into it for you.

573
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,440
I just hope

574
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,400
you can marry a good man.

575
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,840
What if I'm not here one day?

576
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,680
No, mom.

577
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,120
What are you talking about?

578
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,480
You're talking nonsense.

579
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,280
You...

580
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,280
No, no, no.

581
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,200
I won't say it.

582
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,520
Let's talk about it another day.

583
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,960
Mom, I...

584
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,360
I want to hear you tell me

585
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,040
the legendary story

586
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,680
you told me when I was in school.

587
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,680
Tell me.

588
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,640
Why do you suddenly want to hear this?

589
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,720
I suddenly want to hear it.

590
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,120
Okay.

591
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,720
There are many stories

592
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,120
in the jewelry industry.

593
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,280
It includes crowns,

594
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,800
naked diamonds, and jade stones.

595
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,040
The crowns,

596
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,400
you may all know,

597
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,560
are the crowns

598
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,280
of Queen Elizabeth.

599
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,600
But there's also

600
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,280
the crown of the Queen of Egypt.

601
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,280
The crown

602
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,360
is made of gold.

603
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,920
The naked diamonds

604
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,680
are angel's tears,

605
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,360
the star of Africa,

606
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,840
and the star of the ocean.

607
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,040
You've all seen it.

608
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,640
The star of the ocean

609
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,280
is the blue diamond

610
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,120
in Titanic.

611
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,240
You've all seen it.

612
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,640
Actually, the star of the ocean

613
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,920
is also called

614
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,400
the star of bad luck.

615
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,160
Because when it was in the 100s,

616
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,360
more than ten people had it.

617
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,560
But...

618
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,280
I didn't expect that

619
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,560
you'd become

620
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,760
a jewelry designer.

621
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,520
I said I was a jewelry designer,

622
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,160
but it wasn't a big achievement.

623
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,040
You're just too impatient.

624
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,080
Take your time.

625
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:43,600
Come on.

626
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,200
Mom,

627
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,440
I'm going to the room for some rest.

628
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,160
You have some rest, too.

629
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,200
This is father's night.

630
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,160
I look forward to stay over for hours.

631
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:06,640
Hello.

632
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,640
Hello, Shi Qi.

633
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,760
Why are you home so late?

634
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,200
What's wrong?

635
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,360
Do you feel threatened?

636
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,800
No.

637
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,480
I'm confident about it.

638
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,520
Really?

639
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,840
I didn't see it.

640
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:24,760
Nanxi,

641
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,640
when will you

642
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,600
tell your mom about us?

643
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,040
I have to tell her now.

644
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:32,960
Otherwise, she'll be

645
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,120
rushing me to a blind date every day.

646
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,440
I'm so worried.

647
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,640
But I have to

648
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,040
wait for her to tell me.

649
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,720
Nanxi,

650
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,160
don't call me.

651
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,320
Have an early rest.

652
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,200
Okay, I'll go to bed now.

653
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,960
I'll hang up now.

654
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,920
See you tomorrow.

655
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,080
Wait.

656
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,640
You almost forgot something.

657
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,040
What?

658
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,200
You have to kiss me before you go to bed.

659
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,600
My mom is outside.

660
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,640
No.

661
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,840
I won't hang up if you don't kiss me.

662
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:06,800
Mom.

663
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:07,960
Good night.

664
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,680
Good night.

665
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,040
Hello.

666
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,280
Nanxi.

667
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:20,880
Nanxi.

668
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,240
You're out of the hospital.

669
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:22,800
How are you?

670
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,640
Are you feeling better?

671
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,400
I'm fine.

672
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,240
It's just a sudden shock.

673
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,280
You don't know?

674
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,920
We know you're out of the hospital.

675
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,240
We're worried sick.

676
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,080
Don't worry. I'm fine.

677
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,240
How's the store?

678
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,080
It's been on sale for so many days.

679
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,880
How many people collected it?

680
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,760
How many people took pictures of the pre-sale?

681
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,680
Everything is hard to start with.

682
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,040
It's not like Kai.

683
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,040
There are so many magazines and publicity every year.

684
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,360
Celebrity endorsements.

685
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,040
And so many jewelry shows.

686
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,840
So you mean

687
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,600
our store's coverage rate is not enough?

688
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,960
I guess so.

689
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,920
Every year,

690
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,600
we have to pay more attention to the sales.

691
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,720
I think it's because

692
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,080
we're not good at sales.

693
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,320
We're not good at sales.

694
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,080
I think so.

695
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:03,600
It's okay.

696
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,280
It's only been a while.

697
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,040
We'll wait.

698
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,480
No wonder.

699
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,400
In the past, we only thought about

700
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,840
designing the product

701
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,840
and neglecting sales and channels.

702
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,480
By the way,

703
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,960
I saw some bloggers online recently.

704
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,920
They shared their

705
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,080
necklace and rings and outfits.

706
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,920
How about we invite some of these bloggers

707
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,200
to promote it?

708
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,240
And Qin Shiqi.

709
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,560
We can't look for Shiqi.

710
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,960
She has helped us a lot.

711
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,960
And I have

712
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,280
limited funds now.

713
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,080
I just paid back the 1 million yuan in compensation.

714
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,760
I have a short budget.

715
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,160
I don't think I can afford to hire someone else.

716
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,240
How about this?

717
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,600
We can make some short videos

718
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,040
and post the new series

719
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,400
and upload it online

720
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,360
to gain more views.

721
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,360
That's good.

722
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,040
Good?

723
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,560
Let's do it.

724
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,240
The movie has been playing for an hour and a half.

725
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,960
They're still missing each other.

726
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,960
It's a must-watch.

727
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,880
So,

728
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,240
are we still

729
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,400
with the movie or not?

730
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,360
What?

731
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,160
You're the 254th.

732
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,360
You're here early.

733
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,840
Yes, I'm here at 5.

734
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,200
I'll be here at 4.

735
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,800
I'm here at 5.

736
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,560
I'm here at 5.

737
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,960
I'm here at 5.

738
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,440
I'm here at 5.

739
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,960
I'm here at 5.

740
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,200
I'm here at 5.

741
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,600
I'm here at 5.

742
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,920
I came here at 12 last night.

743
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,520
You haven't eaten yet?

744
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,600
I came here at 12.

745
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,760
Don't worry.

746
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,920
I'm here.

747
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,280
You'll get better.

748
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,240
It's just that after a while,

749
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,080
my new series is about to start

750
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,160
and I'm getting busy.

751
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,880
We might have to be on the low end.

752
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,480
Why are there so many people?

753
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,240
I'm here to learn from Xiao Mi.

754
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,640
I'm here to learn from Xiao Mi.

755
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,240
What's wrong?

756
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,240
You must be not confident.

757
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,840
I was confident at first,

758
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,840
but not anymore.

759
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,400
Why?

760
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,000
I told my sister before

761
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
that we could finally

762
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,840
date in public.

763
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,000
I didn't expect you to go on a blind date again.

764
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,840
It's all because of your good deeds.

765
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,680
You're really a rock

766
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,920
who's always on your side.

767
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,440
I saw that

768
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,440
in your future mother-in-law's book,

769
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,720
you wrote a lot of blind dates.

770
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,440
But you didn't get to see me.

771
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,640
How come you're here?

772
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,440
My mom likes

773
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,040
men who wear polo shirts and jeans.

774
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,600
Take your time.

775
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,600
I can't let her resist now.

776
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,800
Don't worry.

777
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,800
I'm always with you.

778
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,600
Okay.

779
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,040
I'll wear a suit

780
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,000
and run to the mountain

781
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
to see my future father-in-law.

782
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Okay.

783
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Let's watch a movie.

784
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,920
Listen to me.

785
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,760
Finish the movie

786
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,800
and don't be distracted.

787
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,200
The company values this movie.

788
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,320
It'll be more popular after you finish it.

789
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,320
Then I can be a rich woman at home.

790
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,600
Now you can.

791
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,600
I'll support you.

792
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,200
What's wrong?

793
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,200
I think someone's watching me.

794
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,000
Forget it.

795
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,320
Go to the company.

796
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,320
I'm going back to the studio.

797
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,800
Okay. I'm leaving.

798
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Bye.

799
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,800
Wait for me.

800
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,200
He has a boyfriend?

801
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Why didn't he tell me?

802
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Look at him.

803
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Mom.

804
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,200
You scared me.

805
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,200
Why are you here?

806
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,200
Why are you dressed like this?

807
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,200
I...

808
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,200
I'm here to see who you're with.

809
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,800
Are you following me?

810
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,600
No.

811
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,400
You said you watched a movie.

812
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,600
I want to see it too.

813
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,600
So I ran into a coincidence.

814
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,000
A coincidence?

815
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,200
You want to watch a movie.

816
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,200
Why didn't you ask me to watch it?

817
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,400
Where's the man?

818
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
The man?

819
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
He left.

820
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,000
He left so soon?

821
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I didn't see his face.

822
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,400
Why are you looking at him?

823
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,200
He's just a friend.

824
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,600
Let's go. I'll go with you.

825
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,600
Let's go.

826
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,600
Let's go.

827
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,000
Nan Xi.

828
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,800
Look.

829
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,400
It's only been a few days.

830
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,400
It's already over 20,000.

831
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,400
The remaining amount has already been over 1,000.

832
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,000
There were only dozens of people

833
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
in our store before.

834
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
It's already been several days.

835
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
That's right.

836
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,600
We finally have some results.

837
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,600
Keep going.

838
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,600
Come on. Let's have a drink.

839
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,800
I didn't expect that Gu Nan Xi

840
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,000
would still be so successful.

841
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
It seems that the case

842
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
is nothing to her.

843
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,800
Li Na has decided

844
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,800
to invest in Qin Shi Qi's Qing Xi.

845
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,800
And we are the

846
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,600
supplier of the Qing Xi's jewelry.

847
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,200
What do you mean by that?

848
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,200
They will be a couple.

849
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,600
I will arrange for you to join the team.

850
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,400
You will be able to see Qin Shi Qi every day.

851
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,000
Are you serious?

852
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,800
Of course.

853
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,400
And a couple is a test for people.

854
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,800
They are just starting to date.

855
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,400
If they don't get along, they will easily have conflicts.

856
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:36,200
It depends on whether you can seize the opportunity.

857
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,200
This time,

858
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,400
you won't use Chen Zhe to threaten me again, right?

859
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,400
Fine.

860
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,200
Since you are helping me,

861
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,200
I won't mention it again.

862
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,400
I'm sorry.

863
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,600
I'm sorry.

864
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,800
I'm sorry.

865
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,400
I'm sorry.

866
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,000
I'm sorry.

867
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,800
I'm sorry.

868
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,400
I'm sorry.

869
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,400
I'm sorry.

870
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,400
I'm sorry.

871
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,400
I'm sorry.

872
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,400
I'm sorry.

873
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,400
I'm sorry.

874
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,400
I'm sorry.

875
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,400
I'm sorry.

876
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,400
I'm sorry.

877
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,400
I'm sorry.

878
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,400
I'm sorry.

879
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,400
I'm sorry.

880
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,400
I'm sorry.

881
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,400
I'm sorry.

882
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,400
I'm sorry.

883
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,400
I'm sorry.

884
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,400
I'm sorry.

885
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,400
I'm sorry.

886
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,400
I'm sorry.

887
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,400
I'm sorry.

888
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,400
I'm sorry.

889
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,400
I'm sorry.

890
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,400
I'm sorry.

891
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,400
I'm sorry.

892
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,400
I'm sorry.

893
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,400
I'm sorry.

894
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,400
I'm sorry.

895
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,400
I'm sorry.

896
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,400
I'm sorry.

897
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,400
I'm sorry.

898
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,400
I'm sorry.

899
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,400
I'm sorry.

900
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,400
I'm sorry.

901
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,400
I'm sorry.

902
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,400
I'm sorry.

903
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,400
I'm sorry.

904
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,400
I'm sorry.

905
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,400
I'm sorry.

906
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,400
I'm sorry.

907
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,400
I'm sorry.

908
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,400
I'm sorry.

909
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,400
I'm sorry.

910
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,400
I'm sorry.

911
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,400
I'm sorry.

912
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,400
I'm sorry.

913
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,400
I'm sorry.

914
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,400
I'm sorry.

915
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,400
I'm sorry.

916
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,400
I'm sorry.

917
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,400
I'm sorry.

918
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,400
I'm sorry.

919
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,400
I'm sorry.
