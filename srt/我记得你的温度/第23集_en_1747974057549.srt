00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,320
I'm not afraid of Mr. Hong.

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,320
I'm not afraid of you.

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,320

I'm more worried about you.

28
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,320
I'm not afraid of you.

00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,320
Well.

The Secret of the Tiger

38
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,320
I didn't expect you to stand out when it's the hardest time for us

39
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,320
Mr. He, you're welcome

40
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,320
We all like this show

41
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,320
I think you can win

42
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,320
Thank you for your support

43
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,320
Thank you

44
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,320
I believe I will make a great work

45
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,320
and give it to the audience

46
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,320
I believe so too

47
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,320
Come on, Sheng Jian

48
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,320
Mr. He

49
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,320
Keke

50
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,320
Thank you, Keke

51
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,320
I read your report

52
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,320
Thank you for standing out

53
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,320
and thank Yehai's jewelry

54
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,320
for your support

55
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,320
Shiqi, do you have time?

56
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,320
Let's talk

57
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,320
We...

58
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,320
What? It's not convenient?

59
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,320
No

60
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,320
Mr. He, we'll go out first

61
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,320
Okay

62
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,320
I'll be back in a minute

63
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,320
Okay

64
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,320
I didn't expect

65
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,320
we can be together

66
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,320
like this

67
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,320
Yes, I didn't expect that

68
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,320
What are you doing?

69
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,320
Are you afraid of being stolen?

70
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,320
You said I should pay attention to it

71
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,320
It's okay

72
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,320
We all know our relationship anyway

73
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,320
I'm sorry

74
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,320
I'm sorry

75
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,320
I should have told you

76
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,320
I might not have

77
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,320
done so many things

78
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,320
It's all over

79
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,320
I should have

80
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,320
said sorry to you and Nanxin

81
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,320
I did a lot of things

82
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,320
to make you feel sleepy

83
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,320
Don't say that

84
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,320
You're a good girl

85
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,320
I believe you can do it

86
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,320
I'm sorry

87
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,320
I'm sorry

88
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,320
I'm a good girl

89
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,320
I believe you

90
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,320
You'll find your love

91
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,320
Actually

92
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,320
you and Nanxi

93
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,320
let me know

94
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,320
how to love someone

95
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,320
Qin Shiqi

96
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,320
You must be happy

97
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,320
Okay

98
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,320
Tomorrow

99
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,320
we have to start over

100
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,320
Go back and rest

101
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,320
Let's go

102
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,320
Lulu

103
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,320
Nanxi

104
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,320
You're here

105
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,320
Do you know who I am?

106
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,320
Sit here

107
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,320
Nanxi

108
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,320
I'm really regretful

109
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,320
I should have

110
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,320
come to your place with Xiaoru

111
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,320
But Nanxi

112
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,320
I really need this job

113
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,320
I need the job

114
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,320
I really need the job

115
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,320
I really need this job

116
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,320
I understand.

117
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,320
It's a good chance to stay in Kaige.

118
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,320
Actually, at the time,

119
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,320
I also did something wrong.

120
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,320
I was too impulsive.

121
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,320
I didn't think about the price.

122
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,320
I was too selfish.

123
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,320
Then, Lulu,

124
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,320
do you have any plans now?

125
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,320
Actually, Sister Nanxi,

126
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,320
I want to...

127
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,320
Yifan, it's good that you're here.

128
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,320
I just want to make a decision

129
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,320
and not ask for your opinion.

130
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,320
Lulu,

131
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,320
I'll officially invite you to join us now.

132
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,320
Hurry up and agree.

133
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,320
Yes.

134
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,320
Lulu,

135
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,320
it's not just you.

136
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,320
As long as we share the same share,

137
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,320
I'll agree to it.

138
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,320
Thank you, Sister Nanxi.

139
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,320
I heard from Nanxi before that

140
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,320
how excellent her former staff was.

141
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,320
Today,

142
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,320
I finally saw it.

143
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,320
All right.

144
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,320
Then,

145
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,320
our Xikongjian Team

146
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,320
will officially start today.

147
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,320
Come on!

148
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,320
Welcome.

149
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,320
Welcome to join us.

150
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,320
Nanxi,

151
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,320
everything is normal

152
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,320
for Shiqi.

153
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,320
Yes.

154
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,320
Is she almost dead?

155
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,320
Recently,

156
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,320
I haven't seen you contact her.

157
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,320
I should have.

158
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,320
Maybe she's too busy

159
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,320
and didn't have enough time to contact her.

160
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,320
Maybe it's because of the last time

161
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,320
that she was angry with me.

162
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,320
Are you still angry?

163
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,320
I think so.

164
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,320
Yifan,

165
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
I just want to be able to be myself.

166
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,320
It's been a long time.

167
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,320
I can't help Shiqi

168
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,320
with anything.

169
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,320
Don't think too much.

170
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,320
After all,

171
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,320
we're in the same boat.

172
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,320
But what you said

173
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,320
about breaking up last time

174
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,320
is really good.

175
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,320
It's my fault.

176
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,320
What should I do?

177
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,320
Listen to me.

178
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,320
Call Shiqi.

179
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,320
There's no way

180
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,320
to get so close.

181
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,320
I don't know

182
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,320
what to say.

183
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,320
Gu Nanxi,

184
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,320
when is it?

185
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,320
It's hard to put your face down.

186
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,320
Hurry up.

187
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,320
Okay.

188
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,320
Be my uncle.

189
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,320
Hello?

190
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,320
What?

191
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,320
I'm so lucky.

192
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,320
I should have gone out earlier

193
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,320
and had some good food.

194
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,320
And I'm doing this again.

195
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,320
Yan Yan.

196
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,320
Sister.

197
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,320
How are you now?

198
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,320
Sister Lianghui,

199
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,320
don't say this.

200
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,320
It was like this.

201
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,320
Master, look.

202
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,320
I don't want to

203
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,320
let go of

204
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,320
the last scene.

205
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,320
Okay.

206
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,320
Let's just

207
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,320
play two versions.

208
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,320
Okay.

209
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,320
Enough.

210
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,320
The generator is on fire.

211
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,320
Then,

212
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,320
we stopped it

213
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,320
and it went through.

214
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,320
What's going on?

215
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,320
Now,

216
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,320
the generator is

217
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,320
saving the generator.

218
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,320
No, I don't care about

219
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,320
the generator.

220
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,320
How is Shiqi?

221
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,320
I'm asking you.

222
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,320
Don't worry.

223
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,320
It's okay.

224
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,320
Don't worry.

225
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,320
I'm fine.

226
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,320
You must be careful.

227
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,320
What should I do

228
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,320
if something happens to me?

229
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,320
Lan Xi.

230
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,320
I'm sorry.

231
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,320
I'm sorry.

232
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,320
It's me.

233
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,320
I just want to say sorry to you.

234
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,320
No matter what,

235
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,320
I shouldn't say

236
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,320
the words of break up.

237
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,320
I know

238
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,320
you were worried about me

239
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,320
because of me.

240
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,320
I was wrong.

241
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,320
I shouldn't

242
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,320
be concerned about you.

243
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,320
Shiqi.

244
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,320
You've been doing

245
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,320
a lot for me.

246
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,320
I really want to ask you

247
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,320
what you did.

248
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,320
I promise you

249
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,320
that no matter what happens in the future,

250
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,320
I'll face it with you.

251
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,320
Okay.

252
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,320
No matter what happens in the future,

253
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,320
we'll be together.

254
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,320
As long as you're happy,

255
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,320
I'll be happy.

256
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,320
I think of you more.

257
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,320
Can you take a photo of me?

258
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,320
It's dark.

259
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,320
I'll take a photo of you

260
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,320
when you're done.

261
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,320
I'll wait for you to take a photo.

262
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,320
I'll go home with you tonight.

263
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,320
Okay.

264
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,320
We'll go home together tonight.

265
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,320
I have a voice

266
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,320
that's with you.

267
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,320
I protect you.

268
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,320
I'm sorry.

269
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,320
What do you mean?

270
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,320
I know

271
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,320
you've been doing things for Xiaorui.

272
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,320
Did she call you back

273
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,320
to look after Brother Kai?

274
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,320
It seems she's only useful to you.

275
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,320
Aren't we all little benefits?

276
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,320
Chen Zhe,

277
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,320
I hope you can help me

278
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,320
do one last thing.

279
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,320
What is it?

280
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,320
Write down

281
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,320
what Xiaorui told you to do.

282
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,320
Write it down?

283
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,320
What do you want to do?

284
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,320
I'll forgive you.

285
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,320
But...

286
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,320
Chen Zhe,

287
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,320
this bank card is not much.

288
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,320
But it's enough for you to do a little thing.

289
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,320
I hope you can understand that

290
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,320
the stolen things

291
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,320
will be found one day sooner or later.

292
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,320
Go home.

293
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,320
Tell me where your dad is.

294
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,320
He told the truth.

295
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,320
The future is president's own fault.

296
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,320
Even if every boy buy an old car,

297
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,320
his will be found.

298
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,320
If he wants to give wind on it,

299
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,320
after he makes вrаться,

300
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,320
he won't forget who it is.

301
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,320
Okay.

302
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,040
I'm sorry.

303
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,120
For your design contest,

304
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,760
I don't dare to disturb you these days.

305
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,560
But I haven't seen you for days.

306
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,280
Qin Shiqi,

307
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,640
you're so brave.

308
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,920
Did I learn from you?

309
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,080
How can I?

310
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,880
You don't have any.

311
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,080
Do I?

312
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,080
You're learning from me.

313
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,920
You're learning from me.

314
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,840
Exactly.

315
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,720
I want to say something.

316
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:51,920
What?

317
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,080
Drink first.

318
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,880
You let others say.

319
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,720
It's a test.

320
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,920
I want to thank you.

321
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,000
You didn't remember the money.

322
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,040
You kept it from me.

323
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,040
It's good to keep it.

324
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,240
Isn't it a sign?

325
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,800
It's been a long time.

326
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,080
Being with you

327
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,600
is like being a family.

328
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,280
You're right.

329
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,160
What do you mean?

330
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,720
We're family.

331
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,280
Exactly.

332
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,200
And,

333
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,480
I want to tell Shiqi.

334
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,040
Yes.

335
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,080
It's you.

336
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,080
I want to tell you.

337
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,240
If you dare to treat Sister Nanxi badly,

338
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,400
I won't forgive you.

339
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,800
Lulu, you're right.

340
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,000
I didn't hear that.

341
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,400
You said to Leng Ran.

342
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,280
He's not good to me.

343
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,400
You won't forgive him.

344
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,400
Well,

345
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,280
this won't happen.

346
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,320
I'm just a metaphor.

347
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:41,600
No.

348
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,400
Your metaphor is not right.

349
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,240
In my opinion,

350
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,840
this kind of thing won't happen in my life.

351
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,200
Anyway,

352
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,800
I'm very grateful

353
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,160
to be able to go back to this big family.

354
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,000
Drink it.

355
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,320
I'll drink it.

356
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,120
Drink it.

357
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,560
Shiqi.

358
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,680
Okay.

359
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,840
What's Shiqi?

360
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,760
We're here today

361
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,560
to celebrate Nanxi's

362
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,200
completion of the design draft.

363
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,120
Don't do those things

364
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,520
about Shiqi.

365
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,160
Come on.

366
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,880
For the champion designer in the future,

367
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,800
let's toast.

368
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,120
Cheers.

369
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,720
Cheers.

370
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,720
Cheers.

371
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,560
Cheers.

372
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,520
You're all blessed.

373
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,840
The game hasn't started.

374
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,320
You're so full of words.

375
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,000
You have to be confident.

376
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,840
Just like me.

377
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,840
Every time I shoot a drama,

378
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,680
I feel like I can definitely succeed.

379
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,000
You're my girlfriend.

380
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,360
You have to be like me.

381
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,760
Okay.

382
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,440
If you're confident,

383
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,720
I'll drink another one.

384
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,760
Cheers.

385
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,400
Cheers.

386
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,440
Cheers.

387
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,720
No.

388
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,480
Why don't you drink it?

389
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,120
I'll open it.

390
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:48,720
Come on.

391
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,200
Cheers.

392
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:49,720
Cheers.

393
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,560
Cheers.

394
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:50,760
Cheers.

395
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,640
Cheers.

396
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,520
Cheers.

397
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,360
Cheers.

398
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,200
Cheers.

399
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,480
You're drinking again?

400
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,280
Is that it?

401
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,720
The Seriously Oh My Dеш

402
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,020
Lu Lu,

403
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,740
How long have you been at my company?

404
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,880
About five years

405
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,720
I remember you being dunno

406
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,560
when you first came to our company

407
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,560
I didn't expect to go to Shaozi

408
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,280
I have the ability.

409
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,280
You can save me.

410
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,280
I need you to do something for me.

411
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,280
You've done it.

412
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,280
Now the design team has a team.

413
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,280
You still have the control.

414
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,280
Mr. Xiao, what's the matter?

415
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,280
I'm going to the studio in Gu Nan.

416
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,280
Help me to participate in the competition this time.

417
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:40,280
Help me to take the design team out of the competition this time.

418
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,280
I...

419
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:50,280
At least, I can save the opportunity.

420
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,280
I'm going to the studio.

421
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,280
Miss.

422
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,280
Let me see what you can fight with me.

423
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,280
Okay.

424
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,280
Everything is ready.

425
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,280
Just wait for your competition to be a big success.

426
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,280
I'm sorry.

427
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,280
To be honest, I'm a little nervous.

428
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,280
What are you nervous about?

429
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,280
I'm nervous about what you're doing.

430
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,280
Why isn't Lu Lu here to work?

431
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,280
She drank too much yesterday. She didn't get up.

432
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,280
Anyway, she's fine today.

433
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,280
Let her sleep more.

434
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,280
You're so fast.

435
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,280
Lei Tong?

436
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,280
Lei Tong? How could this happen?

437
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,280
I don't know.

438
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,280
But I really can't do anything about it.

439
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,280
Nan Xi, we still have a while before we get to the point of the competition.

440
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,280
Let's modify it a little bit more.

441
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,280
It's not too late. Okay?

442
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,280
We don't have time.

443
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,280
Just a few days.

444
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,280
How could I have made a new design?

445
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,280
It's a mess.

446
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,280
I was eliminated.

447
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,280
You're a designer.

448
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,280
Who else would look at me except you?

449
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,280
How could there be such a coincidence?

450
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,280
It's meaningless to say that now.

451
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,280
But it's okay.

452
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,280
I'm fine anyway.

453
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,280
I feel quite relaxed now.

454
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,280
Maybe I really have no fate with the competition.

455
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,280
I remember you're a person who won't give up easily.

456
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,280
I don't want to give up either.

457
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,280
But the truth is here.

458
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,280
How about this?

459
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,280
We'll be thinking about it when we get home.

460
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,280
There will always be a miracle.

461
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,280
Even if the competition is being held on that day,

462
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,280
I don't have the confidence to make another ideal design.

463
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,280
It's okay.

464
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,280
We can't do this.

465
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,280
Let's participate in the next competition.

466
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,280
It's okay.

467
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,280
Don't be stressed.

468
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,280
Don't comfort me.

469
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,280
I'm really fine.

470
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,280
Okay.

471
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,280
If you're really unhappy,

472
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,280
you can find out that I'm here.

473
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,280
I'm your strong backup.

474
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,280
I'm sorry.

475
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,280
I'm sorry.

476
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,280
I'm sorry to bother you.

477
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,280
Keke, why are you here?

478
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,280
I wanted to give you a message

479
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,280
to let Chen Zhe write down

480
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,280
the things that Xiao Rui did.

481
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,280
I accidentally heard your conversation.

482
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,280
Sister Nan Xi,

483
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,280
I have some designs that I've already drawn.

484
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,280
But I didn't release them.

485
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,280
People are powerful.

486
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,280
I think it will definitely help you.

487
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,280
That's your design.

488
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,280
How can I use it?

489
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,280
It's okay.

490
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,280
You helped me a lot in my design before.

491
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,280
Look, we're all helping you.

492
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,280
So you must have confidence.

493
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,280
Let's try again.

494
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,280
Okay.

495
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,280
I'll try again.

496
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,280
Okay.

497
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,280
I'm sorry.

498
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,280
I'm sorry.

499
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,280
I'm sorry.

500
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,280
I'm sorry.

501
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,280
I'm sorry.

502
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,280
I'm sorry.

503
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,280
I'm sorry.

504
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,280
I'm sorry.

505
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,280
I'm sorry.

506
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,280
I'm sorry.

507
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,280
I'm sorry.

508
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,280
I'm sorry.

509
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,280
I'm sorry.

510
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,280
I'm sorry.

511
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,280
I'm sorry.

512
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,280
I'm sorry.

513
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,280
I'm sorry.

514
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,280
I'm sorry.

515
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,280
I'm sorry.

516
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,280
I'm sorry.

517
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,280
I'm sorry.

518
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,280
I'm sorry.

519
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,280
I'm sorry.

520
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,280
I'm sorry.

521
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,280
I'm sorry.

522
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,280
I'm sorry.

523
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,280
I'm sorry.

524
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,280
I'm sorry.

525
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,280
Gu Nanxi.

526
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,280
I love you.

527
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,280
Let's be together again.

528
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,280
Promise her.

529
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,280
Right.

530
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,280
I love you.

531
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,280
Yes.

532
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,280
Promise her.

533
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,280
I love you.

534
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,280
I love you.

535
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,280
Congratulations.

536
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,280
I love you.

537
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,280
I love you.

538
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,280
Shiqi.

539
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,000
Thank you.

540
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,600
I love you.

541
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,480
Mr. Yang, what's the matter?

542
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,840
What's the matter?

543
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,480
Mr. Yang,

544
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,800
I'm saving you.

545
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,600
Don't put it in your heart.

546
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,240
I should do all these.

547
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,280
And anyone else will do it.

548
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,680
Mr. Yang, it's nothing.

549
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,880
It's just a little thing.

550
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,440
Now we're safe.

551
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,680
It's the biggest thing.

552
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,480
Right?

553
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,080
Mr. Yang,

554
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,080
is there anything wrong with you?

555
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,480
Just tell me.

556
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,080
Mr. Qin,

557
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,680
you're a good person.

558
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,080
You're all good people.

559
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,080
I'm not a good person.

560
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,280
I'm sorry.

561
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,480
All right.

562
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,480
This car accident

563
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,880
is not something we can expect.

564
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,280
And it's not what you wanted.

565
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,680
Don't put it in your heart.

566
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,680
Mr. Qin,

567
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,680
is your girlfriend called Gu Nanshi?

568
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,080
Yes.

569
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,480
How do you know?

570
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,480
What happened?

571
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,480
I'm sorry.

572
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,880
I'm so sorry.

573
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,880
I'm so sorry.

574
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,880
I'm so sorry.

575
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,880
Don't go.

576
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,680
Nanshi.

577
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,080
Nanshi.

578
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:11,880
Nanshi.

579
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:12,880
Nanshi.

580
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,280
Is he all right?

581
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,080
He's actually blaming me.

582
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,080
I'm sorry, too.

583
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,080
I was lying to myself.

584
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:19,880
Don't say that.

585
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,480
It's all right now.

586
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,480
No, I'm begging you.

587
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,480
I can't hug you.

588
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,480
I'm not even graduated yet.

589
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,480
I'll hug you and die.

590
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,480
No, he's like this.

591
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,480
What?

592
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,480
I'm so hungry.

593
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,480
I'll take you to the hospital.

594
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,480
I'm not begging you.

595
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,480
You should leave.

596
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,480
No, no, no.

597
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,480
This...

598
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,480
I'll figure it out.

599
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,480
You should leave.

600
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,480
What's wrong?

601
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,480
It's okay.

602
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,480
I'll call the doctor.

603
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,480
I'll call the doctor.

604
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,480
Mr. Qin.

605
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,480
Nanshi.

606
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,480
It's all my fault.

607
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,480
You're good people.

608
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,480
I did something wrong.

609
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,480
I'm sorry.

610
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,480
Mr. Yang, don't say that.

611
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,480
You didn't expect

612
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,480
that it would be like this.

613
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,480
The police.

614
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,480
You must call the police.

615
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,480
You're just murderers.

616
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,480
Forget it.

617
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,480
Nanshi.

618
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,480
As long as you're willing,

619
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,480
I'm willing to do it for you.

620
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,480
It's all my fault.

621
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,480
Mr. Yang.

622
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,480
Mr. Yang.

623
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,480
Thank you for telling me this.

624
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,480
I...

625
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,480
I've forgiven you.

626
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,480
You should go back.

627
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,480
Look, Nanshi.

628
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,480
I know I'm a car.

629
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,480
You don't have to say that.

630
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,480
If you need anything,

631
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,480
I'll ask for your help.

632
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,480
I really forgive you.

633
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,480
Okay, Mr. Yang.

634
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,480
You should go back.

635
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,480
It's okay.

636
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,480
It's okay.

637
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,480
Nanshi.

638
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,480
What are you thinking?

639
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,480
The shooting competition is about to start.

640
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,480
I want...

641
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,480
You want to compete with Xiao Rui.

642
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,480
You want to win the game, right?

643
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,480
I lost to Dr. Xin Li.

644
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,480
I have to find

645
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,480
the source of my inner depth.

646
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,480
I think about it.

647
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,480
I think it's the source.

648
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,480
Although I've recovered now,

649
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,480
if I can't win the game officially,

650
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,480
I can't get the card in my heart.

651
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,480
This time,

652
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,480
I have to win.

653
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,480
You will win.

654
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,480
Come on, Nanshi.

655
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,480
You're the best.

656
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,480
Put this on.

657
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,480
I'm not with you.

658
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,480
Let her be with you.

659
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,480
Okay, Senior.

660
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,480
I'll take care of it.

661
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,480
Okay.

662
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,480
Okay.

663
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,480
I'll go.

664
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,480
Okay.

665
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,480
I'll go.

666
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,480
Okay.

667
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,480
I'll go.

668
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,480
Okay.

669
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,480
I'll go.

670
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,480
Senior,

671
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,480
it's not your time to talk about love.

672
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,480
Nanshi,

673
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,480
don't be nervous.

674
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,480
Have a good time.

675
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,480
You can do it.

676
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,480
Okay.

677
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,480
It's about to start.

678
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,480
Let's talk about it.

679
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,480
Don't be a fan.

680
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,480
It's not a battlefield.

681
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,480
It's just a few hours.

682
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,480
What's the point?

683
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,480
Okay.

684
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,480
I'll wait for your good news.

685
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,480
When you're done,

686
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,480
you can go to my movie studio.

687
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,480
Okay.

688
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,480
Come on.

689
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,480
Nanshi.

690
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,480
Come on.

691
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,480
Nanshi.

692
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,480
Lena.

693
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,480
Are you free?

694
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,480
Come on.

695
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,480
Okay.

696
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,480
Come on.

697
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,480
That way.

698
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,480
I didn't expect you'd come.

699
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,480
I'm here to say goodbye.

700
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,480
Say goodbye?

701
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,480
Where are you going?

702
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,480
I'm going back to Europe.

703
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,480
You...

704
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,480
What about Kai Ge?

705
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,480
I don't care.

706
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,480
Lena.

707
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,480
Actually,

708
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,480
Xiaorui...

709
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,480
Don't mention her.

710
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,480
If I wasn't in love,

711
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,480
neither you nor I would have made it to today.

712
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,480
I'm sorry, Xiaoxi.

713
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,480
Kai Ge, are you really not going to fight?

714
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,480
What else do you mean?

715
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,480
I don't want to go back.

716
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,480
It's almost time.

717
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,480
I should go.

718
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,480
If you have a chance to come to Europe,

719
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,480
I'll be there.

720
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,480
Go back.

721
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,480
Okay.

722
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,480
I'm going.

723
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,480
I'm going back to Europe.

724
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,480
I'm going back to Europe.

725
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,480
I'm going back to Europe.

726
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,480
I'm going back to Europe.

727
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,480
I'm going back to Europe.

728
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,480
I'm going back to Europe.

729
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,480
I'm going back to Europe.

730
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,480
I'm going back to Europe.

731
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,480
I'm going back to Europe.

732
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,480
I'm going back to Europe.

733
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,480
I'm going back to Europe.

734
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,480
I'm going back to Europe.

735
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,480
I'm going back to Europe.

736
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,480
I'm going back to Europe.

737
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,480
I'm going back to Europe.

738
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,480
I'm going back to Europe.

739
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,480
I'm going back to Europe.
