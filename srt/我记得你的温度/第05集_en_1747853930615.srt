EpARTS

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,160
Can't understand the separation with me

3
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,560
In my arms, who are you talking about

4
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,960
How can you hide in my soft heart

5
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,320
I want to be closer to you, be your little star

6
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,720
Always surrounding you, never leaving, never leaving

7
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,080
I want to be closer to you, protect your secret

8
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,680
I will keep looking for you

9
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,800
I'm waiting for you

10
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:12,200
I want to be closer to you, be your little star

11
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,600
Always surrounding you, never leaving, never leaving

12
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,000
I want to be closer to you, protect your secret

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,560
I will keep looking for you

14
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:34,920
I want to be closer to you, protect your secret

16
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,080
What is this place?

17
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,800
Come with me

18
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,560
Open

19
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,560
Hello Boss

20
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,560
Why do you call me Boss?

21
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,560
Call me Director Yan

22
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,560
Come, come, come, come with me

23
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,560
Cheers

24
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,560
Look what I said

25
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,560
Are you that hot?

26
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,560
What are you doing?

27
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,560
How many people know you?

28
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,560
Be quiet, why are you so loud?

29
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,560
Sit, sit, sit

30
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,560
Do you know what I want to say?

31
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,560
I just think you are cowardly

32
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,560
I'm cowardly?

33
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,560
Yes

34
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,560
Be quiet

35
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,560
Ok, I'll be quiet

36
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,560
What are you doing?

37
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,560
You obviously like this little girl

38
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,560
No

39
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,560
You obviously like this little girl

40
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,560
Why don't you confess?

41
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,560
When I was twelve, I understood a joke

42
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,560
I'm so hungry, so cowardly

43
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,560
You don't understand what it feels like to secretly love someone

44
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,560
It's a good thing

45
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,560
I'm really afraid that after I confess to Wu Nanxi

46
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,560
We can't even be friends

47
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,560
Baby, you are twenty-four

48
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,560
You are not young anymore, baby

49
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,560
You haven't been in love, have you?

50
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,560
You must be a little boy

51
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,560
Be quiet

52
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,560
You sound like you have experience

53
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,560
Who am I?

54
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,560
I'm a love boy

55
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,560
Baby, I was in high school

56
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,560
I didn't only study well

57
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,560
Many people are in the row, spending money

58
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,560
Please help me chase girls

59
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,560
I tell you

60
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,560
You met me last month

61
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,560
I'll teach you a few tricks

62
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,560
Let you try to do it

63
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,560
Really?

64
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,560
Really

65
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,560
I tell you

66
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,560
Be quiet

67
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,560
You have to know what girls need

68
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,560
You have to collect what you want

69
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,560
What does Wu Nanxi need?

70
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,560
She needs success

71
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,560
She needs to get what others want

72
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,560
What does she need?

73
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,560
Just go and make up

74
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,560
Don't care how many pursuers she has

75
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,560
It's useless, it's none of your business

76
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,560
As long as you are away from her

77
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,560
You will really be away from her

78
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,560
What do you mean?

79
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,560
I don't know

80
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,560
You can't put so much stuff in your head

81
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,560
Come on, drink

82
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,560
Drink what?

83
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,560
Drink it yourself

84
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,560
I'm thirsty

85
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,560
As long as you are away from her

86
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,560
You will really be away from her

87
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,560
Shiqi, why are you back so late?

88
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,560
Sister Nanxi, I...

89
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,560
Why didn't you come for dinner?

90
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,560
I didn't see your message, sorry

91
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,560
I have something to do at work

92
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,560
I'm sorry I didn't tell you

93
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,560
You drank?

94
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,560
You are so sad

95
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,560
Come in

96
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,560
You need to go to the bathroom

97
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,560
Do you have something to say?

98
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,560
I...

99
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,560
I...

100
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,560
What?

101
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,560
I want to say

102
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,560
Sister Nanxi

103
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,560
Remember to come back in time next time

104
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,560
I promise

105
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,560
Sister Nanxi, why don't you get up first?

106
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,560
I want to sleep in my bed

107
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,560
Then you should rest

108
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,560
I'm going to sleep

109
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,560
Okay

110
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,560
Good night

111
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,560
I'm going to sleep

112
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,560
Hello, what's wrong?

113
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,560
Sister Nanxi

114
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,560
The gemstone sample we reported was rejected by the company

115
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,560
Rejected?

116
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,560
Why?

117
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,560
The company suggested that the gemstone we selected was too cheap

118
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,560
It is not compatible with the new jewelry positioning of the company

119
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,560
I'm talking nonsense

120
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,560
I should have chosen the most suitable gemstone

121
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,560
Wait a minute, I'm going to the company now

122
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,560
What's wrong, sister Nanxi?

123
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,560
Did you encounter trouble?

124
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,560
I have something to do at the company, I'll go first

125
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,560
Then you can go after breakfast

126
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,560
It's too late

127
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,560
Be careful

128
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,560
Why are you going to make up for what he said?

129
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,560
Hello, are you busy now?

130
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,560
I have something to tell you

131
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,560
We choose the original materials

132
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,560
It's more important that it's suitable

133
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,560
Not only its value

134
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,560
We have always done this

135
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,560
Our Kaige is going to the high-end route

136
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,560
Our customers are also high-end people

137
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,560
You use such cheap gemstones as the leading star of the new season

138
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,560
This is too childish

139
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,560
If you just want expensive gemstones

140
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,560
Then factory production is fine

141
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,560
What else do you need a designer for?

142
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,560
These are all your personal thoughts

143
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,560
Our company is so big

144
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,560
Do you want to use the leading star of the new season

145
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,560
Do you want to make a market research?

146
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,560
Mr. Xiao, I can say the previous thing

147
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,560
But I can't accept this

148
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,560
I am still the company's design director

149
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,560
Nanxi, I think what Director Chen said is not unreasonable

150
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:38,640
Let's focus on the

151
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,560
I think we should use the green

152
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,560
Green?

153
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,560
That's nonsense

154
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,560
The color is wrong

155
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,560
You know that

156
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:53,540
The girl who expressed the

157
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,560
Nanxi, time is running out

158
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,560
Let's find a way to keep this thing

159
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,560
It's meaningless to keep arguing

160
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,560
Let's end it

161
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,560
I want you to open the factory

162
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,300
You know my feeling

163
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,560
Happy?

164
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,560
Have you told anyone that we are Tongtong's Beijing?

165
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,560
But far from it

166
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,820
this

167
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,560
After this

168
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,560
It is all over

169
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,560
Now we should talk about this

170
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,560
You can keep the sound

171
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,480
I need your help.

172
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,760
You sit down first.

173
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,640
Sit down and talk.

174
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,240
Yuqi, what's the matter?

175
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:39,880
Tell me.

176
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,360
Do you need help with Nan Nan?

177
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,080
I need gemstones.

178
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,680
Gemstones?

179
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,880
What kind of things do you want?

180
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,760
I'll arrange someone to send them to you.

181
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,760
No.

182
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,880
I want the raw materials.

183
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,800
Raw materials?

184
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,760
What kind of things do you want?

185
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,560
I'm not sure about the details.

186
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,000
Do you need help?

187
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,240
How about this?

188
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,520
I'll take you to the materials room.

189
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,200
Okay.

190
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,120
Thank you, Keke.

191
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:08,960
Let's go.

192
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,560
Let's go.

193
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,520
Let's go.

194
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,600
Shiqi will think of me when something happens.

195
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,360
It seems I still have a chance.

196
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,440
If I help Nanxi to solve this matter,

197
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,960
she will be touched by me.

198
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,120
kungfu

199
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:49,580
Can we send the raw

200
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,240
materials to you?

201
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,680
Sorry.

202
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,720
It may take a month.

203
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,560
A long time?

204
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,360
Okay.

205
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,160
Chen Zhe's design plan?

206
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,440
How long do I have?

207
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,680
Two days.

208
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,640
Is there no other way?

209
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,320
I think the A plan is good.

210
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,840
Let's improve the B plan.

211
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,560
Okay.

212
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,320
Isn't he an ancient designer?

213
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,640
Cherish it.

214
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,160
Maybe it will be moved in two days.

215
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,520
Deng Qi, look.

216
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,880
Is it suitable?

217
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,880
This is...

218
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,400
You sent it?

219
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,360
Are you satisfied?

220
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,720
What do you mean?

221
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,440
I sent the stuff there.

222
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,520
But I don't know if he is satisfied.

223
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,720
You don't know?

224
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,760
I thought I was afraid that

225
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,560
it would be too revealing.

226
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,800
So I put it on the reception table

227
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,200
and asked the reception table to give it to him.

228
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,280
Qin Shiqing, I'm really impressed.

229
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,400
Are you out of your mind?

230
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,760
Or are you soaked by the rain?

231
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,200
You chose the gift with great difficulty.

232
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,360
You let him send it to you.

233
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,960
Why did you run away?

234
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,400
Just give him a delivery.

235
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,080
I'm really impressed.

236
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,800
Well...

237
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,920
What should we do now?

238
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,400
What should we do?

239
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,440
How can I know?

240
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,280
I think

241
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,600
if he is satisfied,

242
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,280
he will definitely thank you on WeChat.

243
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,520
If he doesn't like it,

244
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
then it's up to him.

245
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,000
Hello.

246
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,120
Please give this to Gu Nanxi.

247
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,040
Okay.

248
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,480
Thank you.

249
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,720
This one is for Gu Nanxi.

250
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,920
And this one is for Luo Ke.

251
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,920
Please give them to him.

252
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,120
Mr. Xiao,

253
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,320
this is for the designer

254
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,480
of Gu Nanxi.

255
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:38,920
I know.

256
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,400
I'll take it back.

257
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,280
Okay, Mr. Xiao.

258
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,440
Hello, Rui.

259
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,240
I've solved Qin Shiqi's problem.

260
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,240
You can talk about our cooperation.

261
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,480
So fast?

262
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,400
I'm looking forward to your design.

263
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,040
You'll see it in a few days.

264
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,360
I'll get Qin Shiqi's authorization and contact you.

265
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,520
Okay.

266
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,760
Okay, I'll wait for your news.

267
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,960
Please make an appointment for me at noon.

268
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,200
I'll be there.

269
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,400
Thank you.

270
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,520
The company has solved all the problems for us.

271
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,800
It's our turn now.

272
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,520
Rui,

273
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,760
I'll leave the earring and the outerwear to you.

274
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,040
I've chosen the materials.

275
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,120
Next, when you communicate with the factory,

276
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,280
you must pay attention to the details.

277
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,520
Okay.

278
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:48,920
Lin Yong,

279
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,120
the necklace is the most detailed part of this design.

280
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,760
I chose you

281
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,800
because I like your hand carving skills.

282
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:56,880
Good luck.

283
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,600
Okay, I promise to complete the task.

284
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,200
You two will make the rings together with me.

285
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,640
The rings are the most important part of this design.

286
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,920
You two will make it together with me.

287
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,600
Then,

288
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
we don't have much time.

289
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,120
Let's split up.

290
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,080
Okay.

291
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,520
Gu Nanxi,

292
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,640
you're so brave.

293
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,880
I've worked in the Kaike Star Shop for eight years.

294
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,400
I'm going to be replaced by a small designer

295
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,800
who is so smart and accurate as you.

296
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,960
Fine.

297
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,400
Let's discuss that with her.

298
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,320
You willt waste time делаing against her.

299
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,280
I can only be your friend for one day.

300
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:35,840
Okay?

301
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,160
Know what?

302
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,200
What you want me to do is

303
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,840
to make this heart of mine

304
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,480
strong enough that I could bear everything.

305
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,160
Okay?

306
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,080
Gentlemen,

307
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,240
put down your arm,

308
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,520
rest up and go to the next step.

309
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,280
I'm sorry.

310
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,760
Sit.

311
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,680
Xiao Rui, I'm warning you again.

312
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,560
Stay away from Gu Nanxi.

313
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,360
Don't worry.

314
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,040
I recruited her into the company

315
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,560
to make up for her.

316
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,800
What are you talking about?

317
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,000
She's already seen you through.

318
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,080
What's there to make up for?

319
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,240
You've been so stubborn.

320
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,200
You still miss her.

321
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,960
Have you confessed your love?

322
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,520
It has nothing to do with you.

323
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,680
Let's get to the point.

324
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,080
I asked you here today

325
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,320
because I hope

326
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,600
you can be the spokesperson for our Kai Ge Jewelry.

327
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,360
Impossible.

328
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,480
Don't reject me so hastily.

329
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,920
What if I say

330
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,480
it was Gu Nanxi who designed it?

331
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,640
Then you don't have to tell me.

332
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,360
It seems you still don't know Gu Nanxi.

333
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,240
Do you think she'll tell you herself?

334
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,320
How's the deal?

335
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,040
What deal?

336
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,400
You'll be the spokesperson

337
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,920
for our Kai Ge Jewelry.

338
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,560
I promise that this season

339
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,280
Gu Nanxi will be a famous jewelry designer.

340
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,960
You know it.

341
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,040
Nanxi needs this now.

342
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,960
And you won't suffer any loss

343
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,240
in working with our Kai Ge.

344
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,320
It's true.

345
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,920
Yi Hai won't agree to this.

346
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,040
It's not something I should think about.

347
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,240
I can only think about it

348
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,600
until tonight.

349
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,120
If I don't get your clear answer,

350
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,600
I can only

351
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,080
tolerate the pain and change Gu Nanxi.

352
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,920
I heard that Nanxi is now

353
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,960
starting to make the finished product.

354
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,480
At this time,

355
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,320
you want to change her?

356
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,440
I really don't know how to say it.

357
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,520
I didn't expect

358
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,800
such a big deal from you.

359
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,720
I didn't expect you to be

360
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,640
so despicable all these years.

361
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,640
Don't make fun of me.

362
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,760
I've already paid the bill.

363
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,720
If you don't want to eat with me,

364
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,800
I won't bother you.

365
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,040
But

366
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,400
I hope you can think about it

367
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,720
and look forward to your answer.

368
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,400
Lend me money!

369
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,560
Be quiet.

370
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,200
Don't listen to him.

371
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,160
I'll tell you in person.

372
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,800
I'll tell you in person.

373
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,840
No, I'll tell you now.

374
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,360
I'll resign right now.

375
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,280
I'll work for you for a month.

376
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,080
I'll add a fine.

377
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,320
Chen Shao Yong will be fired.

378
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:19,920
Okay.

379
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,920
Before you resign,

380
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,240
please do me a favor.

381
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,120
Are you okay?

382
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,800
Tell me.

383
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,800
What are you thinking?

384
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,720
Tell me.

385
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,480
I swear.

386
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,160
I'm doing this for our team.

387
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,320
The female lead of the team?

388
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,800
Think about it.

389
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,840
First of all, the design is really good.

390
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,120
And it's a joint venture between Li Sha and Qiang Qiang.

391
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:37,440
Okay.

392
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,040
Yes.

393
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,480
Then...

394
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,680
Then why did you tell that to Yi Hai?

395
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,280
I've discussed with Liu Da Wei.

396
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,040
As long as I pay the five-month deposit,

397
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:44,720
there's no problem.

398
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,760
And it's just a quarter of a month.

399
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,160
But that's not a small number.

400
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,840
So am I here to see you?

401
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,080
I'm really convinced of you.

402
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,000
Then you're not going to tell him this time?

403
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,120
Tell me.

404
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,480
I don't want to give him too much pressure.

405
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,120
I'm really convinced of you.

406
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,440
Then you promised me.

407
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,320
What did I promise?

408
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,000
Money.

409
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:14,680
I...

410
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,720
I really want those fans to see your face.

411
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,840
Don't worry.

412
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,520
Our future days will be better.

413
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,000
Go away.

414
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,640
I'm going to call my dad now.

415
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,160
What's Yang Xi busy with recently?

416
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,560
Did he encounter any trouble?

417
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,840
It was a bit troublesome at work a while ago.

418
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,400
But it's all solved now.

419
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,640
By the way,

420
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,480
did Xiao Rui bother you?

421
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,720
No.

422
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,200
It's really about work.

423
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,040
But he's really helped me a lot recently.

424
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,440
It's only been a few days.

425
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,080
You're just helping him?

426
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,440
No.

427
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,640
But I have good news.

428
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,480
My horse-horses series

429
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,840
is going to be released soon.

430
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,520
Really?

431
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,080
It's the design we saw at your place.

432
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,840
It's not a reformation.

433
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,000
It's very efficient.

434
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,520
I didn't expect it to be so successful so soon.

435
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,120
Come on.

436
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,840
Let's celebrate our Gu Nanxi.

437
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,840
Everything goes well.

438
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,720
Cheers.

439
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,480
It's great.

440
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,640
What's wrong, Keke?

441
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,040
Nothing.

442
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,240
Did Shiqi contact you recently?

443
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,960
You miss her?

444
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,800
You don't know me yet.

445
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,440
You're a girl.

446
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,600
Shiqi has been

447
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,160
disappearing lately.

448
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,880
I can't see her except for work.

449
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,560
And when she talks to me,

450
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,760
she's so beautiful.

451
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,680
She's so attractive.

452
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,240
How did Shiqi treat you?

453
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,080
Tell me.

454
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,520
I'll analyze it for you.

455
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,840
It's not about how she treats me.

456
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,000
It's about every word she tells me,

457
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,560
every expression, every action

458
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,560
will affect my mood.

459
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,800
Nanxi,

460
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,440
help me analyze it.

461
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,360
If Shiqi

462
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,600
doesn't like me,

463
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,360
she didn't deny her relationship with me before,

464
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,520
right?

465
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,960
If she likes me,

466
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,520
why is she so cold to me?

467
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,760
Keke,

468
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,240
don't think too much.

469
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,760
My brother is a good boy.

470
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,040
He's never

471
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,520
confessed his feelings to anyone

472
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,800
since he was a kid.

473
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,760
One more thing.

474
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,240
When we were in school,

475
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,320
a girl

476
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,320
gave him breakfast every morning.

477
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,320
Guess what?

478
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,600
She gave me breakfast.

479
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,880
That's right.

480
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,480
Do you remember it, Nanxi?

481
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,800
Yes, I do.

482
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,920
I didn't expect it to be so many years ago.

483
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,920
Shiqi

484
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,920
is still so stubborn.

485
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,920
Come on.

486
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,320
But

487
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,520
Shiqi has accepted my coffee.

488
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,320
He even had breakfast with me.

489
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,320
Right?

490
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,920
My brother is thoughtful.

491
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,920
Come on.

492
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,920
How about this?

493
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,520
We need to help Keke.

494
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,520
I'm counting on you two.

495
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,120
How about this?

496
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,320
How about this?

497
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,320
Tomorrow,

498
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,320
we'll ask her out for dinner.

499
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,920
When it's time,

500
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,720
Yufan and I will not go.

501
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,920
That's great.

502
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,920
Great.

503
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,920
Keke,

504
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,320
check what you want to eat.

505
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,120
I'll send Shiqi the address.

506
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:42,920
No.

507
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,320
I'm having dinner with Shiqi.

508
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,920
Why do I need to care about food?

509
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,520
Look.

510
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,320
Isn't it not good to do this?

511
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,720
It's not a trick.

512
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,520
What do you mean?

513
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,520
This is

514
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,520
my sister's trick.

515
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,520
Thanks to my assistants.

516
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,520
Thanks.

517
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,520
Oh my god.

518
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,920
I promised to lend you money.

519
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,120
Are you happy?

520
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,520
What do you know?

521
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,320
Tomorrow night,

522
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,920
I'll ask sister Nanxi out for dinner.

523
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,920
Great.

524
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:32,920
It seems that she is satisfied with the gemstone.

525
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,920
I thought she asked me out alone.

526
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,320
I didn't expect there would be someone else.

527
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,320
Who else?

528
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,720
My sister and Keke.

529
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,520
You're just being stubborn.

530
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,320
If it weren't for Keke's help,

531
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,520
maybe sister Nanxi

532
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,920
wouldn't have eaten with you.

533
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,320
Besides,

534
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,920
your sister is here.

535
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,120
Maybe your sister

536
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,320
supports you.

537
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,920
It makes sense.

538
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,920
It makes sense.

539
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,520
Okay.

540
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,720
You're so fierce.

541
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,920
Nanxi,

542
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,320
how's the preparation going?

543
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,920
Thanks to your help,

544
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,320
I should be able to complete the task in advance.

545
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,920
Lisa magazine has also finished it.

546
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,320
I'll leave it to you.

547
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,320
Finished?

548
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,120
I wanted to give you a surprise.

549
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,320
But I couldn't help it when I saw you.

550
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,320
What about the endorsement?

551
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,320
Don't worry.

552
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,320
Everything is going well.

553
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,720
Nanxi,

554
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,320
can we have dinner together tonight?

555
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,520
I have to work overtime.

556
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,920
You need to eat when you work overtime.

557
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,520
I'll take you to a very interesting restaurant.

558
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,720
The park we went to last time?

559
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,920
It's hard to say.

560
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,120
It depends on whether you want to go with me.

561
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,320
You said you were a little hungry.

562
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,920
Let's go.

563
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,320
Wait for me.

564
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,520
I'll arrange a job.

565
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,920
Nanxi,

566
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,520
I wish you a happy and happy life.

567
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,720
Try it.

568
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,320
I often come here. It tastes good.

569
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,320
It looks pretty good.

570
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,920
Nanxi,

571
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,320
after so many years,

572
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,520
have you been living well abroad?

573
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,520
It's good.

574
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,520
I've learned a lot of new ideas.

575
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,320
You know I want to ask you something.

576
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,320
It's not like this.

577
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,520
Sister,

578
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,720
you're so unreliable.

579
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,120
You just don't come.

580
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,120
You don't even come to Nanxi.

581
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,920
You always make me feel uncomfortable.

582
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,520
Okay, I'll stop talking.

583
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,520
I saw her.

584
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,920
Shiqi.

585
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,120
Let's go.

586
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,920
Shiqi, I've ordered some.

587
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,520
See if there's anything you want to eat.

588
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,120
That's enough, Keke.

589
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:35,720
Okay.

590
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,120
Please have these first.

591
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,920
Thank you.

592
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,320
Shiqi,

593
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,320
are you very busy recently?

594
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,320
Shi...

595
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,320
Are you satisfied with the Parla Bar?

596
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:54,920
Yes.

597
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,120
Thank you, Keke.

598
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,120
Don't mention it.

599
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,320
We're not that close.

600
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,520
Nanxi,

601
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,720
there's actually one thing.

602
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,720
I've been thinking about you.

603
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,920
That year, you had a car accident.

604
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,720
My father had a lot of money in addition to the bones.

605
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,320
You've been in a coma.

606
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,320
I didn't get your permission,

607
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,720
so I made fun of your design

608
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,920
and took part in the competition.

609
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,120
I paid you back.

610
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,720
It's been a long time.

611
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,520
There's nothing to be sorry about.

612
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,920
And the design

613
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,320
was originally completed by us.

614
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,120
But I'm still very grateful to you

615
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,920
for being honest with me today.

616
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,920
I was going to invite you,

617
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,720
but I've been too busy recently

618
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,520
and I don't have the time.

619
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,520
It's okay.

620
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,520
I'm happy to see you.

621
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,120
Keke,

622
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,920
I have something to tell you.

623
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,520
I also want to ask you something.

624
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,920
Go ahead.

625
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,720
You and Nanxi...

626
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,720
Nanxi and I...

627
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,720
Me, my sister,

628
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,520
and Nanxi,

629
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,520
we've known each other since childhood.

630
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,720
We haven't seen each other for five years.

631
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,320
Now she's in the jewelry design industry again.

632
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,720
Can we help each other?

633
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,320
That's great.

634
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,320
Let me tell you,

635
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,720
although I haven't been in touch with Nanxi for a long time,

636
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,320
I like her very much.

637
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,320
Nanxi,

638
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,920
everything I have now

639
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,720
is your contribution.

640
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,720
I risked my life

641
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,520
to protect everything

642
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,520
in order to find you.

643
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,320
You've been through a lot these years.

644
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,520
Don't remind me of my contribution.

645
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,920
It has nothing to do with me.

646
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,120
Then,

647
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,320
do I have a chance to chase you again?

648
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,120
Xiaorui,

649
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,320
so many things have happened between us.

650
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,320
You can't go back.

651
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,920
I'm sorry.

652
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,520
I'm sorry.

653
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,120
Do you like

654
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,120
Shi Qi now?

655
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,920
Shi Qi?

656
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,120
Why did you mention him?

657
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,320
He's my brother.

658
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,920
Why did you say that?

659
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,720
Well,

660
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,120
you haven't told me

661
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,120
how you got the endorsement.

662
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,320
It's a secret.

663
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,120
But I'll give you a surprise.

664
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,720
Just this one.

665
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,920
From now on,

666
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,920
I'll give you a surprise every day.

667
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,320
Nanxi,

668
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,920
trust me.

669
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,920
I did all this

670
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,920
for our future.

671
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:58,920
Shi Qi,

672
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,720
and about the company's compensation,

673
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,320
don't worry.

674
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,120
Leave it to me.

675
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,320
I'll tell my grandpa.

676
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,520
I won't let you compensate.

677
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,720
Coco,

678
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,720
work is work.

679
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,920
Business is business.

680
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,120
We have to do things according to the rules.

681
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,320
You've helped me enough.

682
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,720
You don't have to do this.

683
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,320
Shi Qi,

684
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,320
you know my feelings for you.

685
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,720
As long as it's something you decide,

686
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,120
I fully support you.

687
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,520
Thank you, Coco.

688
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:30,920
Coco,

689
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,120
actually, I...

690
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,520
I'm sorry, everyone.

691
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,720
Sorry to have disturbed you.

692
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:36,920
Today

693
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,520
was our last spring meeting.

694
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,720
I hope

695
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,520
you can see it.

696
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,520
Xiao Rui?

697
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,120
Nanxi,

698
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,520
do you remember this?

699
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,720
This is the photo

700
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,920
that we took

701
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,120
when we were in school.

702
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,720
This is the first jewelry I bought.

703
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,120
All these years,

704
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,520
I've never given it to you.

705
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,320
Today, I can finally give it to you.

706
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:19,920
Thank you.

707
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,920
It seems to be

708
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,520
Nanxi's boyfriend.

709
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,520
Let's go and see.

710
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,720
Nanxi.

711
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,520
Xiao Rui didn't let go of Nanxi.

712
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,720
He's so shameless.

713
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,720
I didn't expect to meet you here.

714
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,120
I didn't expect that Coco and Shi Qi

715
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,520
are also here.

716
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,320
Isn't this Qin Shi Qi?

717
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,120
Yes.

718
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:51,920
Isn't the girl next to her

719
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,520
the fake girlfriend, An Coco?

720
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,920
What fake girlfriend?

721
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,520
They're engaged, okay?

722
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,120
Oh my god.

723
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,320
How did all these things happen?

724
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,320
How did all these things happen?

725
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,320
Thank you for your concern

726
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,320
for me and Shi Qi.

727
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,120
I won't disturb you anymore.

728
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,520
I wish you a happy meal.

729
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,320
Nanxi.

730
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,720
Boyfriend.

731
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:26,920
Shi Qi.

732
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,320
Long time no see.

733
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,320
Long time no see, Mr. Xiao.

734
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,320
Let me introduce.

735
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,320
This is the CEO of Kaige Jewelry, Xiao Rui.

736
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,320
He's also my senior in college.

737
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,720
This is An Coco, a young designer.

738
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,320
Hello, Mr. Xiao.

739
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,320
Nice to meet you.

740
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,320
An Coco, a designer of Yi Hai Jewelry.

741
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,520
Hello, An Coco.

742
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:49,720
What a pity.

743
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,320
I thought you were

744
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,920
Nanxi's boyfriend.

745
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,720
Nanxi

746
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,520
always wants to get into work.

747
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,920
It's not worth it.

748
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,720
I wonder if she can see my heart.

749
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,720
It's okay if she can't see it.

750
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,920
Mr. Xiao, don't think you're the boss.

751
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,120
You and Shi Qi are the perfect couple.

752
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,320
I rarely watch entertainment news.

753
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:14,120
But I heard you're getting engaged.

754
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,120
Congratulations.

755
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,320
If there's really a day like this,

756
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,720
Shi Qi and I will invite you to come.

757
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,520
No problem.

758
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,120
Nanxi and I

759
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,320
will definitely come.

760
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,520
Mr. Xiao, Kaige Jewelry

761
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,720
has always been well-received in the industry.

762
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,720
I hope Yi Hai has the honor

763
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,720
to cooperate with you.

764
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:36,720
No problem.

765
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,920
We'll work together.

766
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,120
Nanxi,

767
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,920
I wish you and Mr. Xiao happiness.

768
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,520
You're so silly.

769
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,120
Shi Qi, come on.

770
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,520
Let's wish Nanxi happiness.

771
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,920
Jaergen

772
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,120
Nanxi

773
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,920
Gu Zihong

774
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,720
Song Jinzhen

775
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,320
I am a good man in this universe

776
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,800
It's the best hope in this world

777
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,800
Day and night, I miss you

778
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,800
Only because I always move forward

779
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,320
My world is because of you

780
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:15,320
The snow is slowly melting

781
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:19,320
Let the whole world have romance

782
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:23,320
And I am more greedy at this moment

783
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:27,320
Surrounding you

784
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,320
The world is brilliant

785
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,320
Beyond the vast universe

786
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:35,320
The calm sea of mountains and seas also raise waves

787
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,320
Day and night, I miss you

788
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,320
Only because I always move forward

789
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:43,320
My world is because of you

790
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:01,320
