1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
To love.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,160
Can't understand the separation with me

3
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,560
In my arms, who are you talking about

4
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,960
How to hide in my soft heart

5
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,360
I want to be closer to you, be your little star

6
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,720
I'm always around you, never leaving you

7
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,080
I want to be closer to you, protect your secret

8
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,680
I will keep looking for you

9
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,800
I'm waiting for you

10
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:12,200
I want to be closer to you, be your little star

11
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,600
I'm always around you, never leaving you

12
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,000
I want to be closer to you, protect your secret

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,560
I will keep looking for you

14
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:35,160
I will always be with you, protecting you

15
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,280
President Xiao

16
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,360
Is this the real reason you came to me?

17
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,840
Dan Xi, don't misunderstand

18
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,800
Although I do think that

19
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,760
Ma Tian Liang is in the temperament of Qin Shi Qi

20
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,200
But I never thought of

21
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,120
Let you go help me persuade him

22
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,640
Dan Xi

23
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,600
What you have to do now is to perfectly

24
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,560
Present the Ma Tian Liang series

25
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,920
I'll handle the company thing

26
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,400
And I promise you

27
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,240
Even if there is no Qin Shi Qi

28
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,240
There will be a more suitable solution

29
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,760
But didn't the editor-in-chief just say

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,840
He only wants Qin Shi Qi to be the spokesperson

31
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,720
To promise us to be the top version

32
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,760
That's because he doesn't have confidence in your work yet

33
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,480
You give him confidence

34
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,760
Who is the specific one

35
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,400
It's not that important

36
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,240
I believe you

37
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,960
You can do it

38
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,760
You can do it

39
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,760
Boss

40
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,080
You can do it

41
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,600
The beginning is not easy

42
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,520
Everyone should graduate from school

43
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,760
You've just been here for a few days.

44
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,000
And you're already talking about me?

45
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,880
So these excellent colleagues

46
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,160
are all from Design Studio Chen.

47
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,040
You're indeed a member of the meeting room.

48
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,120
How about this?

49
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,120
Let's not put our backs to each other.

50
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,720
You can ask them.

51
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,280
If they're willing,

52
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,040
I have no objection.

53
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,240
I...

54
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,880
I'm willing to work with you.

55
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,400
Mr. Gu,

56
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,080
I...

57
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,080
I...

58
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,800
Hello, everyone.

59
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,240
You're doing great.

60
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,840
You don't want to join Gu Nanxi's team, right?

61
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,720
Then you can pack up

62
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,760
and leave the company.

63
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,400
Xiao Geng,

64
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,440
this doesn't meet the rules.

65
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,600
You're going on purpose.

66
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,800
You're going to do what I say?

67
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,080
Martini is now

68
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,480
a major pillar of the company.

69
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,400
Everyone must cooperate.

70
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,840
What about you?

71
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,840
Chen Zhe,

72
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,160
I see you're taking these people

73
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,760
to your own studio.

74
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,760
Mr. Xiao, it's not like that.

75
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,960
Just now,

76
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,800
Designer Chen was discussing

77
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,920
the matchability of the staff with me.

78
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,120
Since Designer Gu said so,

79
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,120
I hope you can cooperate.

80
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,400
Show Martini

81
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,920
as soon as possible.

82
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,800
Gu Nanxi,

83
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,560
don't think you can say a few nice words for me.

84
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,520
I'll be grateful.

85
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,440
Mr. Chen,

86
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,080
I know you're a talent.

87
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,360
I'm sorry I didn't figure out

88
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,360
the staff's situation.

89
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,600
I called them all here.

90
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,720
I'll choose the other members of my team.

91
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,400
You can go back.

92
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,480
I'm sorry.

93
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,560
I didn't know what to do.

94
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,320
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,120
I'm sorry.

96
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,880
I'm sorry.

97
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,480
I'm sorry.

98
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,240
I'm sorry.

99
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:12,880
I'm sorry.

100
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,480
I'm sorry.

101
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,520
I'm sorry.

102
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,720
Great.

103
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,280
Thank you.

104
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,400
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

105
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:36,640
input

106
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,200
Hello.

107
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,040
Thank you.

108
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,440
Thank you.

109
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,240
Yifan.

110
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,600
Keke.

111
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,480
What a coincidence.

112
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,760
What are you going to do later?

113
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,080
It's a rare occasion.

114
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,600
She just got to work these days.

115
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,720
I'm worried about her.

116
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,320
Let's go and see her.

117
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,560
I envy your friendship.

118
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,960
Can I go with you?

119
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,920
I'm bored.

120
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,960
Of course.

121
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,520
Let's go.

122
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,720
Don't you need to tell her in person?

123
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,760
No.

124
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,120
Let's give her a surprise.

125
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,840
It's been a day.

126
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,400
The team hasn't left yet.

127
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,360
Hello.

128
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,240
Do you need to help your boyfriend choose the items?

129
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,000
No, I'll just pass by.

130
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,600
Do you have milk?

131
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,160
Yes.

132
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,480
I recommend this one.

133
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,600
Okay, thank you.

134
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,120
How can I eat takeout every day?

135
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,360
I have to make something good for Nanxi.

136
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,560
Shiqi?

137
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,960
Why are you here?

138
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,680
I...

139
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,120
I'm fine.

140
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,520
I'm sorry. I thought I was a thief.

141
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,200
I'm fine.

142
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,920
How did you get in?

143
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,840
You're still the same old habit.

144
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,560
The key is under the footrest.

145
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,440
It's very dangerous.

146
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,880
I'll help you take out the key.

147
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,440
Okay, go ahead.

148
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,160
I'll cook.

149
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,240
Wait.

150
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,360
Why are you in my house

151
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,360
and wearing...

152
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,080
Didn't we agree before?

153
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:31,920
What did you agree?

154
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,360
I live in your house.

155
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:35,880
No.

156
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,960
We agreed that

157
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,840
we should live in my house.

158
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,760
We didn't say...

159
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,080
Okay, go ahead.

160
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,160
I'll cook.

161
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,680
Nanxi, go ahead.

162
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,000
I didn't expect you to cook.

163
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,840
Try it.

164
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,720
Here.

165
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,800
Drink some.

166
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,480
Thank you.

167
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,240
Nanxi.

168
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,160
Is this for me?

169
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,120
I'm afraid that

170
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,120
I'll be late for work

171
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,560
and it's not convenient to go back.

172
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,000
And...

173
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:18,960
I see.

174
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,480
Your cooking is quite good.

175
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,200
It's okay if it's delicious.

176
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,600
You've helped me a lot recently.

177
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,640
I don't know how to thank you.

178
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,560
If you want to thank me,

179
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,160
you can...

180
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,640
Nanxi.

181
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,200
Who is it?

182
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,640
I don't know.

183
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,720
I'll open the door.

184
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,720
Yu Fan.

185
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,800
Is Nanxi not at home?

186
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,800
She's not at home.

187
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,800
She's not at home.

188
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,800
She's not at home.

189
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,800
She's not at home.

190
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,400
Is she not at home?

191
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,200
Impossible.

192
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,240
I was downstairs.

193
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,040
I saw the lights of her house.

194
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,520
Oh, no.

195
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,480
Oh, no.

196
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,440
Oh, no.

197
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,680
My sister and Ge Ge.

198
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,400
Then open the door.

199
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,720
No, no.

200
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,200
My sister wants to find me a water repair shop.

201
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,640
I didn't go.

202
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,480
If she knows I'm at home,

203
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,560
she'll beat me to death.

204
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,000
What should I do?

205
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Don't worry.

206
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,560
Fortunately, I put the key

207
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,600
in the drawer.

208
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,640
Now it's okay.

209
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,400
They can't come in.

210
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,000
What are you looking for?

211
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,240
Nanxi has grown up.

212
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,280
She put the key

213
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,680
under this carpet.

214
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,240
Why don't you hide it?

215
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:30,720
Okay.

216
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,400
Hurry up.

217
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,280
Okay, I'll hide it first.

218
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:32,760
Okay.

219
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,160
Nanxi.

220
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,040
Coming.

221
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,400
What are you doing?

222
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,680
Why are you so active?

223
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,480
I was taking a nap.

224
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,520
Why are you here so late?

225
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,520
So late?

226
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,320
Are you drunk?

227
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,800
It's not eight o'clock yet.

228
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,560
No, I'm too tired in the company today.

229
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,560
I just want to rest early.

230
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,840
Come to see me tomorrow.

231
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,000
Okay, Ge Ge.

232
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,720
Let's go.

233
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,160
Bye.

234
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,080
Gu Nanxi.

235
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,640
I've been thinking you're not right.

236
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,560
No, what's wrong?

237
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,120
How can you sleep so early?

238
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,840
I really want to sleep.

239
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,120
Hey.

240
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,480
What are you doing?

241
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,080
No.

242
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:27,960
That...

243
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,000
Nanxi.

244
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,360
Your design is so good.

245
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,120
This is a draft.

246
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,480
It needs to be completed.

247
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,480
You're so good.

248
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,240
Can you teach me?

249
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,360
Okay, let's find time

250
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,800
to communicate.

251
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,880
Great.

252
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,040
Gu Nanxi.

253
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,360
I still feel something is wrong.

254
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,680
Tell me honestly.

255
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,080
I'm so busy every day.

256
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,160
How can I have time to be wrong?

257
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,960
Okay, Yu Fan.

258
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,760
I think Nanxi is tired.

259
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,640
Let's let her rest today.

260
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,640
Come to see her tomorrow.

261
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,080
Be honest.

262
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,840
I'm watching you from time to time.

263
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,560
I'll knock on your door anytime.

264
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,360
Bye.

265
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,280
Okay.

266
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,880
I'm afraid he's not suspicious of the lights.

267
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,880
What are we doing?

268
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,880
Okay, Yifan. I'm going home.

269
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,880
I'll see you later.

270
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,880
Okay.

271
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,880
There must be something going on.

272
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,880
What is it?

273
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,880
You don't know about Nanxi.

274
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,880
I must find out about this.

275
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,880
I want to know who this man is.

276
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,880
Okay. I'm looking forward to your little gossip.

277
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,880
Okay, I'm going. See you tomorrow.

278
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,880
Bye.

279
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,880
You're...

280
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,880
Designers.

281
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,880
They were not sensible before.

282
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,880
Don't take it to heart.

283
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,880
Mr. Xiao was right yesterday.

284
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,880
We are all people in the company.

285
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,880
We should take the company's interests into account.

286
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,880
Chen Zhe's design was not well-preserved.

287
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,880
We were worried that

288
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,880
if he came to your place,

289
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,880
and you left,

290
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,880
we wouldn't be able to stay in the company.

291
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,880
I'm sorry.

292
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,880
I'm sorry.

293
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,880
I'm sorry.

294
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,880
I'm sorry.

295
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,880
I can't stay in the company anymore.

296
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,880
I understand.

297
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,880
Thank you for your trust.

298
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,880
Let's work hard together.

299
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,880
Thank you for not taking the lead.

300
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,880
We will do our best.

301
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,880
Just tell us what to do next.

302
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,880
By the way,

303
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,880
don't call me designer Gu.

304
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,880
Just call me Nanxi.

305
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,880
This is not appropriate.

306
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,880
We are a team.

307
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,880
Don't talk about rules.

308
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,880
Okay.

309
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,880
I won't be polite to you.

310
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,880
Time is running out.

311
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,880
I will arrange a task for you.

312
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,880
Okay.

313
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,880
Okay.

314
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,880
What are you doing here?

315
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,880
Nothing.

316
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,880
Let me remind you.

317
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,880
We are now

318
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,880
a team.

319
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,880
Either we work together,

320
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,880
or we work together.

321
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,880
Do you understand?

322
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,880
I know.

323
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,880
As long as we get the cover of Lisa magazine,

324
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,880
and sign Qin Shiqi as the representative,

325
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,880
my support in the board meeting

326
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,880
and the shares you have,

327
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,880
you can definitely take over the company.

328
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,880
I hope

329
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,880
everything goes as you wish.

330
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,880
Otherwise, you know I'm a man.

331
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,880
I can't bear to see you.

332
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,880
You don't have much time.

333
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,880
Keke.

334
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,880
Keke.

335
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,880
It's so quiet.

336
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,880
What are you doing?

337
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,880
You are like a wronged cat.

338
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,880
Grandpa criticized me again.

339
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,880
You can't do that.

340
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,880
Your new jewelry is so good.

341
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,880
What's the use of good?

342
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,880
I found it.

343
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,880
In his heart,

344
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,880
I'm always

345
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,880
so ignorant.

346
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,880
Don't think too much.

347
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,880
He is just a child.

348
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,880
Don't comfort me.

349
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,880
I'm used to it.

350
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,880
Tell me.

351
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,880
What's wrong?

352
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,880
I'll see if I can help you.

353
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,880
It's because of the magazine.

354
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,880
The new jewelry is selling well.

355
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,880
But Lisa magazine

356
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,880
still hasn't chosen to cooperate with us.

357
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,880
She put all the responsibility on me.

358
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,880
She said

359
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,880
the jewelry I designed was problematic.

360
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,880
I was wondering

361
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,880
why she didn't

362
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,880
find the reason on her own.

363
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,880
What she didn't like

364
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,880
was the brand Yihai Jewelry.

365
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,880
What does it have to do with me?

366
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,880
Don't say that.

367
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,880
Mr. An

368
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,880
is indeed a little strict with you.

369
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,880
But you can see

370
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,880
that he has high expectations for you.

371
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,880
I know Lisa.

372
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,880
The chief editor of her company, Leng Ran,

373
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,880
is extremely mysterious.

374
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,880
There is a rumor

375
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,880
that she is a pervert.

376
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,880
I think it's strong enough

377
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,880
to cooperate with her.

378
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,880
She is so difficult to deal with.

379
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,880
She doesn't want me to deal with her.

380
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,880
Old man.

381
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,880
Don't worry.

382
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,880
Let's figure it out together.

383
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,880
Yifan.

384
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,880
Yifan.

385
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,880
What is Shiqi doing now?

386
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,880
I haven't seen her for a long time.

387
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,880
If you don't mention her,

388
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,880
I almost forgot

389
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,880
that I have a good brother.

390
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,880
Since Nanxi left,

391
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,880
I haven't seen her

392
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,880
until now.

393
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,880
Okay.

394
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,880
Do you have something to do?

395
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,880
Let's go to Shiqi's company.

396
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,880
Let's go.

397
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,880
Let's go.

398
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,880
See Shiqi.

399
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,880
Happy?

400
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,880
In the end of the Ming Dynasty,

401
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,880
the company was also

402
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,880
attacked by the invaders of the Empire.

403
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:36,800
After the

404
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,880
Wait for me.

405
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,880
No.

406
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,880
Yan Yan, you are too careless.

407
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,880
If you have a job,

408
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,880
you should have informed me in advance.

409
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,880
Me?

410
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,880
Okay. My problem.

411
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,880
You go downstairs now.

412
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,880
Get on the car now.

413
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,880
Come here now.

414
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,880
Okay?

415
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,880
Boss, I'll deal with you first.

416
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,880
Hurry up.

417
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,880
Wait a minute.

418
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,880
It's a bit too late now.

419
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,880
What is too late?

420
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,880
I...

421
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,880
I'm not at home now.

422
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,880
Where are you?

423
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,880
I can't tell you

424
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,880
in a moment.

425
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,880
How about this?

426
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,880
I'll send you an address.

427
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,880
You let the driver pick me up.

428
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,880
I'll tell you in detail

429
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,880
when I meet you.

430
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,880
Okay?

431
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,880
I...

432
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,880
Are you...

433
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,880
I'm dating.

434
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,880
Okay.

435
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,880
Mr. Shao,

436
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,880
why are you here?

437
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,880
I just came here.

438
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,880
I'm so embarrassed to call you

439
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,880
when you're so serious.

440
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,880
Eat this for lunch.

441
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,880
Yes.

442
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,880
I don't have time to eat.

443
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,880
I need to be patient.

444
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,880
You're strong.

445
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,880
You're strong.

446
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,880
Let's go.

447
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,880
I'll take you to eat.

448
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,880
I'm not going.

449
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,880
I've already made an order.

450
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,880
I'm in a hurry.

451
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,880
You're not in a hurry.

452
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,880
Let's go.

453
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,880
Okay.

454
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,880
Two cups of mocha and two cups of Americano.

455
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,880
One less Americano.

456
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,880
One more cup of matcha latte.

457
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,880
One less sugar and one more cream.

458
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,880
Thank you.

459
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,880
Okay.

460
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,880
Wait a moment.

461
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,880
It's something

462
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,880
Qi can't drink

463
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,880
when he's on a diet.

464
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,880
He'll be unable to fall asleep soon.

465
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,880
I always buy it for him.

466
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,880
Keke,

467
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,880
you're so considerate.

468
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,880
No.

469
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,880
It's just that

470
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,880
when I was filming with him,

471
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,880
I knew his heart.

472
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,880
I knew that

473
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,880
he was so kind to me.

474
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,880
I was so kind to him.

475
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,880
I was so kind to him.

476
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,880
I was so kind to him.

477
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,880
I was so kind to him.

478
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,880
I just knew his habits.

479
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,880
If Qi was really with you,

480
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,880
it's really his fortune.

481
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,880
Yu Fan,

482
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,880
don't talk nonsense.

483
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,880
Hello, your coffee is ready.

484
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,880
Thank you.

485
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,880
Thank you.

486
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,880
Be careful. It's hot.

487
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,880
This is the good place you said.

488
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,880
What's wrong?

489
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,880
This is better than a high-end restaurant.

490
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,880
Blue sky, white clouds,

491
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,880
birds and flowers.

492
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,880
The most important thing

493
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,880
is to be close to the company.

494
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,880
That's right.

495
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,880
I'm working hard.

496
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,880
I'll sit out for a while

497
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,880
to change my mind

498
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,880
and breathe the fresh air.

499
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,880
It's good.

500
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,880
Danqi,

501
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,880
do you remember

502
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,880
when we were in school?

503
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,880
At that time,

504
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,880
we went to the park

505
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,880
every time we took a vacation.

506
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,880
What park was it?

507
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,880
Zhongxia Park.

508
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,880
Yes, Zhongxia Park.

509
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,880
Then,

510
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,880
I ate it all.

511
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,880
You made me

512
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,880
a heart-shaped lunch box.

513
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,880
It's a day.

514
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,880
Darling,

515
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,880
look.

516
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,880
It's great.

517
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,880
This is really

518
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,880
the most creative design

519
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,880
I've ever seen.

520
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,880
Really?

521
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,880
I feel like

522
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,880
there's something missing.

523
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,880
Wait for me.

524
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,880
I'll go and get it.

525
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,880
Okay.

526
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,880
I'll go and get it.

527
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,880
Look.

528
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,880
This is good.

529
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,880
After you changed it,

530
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,880
I feel like

531
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,880
there's a new layer of depth.

532
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,880
I believe

533
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,880
this work

534
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,880
will help us

535
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,880
to achieve success.

536
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,880
Why are you looking for me

537
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,880
to go back to the past?

538
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,880
Actually, for so many years,

539
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,880
I didn't know

540
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,880
what I was doing.

541
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,880
I didn't know

542
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,880
what I was working on.

543
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,880
I gave all my heart

544
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,880
to the company.

545
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,880
But in the end,

546
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,880
I found that

547
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,880
I didn't get

548
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,880
what I cherished the most.

549
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,880
Don't say that.

550
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,880
It's the past.

551
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,880
Nanxi,

552
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,880
losing you

553
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,880
has always been

554
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,880
a card in my heart.

555
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,880
I thought I had forgotten.

556
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,880
But after I met you again,

557
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,880
I found

558
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,880
you were always in my heart.

559
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,880
Nanxi,

560
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,880
I've been meaning to ask you for so many days.

561
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,880
Excuse me.

562
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,880
I have to answer the phone.

563
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,880
I have something to do at the company.

564
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,880
I'll go back first.

565
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,880
Tong Jun!

566
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,880
Lower your voice.

567
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,880
Qin Shiqing,

568
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,880
you're getting too close.

569
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,880
What if

570
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,880
you get caught?

571
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,880
Do you know how serious the consequences are?

572
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,880
Who else knows about this?

573
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,880
Only three people know about this.

574
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,880
If there are other people

575
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,880
who know about it,

576
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,880
it's you.

577
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,880
I'm a big mouth.

578
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,880
I'll tell you everything.

579
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,880
I'm so pissed off.

580
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,880
If you let

581
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,880
Liu Dawei know about this,

582
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,880
what will you do?

583
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,880
I can't eat it.

584
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,880
I have to eat it.

585
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,880
I have to eat it.

586
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,880
Oh my god.

587
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,880
Why am I so unlucky?

588
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,880
Why am I so unlucky?

589
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,880
I wanted to

590
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,880
chase a star alone.

591
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,880
The company had to arrange it for me.

592
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,880
You're so annoying.

593
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,880
Enough.

594
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,880
Who's not annoying you again?

595
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,880
Qi Yan.

596
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,880
Qi Yan.

597
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,880
You brat.

598
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,880
Did you get into trouble again?

599
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,880
I didn't.

600
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,880
Shiqi,

601
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,880
this is the coffee I brought you.

602
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,880
Thank you, Keke.

603
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,880
What about mine?

604
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,880
The Americano is yours.

605
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,880
Americano again?

606
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,880
You're satisfied.

607
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,880
Drink it or not?

608
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,880
Drink it.

609
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,880
It's better than the strawberry.

610
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,880
Shiqi,

611
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,880
do you have any plans tonight?

612
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,880
Let's go to dinner together.

613
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,880
You guys go.

614
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,880
I have work tonight.

615
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,880
No, we won't.

616
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,880
I want to ask Nanxi

617
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,880
if she has time.

618
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,880
We're having dinner together today.

619
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,880
I won't take them.

620
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,880
Sister,

621
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,880
here's the thing.

622
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,880
I haven't

623
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,880
had dinner with you for a long time.

624
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,880
Let's have dinner together tonight.

625
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,880
Okay, Shiqi.

626
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,880
Shiqi,

627
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,880
I'll book a table for you.

628
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,880
Then we'll meet and part.

629
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,880
What meeting and parting?

630
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,880
What's the matter with you?

631
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,880
I'm not the one.

632
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,880
You should ask.

633
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,880
Sister,

634
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,880
I haven't had dinner with Yan Yan

635
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,880
for a long time.

636
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,880
I've asked her to come.

637
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,880
It seems that you're the one

638
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,880
who doesn't usually call her.

639
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,880
I've booked the table.

640
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,880
7.30 p.m.

641
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,880
I'll send you the table

642
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,880
when I get there.

643
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,880
Keke and I will go to Nanxi.

644
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,880
See you tonight.

645
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,880
Let's go, Keke.

646
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,880
Sister.

647
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,880
We'll be working later.

648
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,880
It's close to Nanxi's company.

649
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,880
I'll pick up Nanxi.

650
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,880
I don't need to bother you.

651
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,880
You have this job?

652
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,880
Why don't I remember?

653
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,880
It's such an important job.

654
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,880
Why don't you remember?

655
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,880
You do have this job.

656
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,880
I almost forgot.

657
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,880
See you tonight.

658
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,880
Bye, sister.

659
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,880
Shiqi, bye.

660
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,880
See you tonight.

661
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,880
Bye.

662
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,880
Why are you in a hurry?

663
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,880
I'm not having a meeting.

664
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,880
Love adviser.

665
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,880
Love father.

666
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,880
Go and pack up.

667
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,880
It's very good.

668
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,880
Nanxi,

669
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,880
I believe you.

670
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,880
You can do it.

671
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,880
It's all the team's contribution.

672
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,880
You haven't had lunch yet.

673
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,880
I booked a restaurant

674
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,880
for you tonight.

675
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,880
Let's go together.

676
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,880
I made an appointment with a friend

677
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,880
at Huaihai Road.

678
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,880
Friend?

679
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,880
I'm about to make friends with him.

680
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,880
Qin Yu Fan.

681
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,880
You know him.

682
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,880
Oh, Yu Fan.

683
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,880
I haven't seen him

684
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,880
for a long time.

685
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,880
He's in the middle of the road.

686
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,880
Let me send you there.

687
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,880
We can talk about

688
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,880
the new season of the new season in the car.

689
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,880
Okay.

690
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,880
Let's go.

691
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,880
Oh,

692
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,880
it's so hot.

693
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,880
Don't be anxious.

694
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,880
If you're anxious,

695
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,880
it'll make us look unkind.

696
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,880
Do you understand?

697
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,880
Yes.

698
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,880
He'll be off work later.

699
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,880
What if you don't pick him up?

700
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,880
How is that possible?

701
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,880
Look.

702
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,880
Isn't she your goddess?

703
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,880
Oh,

704
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,880
I think you're a little bit suspicious.

705
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,880
I'm sorry.

706
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,880
I should have waited for you

707
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,880
after I got into the car.

708
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,880
Nanxi.

709
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,880
I'm sorry

710
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,880
about what happened this noon.

711
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,880
Oh.

712
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,880
In fact,

713
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,880
I've never

714
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,880
changed my feelings for you.

715
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,880
Every time I'm tired,

716
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,880
I feel bad.

717
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,880
You're the only motivation

718
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,880
that drives me to keep working hard.

719
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,880
I've already told you

720
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,880
not to talk about it.

721
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,880
I think the old heaven

722
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,880
wants us to meet again.

723
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,880
Not just to work together.

724
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,880
This is my only chance.

725
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,880
I'll help you out.

726
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,880
I'll keep chasing after you.

727
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,880
I don't want to think about it now.

728
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,880
I just want to work hard.

729
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,880
I wasn't able to

730
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,880
protect you before.

731
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,880
But it's different now.

732
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,880
I don't want to lose you again.

733
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,880
Please stop

734
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,880
in front of me.

735
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,880
I want to walk by myself.

736
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,880
Nanxi.

737
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,880
Please stop the car.

738
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,880
Nanxi.

739
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,880
Nanxi.

740
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,880
Where's Shiqi?

741
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,880
Shiqi?

742
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,880
Didn't Shiqi say

743
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,880
he wanted to pick you up?

744
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,880
Really? I don't know.

745
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,880
I didn't see him

746
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,880
at the door of my company.

747
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,880
He's so unreliable.

748
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,880
Oh, no.

749
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,880
He sent me a message this afternoon.

750
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,880
But I'm too busy with work.

751
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,880
I didn't see him.

752
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,880
I'm sorry.

753
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,880
I'm sorry.

754
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,880
I'm sorry.

755
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,880
I'm sorry.

756
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,880
I'm sorry.

757
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,880
I'm sorry.

758
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,880
I'm too busy. I didn't see him.

759
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,880
I'll call him.

760
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,880
I'm so upset.

761
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,880
I didn't get through

762
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,880
his phone call.

763
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,880
Is Shiqi angry with me?

764
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,880
I'll call him.

765
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,880
Nanxi.

766
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,880
He's not that narrow-minded.

767
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,880
I'm so angry.

768
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,880
Hello.

769
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,880
Can I order now?

770
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,880
Wait a minute.

771
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,880
There's another person who hasn't come.

772
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,880
Keke.

773
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,880
Don't wait.

774
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,880
What time is it?

775
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,880
Look.

776
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,880
He's not coming again.

777
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,880
I don't know where he went.

778
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,880
Waiter.

779
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,880
Serve the dishes.

780
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,880
Okay.

781
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,880
Nanxi.

782
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,880
Don't bother him.

783
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,880
Okay.

784
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,880
Why don't you get off the bus?

785
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,880
It's been more than half an hour.

786
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,880
Or they'll be done eating.

787
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,880
Let's go.

788
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,880
Okay.

789
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,880
I'll take you to a place.

790
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,880
Where?

791
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,880
You'll know when you get there.

792
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,880
Let's go.

793
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,880
Come on.

794
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,880
Let's drink.

795
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,880
Cheers.

796
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,880
Cheers.

797
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,880
Nanxi.

798
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,880
How was your first day at work?

799
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,880
Are you still used to it?

800
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,880
It's okay.

801
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,880
Take your time.

802
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,880
It's only been two days.

803
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,880
It'll be fine.

804
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,880
Nanxi.

805
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,880
When you get used to it,

806
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,880
you'll get used to it.

807
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,880
Keke.

808
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,880
What's your new idea

809
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,880
about Leng Ran?

810
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,880
I don't know.

811
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,880
I'm not sure.

812
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,880
Leng Ran?

813
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,880
Our company has always wanted to work with Lisa.

814
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,880
We've talked to her several times.

815
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,880
She's been rejected.

816
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,880
The boss even put the blame on Keke.

817
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,880
In my opinion,

818
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,880
Lisa's Leng Ran is a pervert.

819
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,880
And she's a pervert with a weight of 200 jin.

820
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,880
200 jin?

821
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,880
Who are you talking to?

822
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,880
Nanxi.

823
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,880
You don't know her.

824
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,880
Leng Ran has a nickname.

825
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,880
It's called...

826
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,880
I remember now.

827
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,880
It's called Big Magic King.

828
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,880
Think about it.

829
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,880
What would people call him

830
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,880
if he's that nickname?

831
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,880
I met him a few days ago.

832
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,880
It's not like what you said.

833
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,880
A few days ago?

834
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,880
I saw him.

835
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,880
Do you have his photo?

836
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,880
Take a look.

837
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,880
Let me see.

838
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,880
I added his WeChat account.

839
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,880
Not a single one.

840
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,880
He's ugly and unbearable.

841
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,880
He's definitely not as good as Xu Qi.

842
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,880
He can't be on stage.

843
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,880
How about this?

844
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,880
I'll think of a way

845
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,880
to help you contact him.

846
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,880
Nanxi, thank you.

847
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,880
Nanxi, it's you again.

848
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,880
Fine.

849
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,880
Why did you bring me to the clothing store?

850
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,880
Come with me.

851
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,880
The wind is caressing the night.

852
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,880
Listening to your complaints.

853
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,880
Kissing the ancient valley.

854
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,880
The gentle hand is cold.

855
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,880
The fireworks are in full bloom.

856
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,880
The light is gone.

857
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,880
The youth is missing.

858
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,880
How soft your heart is.

859
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,880
You are the most brilliant in the world.

860
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,880
You are the best in the universe.

861
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,880
The calm deep sea is also a wave.

862
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,880
You are like a heart.

863
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,880
Let the rain and fog dissipate.

864
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,880
I don't want time to protect the blood.

865
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,880
You are the most brilliant in the world.

866
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,880
You are the best in the universe.

867
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,880
You are the best in the world.

868
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,880
The day and night are missing.

869
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,880
Only because I walk forward.

870
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,880
My world is because of you.

871
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,880
The blood is full of stars and lights.

872
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,880
Let the whole world have romance.

873
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,880
And I'm more greedy now.

874
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,880
Surrounding you.

875
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,880
You are the most brilliant in the world.

876
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,880
You are the best in the universe.

877
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,880
The calm deep sea is also a wave.

878
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,880
The day and night are missing.

879
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,880
Only because I walk forward.

880
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,880
My world is because of you.

881
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,880
The warmth.
