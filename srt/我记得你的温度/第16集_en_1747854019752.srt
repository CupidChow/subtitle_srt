1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,440
You don't understand the separation with me

2
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,800
In my arms, who are you talking to?

3
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,200
How come you're hiding in my soft heart?

4
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,600
I want to get closer to you, be your little star

5
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,960
I can't ever leave you when you're around me

6
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,360
I want to get closer to you, protect your secret

7
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,920
I will keep looking for you

8
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,320
I'll be with you for the rest of my life

9
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:09,520
I want to get closer to you, be your little star

10
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,920
I can't ever leave you when you're around me

11
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,320
I want to get closer to you, protect your secret

12
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,520
I will keep looking for you

13
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:27,920
I will be with you for the rest of my life

14
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,520
I will keep looking for you

15
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,520
I will protect you

16
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,520
The Long Ballad

17
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,520
Episode 18

18
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,520
She isn't as fragile as you think.

19
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,520
Besides, I think Nanxin is fine.

20
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,520
Feelings?

21
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,520
Your feelings?

22
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,520
What feelings?

23
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,520
What feelings do you have?

24
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,520
I... I just appreciate it.

25
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,520
Appreciate? What do you appreciate?

26
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,520
She's quite strong, quite capable.

27
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,520
You mean I'm not strong, I'm not capable?

28
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,520
I didn't mean that. That's not what I meant.

29
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,520
Then what do you mean?

30
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:27,520
Yufan, I know we all have our own goals.

31
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,520
Who asked us to suddenly stay at home?

32
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,520
What do you mean? I stay at home every day?

33
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,520
You mean I'm unemployed, I don't have a job, I love you every day?

34
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,520
That's not what I meant.

35
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,520
Then what do you mean?

36
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,520
Yufan.

37
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,520
You're not married yet.

38
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,520
If you get married, you'll lose me every day.

39
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,520
You can't compare me to others every day.

40
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,520
Yufan, I mean I was wrong.

41
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,520
What did you do wrong?

42
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,520
I was wrong.

43
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,520
You were wrong? Is this a wrong attitude?

44
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,520
I know you're in a bad mood.

45
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,520
Bad mood? I can see it clearly now.

46
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,520
You think we've been together for a long time.

47
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,520
You think I'm annoying?

48
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:23,520
Yufan, don't be angry. I was wrong.

49
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,520
Yufan, I was wrong.

50
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,520
Yufan, I was really wrong.

51
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,520
Don't tell me that. Where's the thing?

52
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,520
I came out to find you.

53
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,520
Why are you looking at me?

54
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,520
I'll be right back.

55
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,520
When you go get it, the flowers and vegetables will be cold.

56
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,520
What's the use of asking you?

57
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,520
Yufan.

58
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,520
Yufan.

59
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,520
Come in.

60
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,520
What's wrong?

61
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,520
I think I made her angry.

62
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,520
I'll talk to her.

63
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,520
What's wrong with your expression?

64
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,520
Nothing.

65
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,520
I just recognized someone's face.

66
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,520
Let me open it.

67
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,520
Shiqi.

68
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,520
Brother-in-law.

69
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,520
Shiqi, you're here.

70
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,520
Go out with your brother-in-law to buy something.

71
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,520
Okay.

72
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,520
Go.

73
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,520
Let's go.

74
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,520
Tell me. What's wrong?

75
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,520
Nanxi, I'm telling you.

76
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,520
I'm telling you.

77
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,520
A man is not the last way out.

78
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,520
Once he gets it, he doesn't know how to cherish it.

79
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,520
Don't make such a conclusion.

80
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,520
Tell me what happened.

81
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,520
You think I'm not making money?

82
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,520
Leng Ran?

83
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,520
No way.

84
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,520
Why not?

85
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,520
You don't believe me?

86
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,520
I don't believe you.

87
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,520
What did he say?

88
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,520
Don't ask.

89
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,520
I'm so annoyed.

90
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,520
Okay, let's not talk about this.

91
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,520
When we eat later,

92
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,520
I have something important to tell you.

93
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,520
You need to adjust your mood.

94
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,520
What is it?

95
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,520
Brother-in-law, why are you so angry?

96
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,520
Brother-in-law.

97
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,520
Tell me. I'll analyze it for you.

98
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,520
Why are you so shy?

99
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,520
We're all friends.

100
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,520
I'm not shy.

101
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,520
I don't know.

102
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,520
What do you mean by that?

103
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,520
I don't know what made your sister upset.

104
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,520
She's just angry.

105
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,520
Brother-in-law, I really understand you.

106
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,520
It's really hard for you to be with him.

107
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,520
Enough. Don't use me as an excuse.

108
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,520
Let's go back and buy something.

109
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,520
Let's go.

110
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,520
I'll make a suggestion.

111
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,520
I want to announce a good news after this.

112
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,520
Okay.

113
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,520
Come on.

114
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,520
Yu Fan, give me a face.

115
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,520
Why don't you say it first?

116
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,520
Yu Fan, I'm sorry.

117
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,520
I was wrong.

118
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,520
Let's go home and talk.

119
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,520
Can you say something else?

120
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,520
I always say you're wrong.

121
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,520
Do you know what you're wrong?

122
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,520
I'm wrong.

123
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,520
Forget it.

124
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,520
I'll say it first.

125
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,520
I decided to start a business.

126
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,520
You start a business?

127
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,520
What business?

128
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,520
Of course, I'm still making jewelry.

129
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,520
I'm going to make jewelry.

130
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,520
I'm going to make jewelry.

131
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,520
What's your plan?

132
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,520
I've already made a series of plans.

133
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,520
I'll start to look for two more people.

134
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,520
As a senior,

135
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,520
I'm your college close friend.

136
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,520
I support you.

137
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,520
You mean...

138
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,520
I'll join.

139
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,520
I'm afraid I can't be a good person.

140
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,520
I'm afraid I can't be a good person.

141
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,520
I'm afraid I can't be a good person.

142
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,520
I'm afraid I can't be a good person.

143
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,520
I'm afraid I can't be a good person.

144
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,520
Okay, welcome.

145
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,520
Brother, you're not right.

146
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,520
I heard such a bad news.

147
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,520
It's so quiet.

148
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,520
It's not like your character.

149
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,520
I heard this news.

150
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,520
I don't know what to say.

151
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,520
I didn't react.

152
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,520
Really?

153
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,520
You must have something in your heart.

154
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,520
I'm not.

155
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,520
I'm happy for Nanxi.

156
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,520
Let's have a toast.

157
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,520
Let's celebrate.

158
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,520
Celebrate.

159
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,520
Come on.

160
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,520
Celebrate me.

161
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,520
Come on.

162
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,520
Celebrate our career.

163
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,520
Good luck.

164
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,520
What are you doing?

165
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,520
You're not in the mood.

166
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,520
Go to sleep.

167
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,520
No.

168
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,520
I'm not.

169
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,520
I'm not.

170
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,520
Don't you feel that I'm not in the mood?

171
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,520
I'm not.

172
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,520
I'm not.

173
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,520
I'm not.

174
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,520
I'm not.

175
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,520
I'm not.

176
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,520
I'm not.

177
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,520
I'm not.

178
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,960
It's not a way to fight.

179
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,360
That's what I said.

180
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,360
But they are both virgin girls.

181
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,520
They deserve to be respected.

182
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,320
Didn't you make up with me last time?

183
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,520
You know my sister's character.

184
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,200
I feel worried when I think of her.

185
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,960
What's wrong with your sister's character?

186
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,800
She doesn't have a sense of security.

187
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,160
Leng Ran is the chief editor.

188
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,160
She lost her job now.

189
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,080
She's not confident.

190
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,080
Leng Ran is also

191
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,680
a man who can't coax.

192
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,320
You really embarrassed my brother-in-law.

193
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,160
Okay, go and do it.

194
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,800
Yes, madam.

195
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,160
Mr. Xia.

196
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,080
You've worked hard before.

197
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,240
Since I took over the company,

198
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,680
I haven't had a break.

199
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,680
If I hadn't been the president,

200
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,880
I wouldn't have known

201
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,440
that you worked so hard before.

202
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,720
Look at what you said.

203
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,400
No matter how much I've done,

204
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,160
it's for our future.

205
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,360
By the way, dear.

206
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,640
I want to discuss something with you.

207
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:07,880
What's up?

208
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,640
Since the company was closed,

209
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,120
we haven't cooperated

210
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,720
with Li Sha anymore.

211
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,400
If that's the case,

212
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,880
then our contract with Qin Shiqi

213
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,440
is not very high.

214
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,840
Although Qin Shiqi is our spokesperson,

215
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,320
he doesn't have a share in the company.

216
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,480
It's a bit disappointing.

217
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,680
What do you think?

218
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,240
I think

219
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,160
you should go to Leng Ran.

220
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I understand.

221
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:33,960
Don't worry.

222
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,160
Shiqi.

223
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,680
You don't feel comfortable in this sleepwear, do you?

224
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,600
It's okay. I'm used to it.

225
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,560
I'll buy you two pajamas later.

226
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,360
Okay. I want to buy a couple.

227
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,760
Why?

228
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,640
Just buy two at home.

229
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,640
I can't wear couple clothes outside.

230
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,680
I can't wear it at home.

231
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,840
No. I want to buy a couple.

232
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,080
Okay. I'll buy a couple.

233
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,440
It's late. I'm going to bed.

234
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,760
Okay.

235
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,240
Good night, Sister Nanxi.

236
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,720
Do you feel uncomfortable

237
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,520
sleeping on the sofa every day?

238
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,160
Do you want to come in and sleep?

239
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,560
Indeed.

240
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,360
My back hurts every day.

241
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,520
Then I...

242
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,440
I'll go in and sleep.

243
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,760
Sister Nanxi.

244
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,400
Nanxi.

245
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,680
Are you ready?

246
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,880
I'm very satisfied

247
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,720
with your sleepwear.

248
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,040
If you're not ready,

249
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,560
we'll wait for you.

250
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,720
I...

251
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,080
Doesn't this pair look nice?

252
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,040
It's my everyday puff bag.

253
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,500
What did you think about Tao дваo?

254
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,800

259
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:41,540
Actually it's not

260
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,260

00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,660

to buy something.

268
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,680
What?

269
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,520
Some daily necessities.

270
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,480
I can't live here

271
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,760
with nothing.

272
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,160
I'll go with you after work.

273
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,040
It's okay.

274
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:08,920
You can go ahead.

275
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,840
I'll go to the studio.

276
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,720
I'll meet your sister.

277
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,000
Okay.

278
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,680
Hello.

279
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,480
Hello, sir.

280
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,240
Is there a couple in this one?

281
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,240
No.

282
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,160
How about this one?

283
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,280
This one is for a couple.

284
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,080
Let me see.

285
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,440
This one is good.

286
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,880
Help me wrap it up.

287
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,600
Okay.

288
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,480
How much is your lover's share?

289
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,520
It's not a big deal.

290
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,560
It's a small one.

291
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,520
It's not a big deal.

292
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,320
It's a small one.

293
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,280
It's a small one.

294
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,240
It's a small one.

295
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,120
It's a small one.

296
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:56,920
It's a small one.

297
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,200
What's the size of your mouth?

298
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,280
It's the smallest.

299
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,240
Okay.

300
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,280
It seems that your lover

301
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,240
has a great body.

302
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,080
Let's go.

303
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,160
Come in.

304
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,520
Nanxi.

305
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,720
It's great.

306
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,160
Come upstairs.

307
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,040
It's even better.

308
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,360
It's not bad.

309
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,000
It's not bad, Nanxi.

310
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,400
You've been packing it up little by little.

311
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,440
Yes.

312
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,280
I didn't expect that

313
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,240
I'm not here.

314
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,440
It's very efficient.

315
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,400
That's not true.

316
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,200
I'm so tired.

317
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,320
Is it good?

318
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,160
It's pretty good.

319
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:45,960
Hello.

320
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,520
Now?

321
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,560
Okay.

322
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,520
I'm going to the game.

323
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,040
I'm going to the game.

324
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,520
I've been busy lately.

325
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,320
I'm going out.

326
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,600
Go ahead.

327
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,880
What about you?

328
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,480
What about me?

329
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,920
You want to drive me away so soon?

330
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,840
This is my studio.

331
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,360
Yes.

332
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,120
I thought about it.

333
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,000
You're right.

334
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,920
I'll go to find Leng Ran later.

335
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,120
Give him a step.

336
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,200
I'm leaving.

337
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,000
You stay here.

338
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,640
Go ahead.

339
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,760
I'll visit him again.

340
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,720
Shiqi.

341
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,560
What are you doing here?

342
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:04,760
Come here.

343
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,600
What do you mean?

344
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,720
Are you leaving?

345
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,800
I'm going to a new drama soon.

346
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,160
I need to train myself.

347
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,360
I'm going to the theater.

348
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,560
I'm going to the theater.

349
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,760
I'm going to the theater.

350
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,960
I'm going to the theater.

351
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,080
I'm going to the theater.

352
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,200
I'm going to the theater.

353
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,400
I need to train myself.

354
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,560
You're going to the theater?

355
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,000
Just move there.

356
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,840
No way.

357
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,520
I don't want to leave you.

358
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,400
Cut the crap.

359
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,440
What are you doing here?

360
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,600
I'm going to the studio

361
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,200
of the two men's heart.

362
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,720
I happen to have something in there.

363
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,920
I want to take it.

364
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,960
Come with me.

365
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,680
No.

366
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,640
No need.

367
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,000
I just thought of something.

368
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,960
I'm leaving.

369
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,120
You're going to the studio so soon?

370
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,960
Hello, Xiaorui.

371
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,560
I have an idea.

372
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,440
I'm going to rent out his studio.

373
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,080
You're so stupid.

374
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,640
Even if you rent out his studio,

375
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,520
it's expensive.

376
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,040
He can change it.

377
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,040
You might as well

378
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,400
cut off all his

379
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,600
jewelry.

380
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,440
That's it.

381
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,400
Don't bother.

382
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,200
Crazy woman.

383
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,960
Just let her go.

384
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,400
She wants to put me in first.

385
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,080
I'm leaving.

386
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,960
Hello, Shiqi.

387
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,760
Nanxi.

388
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,360
Is my sister with you?

389
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,480
Yufan?

390
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,440
No.

391
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,120
That's good.

392
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,000
You don't even know

393
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,680
I almost got the wrong message.

394
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,200
I was looking for you

395
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,640
and ran into my sister.

396
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,240
My gosh, that's too sudden.

397
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,000
You should've told me in advance.

398
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,640
I see.

399
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:26,760
Why did you buy so many

400
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,200
household items?

401
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,400
I told you

402
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,080
this morning.

403
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,920
You bought too many.

404
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,520
All right, don't worry.

405
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,040
As long as my sister doesn't know,

406
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,040
I'll take care of the rest.

407
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,680
All right.

408
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,520
I'll work hard.

409
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,880
See you at home tonight.

410
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,920
See you.

411
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,040
No.

412
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,480
It's definitely not right.

413
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,680
What's wrong?

414
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,680
During this period,

415
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,680
Qin Shiqi must have been hiding something from me.

416
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,480
Don't worry about it.

417
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,680
She's an adult.

418
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,680
She has the ability to judge for herself.

419
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,680
I'm just curious.

420
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,080
What's going on?

421
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,240
Leng Ran,

422
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,520
aren't you curious?

423
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,640
I'm not.

424
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,080
I'm just curious.

425
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,080
What's going on?

426
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,280
What's going on?

427
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,480
I'm just curious.

428
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,680
What's going on?

429
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,880
I'm just curious.

430
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,520
I guess we need to talk for a bit.

431
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,120
I'mASTAL.

432
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,280
What's going on?

433
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,120
Are you allowing me to hear this all morning?

434
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,400
How do you know?

435
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,960
He's அtheama,

436
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,360
Right now.

437
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:52,520
Okay.

438
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,600
Go ahead.

439
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,320
What do you want to talk about?

440
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,080
I think there's something wrong with our relationship.

441
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:57,720
No.

442
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,000
And it's a big problem.

443
00:20:59,080 --> 00:20:59,880
Not at all.

444
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,480
Since I lost my job,

445
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:02,960
look at you.

446
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,640
Have you ever seen me in the open?

447
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:05,720
Yu Fen.

448
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,720
It's not like that.

449
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,280
It's not what you think.

450
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,560
Whose phone are you going to answer behind my back?

451
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,480
The work channel.

452
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,400
Leng Ran.

453
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,600
Go.

454
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,040
Hello?

455
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:31,920
Hello?

456
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:32,560
Hello.

457
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,920
The gemstone I told you about last time,

458
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,040
do you have it now?

459
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,360
Sorry.

460
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,000
The gemstone you want is out of stock.

461
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,920
What about the other similar colors?

462
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,720
The other ones are out of stock, too.

463
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,000
Why is it gone?

464
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:53,960
Lan Xi.

465
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,760
Shu Qi.

466
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,080
Didn't we say we'd meet at home?

467
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,000
Why are you here?

468
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,560
I can't wait.

469
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,040
I'm going to pick up my goddess to get off work.

470
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,680
I'm afraid I'll run into Yu Fen.

471
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,840
Don't worry.

472
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,040
I've checked.

473
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,880
She's at home with Leng Ran.

474
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,560
She won't be here.

475
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,680
Really?

476
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,880
I'm going to pick her up.

477
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,360
You're so bad.

478
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,320
I'll get you a bag.

479
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,440
Let's go.

480
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,240
Hurry up.

481
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,280
I didn't expect to start a business so troublesome.

482
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,360
I have to run around and register a company.

483
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,560
I have to find an office.

484
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,000
I have to buy equipment,

485
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,040
contact the manufacturer,

486
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,160
and contact the channel.

487
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,440
Although it's a little bit not smooth,

488
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,400
but you're by my side.

489
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,360
I think everything is fine.

490
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,360
Okay.

491
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,520
How is it?

492
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,160
Isn't it pretty?

493
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,800
Put it on and let's take a picture together.

494
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,320
What should I wear now?

495
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,800
I'll wear it and come back later.

496
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,160
How could she come as she wishes?

497
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,120
Nan Xi.

498
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,520
I'm Yu Fen.

499
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,200
Coming.

500
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,520
Open the door.

501
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,640
Why are you here so late?

502
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,040
You're here so late.

503
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:31,920
What's the matter?

504
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,040
I'm so angry.

505
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,880
I'll tell you when I get in.

506
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,600
Wait a minute.

507
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,560
I'm going for a walk.

508
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,160
I'll walk with you.

509
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,600
Wait for me.

510
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,080
Come on.

511
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,120
Let's go.

512
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,320
I'm so angry.

513
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,840
What's wrong this time?

514
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,920
I think Leng Nan has changed.

515
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,440
I'll tell you.

516
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,280
She actually called me behind my back today.

517
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:05,880
What's that?

518
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,520
That's not normal.

519
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,080
I think she's having an affair.

520
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,480
What?

521
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,760
You're so sensitive.

522
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,200
I think I'm not working.

523
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,960
She thinks I'm annoying.

524
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,760
Nan Xi.

525
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,880
We must have a good time in the studio.

526
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,160
Maybe she won't be here.

527
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,680
You're being stubborn.

528
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,520
But we must have a good time in the studio.

529
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,800
Where are you going?

530
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,480
I'll send you back.

531
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,640
I'm going to the studio.

532
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,680
I'm going to the studio.

533
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:37,920
I'll send you home.

534
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,280
I'm not going back.

535
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,680
I'll live here with you today.

536
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,360
No.

537
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,800
Why not?

538
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,080
I'm out.

539
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,280
You're having an affair with Leng Ran.

540
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,960
What you need most is communication.

541
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,280
You live here.

542
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,320
Can't you communicate with him?

543
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,000
I can't communicate with him when I go back.

544
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,920
We're not on the same channel.

545
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,200
What's wrong, Gu Nan Xi?

546
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,560
Is it so hard for me to go to your house?

547
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,120
No.

548
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,080
I think something's wrong with you.

549
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,120
I'm fine.

550
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,480
I'm really doing this for your good.

551
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,360
Think about it.

552
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,080
When you get back together with Leng Ran,

553
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,040
you can live in my house.

554
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,720
You can stay as long as you want.

555
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,520
Okay?

556
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,600
Go back now.

557
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,760
Go back.

558
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,320
Be good.

559
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,280
Let's go.

560
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,840
Who told you to come out?

561
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,200
What if your sister comes back with me?

562
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,360
Why don't we make a deal with my sister?

563
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,280
Not now.

564
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,520
Your sister is having an affair with Leng Ran.

565
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,240
When are we going to stop

566
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,920
secretly touching each other?

567
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,880
She can't do anything to me anyway.

568
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,320
Let's wait a little longer.

569
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,200
Don't worry.

570
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,960
I'll go back to my room.

571
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,000
I'll go to my room.

572
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,080
I'll go to my room.

573
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,120
I'll go to my room.

574
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,000
I'll go to my room.

575
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:02,880
I'll go to my room.

576
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,720
I'll go to my room.

577
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,640
I'll go to my room.

578
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,600
I'll go to my room.

579
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,480
I'll go to my room.

580
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,560
What am I?

581
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,960
Are you angry?

582
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,400
Don't be angry.

583
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,080
When your sister and Leng Ran

584
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,080
make up,

585
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,720
we'll sit down together.

586
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,320
Let's talk about it, okay?

587
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,840
Don't be angry.

588
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,280
Let's go.

589
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,240
Go to your room.

590
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,240
Change into pajamas.

591
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,160
Change now.

592
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,240
Couple pajamas.

593
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,040
Three months later

594
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,880
Subbers Ballantine

595
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,440
Why are you guys come here?

596
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,280
Can we catch you don't have to work today?

597
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,080
Sure.

598
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,080
We're here to report.

599
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,200
Report? What do you mean?

600
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,720
What's wrong, Nanxi?

601
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,880
You don't welcome us?

602
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,880
I do.

603
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,240
What's wrong with Kai?

604
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,640
Don't mention it.

605
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,840
Ever since you left the company,

606
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,960
the company's design has been getting messier.

607
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,560
We really can't continue.

608
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,320
Right.

609
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,640
And all our designs

610
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,120
have been taken back by Xiaorui.

611
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,000
And then we quit.

612
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,320
That's too impulsive.

613
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,120
Nanxi,

614
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,440
we still want to follow you.

615
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,000
Right.

616
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,560
We'll be happy to follow you.

617
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,920
And it's not just about that.

618
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,840
In Lin Nan's company,

619
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,640
the design we designed

620
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,160
is Mr. Xiao's talent.

621
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,840
The bad design we designed

622
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,280
is our fault.

623
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,080
What's wrong?

624
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,280
Mr. Xiao,

625
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,440
what's the situation with the design today?

626
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,680
What's the situation?

627
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,400
What do you mean?

628
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,480
Mr. Xiao,

629
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,440
you know what we mean.

630
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,600
You've been asking me

631
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,480
some weird questions.

632
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,800
I don't understand.

633
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,400
Okay, Mr. Xiao.

634
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,640
I'll be straight with you.

635
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,960
The design Lin Nan designed today

636
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,000
is obviously mine.

637
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,000
Why did you change it and it's yours?

638
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,920
You said you changed it.

639
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,160
Lin Yong,

640
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,040
I admit you're talented.

641
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,800
But you didn't do

642
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,920
a lot of things in detail.

643
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,920
If you didn't have my help,

644
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,760
do you think the company would have passed?

645
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,800
Okay, I admit it.

646
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:37,760
But this design

647
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,840
doesn't even have my name on it.

648
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,800
It's not appropriate.

649
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,000
You two are still young.

650
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,800
The name is not important.

651
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,720
You can't rush to get it.

652
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,280
Mr. Xiao,

653
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:49,960
you're doing this

654
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,440
is not appropriate.

655
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,320
Only you

656
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,960
dare not lie to me.

657
00:28:59,160 --> 00:28:59,680
You...

658
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,240
You...

659
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,240
They're all the creditors.

660
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,400
We're all the scapegoats.

661
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:06,680
Yes.

662
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,880
Although he's the director,

663
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,960
he didn't take us

664
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,000
as a team.

665
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,480
We were the ones

666
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,560
who kicked him out day and night.

667
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,240
He ended up doing it himself.

668
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,880
How could this happen?

669
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,360
It shouldn't have happened.

670
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,920
It's true, Sister Na Xi.

671
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,240
Anyway, that's the way it is.

672
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,000
I have no choice.

673
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,720
I can only come to ask you.

674
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,000
Actually, I'm happy

675
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,040
that you two can come

676
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,760
and believe me.

677
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,640
But my studio

678
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,040
has just started.

679
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,960
It's not stable yet.

680
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,240
I'm afraid

681
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,720
I might not meet your expectations.

682
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,040
What are you talking about, Sister Na Xi?

683
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,400
We're happy

684
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,120
to work with you.

685
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,200
Okay.

686
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,920
I can only

687
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,680
give you a five-thousand-yuan deposit.

688
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,840
But if there's a sale,

689
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,680
there will be a promotion.

690
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:57,800
No problem.

691
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:58,640
Okay.

692
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,880
Let's get started.

693
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:01,600
Okay.

694
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,320
What's the matter?

695
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,000
I heard

696
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,840
that you had a sequelae

697
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,840
because of the car accident five years ago.

698
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,160
Is that true?

699
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,320
I'm sorry.

700
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,760
Why are you sorry?

701
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,600
It's none of your business.

702
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,000
When you need me the most,

703
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,840
I'm not by your side.

704
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,160
It's all in the past.

705
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,200
And even if you're here,

706
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,440
I can't get better with sequelae.

707
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,040
Let's not talk about this.

708
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,840
I heard that

709
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,640
you're working in a jewelry studio recently.

710
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,080
You should need

711
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,640
a lot of money and people to start a new business.

712
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,840
There's a place that needs help.

713
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,440
You can ask me for help.

714
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,920
Well,

715
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,000
no need.

716
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,440
Yu Fan and Shi Qi have already

717
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,120
taken care of it for me.

718
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:56,760
What's good about it?

719
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,760
It's not a small matter to start a studio.

720
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,360
It's not a small number to lose.

721
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:03,720
I've thought about it

722
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,760
before.

723
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,440
But if I have to take care of it,

724
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,560
I can't do anything.

725
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,360
Now Xiaoru and Lin Yiyong just left.

726
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,720
You should be busy, right?

727
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,400
You know that.

728
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,960
It seems that I'm not capable enough.

729
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,360
Only you can help them.

730
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,000
By the way,

731
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,160
I did encounter a small problem.

732
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,800
I couldn't find

733
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,240
a suitable supplier.

734
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,280
I called many people

735
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,720
but they all said that I couldn't supply them.

736
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:33,880
I don't know why.

737
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,360
Anxin,

738
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,640
Yi Hai Jewelry

739
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,960
and many jewelry suppliers

740
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,760
have a lot of problems.

741
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:45,720
I'm thinking

742
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,320
if they're afraid of

743
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,320
offending Yi Hai for you.

744
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,760
Yi Hai?

745
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,160
Yi Hai Jewelry

746
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,680
You really

747
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,440
cut off Gu Nanxi's jewelry supply.

748
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,120
Didn't you say that?

749
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,840
But it still works.

750
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,440
Next,

751
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,560
our two companies

752
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,320
will join together

753
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,680
to resist Gu Nanxi.

754
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,440
I think he should be dead.

755
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,480
The super-price

756
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,200
has been useless to him.

757
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,800
He was forced to

758
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,560
be the owner of the chain price.

759
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,800
To put it bluntly, he's a scum.

760
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:27,960
There's no need

761
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,360
to fight with him.

762
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,160
I don't care.

763
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,680
No matter what Gu Nanxi does,

764
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,680
I'm not happy.

765
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,720
Do you think Yi Hai Jewelry

766
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,240
will do such a cheap thing?

767
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,440
What's the use of you

768
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,480
to Gu Nanxi?

769
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,520
Xiaorui,

770
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,800
don't forget

771
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,520
that we're on the same boat.

772
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,240
Don't you want to be kicked out

773
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,800
by Li Na?

774
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,560
Hello.

775
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,600
Are you the material manufacturer

776
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,480
of Jewelry?

777
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,520
Yes, I'm from the studio.

778
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,080
I think...

779
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:11,960
We're out of goods for now.

780
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,720
Sorry.

781
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,700
Straighten out the line

782
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,560
blinker

783
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,140
Say good-bye to him

784
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:27,960
A clear sky

785
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:39,800
I want to be

786
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:45,600
held trauma

787
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,720
Pleass me have you

788
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,800
hold

789
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,800
I'm still cold

790
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,800
You are the brightest in the world

791
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,800
The best man in the universe

792
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,800
The best start in the world

793
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,800
Day and night, I miss you

794
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,800
Because I always move forward

795
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,800
My world is because of you

796
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,800
The snow is growing slowly

797
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,800
The star and the sky are lit

798
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,800
Let the whole world have romance

799
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,800
And I'm more greedy at this moment

800
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,800
I turn around and turn around

801
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,800
You are the brightest in the world

802
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,800
The best man in the universe

803
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,800
The calm sea and the wild waves rise

804
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,800
Day and night, I miss you

805
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,800
Because I always move forward

806
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,800
My world is because of you

807
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,800
The warmth
