1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Don't you understand that you have to say you want to be apart from me

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
In my arms, you are asleep

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
How can you hide in my soft heart?

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I want to get closer to you, but your little stars

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Always surrounding you, never leaving, never leaving

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I want to get closer to you, to protect your secret

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I will keep looking for you

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm waiting for you

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I want to get closer to you, but your little stars

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Always surrounding you, never leaving, never leaving

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I want to get closer to you, to protect your secret

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I will keep looking for you

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I want to be with you forever

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
To protect you

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Nanxi

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Shiqi

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Why did you lie to me?

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What did I lie to you about?

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You know it clearly

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
My sister doesn't come, so you don't come either

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You are putting me in a corner

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Actually, Keke is very sincere to you

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And I saw you two standing together

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's not like you two are not in love

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You two are not in love

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You two are not in love

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You two are not in love

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You two are not in love

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You two are not in love

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And I saw you two standing together

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's not like you two are not in love

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Not in love?

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Keke likes me, so I have to be with her

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Xiao Rui, of course, in front of so many people

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
To confess to you

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Do you want to be with her?

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I...

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I saw Xiao Rui holding your hand and didn't let go

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I thought he was shameless

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It seems that you two are not in love, right?

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
No, I didn't notice him just now

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's not like that

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Okay, I'm sorry

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm too emotional

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'll go first

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
What trick did Xiao Rui use?

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Nanxi ate with him

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Why can't I see this person clearly?

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What's wrong with Mr. Xiao?

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I didn't expect him to be so romantic

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
If someone is so lovable to me

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I would have been so happy

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And I wouldn't have agreed to it

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What romantic? That's called offence

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
If my sister knew about this

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
She would have to go to Nanxi's house

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Keke

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You must be careful in the future

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
This kind of man

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Okay

61
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Nanxi

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I didn't expect this in the restaurant

63
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm sorry

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's okay

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Thank you for your gift

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But don't do this again

67
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
As long as you like it

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Nanxi

69
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Nanxi

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I was in the restaurant just now

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And they were so quick to decide

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I think we

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It doesn't seem to be over

74
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Nanxi, don't run away, okay?

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Xiao Rui

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
There were too many people in the restaurant just now

77
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
If I have anything that makes you misunderstand

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm sorry

79
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm going back first

80
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Nanxi

81
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'll wait for you

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Chen Zhe, I advise you to do your own thing

83
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Take care of your own job

84
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
But Xiao Rui really can't be trusted

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I think you should know

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
My relationship with Xiao Rui

87
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Then do you think I will believe you or him?

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I am the company's senior

89
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Everything I do is for the company

90
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I don't want to hear from you again

91
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Things that are not good for the company's unity

92
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Otherwise, I will make you disappear from the company immediately

93
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Nina

94
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Is there anything?

95
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
How come I have an opinion?

96
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
What did you say?

97
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I think Apart from a lot of feeling

98
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
We can leave him quickly

99
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
She may think it has many chances

100
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Then why not kill her how's about together

101
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Then my intention is to kill her

102
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,400
Nan Xin, I know you still have feelings for Xiao Rui.

103
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,080
But don't take the risk and put yourself in it.

104
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,680
What do you know?

105
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,600
You're talking nonsense.

106
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,240
And,

107
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,560
you can't be blinded by his poor pursuit.

108
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,120
Women in the new era

109
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,520
should know more about men than their career.

110
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,480
Enough.

111
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,680
It's not what you think.

112
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,480
So the man you hid last time was Xiao Rui?

113
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,480
Not him.

114
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,240
So you really have a man?

115
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,560
No.

116
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,080
No.

117
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,240
Gu Nan Xin.

118
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,520
Anyway, Xiao Rui

119
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,000
has been acting like that recently.

120
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,360
But I've already rejected him.

121
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,080
Don't worry.

122
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,600
Don't be so stubborn.

123
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,560
Remember it.

124
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm leaving.

125
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,000
Pretty lady.

126
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,280
How's thing going with Zhen's investigation?

127
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,400
Good.

128
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,520
Keep an eye on him.

129
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Shiqi, actually,

130
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
before I met you,

131
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I didn't even know what kind of person I like.

132
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm leaving.

133
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Hello?

134
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Shiqi, I just saw Xiao Rui send Nanxi home.

135
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You help me keep an eye on her these days.

136
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
If there's anything, tell me.

137
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm leaving.

138
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Seven days, seven days again.

139
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Today is the day.

140
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I guess I'll be free from renewing the contract.

141
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It won't be that easy to see Nanxi in the future.

142
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I've already renewed the contract with Shiqi.

143
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
What excuse do I take this time?

144
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And today he sent so much.

145
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
He didn't see me.

146
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'll think about it tomorrow.

147
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Shiqi, you're playing with me on purpose, right?

148
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Can you make some decisions for your actions?

149
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
What can these photos prove?

150
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Prove what?

151
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
The meeting two days ago,

152
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
you saw An Keke was in a stormy state.

153
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
The company just gave you a pressure.

154
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You came to me again.

155
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
He's my designer.

156
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'll have a meal with him and discuss my work.

157
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Is there a problem?

158
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You're an online friend.

159
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You're an online friend.

160
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You know how to write and think, right?

161
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And you, what about your mission?

162
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You know every day that you only rely on your fat.

163
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Is it like you're watching chess?

164
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
What are you looking at?

165
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Hurry up and think about it.

166
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's like this.

167
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I did a fan analysis of Qin Shiqi.

168
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
In my opinion,

169
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
this is not necessarily a bad thing.

170
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
From the fan analysis of Qin Shiqi's debut,

171
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
the number of fans before he and An Keke

172
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
had a scandal is 3 million.

173
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
But after the scandal,

174
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
his fan number has been up.

175
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Now it's reached 8 million.

176
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
So I think we should

177
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
confirm the relationship between the two.

178
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Qin Shiqi's good image

179
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
can even be popular.

180
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
National idol and

181
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
love story of genius designers.

182
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Good point.

183
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Tomorrow is the press conference.

184
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You, you go and take An Keke here.

185
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I disagree.

186
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Disagree invalid.

187
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You go to An Keke.

188
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Let him attend tomorrow.

189
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'll go now.

190
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I said I disagree.

191
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You're looking for me, right?

192
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Then you think about it.

193
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Before you figure it out,

194
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
stop all your work.

195
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
No.

196
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I have a shoot with Keke Zhu Bao today.

197
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Good.

198
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I disagree anyway.

199
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Disagree.

200
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
This...

201
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I was very nervous last time.

202
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
If there was no tension, you...

203
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yanxi.

204
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You guys go ahead.

205
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I didn't expect

206
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
that the model of the horse-horses' chain

207
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
is so experienced

208
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
in the past few years.

209
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Yanxi.

210
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Thank you for your hard work.

211
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It's my pleasure.

212
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Leave the rest to me.

213
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Leave the horse-horses' chain to us.

214
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I won't let you down.

215
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Of course.

216
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Our Keke cooperates with Lisa.

217
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It's a strong alliance.

218
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Editor, we're ready.

219
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Okay.

220
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Let's go.

221
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
We'll go first.

222
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So how did you get Lisa?

223
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Look over there.

224
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
How is it?

225
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Is it a surprise?

226
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Go and have a look.

227
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
What's wrong?

228
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm a little surprised.

229
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

230
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
That's all arranged by the company.

231
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm not sure.

232
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
But you're

233
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
the spokesperson of Yihai Jewelry.

234
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You're competing with Keke.

235
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
If you're like this...

236
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Nancy.

237
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm sorry.

238
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm sorry.

239
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm sorry.

240
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm sorry.

241
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm sorry.

242
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm sorry.

243
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm sorry.

244
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm sorry.

245
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm sorry.

246
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm sorry.

247
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm sorry.

248
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm sorry.

249
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
You're so...

250
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Nancy.

251
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
These are all work-related matters.

252
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Leave it to them.

253
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Look.

254
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
This design is really good.

255
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Especially this jewelry.

256
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It's a classic.

257
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I've been looking for this gemstone for a long time.

258
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I didn't find it.

259
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It was a good time.

260
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Fortunately, at the last minute,

261
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Mr. Xiao gave me a pair of palaibas.

262
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It helped a lot.

263
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You said it was Xiao Rui who helped you find it.

264
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Yes.

265
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
What's wrong?

266
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Nothing.

267
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'll go talk to the editor first.

268
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You two sit for a while.

269
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
That's good.

270
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
The credit goes to that Xiao.

271
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Zhu Lan is really a hard worker.

272
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Forget it.

273
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
As long as she's happy.

274
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Actually,

275
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
she can talk and make things clear.

276
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Shi Qi.

277
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm still worried about the company.

278
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
The company has stopped your endorsement and activities.

279
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
If they know you're still shooting,

280
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm afraid things can't be controlled.

281
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
There's still a while until the magazine is released.

282
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
There's no way to solve it.

283
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Or you listen to me.

284
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You just have to work for the company.

285
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
No.

286
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Because of her.

287
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Sometimes you can't help her.

288
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It's her fault.

289
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Okay.

290
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'll think about it.

291
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Nan Xi.

292
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Now,

293
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
a young,

294
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
beautiful,

295
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
capable,

296
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
and thoughtful designer like you

297
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
is really not much.

298
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Mr. Leng, you're overpraising me.

299
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Don't call me Mr. Leng anymore.

300
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Call me Leng Ran.

301
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You can call him Lao Leng.

302
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
That's not appropriate.

303
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Sure.

304
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Director Leng never praises people.

305
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You don't have to be so polite to him.

306
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Then, Director Leng,

307
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
can I ask you a question?

308
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I can't talk about it.

309
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Go ahead.

310
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It's okay.

311
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Just say it.

312
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I want to ask you

313
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
what the cooperation conditions are for Lisha Fashion.

314
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Cooperation conditions?

315
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
This

316
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
may not be suitable for Mr. Xiao.

317
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
But I'm afraid there's no chance later.

318
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
We don't know this.

319
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Tell me.

320
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I have a friend

321
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
who is a designer of Yi Hai Jewelry.

322
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
They've always wanted to work with Lisha Fashion.

323
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
But I don't know which part is wrong.

324
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
If there's a problem...

325
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You mean An Ke Ke?

326
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Yes.

327
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I've seen Yi Hai's designs.

328
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
They're good.

329
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Although the company's capital is relatively small,

330
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
it's a good product.

331
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Xiao Rui,

332
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
what are you talking about?

333
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Why are you talking about competitors?

334
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
There's no competitor.

335
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
What we want is a good product.

336
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
If Yi Hai Jewelry doesn't have the support of Ding Li,

337
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
how can we afford Qin Shi Qi?

338
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Since you two recommend it,

339
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'll think about it.

340
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Really?

341
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I'm just saying.

342
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'll think about it.

343
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Okay?

344
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Let's talk about the work.

345
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Sister An Qi, we'll go first.

346
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Bye.

347
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Thank you.

348
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
An Qi,

349
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
it's late.

350
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's not safe to go back alone.

351
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Let me send you off.

352
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
This guy...

353
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Don't try to take my sister Nan Xi away.

354
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
No need.

355
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Nan Xi is not alone.

356
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I'm watching you

357
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
as my sister's order.

358
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Are you the designer of Ma Ti Lian?

359
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Yes.

360
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
May I ask who you are?

361
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Li Na,

362
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
why are you here?

363
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
What's wrong?

364
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Can't I come

365
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
if you're here?

366
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Ms. Qin,

367
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm An Qi.

368
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Let me introduce you.

369
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
This is our company's CEO,

370
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Li Na.

371
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Hello, Miss Gu.

372
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Look at me, the CEO.

373
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You're a big designer.

374
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You've been here for so long.

375
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
This is the first time we've met in such a place.

376
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Excuse me.

377
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Hello, Li Na.

378
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Long time no see.

379
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Li Na has been able to make

380
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Kaige Jewelry

381
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
number one and number two

382
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
in the past six years.

383
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
That's great.

384
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I have to thank you

385
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
for standing on our stage.

386
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You don't have to thank me.

387
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You're welcome.

388
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
We'll leave if we have something to do.

389
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Let's go.

390
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
What?

391
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You want to see me off?

392
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It seems that

393
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
you have a special relationship.

394
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Dear,

395
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
we're engaged.

396
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
What's the problem?

397
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Gu Nan Xi is just a chess piece

398
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
to me.

399
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
When you were taking your design

400
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
to the interview of the company,

401
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I not only liked your design,

402
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
but also you.

403
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Of course,

404
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I hope

405
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
the person I love

406
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
is loyal to me.

407
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Don't do anything

408
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
under my nose.

409
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You're the only one in my heart.

410
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
No one can replace you.

411
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Okay.

412
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I'll give you a chance.

413
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Go home.

414
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Go.

415
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
If I knew that woman

416
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
had such a bad attitude,

417
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I wouldn't have agreed

418
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
to be her spokesperson.

419
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Forget it.

420
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
It's okay.

421
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
This is my boss.

422
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It's normal that he doesn't trust me

423
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
when he first saw me.

424
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
But I still thank you

425
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
for helping me out.

426
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
He helped me out

427
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
not only because of this.

428
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
You're not tired from work,

429
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
right?

430
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I'll give you extra work tomorrow.

431
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I'm going to bed.

432
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I'm talking about Meng Hua.

433
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
By the way,

434
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
you and Xiao Rui

435
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
are always against each other.

436
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Why did you agree

437
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
to be in the shooting?

438
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Of course,

439
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
your design is excellent.

440
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It touched my team.

441
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Really?

442
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I swear

443
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I'll trick your dog.

444
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
You're sleeping.

445
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I'm not going home.

446
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I have an appointment with Yu Fan

447
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
to meet him in the restaurant.

448
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Please let me go.

449
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
No.

450
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
My sister told me

451
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
to care about you.

452
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Care about me?

453
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
What if

454
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Xiao Mian Yang

455
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
is eaten by some big bad guy?

456
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I'll see you out.

457
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Take care.

458
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Go ahead.

459
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I won't be in your girls' party.

460
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You've worked hard today.

461
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Go home and get some rest.

462
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Nan Xi.

463
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
What's wrong?

464
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Yesterday, you and Xiao Rui...

465
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I've made it clear to her.

466
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I've refused her.

467
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
That's good.

468
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Then

469
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
my sister won't worry about you.

470
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Your sister?

471
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Go ahead.

472
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Go.

473
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Nan Xi.

474
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

475
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I wanted to ask you later

476
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
if the shooting went well.

477
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
But you came so soon.

478
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I came here

479
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
to report to you.

480
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Is the model handsome?

481
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Is it a puppy

482
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
or a puppy?

483
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
They're both good-looking.

484
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
You're so lucky today.

485
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
It's just that.

486
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I'm tired of the beauty.

487
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I'm not handsome if I look too much.

488
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You're so boring.

489
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Do you have a WeChat account?

490
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Give it to me.

491
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
You can't.

492
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
You're not suitable.

493
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
What's wrong with me?

494
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I have a good body.

495
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I have a good appearance.

496
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Okay.

497
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I'll give it to you.

498
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Why did you push my brother?

499
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Master.

500
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Let's turn around and go back.

501
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Shi Qi.

502
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Didn't I tell you

503
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
to mind your own business?

504
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Didn't you find

505
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
that there was a car

506
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
following us?

507
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Isn't this a common thing?

508
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It must be a fan.

509
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It's definitely not a fan.

510
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
The car didn't leave

511
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
after we arrived at the crime scene.

512
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Master.

513
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Let's go back and have a look.

514
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
That's the car.

515
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
We'll stop here

516
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
and turn off the lights.

517
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It's a Ford Moselle.

518
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Wait.

519
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
The car is on its way home.

520
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It's following us.

521
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I believe in my intuition.

522
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
The Big Moth?

523
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
What did he say again?

524
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
He said to think about it.

525
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Really?

526
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
If Ke Ke knows this news,

527
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
he must be very happy.

528
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Tomorrow, you and Ke Ke

529
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
will come to the studio together.

530
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
When Leng Ran is here,

531
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
we can sit down and talk.

532
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Don't worry.

533
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Hello?

534
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Hello, your package

535
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
is at the door of the community.

536
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
There's a door.

537
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I can't get in.

538
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Package?

539
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Yes.

540
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It says Gu Xiao Jin on it.

541
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Then put it at the door of my house.

542
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
No.

543
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
This must be signed in person.

544
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
In person?

545
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Okay.

546
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Wait for me.

547
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
What's wrong?

548
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I have a package.

549
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I bought a lot of things recently.

550
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I don't know what it is.

551
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Wait for me.

552
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I'll go get it.

553
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I'll be right back.

554
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Hurry up.

555
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Okay, see you later.

556
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
It's out.

557
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Look.

558
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Don't rush.

559
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Let's stay calm

560
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
and see what's going on.

561
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Gu Nan Xi.

562
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
How can you

563
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
be the chief designer?

564
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Oh my god.

565
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
You're so accurate.

566
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Yang Yan.

567
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Did you get the license plate?

568
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
It's too far.

569
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I didn't see it clearly.

570
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
How about

571
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
we tell Nan Xi?

572
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
It's too dangerous.

573
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Don't say it yet.

574
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
She's been too busy with work recently.

575
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I don't want her to worry.

576
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Okay.

577
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
But I don't think

578
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
it's easy

579
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
to do it now.

580
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
How about this?

581
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
You should pay more attention

582
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
to what's going on around Nan Xi.

583
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Okay.

584
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
How about

585
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
we follow her up and see who it is?

586
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Don't chase after her.

587
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
She's gone so far.

588
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
We can't catch up.

589
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Should we call the police?

590
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
No.

591
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
If you call the police,

592
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I'll be in trouble tomorrow

593
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
if I don't make it.

594
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
We can't let Nan Xi

595
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
suffer in vain.

596
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I think

597
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
there's no danger

598
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
for now.

599
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
How about this?

600
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
We'll pick her up tomorrow morning.

601
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Okay.

602
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
We've been waiting for an hour.

603
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Nan Xi hasn't come out yet.

604
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
We didn't see the car yesterday.

605
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
What can we do

606
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
in broad daylight?

607
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Let's go.

608
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Or we'll be late.

609
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Is Nan Xi going to be okay?

610
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
What can happen to her?

611
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
You're a good boy.

612
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
You know how to pick up your sister.

613
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Yes.

614
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Yes.

615
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Did Nan Xi tell you?

616
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
She...

617
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Tell me what?

618
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Stop pretending.

619
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I'm going to

620
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
the place where you're shooting

621
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
to meet the Big Devil of Bic.

622
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Yes.

623
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Yes.

624
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Where's Nan Xi?

625
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Where is she?

626
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
She's gone.

627
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Thanks, sister.

628
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Sister Nan Xi, you're here.

629
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Good morning.

630
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
All are there.

631
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
hasn't Qin Shi Qi come?

632
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Yes.

633
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I don't know why he's late.

634
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Everyone is waiting for him.

635
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
What time is it?

636
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Is there a problem?

637
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
It's okay.

638
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I'll send him a message.

639
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
He seems a bit disappointed.

640
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,840
I'm sorry.

641
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,880
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

642
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,920
I'm really sorry.

643
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,040
Sorry?

644
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,360
Let's go change.

645
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,680
Okay, let's go.

646
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,680
Nanxi,

647
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,280
my brother is out of school.

648
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,960
He went to pick me up at the community center.

649
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,520
That's great.

650
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,160
Let's see our products.

651
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:16,920
Look at this.

652
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,280
It's a good one.

653
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,280
It's a good one.

654
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,280
It's a good one.

655
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,280
It's a good one.

656
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,280
It's a good one.

657
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,360
This is the Martin series?

658
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,280
I've seen the design.

659
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,120
I didn't expect the product to be so eye-catching.

660
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,480
Why don't you make it?

661
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,800
It's best if you want to.

662
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,840
What are you looking at?

663
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,800
I'm looking at which one is the Big Cat King?

664
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,080
I haven't arrived yet.

665
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,560
I'm just curious about what he looks like.

666
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,000
He looks pretty handsome.

667
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,080
Is he?

668
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,360
He has two horns.

669
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,040
What horns?

670
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,040
Here he comes.

671
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,360
Let me introduce him.

672
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,360
This is my friend,

673
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,760
Qin Yufan from Yi Hai Jewelry.

674
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,520
This is the famous chief editor of Lisha magazine, Leng Ran.

675
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,360
Hello, Leng Ran.

676
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,280
Hello, Qin Yufan.

677
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,080
Let me have a look.

678
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:19,680
Okay.

679
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,360
Have fun.

680
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:23,960
Let's go.

681
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,680
Okay, everyone, take a break.

682
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,880
Thank you.

683
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,040
Thank you, teachers.

684
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,720
Thank you, teachers.

685
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:56,640
Shi Qi,

686
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,280
let's change into the next outfit.

687
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,600
Let's go.

688
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,560
Let's eat first.

689
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,600
What are you looking at?

690
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,320
He looks exactly like my sister.

691
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,000
Let's go.

692
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,880
Chief Editor Leng.

693
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,800
Are you tired?

694
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,360
I'm fine.

695
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,920
I'll go to the supermarket later.

696
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,160
Do you want me to buy you something delicious?

697
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:31,920
No, no.

698
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,120
We have work here.

699
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,040
You can eat.

700
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,600
You're so kind.

701
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,280
Do you have a girlfriend?

702
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,840
I'm sorry, Chief Editor Leng.

703
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,240
My friend drank too much last night.

704
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:41,960
We were chatting.

705
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,560
It's normal that he didn't drink much.

706
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,720
I'm sorry, everyone.

707
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,240
Director Xiao.

708
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,520
Something came late.

709
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,360
I bought coffee.

710
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:47,960
Would you like some?

711
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,840
Okay, let's go.

712
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,640
Thank you.

713
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,400
Thank you.

714
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,200
Your coffee is cold.

715
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,240
Thank you.

716
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,760
Yufan.

717
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:58,920
Yufan.

718
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,640
Let me have a look.

719
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:10,720
Yufan.

720
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,600
Yihuang.

721
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,080
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

722
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,240
If possible,

723
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,840
I don't want to see you in my life.

724
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,920
Don't say that.

725
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,200
Xiaorui.

726
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,640
Let me tell you.

727
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,440
You'd better stay away from Gu Nanxi.

728
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,760
I was too foolish before.

729
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,520
But this time,

730
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,360
I'll let Nanxi see my determination.

731
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,040
I can't help

732
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,320
how you and Gu Nanxi will develop.

733
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,000
But I warn you.

734
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,320
If you hurt Gu Nanxi again,

735
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,160
I'll do whatever I can

736
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,160
to make you disappear from this world.

737
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,680
How dare I

738
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,680
have a good friend like you?

739
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,200
Mr. Leng.

740
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,640
This is Leng Ran.

741
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,680
This is An Keke, a jewelry designer.

742
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,680
Hello, Mr. Leng Ran.

743
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,720
I've been wanting to visit you.

744
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,800
But I didn't have a chance.

745
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,760
Thank you for your advice.

746
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,640
You should thank Nanxi.

747
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,360
If it weren't for her recommendation,

748
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,320
I wouldn't have considered your company.

749
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,800
I just helped you to tell the truth.

750
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,760
By the way, I've seen your design.

751
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,080
But if you want to cooperate with us,

752
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,080
you may need to distance yourself.

753
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,680
Yes, I understand.

754
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,160
Mr. Leng Ran,

755
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,600
can you give me some suggestions?

756
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,160
I'll modify it when I get back.

757
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,520
Your design is very moving

758
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,280
and layered.

759
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,480
But the depth is not obvious.

760
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,040
Maybe I'm too demanding.

761
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,960
I didn't expect

762
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,120
this young designer

763
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,040
to be so knowledgeable.

764
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,600
I think it's admirable.

765
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,360
You can

766
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,840
learn more from Nanxi.

767
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,760
No, we learn from each other.

768
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,840
We make progress together.

769
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,880
Mr. Leng Ran, you're right.

770
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,520
I couldn't figure it out before.

771
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,720
I thought I lacked something.

772
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,160
But you just said that.

773
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,840
I was so confused.

774
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,840
Mr. Leng Ran, thank you.

775
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,520
I'll modify it when I get back.

776
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,720
I'll try to cooperate with Lisa

777
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,800
in the next season.

778
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,200
Looking forward to it?

779
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,680
Let's have a meal together.

780
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,160
Okay.

781
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:16,560
Okay.

782
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,160
Let's go.

783
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:17,880
Let's go.

784
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,880
Okay, this way.

785
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,000
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

786
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,600
Okay.

787
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,960
See you.

788
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,400
Shi Qi.

789
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,560
The time for the variety show

790
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,440
is set.

791
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,560
Seven days in a row.

792
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,080
Okay, you can come here.

793
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,200
Shi Qi.

794
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,560
Brother.

795
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,760
Shi Qi, you've worked hard.

796
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,600
I'm fine.

797
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,720
Shi Qi,

798
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,840
your style is so good today.

799
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,400
You're really Lisa's style.

800
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,400
Thank you.

801
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,400
Shi Qi.

802
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,720
Why are you so nervous?

803
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,120
I won't eat it.

804
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:09,840
What?

805
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,360
Are you afraid that I'll steal your dinner?

806
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,000
No.

807
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,880
It's mainly because

808
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,240
you two were photographed

809
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:14,840
in the restaurant.

810
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,160
The company is still...

811
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,280
Yan Yan.

812
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,280
Don't say it.

813
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,120
Did the incident

814
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,240
affect Shi Qi?

815
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,480
It's okay, Ke Ke.

816
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,560
The work is over.

817
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,320
The work is over.

818
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,320
The work is over.

819
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,760
The work is over.

820
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,640
The dresser.

821
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,880
Help him to change his clothes.

822
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,240
The makeup artist will help him to fix his makeup.

823
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,160
Thank you.

824
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,160
Sister Lan Xi.

825
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,640
Okay, let's start.

826
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,360
Okay, let's start.

827
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,240
The cold chief editor.

828
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,720
What do you think of that guy?

829
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,200
He's good.

830
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,480
He's very popular now.

831
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,720
He's the hottest person

832
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,520
in the fashion world.

833
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,120
He's my brother.

834
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,840
Brother?

835
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,840
My biological brother.

836
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,000
It's said that the cold chief editor

837
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,400
is the most popular person in the world.

838
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,720
He's my brother.

839
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,240
Brother?

840
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,240
My biological brother.

841
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,240
The cold chief editor hasn't answered me yet.

842
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,240
Do you have a girlfriend?

843
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,240
I...

844
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,240
No.

845
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,240
That's strange.

846
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,240
You look talented.

847
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,240
How could you not have a girlfriend?

848
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,240
Are you...

849
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,240
Don't guess.

850
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,240
I'm a man of my word.

851
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,240
Hello, Mr. Liu.

852
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,240
What's going on?

853
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,240
Are you making fun of me?

854
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,240
What's wrong, Mr. Liu?

855
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,240
Let me ask you.

856
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,240
Who asked Qin Shi Qi to shoot for Kai Kai?

857
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,240
Mr. Liu, how did you know?

858
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,240
What?

859
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,240
You mean

860
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,240
you want to hide it from me?

861
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,240
No, no, no.

862
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,240
Mr. Liu, look at what you said.

863
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,240
We were thinking

864
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,240
that we should find a suitable opportunity

865
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,240
to tell you.

866
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,240
A suitable opportunity?

867
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,240
I'm telling you

868
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,240
that we should stop shooting right now.

869
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,240
We should get Qin Shi Qi and Wu Kun back and have a meeting.

870
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,240
I'm sorry.

871
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,240
I'm sorry.

872
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,240
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

875
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,240
I'm sorry.

876
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,240
I'm sorry.

877
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,240
I'm sorry.

878
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,240
I'm sorry.

879
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,240
I'm sorry.

00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,240
I'm sorry.

881
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,240
I'm sorry.

882
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,240
I'm sorry.

883
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,240

I'm sorry.

888
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,240
I'm sorry.

889
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,240
I'm sorry.

890
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,240
I'm sorry.

891
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,240
I'm sorry.

892
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,240

I'm sorry.

895
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,240
I'm sorry.

896
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,240

I'm sorry.

898
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,240
I'm sorry.

899
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,240
I'm sorry.

900
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,240
I'm sorry.

901
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,240
I'm sorry.

902
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,240
I'm sorry.

903
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,240
I'm sorry.

904
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,240
I'm sorry.

905
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,240
I'm sorry.

906
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,240
I'm sorry.

907
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,240

910
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,240
I'm sorry.

911
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,240
I'm sorry.

912
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,240
I'm sorry.
