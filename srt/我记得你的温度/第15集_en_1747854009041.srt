Chinese TV Series Exclusive YouTube

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Can't understand the separation with me

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
In my arms, you are asleep

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
How can you hide in my soft heart?

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I want to get closer to you, but your little stars

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Always circling you, never leaving, never leaving

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I want to get closer to you, to protect your secret

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I will keep looking for you

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm waiting for you

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I want to get closer to you, but your little stars

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Always circling you, never leaving, never leaving

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I want to get closer to you, to protect your secret

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I will keep looking for you

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I want to be with you for the rest of my life

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
To protect you

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Wish you and Qin Shiqi a happy marriage

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm leaving

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Ok

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You and my brother-in-law, you two are fine, ok?

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Don't worry about us, take care of yourself

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
One day

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Am I right?

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yes, that's Xiaorui

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Xiaorui

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Nanxi

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Nanxi

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Did Xiaorui kick you again?

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
No, isn't this cold?

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Xu Yifan, sit down first

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Why are you in a hurry? Sit down

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Xiaorui wants to help Nanxi, but Nanxi refused

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I feel that she is really kind this time

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I feel that Xiaorui has changed

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Ok, ok, why are you talking about her?

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
We are gathered together, our purpose is to cheer for Nanxi

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yes, why mention her?

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Nanxi, don't be nervous

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
All of us are your strong backing

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's so good to have you

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm not nervous

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Let's have a drink together

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Come on, have a drink

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Waiter, serve the wine

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I think we are too worried

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We didn't do anything wrong

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What are you worried about?

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Ok, let's not talk about this

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yifan, how is your job?

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Don't mention it

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I am now a family member

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Mr. Leng's full-time nanny

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You just say that my brother-in-law has taken care of you

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Qin Shiqi, you are so good at talking

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Don't talk about it again

55
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Isn't it good?

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
This is called love and support, right?

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Love and support, Nanxi is good at talking

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Drink, drink, drink

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Come on

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Nanxi

62
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Why are you here?

63
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Are you a little nervous?

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Are you a little nervous?

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You can see it

66
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I am really nervous

67
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
If I really lose this time

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Not only will I be involved in the company

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Because of the abuse of plagiarism

70
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
My own career

71
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
also

72
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Nanxi

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Just be yourself

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The rest is natural

75
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Thank you, Le Ran

76
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You comfort me every time

77
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You don't let Shiqi hear this

78
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
If she hears it, she has to eat me

79
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You are right

80
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Shiqi really loves you

81
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Cherish

82
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Sit down

83
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Come on

84
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What are you doing?

85
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What's wrong? Are you afraid?

86
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm not afraid of you

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
go

88
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Nanxi, don't worry

89
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You will win

90
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Actually I have no confidence

91
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
They, they all registered copyright

92
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
What's the big deal?

93
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Even if you lose

94
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I will support you in the future

95
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You want to support me too?

96
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What? You don't trust me yet?

97
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
After all, I am a national hero

98
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
believe

99
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
How about I go with you?

100
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Don't

101
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
If you go

102
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I may be more stressed

103
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
But I will worry about you

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's ok

105
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
With you

106
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I feel powerful

107
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
it is good

108
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Let's go

109
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Let's go

110
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You are awake

111
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
By the way

112
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
What about the case you said last time?

113
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I haven't thought about it

114
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
But I have talked to Mr. Chen

115
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What did he say?

116
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Mr. Chen said the chance is not too big

117
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
But he also gave a suggestion

118
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What suggestion?

119
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I think

120
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You can't go to the hospital

121
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I have to go to the hospital

122
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
What suggestion?

123
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Designer's choice

124
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's a good way

125
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
At least it can greatly reduce the impact on the reform

126
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
right?

127
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Right?

128
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Do you think

129
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Gu Nanxi's possibility of plagiarism is big?

130
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
The court is focusing on evidence

131
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Besides

132
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
What can Chen Zhe do to steal Gu Nanxi's work?

133
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
No evidence

134
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's a hassle to explain more

135
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I will go to the hospital

136
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Ok

137
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Are you busy?

138
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
What do you want?

139
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I have some information here

140
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Our design process, draft date

141
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And the source of inspiration

142
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Nanxi

143
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
They have signed the copyright long ago

144
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Even if it's a thunder

145
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
We will also be the copyright

146
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The opening date of the court has already come down

147
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
This month is the 26th

148
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I know

149
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I will prepare

150
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Don't be so nervous

151
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Just say the word

152
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Just do your best

153
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Is there anything else?

154
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
No

155
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Then you go

156
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
The 166th civil lawsuit case in Chunzhou City People's Court

157
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Is now in court

158
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Open the court

159
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It was a case without a winner

160
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I will go

161
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Designer Gu

162
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
No

163
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I am afraid I can't call you that anymore

164
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
The court's judgment has come down

165
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I will be on time

166
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
This lawsuit

167
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Has a lot of impact on the reform

168
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Shi Qi is a spokesperson

169
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's all because of you

170
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You will only be with him

171
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Will only drag him down

172
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Keke

173
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
If you plan this for this

174
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You are really too pitiful

175
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
What did you say?

176
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Once a person has a obsession

177
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I want to bet everything

178
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
But the more you want to get

179
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
The less you get

180
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Go

181
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Go

182
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I don't know

183
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
How is sister Nanxi doing?

184
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Why haven't you come back yet?

185
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I am back

186
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I am back

187
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Won

188
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Unexpectedly lost

189
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
They are well prepared

190
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
We have been in the lower house

191
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Are you okay?

192
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'm fine

193
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I feel much more relaxed now

194
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Anyway, regardless of winning or losing

195
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
There is a result

196
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I have won

197
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
What is the specific judgment?

198
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
What do you mean?

199
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
One million

200
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I will pay

201
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
One million, they are crazy

202
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I will help you pay

203
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
No need

204
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You can rest assured

205
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
As long as I am here

206
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I will solve all the problems for you

207
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I think it's okay

208
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I will help you

209
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Xiaorui, congratulations

210
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You won all the big goods

211
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
What should we do next?

212
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It's you

213
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Not me

214
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Xiaorui, what do you mean?

215
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
The matter is not over yet

216
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You want to cross the river to break the bridge

217
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
An Keke

218
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You have to figure it out

219
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
The person who has the greatest profit in this matter is you

220
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I guess now the Yihai Chubao is famous

221
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Your plan is also going smoothly

222
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You are so naive

223
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
In my understanding of Li Na

224
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
In order to keep my position in the company

225
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Li Na is in a relationship with Gu Nanxi

226
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
What are you going to do?

227
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
My position in the company will be more dangerous

228
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Gu Nanxi is my company

229
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Li Na will definitely put all the responsibility on me

230
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
What should we do next?

231
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Gu Nanxi still hasn't left

232
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Wait

233
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Wait for her

234
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
What about Chen Zhe?

235
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Should he stay in the company or...

236
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Whatever

237
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Come here

238
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I want to tell you about the recent situation in the company

239
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I believe you all know about the case between Yihai and our company

240
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I don't need to hide it from you

241
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
The case is lost

242
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
So I want to tell you about the company's decision

243
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
The main responsibility of this incident is our main designer

244
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Gu Nanxi

245
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Gu Nanxi

246
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I have discussed with her

247
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
For the company's reputation and interests

248
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
The company plans to terminate the contract with Gu Nanxi

249
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
All the responsibilities of this plagiarism are taken by Gu Nanxi

250
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
But as a colleague who fought side by side

251
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Nanxi also wants to say goodbye to everyone

252
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
This time, the incident is caused by my personal work mistakes

253
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Causing an unimaginable loss to the company

254
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I am here

255
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I am here to apologize to all my colleagues

256
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Thank you very much for your help

257
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I hope we can work together in the future

258
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Ok, that's it

259
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Nanxi, come with me

260
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I am sorry, Nanxi

261
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
This is the decision of the board of directors of the company

262
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Don't say that

263
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I think it's right to apologize

264
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
The compensation for the court is because you have taken all the responsibility

265
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
So the company can't bear it for you

266
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
But after all, your two main designs have made a great contribution to the company

267
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
So I take a compensation for you in the name of one person

268
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
This is 200,000

269
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I can't take this

270
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Just take it

271
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I don't want others to take Lina, cross the river, tear down the bridge, and eat people's bones

272
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Thank you

273
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I really need it now

274
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Just take it as I borrowed it from you

275
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I will return it to you as soon as possible

276
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
The password is your birthday

277
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I can only help you here

278
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Enough, thank you very much

279
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
What are your plans next

280
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I haven't thought about it yet

281
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I should take a break and adjust it first

282
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
After all, the plagiarism label has been called now

283
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It should be difficult to find a job

284
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Then what do you need to help me in the future?

285
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Find me tonight

286
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Hello

287
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
How is it? How is the country?

288
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
It's the same as I expected

289
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I am completely unemployed now

290
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Then can I officially adopt you?

291
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Yes, I can give you a chance now

292
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I can't do it

293
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I can't do it

294
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I can't do it

295
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I can't do it

296
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I can't do it

297
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
By the way, your sister and brother-in-law will come to eat hot pot at home

298
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
You clean it up

299
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
My sister?

300
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I have to clean it up

301
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
My sister's words are not true

302
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
And my brother-in-law said don't irritate her

303
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
How about this

304
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Let's go out and eat

305
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Then I don't have to pretend to come to your house

306
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Hurry up, I'll give you half an hour to clean up

307
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Okay, okay

308
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm going to eat

309
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Cheers

310
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Lanxi

311
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You really impressed me this time

312
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I didn't expect to experience such a big thing

313
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Your mentality is still so good

314
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I didn't expect it either

315
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Maybe it's because I have a bottom in my heart

316
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I think it's almost time

317
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Let's help Nanxi clean up

318
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Let's go back

319
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
No need, I can clean it up myself

320
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Choosing to eat hot pot is easy

321
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Okay, you choose to eat something else

322
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You have to know

323
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
You know again, don't say a few words

324
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Okay, then the three of us are gone

325
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Go, go, go

326
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Sister, wait a minute

327
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
That you and my brother-in-law

328
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You two go back

329
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
That

330
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I'll stay and help sister Nanxi clean up

331
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
You two go back

332
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
You two go back

333
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I'll go out for a while

334
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
You know how to clean up

335
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
What kind of goodwill can you have

336
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Go with me

337
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Go

338
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Go

339
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
No, no

340
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Cold person

341
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
it is good

342
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Then we'll go first

343
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
it is good

344
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
All right, all right

345
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Let me tell you

346
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
You be honest

347
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Brother-in-law, look at my sister

348
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I'm kind too

349
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Yes

350
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
You are kind

351
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
What are you thinking about

352
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I'm not clear

353
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
OK

354
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
My sister's master

355
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I'm obedient

356
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Yufan, the matter has been said

357
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Don't be picky with yourself

358
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
OK

359
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Go back

360
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
What are you doing here

361
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It's so late

362
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You let me take a taxi back

363
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Otherwise

364
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Stay with me

365
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
No

366
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I mean

367
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Lend me your favorite car

368
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Dream

369
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
All right

370
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Then I can only live in your house

371
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I don't want to be this light bulb

372
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
There is no way

373
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Yufan, the matter is right

374
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It's really not suitable to take a taxi so late

375
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
He is a public figure

376
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You can lend him the car

377
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Go, go

378
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Slow down

379
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Why do I feel like I'm fooled

380
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
The matter is so big

381
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Don't worry

382
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I'm sorry

383
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I'm sorry

384
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I'm sorry

385
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I'm sorry

386
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I'm sorry

387
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I'm sorry

388
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I'm sorry

389
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I'm sorry

390
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I'm sorry

391
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I'm sorry

392
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I'm sorry

393
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I'm sorry

394
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I'm sorry

395
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I'm sorry

396
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm sorry

397
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I'm sorry

398
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I'm sorry

399
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I'm sorry

400
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I'm sorry

401
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I'm sorry

402
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I'm sorry

403
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I'm sorry

404
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I'm sorry

405
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I'm sorry

406
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I'm sorry

407
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I'm sorry

408
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I'm sorry

409
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I'm sorry

410
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I'm sorry

411
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I'm sorry

412
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I'm sorry

413
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I'm sorry

414
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'm sorry

415
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I'm sorry

416
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I'm sorry

417
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I'm sorry

418
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I'm sorry

419
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I'm sorry

420
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I'm sorry

421
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I'm sorry

422
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm sorry

423
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I'm sorry

424
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I'm sorry

425
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I'm sorry

426
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm sorry

427
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I'm sorry

428
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I'm sorry

429
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I'm sorry

430
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I'm sorry

431
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I'm sorry

432
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I'm sorry

433
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm sorry

434
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I'm sorry

435
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I'm sorry

436
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I'm sorry

437
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'm sorry

438
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I'm sorry

439
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I'm sorry

440
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I'm sorry

441
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I'm sorry

442
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I'm sorry

443
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm sorry

444
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I'm sorry

445
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I'm sorry

446
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I'm sorry

447
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I'm sorry

448
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I'm sorry

449
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I'm sorry

450
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I'm sorry

451
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I'm sorry

452
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I'm sorry

453
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I'm sorry

454
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I'm sorry

455
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I'm sorry

456
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I'm sorry

457
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'm sorry

458
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I'm sorry

459
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm sorry

460
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I'm sorry

461
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I'm sorry

462
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm sorry

463
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I'm sorry

464
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I'm sorry

465
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I'm sorry

466
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I'm sorry

467
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I'm sorry

468
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
2020

469
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Can I see it

470
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Yes

471
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Nanxi

472
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,440
Let's go

473
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,400
to the shop across the street

474
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,440
the big brand

475
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I want to here

476
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Nanxi, are you sure you want this?

477
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Yes, I know it.

478
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Thank you.

479
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Okay, how much is it?

480
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
3.5 yuan.

481
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
It's gone.

482
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Thank you.

483
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
You're welcome.

484
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Do you know why I wanted to buy that bracelet

485
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
instead of going to the big store?

486
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Why?

487
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I was thinking

488
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
that everyone ignored the real meaning of the diamond.

489
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
The reason the diamond represents love

490
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
is not because it's expensive,

491
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
but because it's hard.

492
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
It represents the shoulder of love.

493
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I don't quite understand what you're saying.

494
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
So, why is it?

495
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I don't know.

496
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I just don't understand.

497
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I don't quite understand.

498
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
So, why is it?

499
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Now, the diamond is a luxury

500
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
because of the hype of people.

501
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Many people are disappointed.

502
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
But everyone has the right to pursue love.

503
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
So?

504
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
So, I've always had an idea.

505
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I want to make a common jewel.

506
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
A common jewel?

507
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Jewels that most people can afford

508
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
can symbolize their love.

509
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Well said.

510
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
A common jewel.

511
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
It can occupy the public market.

512
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
It won't compete with the big brands

513
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
in the high-end market.

514
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
It's a different kind of jewel.

515
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
That's what I mean.

516
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
It's to reduce its cost on the original value.

517
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
And the main focus is on design and workmanship.

518
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
In this case,

519
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
it's not high in the cost of capital.

520
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Well said.

521
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
A common jewel.

522
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I understand.

523
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Nanxi, no matter what,

524
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I will support you unconditionally.

525
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I'll always be on your side.

526
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I'll always be on your side.

527
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Xi Ya.

528
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I don't think you did this.

529
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Did you feel like you were in love today?

530
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Thank you.

531
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
It's the truth.

532
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I haven't been to the playground for a long time.

533
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I'm helping you go back to your youth.

534
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
What?

535
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I'm not a girl anymore.

536
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
You think I'm a big girl.

537
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
No.

538
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
In my eyes,

539
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
you're always 19 years old.

540
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Yeah.

541
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
You can't believe what a guy says.

542
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I'm thinking

543
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
when I can find time

544
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
to tell your sister about us.

545
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Okay. Today?

546
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Today?

547
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Why are you in such a hurry?

548
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Then,

549
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
when will it be?

550
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
You should do more work on the studio.

551
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Why?

552
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
You don't trust me?

553
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I don't.

554
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I didn't expect

555
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
you to say something

556
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I didn't expect you to say something

557
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
that I can't wait to hear.

558
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Can we wait a little longer?

559
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I've used up all my time today.

560
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Tomorrow, I'm going to bed.

561
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Nanxi.

562
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Huh?

563
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Didn't you say you've used up all your time today?

564
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
It's past midnight.

565
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
It's tomorrow.

566
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Good night.

567
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Should I let her sleep in the room?

568
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
You're back.

569
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I don't care what you do.

570
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I want Qin Chiqi

571
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
and Gu Nanxi

572
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
to never let me come back.

573
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I'm sorry.

574
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I...

575
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
What's wrong with me?

576
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
What's wrong with me?

577
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Why can't you do it, long-distance runner?

578
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
What?

579
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I thought you could do it.

580
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I didn't get up this morning.

581
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
It hurts so much.

582
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I couldn't get up this morning either.

583
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I'm sorry.

584
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I'm sorry.

585
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I'm sorry.

586
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I'm sorry.

587
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I'm sorry.

588
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I'm sorry.

589
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I'm sorry.

590
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I'm sorry.

591
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
What's the plan for today?

592
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I wanted to look for a job address.

593
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
But now,

594
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I have to look it up on my computer.

595
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
What about you?

596
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I have to go to the office today.

597
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I haven't been there for a long time.

598
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Yan Yan said there was some unusual work.

599
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
That's good.

600
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
You have to work hard.

601
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Don't delay your work when you're in love.

602
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Don't worry.

603
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I have to make money to support my family.

604
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I think

605
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
people are very attractive when they do what they like.

606
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
You mean

607
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I'm very attractive when I'm filming?

608
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I've never seen you before.

609
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
But you were really good when you were taking pictures.

610
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Really?

611
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I think I'm more attractive when I'm kissing.

612
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
That's serious.

613
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Okay.

614
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
You should go to work.

615
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I'll make you breakfast.

616
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
No need.

617
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Go ahead. I'll take care of it.

618
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Okay.

619
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I'm leaving.

620
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Miss Ji,

621
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
down the road.

622
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
When you are ready,

623
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
ask them to give you a lift.

624
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
You do make iy全 liner upی

625
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
when there's no passengers to take the lift along.

626
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Before we leave,

627
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
let's tie the knot.

628
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Do you forget

629
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I told you I would pick the threads for modern women

630
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
in my 자�idad�도

631
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I'm thinking of wearing the interpretation jacket

632
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
only for modern women.

633
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
You're excited.

634
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Old çokah esquورa.

635
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I還覺得

636
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I'm in the優勢 Whoa is it fair that

637
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
men like you walk in the commodities and please gethhhh

638
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
so and go cakes?

639
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,840
We're going to choose a transportation store.

640
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,040
This place is a transportation store.

641
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,920
But it's far from the mall.

642
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,240
There are few things to eat nearby.

643
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,040
Then let's order takeout.

644
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,400
Is there anything else to choose?

645
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,920
Which one do you like?

646
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,640
Zhao Xiaobei.

647
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:34,880
What about this?

648
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,520
You want to choose the one I like?

649
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,400
Okay, let's not choose.

650
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,880
Just choose the one you like.

651
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,720
Okay.

652
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,480
It's late.

653
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,920
You should go to bed.

654
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,720
Go take a shower.

655
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,160
Okay.

656
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,960
What's up?

657
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,800
I want you to disband them.

658
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,560
You and Qin Shiqi are impossible.

659
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,360
Is Chen Zhe still in my company?

660
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,560
It's up to you to decide whether he goes or not.

661
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:42,720
How did Chen Zhe get the design from the Kaige Company?

662
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,960
I want you to know better than me.

663
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,840
I'm not sure.

664
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,000
What do you mean?

665
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,240
I said

666
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,400
disband them.

667
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,680
Otherwise,

668
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,480
I don't think I can live for a few days.

669
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,320
The Kaige Company

670
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,400
and even the whole industry

671
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,560
will know about this.

672
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,120
An Keke, are you crazy?

673
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:10,880
Yes.

674
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,800
I'm crazy.

675
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,880
Because he's not a man.

676
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,160
He's not in love with Qin Shiqi.

677
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,600
He's using Qin Shiqi

678
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,960
to cure his mental disorder.

679
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,000
But Shiqi is just

680
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,640
being seduced by him.

681
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,440
He must have been used by him.

682
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,000
Xiaorui,

683
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,320
I just want Shiqi to know

684
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,240
who really loves him.

685
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,320
I'm begging you.

686
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,960
Can you help me?

687
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,880
You've always had a way out.

688
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,160
You must have asked Shiqi

689
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,760
to leave Gu Nanxi, right?

690
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,680
That's enough.

691
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,120
You bought so many things.

692
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,360
He likes them.

693
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,440
That's the limit.

694
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,560
Buy more.

695
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,720
He just lost his job.

696
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,640
He needs to be comforted.

697
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,280
He's not as fragile as you think.

698
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,400
Besides, I think there's nothing wrong with Nanxi.

699
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,200
Do you think even my father would know

700
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,440
Xiaolandai went back in time?

701
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,480
He knew

702
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,240
their minds were purely just a rabble.

703
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,120
They actually had nothing to do with the incident.

704
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,560
It's so sad.

705
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,440
Xiaolandai had nothing to do with the oxidization of the Group Sky,

706
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,760
of whom she was responsible for dieing.

707
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,440
Are you sorry to him?

708
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,640
No, no.

709
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,600
Nu speaks an Estados word.

710
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,640
Her name isfaced out.

711
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,080
How can you ask...

712
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,040
How can you ask

713
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,040
I'm sorry.

714
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,040
I'm sorry.

715
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,040
I'm sorry.

716
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,040
I'm sorry.

717
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,040
I'm sorry.

718
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,040
I'm sorry.

719
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,040
I'm sorry.

720
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,040
I'm sorry.

721
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,040
I'm sorry.

722
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,040
I'm sorry.

723
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,040
I'm sorry.

724
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,040
I'm sorry.

725
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,040
I'm sorry.

726
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,040
I'm sorry.

727
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,040
I'm sorry.

728
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,040
I'm sorry.

729
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,040
I'm sorry.

730
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,040
I'm sorry.

731
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,040
I'm sorry.

732
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,040
I'm sorry.

733
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,040
I'm sorry.

734
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,040
I'm sorry.

735
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,040
I'm sorry.

736
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,040
I'm sorry.

737
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,040
I'm sorry.

738
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,040
I'm sorry.

739
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,040
I'm sorry.

740
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,040
I'm sorry.

741
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,040
I'm sorry.

742
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,040
I'm sorry.

743
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,040
I'm sorry.

744
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,040
I'm sorry.

745
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,040
I'm sorry.

746
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,040
I'm sorry.

747
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,040
I'm sorry.

748
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,040
I'm sorry.

749
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,040
I'm sorry.

750
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,040
I'm sorry.

751
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,040
I'm sorry.

752
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,040
I'm sorry.

753
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,040
I'm sorry.

754
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,040
I'm sorry.

755
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,040
I'm sorry.

756
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,040
I'm sorry.

757
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,040
I'm sorry.

758
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,040
I'm sorry.

759
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,040
I'm sorry.

760
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,040
I'm sorry.

761
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,040
I'm sorry.

762
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,040
I'm sorry.

763
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,040
