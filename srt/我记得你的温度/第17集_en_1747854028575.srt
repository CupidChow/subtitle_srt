1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,440
You don't understand the separation with me

2
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,800
In my arms, who are you?

3
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,200
How are you hiding in my soft heart?

4
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,600
I want to get closer to you, be your little star

5
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,960
I'm unable to get away from you as you're so gentle

6
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,360
I want to get closer to you, guard your secret

7
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,920
I will keep looking for you

8
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,120
I'll be with you for the rest of my life

9
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,120
I want to get closer to you, be your little star

10
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,520
I'm unable to get away from you as you're so gentle

11
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,920
I want to get closer to you, guard your secret

12
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,320
I will keep looking for you

13
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,920
I'll be with you for the rest of my life

14
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:35,120
I'll be with you, guard your secret

15
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,520
Hello, are you the jewelry manufacturer?

16
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,920
Yes, I'm from the studio. I think...

17
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,120
We're out of stock. Sorry.

18
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,720
Hello, I just got a new batch of original items.

19
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,520
I can send you the goods soon.

20
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,320
Thank you.

21
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,120
This is the jewelry that we're selling in our studio.

22
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,120
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,120
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,120
I'm sorry.

25
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,120
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,120
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,320
This is the first batch of our studio's products.

28
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,920
It's called Star Wings.

29
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,920
Wow, it's so pretty, Sister Nanxi.

30
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,920
I feel like it will be very popular.

31
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,520
Sister Nanxi, what should we do next?

32
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,320
We'll find a factory to make a sample,

33
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,720
and then start selling it.

34
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,720
Then let's split up.

35
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,120
Okay.

36
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,920
Gu Nanxi!

37
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,320
I want to break up with Leng Ran!

38
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,320
What? They really broke up?

39
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,120
Right, Yifan is so stubborn.

40
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,120
She said Leng Ran has someone else.

41
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,120
Oh no, then we'll both break up.

42
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,120
My brother-in-law wants me to persuade my sister.

43
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,520
When did you say that?

44
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,720
Think about what they'll do first.

45
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,920
I think we should either persuade them to make up.

46
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,720
Or let them break up completely.

47
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,120
What are you thinking?

48
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,120
How about this? I'll persuade my brother-in-law tomorrow.

49
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,520
You go persuade my sister.

50
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,920
I think, how about...

51
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,520
You go find your sister tomorrow. I'll go find Leng Ran.

52
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,120
We'll talk about the situation.

53
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,120
Then we'll make an appointment

54
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,320
and let them meet up.

55
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,720
We'll chat.

56
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,720
Okay. Then let's make an appointment with Yan Yan tomorrow.

57
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,520
Okay.

58
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,520
Enough. Let's not think about their problems.

59
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,320
Think about our problems.

60
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,120
It's almost time for this time.

61
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,320
This...

62
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,720
You and Shi Qi are really a match made in heaven.

63
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,320
You called me to the coffee shop early in the morning and there were only two people.

64
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,520
One was you and the other was her.

65
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,520
You still have the leisure to say this?

66
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,720
What's going on between you and Yufan?

67
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,720
You're asking me? I don't know either.

68
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,520
Don't not know.

69
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,320
Leng Ran, what are you planning to do?

70
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,520
Other than cold treatment, what else can be a better solution?

71
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,120
This is not like your style of doing things.

72
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,120
Do you really have other thoughts?

73
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,720
I just feel that Yufan's condition is really bad lately.

74
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,920
She's always acting like a ghost.

75
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,320
Honestly, I'm really tired.

76
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,120
You have to understand her.

77
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,920
She really cares about you and is afraid of losing you.

78
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,320
She lost her job and feels like she doesn't deserve you.

79
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,320
I understand what you're saying.

80
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,920
But she's so noisy. The company already has a problem with me.

81
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,520
Then I think you two should have a good conversation.

82
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:58,120
I don't mean to not have a conversation, but I'm always happy.

83
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,520
How about this?

84
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,320
Tonight, Shi Qi and I will be here. You two can have a good chat.

85
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,320
Don't do that cold treatment thing.

86
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,920
Yufan will be so upset.

87
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,920
Okay.

88
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,720
This is also a way.

89
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,720
By the way, how's your work?

90
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,720
It's pretty good.

91
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,520
I was a little upset about the jewelry material.

92
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,520
But Xiao Rui came to help me analyze it.

93
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,120
It's pretty helpful.

94
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,920
Xiao Rui has a conscience.

95
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,920
Qin Yufan, are you out of your mind?

96
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,920
It's up to you. You can stay where you want.

97
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,520
How can you see who you want now?

98
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,520
You deserve it.

99
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,320
Qin Yufan, if it wasn't for me...

100
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,520
If it wasn't for you, if it wasn't for you, you're my father.

101
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,120
You don't want to care about me, right?

102
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,520
Qin Shi Qi, do you have a conscience?

103
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,320
Qin Yufan, we're talking about you.

104
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,520
I hope you can be more serious.

105
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,520
Tell me, what do you think?

106
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,120
I don't think much.

107
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,320
If you don't think much, then let's split it.

108
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,520
I understand what you mean, sister.

109
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,320
I'll bring her stuff to her for you.

110
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,320
You two, don't see each other again.

111
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,920
Shi Qi.

112
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,520
Actually, I didn't mean that.

113
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,720
Don't, don't, sister.

114
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,320
Look at you now.

115
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,120
You two are not suitable for each other.

116
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,520
As your brother, I'll make this decision for you.

117
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,520
Then...

118
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,320
I can't make a mistake for him, right?

119
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,120
I knew you would do this.

120
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,120
You don't want to fly, right?

121
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,720
You can't show your face, right?

122
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,320
Wait for my news.

123
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,720
Shi Qi, are you leaving now?

124
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,320
What else?

125
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,320
Then...

126
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,320
What about me?

127
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,920
You should think about what to say to Neng Ran.

128
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,320
I'll take care of the rest.

129
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,320
Don't worry, Mr. Liu.

130
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,920
We'll follow the contract's regulations.

131
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,920
I've read the script you sent me.

132
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,720
The company has also evaluated it.

133
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,120
The investment ratio you promised will be one point less.

134
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,120
But there are other shareholders.

135
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,320
I can't make the decision by myself.

136
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,120
Yes, and the fund's draw needs some time.

137
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,720
Don't worry about the jewelry.

138
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,520
Shi Qi is our spokesperson.

139
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,520
We have no conditions for this.

140
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,920
Yes.

141
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,920
I'll let our designer design according to the script and the crew.

142
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,120
We'll talk about the details when we get the details.

143
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,120
Okay.

144
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,120
The company wants to invest in the hardware?

145
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,720
Yes.

146
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,120
I promised them to get a exclusive spokesperson for Qin Shi Qi.

147
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,120
And I have a deal with their company.

148
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,520
I don't think it's a bad thing.

149
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,320
The company is getting bigger.

150
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,520
The investment needs to be more diversified.

151
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,120
And the market is still optimistic about the product of Qin Shi Qi.

152
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,320
The phone is still more objective.

153
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,920
Yes, but I don't know what the board will say.

154
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,720
Don't worry.

155
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,720
I'll always be on your side.

156
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,720
Okay, let's not talk about this. I have something else to talk to you about.

157
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,720
What is it?

158
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,120
How did you talk to Le Ran? How did he respond?

159
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,920
He's been busy lately. I didn't have time to talk to him.

160
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,120
We have to get this done as soon as possible.

161
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,720
The board has a lot of opinions about Qin Shi Qi.

162
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,120
If we can't get this done,

163
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,120
it'll be even more difficult to invest in the studio.

164
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,920
Don't worry. I'll make the arrangements.

165
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,920
Thank you, dear.

166
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,520
Oh, right. You have to look at the script design.

167
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,920
And then, according to the script,

168
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,520
it's convenient for the crew to use.

169
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,520
Don't worry. They're all watching.

170
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,520
Is there anything else?

171
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,120
No.

172
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,120
I'll get back to work.

173
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,520
Xiaoru and the others will be back soon.

174
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,120
Come.

175
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,720
How is your sister?

176
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,720
Don't worry. Everything is under my control.

177
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,720
That's good. Let's do it while it's hot.

178
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,520
You know how to flash.

179
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,720
You were at my house just now.

180
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,720
Now you're here.

181
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,720
I'm doing this for you. You should appreciate it.

182
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,920
Sister Nanxi, don't tell her about us.

183
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,520
Everything is under my control.

184
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,920
Okay. See you tonight. I'll get going.

185
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,720
What did they say about you tonight?

186
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,720
Don't tell her yet.

187
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,920
These two...

188
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,920
I'm sorry.

189
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,920
You don't have to be sorry.

190
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,120
Nanxi!

191
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,320
Look!

192
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,920
Look.

193
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,520
It's done.

194
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,720
That's great.

195
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,120
Don't you know that Lin You and I

196
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,320
only made it after we worked hard for so long.

197
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,720
Thank you for your hard work.

198
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,120
We'll be even busier next time.

199
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,120
Let's sing.

200
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,720
Let's add more volume.

201
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,520
Let's start the engine.

202
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,520
Let's fight in the dark.

203
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,120
Who said I'm flying against the wind?

204
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:09,120
The place I'm going to is the direction of the wind.

205
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,720
There are too many bumps.

206
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,520
I have to pretend to be cool.

207
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,520
How is it?

208
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,120
With a cold feet,

209
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,720
that's how I am.

210
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,720
It's a good time.

211
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,920
Okay.

212
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,520
Sister Wenxi.

213
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,120
Why don't we invite a model to show us?

214
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,520
This isn't in Kaige.

215
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,520
Where do you get the money?

216
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,120
Let's upload this picture to the store.

217
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,520
And we'll do a pre-sale.

218
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:46,720
Okay.

219
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,320
Let's see how it goes.

220
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:48,720
Okay.

221
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,520
I'm going out.

222
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,520
Okay.

223
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,320
I'm leaving.

224
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,320
Be safe, Sister Wenxi.

225
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,520
Okay.

226
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,320
I'll clean up.

227
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,320
Qin Xu Fan, I'm leaving.

228
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,920
Slowly.

229
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,720
I'm leaving.

230
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,320
You're drinking in the afternoon.

231
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,520
When did you get so drunk?

232
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,920
Why drink?

233
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,520
Let's talk business.

234
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,120
Sit here.

235
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,720
Let me tell you.

236
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,520
I asked Leng Ran to come over today.

237
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,120
Shi Qi and I will be here.

238
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,920
You two can talk.

239
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,520
Listen to me.

240
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,520
There's nothing we can't talk about.

241
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,720
And I asked Leng Ran to come over before.

242
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,320
He's not what you think he is.

243
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,320
I know.

244
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,720
You talk to him today.

245
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,920
Don't argue.

246
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,520
Do you hear me?

247
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,320
He'll be here soon.

248
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,120
Tell him for me.

249
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,520
I'll tell him for you.

250
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,520
You tell him yourself.

251
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,120
I'll tell him for you.

252
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,920
I'll leave it to you.

253
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,520
Must be a good idea.

254
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,120
Ok.

255
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:56,840
We are

256
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,240
here— melting

257
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,160
into it.

258
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,800
I'm not

259
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,320
so automby could

260
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,760
Ind divid

261
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,140
I'm

262
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,540
I'll go arrange something.

263
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,540
Okay.

264
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,540
You guys talk first.

265
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,140
Well,

266
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,140
since you're here,

267
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,140
who'll go first?

268
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,940
You guys don't say anything.

269
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,140
I'll go first.

270
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,740
Today's meal,

271
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:35,340
we'll eat a reunion meal.

272
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,740
If we can't eat well,

273
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,340
we'll break up.

274
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,340
You're good at talking.

275
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,340
Okay.

276
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,340
You two,

277
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,340
who'll go first?

278
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,140
Fine, we won't talk.

279
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:55,940
Lao Ran,

280
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,740
I'm asking you.

281
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,940
The person who keeps calling you,

282
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,140
who is it?

283
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,740
Who is it?

284
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,740
You saw it, right?

285
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,540
He's always like this.

286
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,740
I said he'll be like this all night.

287
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,340
Lao Ran,

288
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,740
am I a bitch?

289
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,740
A very bitch.

290
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,140
I'm a bitch.

291
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,140
I'm a bitch, okay?

292
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:19,740
I'm a bitch.

293
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,140
You're a bitch, say it.

294
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,740
What did I say?

295
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,740
Am I a bitch?

296
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,740
No, Qian Yu Fan,

297
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,740
we've made a deal.

298
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,740
We'll talk nicely,

299
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,740
we won't quarrel.

300
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,340
I didn't quarrel.

301
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,740
Look at his attitude.

302
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,740
Lao Ran,

303
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,740
what attitude?

304
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,740
What attitude?

305
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,540
Can't you explain it?

306
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,140
It's not good to let him misunderstand.

307
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,340
What's there to explain?

308
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,340
He's my colleague,

309
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,340
you've met him.

310
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,340
Colleague?

311
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,540
Why did you call me behind my back?

312
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,340
Is there anything you can't see?

313
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,340
I didn't mean to do that.

314
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,740
I'm afraid you're in a bad situation,

315
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,940
and it'll affect my work.

316
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,540
It'll affect your work?

317
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,540
You don't know why I'm in a bad mood?

318
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,740
I really don't know.

319
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,340
You're being unreasonable.

320
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,740
I'm being unreasonable?

321
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,540
In your heart, I'm like this, right?

322
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,340
Good boy.

323
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,940
Look at him.

324
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:07,940
Look at him.

325
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,940
I really can't communicate with him.

326
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,940
You can't communicate with him.

327
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:12,940
Let's call it a day.

328
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,740
No, it's not a big deal.

329
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,740
Is it necessary?

330
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,140
Why not?

331
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,540
It's because of these little things

332
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,940
that I found his big problem.

333
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,940
Lao Ran,

334
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,540
I won't argue with you today.

335
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,940
Take all the things in the house

336
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,140
and take them away within two days.

337
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,940
Zi Yan, what are you doing?

338
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,340
Hurry.

339
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,540
Lao Ran, can't you just say something?

340
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:36,940
You're so good at it.

341
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,140
You can't just take one away.

342
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,940
Go after him. He's gone.

343
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:40,940
I'm not going.

344
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,940
I owe you guys.

345
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,540
I'll go if you don't go.

346
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,540
Nan Xin.

347
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,540
Xiao Ran.

348
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,540
You two are really something.

349
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,140
You took everyone away.

350
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,340
Look at you.

351
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,540
What should we do now?

352
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,340
Brother-in-law.

353
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:06,140
I remember you weren't like this before.

354
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,940
Brother, let me ask you.

355
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,340
Do you still like Yu Fan Ji?

356
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,140
Oh my god.

357
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,740
You're at this time.

358
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,340
You're still not ashamed to say it.

359
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,740
What are you doing?

360
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,340
I think since you like him,

361
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,540
since you love him,

362
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:37,140
let's not care who's right or wrong.

363
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,540
What's the point of it?

364
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,140
Right?

365
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,340
Yeah.

366
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,140
Look at me and Nan Xin.

367
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,940
We both have decided.

368
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,340
Then I'll follow him and spoil him.

369
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:46,540
Right.

370
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,740
Women need men to protect them.

371
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,340
Right.

372
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,140
And you've been in touch with so many women.

373
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,740
These two principles are right.

374
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,340
I've been in touch with so many women.

375
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,340
I didn't mean that, brother-in-law.

376
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,140
What do you mean?

377
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,540
I mean

378
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,340
you have so many female colleagues around you.

379
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,940
You must know women.

380
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:04,540
I know.

381
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,340
How can I do that?

382
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:06,940
I...

383
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,740
Brother-in-law, let me ask you.

384
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,940
Do you love my sister?

385
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,140
If you don't,

386
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,540
break up with her.

387
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,340
Right.

388
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,740
If you don't want to break up,

389
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,140
why do you want to do this?

390
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,740
What's the point?

391
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,940
You're so good, aren't you?

392
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,340
You can do whatever you want.

393
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,440
Well, go ahead.

394
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,440
Let's discuss about the marriage.

395
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,300
Liang monitor,

396
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,300
I shouldn't have ignored your feelings because of work.

397
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,300
I shouldn't have a secret between you and work.

398
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:09,300
I shouldn't have a problem between us because of work.

399
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,300
Yifan, can you answer the phone?

400
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,300
I don't want work. I don't want to find a better one.

401
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,300
I want you.

402
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:34,300
Yifan, I will resign tomorrow.

403
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,300
I have a way to support you.

404
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,300
I will stay at home with you every day.

405
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,300
You can go wherever you want.

406
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,300
You can do whatever you want.

407
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,300
Can you give me another chance?

408
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,300
Where are you?

409
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,300
Hello, Yifan.

410
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,300
Okay. Wait for me.

411
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,300
Hello, Lanxin.

412
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,300
I found Yifan.

413
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,300
How is it?

414
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:28,300
Am I a master of love now?

415
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,300
Of course.

416
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,300
You have such a good master.

417
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,300
How can you not count?

418
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,300
I am a talented man.

419
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,300
Yes.

420
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,300
Talented man.

421
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,300
I tell you.

422
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,300
You rarely go to the company after you started dating.

423
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,300
I think you should go there if you are free.

424
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,300
Don't say that Liu Dawei is bothering you.

425
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,300
It's okay.

426
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,300
I am their money-sharing uncle now.

427
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,300
Money-sharing uncle?

428
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,300
Call your sister Nanxi.

429
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,300
The wine hasn't been moved yet.

430
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,300
Right?

431
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,300
Let her drink some more.

432
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,300
Okay.

433
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,300
They are sweet.

434
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,300
It's not a big deal for my Nanxi to be a radio light.

435
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,300
Right.

436
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,300
What a big deal?

437
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,300
It's a pity.

438
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,300
It's not Nanxi.

439
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,300
Who?

440
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,300
Hello.

441
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,300
Hello.

442
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,300
Yufan.

443
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,300
Sorry.

444
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,300
Hello, Shi Qi.

445
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,300
Hospital.

446
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,300
Shi Qi.

447
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,300
How is Nanxi?

448
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,300
Qi Yufan.

449
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,300
Are you satisfied now?

450
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,300
Are you happy now?

451
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,300
You are so selfish.

452
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,300
Do you think you are the center of the world?

453
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,300
Shi Qi.

454
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,300
Don't say that.

455
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,300
I mean your sister.

456
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,300
Your sister doesn't mean that.

457
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,300
How is Nanxi now?

458
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,300
You know it.

459
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,300
For your stupid things,

460
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,300
she is lying in there now.

461
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,300
You are happy now.

462
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,300
You are happy now.

463
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,300
Shi Qi, don't be anxious.

464
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,300
How can I not be anxious?

465
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,300
She is in there.

466
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,300
What should I do if she is in there?

467
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,300
Nanxi is our good friend.

468
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,300
She is my girlfriend.

469
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,300
What did you say?

470
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,300
Qi Yufan, I tell you officially today.

471
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,300
We are together.

472
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,300
I love her very much.

473
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,300
No matter what you think,

474
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,300
this can't be changed.

475
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,300
No matter what she says,

476
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,300
she is my girlfriend.

477
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,300
Shi Qi, listen to me.

478
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,300
I don't mean that.

479
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,300
I don't care what you mean.

480
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,300
I have said what I should say.

481
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,300
I understand.

482
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,300
Are you two so interesting?

483
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,300
The doctor is coming.

484
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,300
Hurry up.

485
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,300
Doctor.

486
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,300
The patient has a little skin injury.

487
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,300
It shouldn't be a big problem.

488
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,300
What do you mean by it?

489
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,300
What do you mean by it?

490
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,300
Shi Qi, I'm sorry.

491
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,300
Please continue.

492
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,300
The patient was a little scared.

493
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,300
We have injected a sedative for him.

494
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,300
When the medicine is ready,

495
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,300
he will wake up.

496
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,300
Just in case,

497
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,300
just stay in the hospital for a while.

498
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,300
You can pay the hospital bills

499
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,300
to your family at any time.

500
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,300
Okay, thank you.

501
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,300
Thank you, doctor.

502
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,300
You wait for Nanxi here.

503
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,300
Let's go.

504
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,300
Let's go.

505
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,300
Go.

506
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,300
They blame me.

507
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,300
If I had answered Nanxi's call,

508
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,300
it wouldn't be like this.

509
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,300
Yufan,

510
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,300
the doctor said that

511
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,300
Nanxi is not a big problem.

512
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,300
Do you think

513
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,300
I'm very selfish?

514
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,300
You can say that,

515
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,300
it means you are not selfish.

516
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,300
I really don't know

517
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,300
Shi Qi and Nanxi.

518
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,300
Then you know now.

519
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,300
What's your attitude?

520
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,300
What's my attitude?

521
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,300
You still don't know?

522
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,300
I know.

523
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,300
I know.

524
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,300
Doctor, please pay the hospital bills.

525
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,300
I was worried before.

526
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,300
It seems to be unnecessary.

527
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,300
It's not unnecessary.

528
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,300
I think

529
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,300
that's a lesson

530
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,300
for Shi Qi.

531
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,300
Leng Ran,

532
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,300
have you known this thing

533
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,300
for a long time?

534
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,300
I don't know.

535
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,300
But I have noticed it before.

536
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,300
I'm such a failure as a sister.

537
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,300
My brother,

538
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,300
I didn't know until the last one.

539
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,300
Who was the one

540
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,300
who had a big fight with Shi Qi before?

541
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,300
If he hid it from you,

542
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,300
he was afraid that you would be sad.

543
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,300
Pay the bill first.

544
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,300
Pay the bill first.

545
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,300
Hello.

546
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,300
Hello.

547
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,300
Nanxi,

548
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,300
wake up.

549
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,300
I have a lot of things to do.

550
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,300
Er...

551
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,300
It's all right.

552
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,300
First,

553
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,300
exhibition.

554
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,300
Come.

555
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,260
Let's go back first.

556
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,180
Let's go.

557
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,300
Let's go.

558
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,500
Let's go.

559
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,180
Let's go.

560
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:02,300
Da Xi, you're awake.

561
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,300
I'll go call the doctor.

562
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,300
You don't have to call the doctor.

563
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,300
I feel like I'm fine.

564
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,300
That's not good.

565
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,300
I have to let the doctor check you again.

566
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,300
How are Yifan and Luoran?

567
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:21,300
You're too worried about others.

568
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,300
Don't worry.

569
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,300
They've made up.

570
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,300
I'll let them go back first.

571
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,300
Okay.

572
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:31,300
I think they'll be back soon.

573
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,300
What's wrong?

574
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,300
What's wrong?

575
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,300
I don't think I can feel it.

576
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,300
I'll go call the doctor.

577
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,300
How is it, doctor?

578
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,300
We did a full check.

579
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:17,300
The patient's condition is fine.

580
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,300
Everything is normal.

581
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,300
Why don't you feel anything?

582
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,300
We don't know.

583
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,300
We may need to do further tests.

584
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,300
Then continue.

585
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,300
Don't worry.

586
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,300
We'll arrange it.

587
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:32,300
Shi Qi, listen to the doctor.

588
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,300
Da Xi, you told me before.

589
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,300
You'll feel it when you touch me.

590
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,300
Try again.

591
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,300
Stop acting.

592
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:49,300
I know everything I should know.

593
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,300
What do you know?

594
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,300
Shi Qi told me everything last night.

595
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,300
Still acting.

596
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,300
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

597
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,300
Go out with Shi Qi.

598
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,300
Okay.

599
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,300
Shi Qi.

600
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,300
What are you talking about?

601
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,300
Shi Qi, let's go out first.

602
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,300
We're talking about our besties.

603
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,300
Say it.

604
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,300
What's wrong with you?

605
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,300
It's the car accident.

606
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,300
I have a sequela.

607
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,300
Are you stupid?

608
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,300
Why didn't you tell me?

609
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,300
I didn't want you to worry.

610
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:42,300
Did you treat me as your bestie?

611
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,300
And when did you start to treat Shi Qi?

612
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,300
After I came back this time.

613
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,300
After I came back.

614
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,300
I accidentally met Shi Qi.

615
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:01,300
I found out that I had a sense of sense when I met him.

616
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,300
So at first I kept it to myself.

617
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,300
I wanted to use it to treat the disease.

618
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:09,300
But when I got to know it,

619
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:12,300
I slowly couldn't leave him.

620
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,300
I didn't blame you.

621
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:20,300
I was surprised after I found out last night.

622
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,300
But then I thought about it.

623
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,300
It's normal.

624
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,300
You're not angry?

625
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,300
I'm angry.

626
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:32,300
I'm angry that you all are hiding it from me.

627
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,300
Even Leng Ran knows it.

628
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,300
I don't know it.

629
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,300
How can I tell you?

630
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,300
Nanxi.

631
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:47,300
I think my brother is not mature yet.

632
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,300
You didn't know last night.

633
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,300
You scared me.

634
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,300
I'm not going to give you any face as your sister.

635
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,300
I found out that

636
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:01,300
Shi Qi really fell in love with you this time.

637
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,300
It seems that my previous worries were unnecessary.

638
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,300
Shi Qi, he...

639
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,300
He really treats me well.

640
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,300
That's good.

641
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,300
If he dares to bully you in the future,

642
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,300
I'll teach him a lesson.

643
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,300
By the way,

644
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,300
you have to promise me one thing today.

645
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,300
If there's anything in the future,

646
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,300
you have to tell me immediately.

647
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,300
I'll tell you everything in the future.

648
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:34,300
Nanxi, you two are the people I care about the most.

649
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,300
You two are happy.

650
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,300
Then I'll be happy.

651
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,300
Don't think too much now.

652
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:42,300
Your first task now is to treat and recuperate well.

653
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,300
Try to recover as soon as possible.

654
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,300
I know.

655
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,300
I love you.

656
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:52,300
Then I'll leave my brother to you.

657
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,300
Shi Qi, your sister is afraid.

658
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,300
She's afraid that you're young and not determined.

659
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:04,300
She's just in a momentary impulse with Nanxi.

660
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,300
You'll be tired and regretful in a few days.

661
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,300
By then, you won't be married for two or three years.

662
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,300
You can't even make friends.

663
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,300
She treats me like myself.

664
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,300
She treats you like yourself.

665
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:24,300
Shi Qi, don't be so hostile to your sister.

666
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,300
Before you came to me that day,

667
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,300
your sister talked to me for a long time.

668
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,300
She especially told me not to tell you.

669
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,300
I'm afraid that after you know her true feelings,

670
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,300
you'll become unnerving.

671
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,300
But recently,

672
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,300
especially yesterday,

673
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:41,300
your sister is very clear that you are the most sincere Nanxi.

674
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,300
She can feel that you cherish Nanxi.

675
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,300
So today, I can tell you this.

676
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,300
Don't worry.

677
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,300
Your sister won't be against it.

678
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,300
Then...

679
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:01,300
What did they talk about when they knew us?

680
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:05,300
They talked about it secretly between their best friends.

681
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,300
Now we also talk about it secretly.

682
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,300
Hello?

683
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,300
Hello?

684
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,300
Okay.

685
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,300
See you later.

686
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,300
Okay.

687
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,300
Who is it?

688
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,300
Xiao Rui.

689
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,300
Why is he looking for you?

690
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,300
I'll go with you.

691
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,300
I'm not like you.

692
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,300
Our relationship is not that complicated.

693
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,300
I'm not working with them right now.

694
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,300
Right, and you.

695
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,300
We're working together.

696
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,300
You can go back by yourself later.

697
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,300
Okay.

698
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,300
Then, brother-in-law, be careful on your way.

699
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,300
Tell me if you need anything.

700
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,300
Okay.

701
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,300
Senior,

702
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,300
when you go back later,

703
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,300
can you apologize to your sister?

704
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,300
What you said that day,

705
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,300
she was really sad.

706
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,300
Okay.

707
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,300
Okay.

708
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,300
Okay, I'll go first.

709
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,300
Okay.

710
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,300
Be careful, brother-in-law.

711
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,300
Okay.

712
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,300
Okay.

713
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,300
I'm sorry.

714
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,300
I'm sorry.

715
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,300
I'm sorry.

716
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,300
I'm sorry.

717
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,300
I'm sorry.

718
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,300
I'm sorry.

719
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,300
I'm sorry.

720
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,300
I'm sorry.

721
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,300
I'm sorry.

722
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,300
I'm sorry.

723
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,300
I'm sorry.

724
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,300
I'm sorry.

725
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,300
I'm sorry.

726
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,300
I'm sorry.

727
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,300
I'm sorry.

728
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,300
I'm sorry.

729
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,300
I'm sorry.

730
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,300
I'm sorry.

731
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,300
I'm sorry.

732
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,300
I'm sorry.

733
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,300
I'm sorry.

734
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,300
I'm sorry.

735
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,300
I'm sorry.

736
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,300
I'm sorry.

737
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,300
I'm sorry.

738
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,300
I'm sorry.

739
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,300
I'm sorry.

740
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,300
I'm sorry.

741
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,300
I'm sorry.

742
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,300
I'm sorry.

743
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,300
I'm sorry.

744
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,300
I'm sorry.

745
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,300
