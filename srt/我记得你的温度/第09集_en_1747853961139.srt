2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Don't you understand that you have to say you want to be apart from me

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
In my arms, you are asleep

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
How can you hide in my soft heart?

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I want to get closer to you, but your little stars

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Are always around you, never leaving you, never leaving you

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I want to get closer to you, to protect your secret

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I will keep looking for you

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm waiting for you

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I want to get closer to you, but your little stars

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Are always around you, never leaving you, never leaving you

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I want to get closer to you, to protect your secret

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I will keep looking for you

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I will keep looking for you

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
To protect you

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
To protect you

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Is that all?

18
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What you told Keke today really has nothing to do with me

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I can still tell the difference between work and life

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
This time, it was Nanxi's design that moved me

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I have to admit that Nanxi is really a genius

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
She can accurately find the bright spots of every design and enlarge it

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
How is Nanxi?

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
She... she's fine now

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
She just got a little surprised

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I really didn't expect this kind of thing to happen

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Even if she doesn't appear, other things will happen

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Why?

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Because I know Xiao Rui too well

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Xiao Rui? What does this have to do with Xiao Rui?

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You don't know the relationship between Xiao Rui and Nanxi?

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So that's how it is

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
This fate is really too strange

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
No wonder when I first saw them, I thought they were weird

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
That's also the end of the world

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
If I had to say, I wouldn't let Nanxi go back to Xiao Rui

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You don't have to worry so much

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I don't think Xiao Rui has any thoughts about Nanxi

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What do you mean he has no thoughts?

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
He's like a dog's skin now

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Can't tear it off

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Don't worry, it won't

43
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Why are you so sure?

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You don't know yet?

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:56,060
Xiao Rui has already engaged with the

46
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Xiao Rui is still pestering Nanxi

47
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So shameless

48
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Xiao Rui

49
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Aren't you living with Nanxi?

50
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You're living with her

51
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Stop

52
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Our relationship is called living together

53
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I didn't mean that

54
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I mean

55
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You and her have lived together

56
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
That means she still likes you

57
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
She didn't resist you

58
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
If she resists you

59
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Do you think you two will live together?

60
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yes

61
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I think

62
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
If you confess to her once

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You'll make her confess her whole life

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And then find a familiar person to push her

65
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
For example, find your sister

66
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
My sister

67
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yes, you say you are

68
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
How to explain it to your sister

69
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yes

70
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You don't tell your sister about this

71
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
How can Nanxi

72
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Promise you with peace of mind?

73
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Right?

74
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
But my sister told me

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
She'll agree to anything I do

76
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
But there's one thing

77
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Can't be with you

78
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
What does it have to do with me?

79
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
What's your attitude?

80
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I should have an attitude

81
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Gu Nanxi

82
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I heard this news

83
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I ran out to share it with you

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I left Leng Yan at home

85
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Leng Yan?

86
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
At your home?

87
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What's going on?

88
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm talking about your problem

89
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I want to talk about your problem first

90
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I have no problem

91
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I mean

92
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I was at home with Leng Yan

93
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Discussing things

94
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I heard this news

95
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I left her at home

96
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You left your family

97
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Qin Yufan

98
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I've known you for more than ten years

99
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Can you leave your family?

100
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I don't know

101
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'll call you later

102
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's all because of you

103
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Because of your celebration

104
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I drank so much

105
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So the single dog is blooming

106
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Gu Nanxi, be serious

107
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Okay

108
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm talking about your problem

109
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Be serious

110
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I have no problem

111
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Why do you have no problem?

112
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
That scumbag

113
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
He and Linna have engaged

114
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And he ran to your place

115
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
He's not dead

116
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Stay away from him

117
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yes

118
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You resign

119
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
No

120
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Why not?

121
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Think about it

122
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Don't think about it

123
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's a deal

124
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I won't care about him

125
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
He won't do anything to you

126
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
But your female boss

127
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yes

128
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
No wonder Linna has that attitude towards me

129
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So this is the reason

130
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I think you should find a boyfriend now

131
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's easy to find a boyfriend in the supermarket

132
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Shiqi

133
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What?

134
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I mean, let Shiqi pretend to be your boyfriend

135
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
We'll talk about it later

136
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I mean

137
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
No

138
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
No

139
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Why not?

140
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You two know each other

141
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You should know each other

142
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's a good match

143
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You're so close

144
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You're like a sister

145
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You can borrow from others

146
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm doing this because of you

147
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Think about it

148
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
If that devil knows you have a boyfriend

149
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
He won't be so careful about you

150
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Then your work will be successful

151
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Shiqi is not good

152
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Shiqi and Keke

153
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
They are so annoying

154
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
No

155
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,660
Yu

156
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Finally, done

157
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I've been working hard these days.

158
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's so pretty.

159
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,600
Shi Qi, do you like it?

160
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,600
I like it very much.

161
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,000
This will be my favorite ring in my life.

162
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Brother.

163
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
What are you doing?

164
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
What is this?

165
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
A small gift for my son.

166
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So pretty.

167
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Is this for sister-in-law?

168
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
No.

169
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You and sister-in-law have bought rings.

170
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Whose is this for?

171
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You talk too much.

172
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The less you eat, the better.

173
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
The less you eat, the better.

174
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You're not giving it to him, are you?

175
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Brother, you and sister-in-law are engaged.

176
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
If sister-in-law knows it,

177
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
have you thought about the consequences?

178
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I have my own plans.

179
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Then think about it.

180
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
What can this woman give you?

181
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
What can sister-in-law give you?

182
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Get out.

183
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Brother.

184
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Get out.

185
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Hello.

186
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Chief Editor Leng.

187
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
What are you busy with?

188
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm working on the dinner process.

189
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's been so long.

190
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Still busy?

191
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Basically, it's done.

192
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I just have one thing.

193
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I really can't get an idea.

194
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I happen to ask you.

195
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
What is it?

196
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You said you were going to do a dinner party.

197
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm going to do it.

198
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm going to do it.

199
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm going to do it.

200
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm going to do it.

201
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm going to do it.

202
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm going to do it.

203
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm going to do it.

204
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm going to do it.

205
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm going to do it.

206
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You said Yi Hai Jewelry

207
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
and Kai Ge Jewelry's spokesperson

208
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
are all Shi Qi.

209
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Then how do we wear this jewel?

210
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And do you think I'm going to arrange

211
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Shi Qi and An Ge Ke to attend the party together

212
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
or Shi Qi and Nan Xi to attend the party together?

213
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You've lost weight.

214
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Yifan.

215
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I won't talk to you for now.

216
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Keke is here.

217
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Think about it.

218
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'll call you later.

219
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Keke.

220
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Why are you so happy?

221
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You bought a lottery?

222
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Keke, look.

223
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You're amazing.

224
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You finished it so quickly.

225
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Help me see if it's suitable for Shi Qi.

226
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I saw these photos of him.

227
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Is it good?

228
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Is it good?

229
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
What's wrong, Yifan?

230
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Nothing serious.

231
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's just that Leng Lan...

232
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
What's wrong with your brother-in-law?

233
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It's not what you think.

234
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's about the jewel party.

235
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Shi Qi is our common spokesperson with Kai Ge.

236
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm thinking about how to arrange this entry.

237
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Isn't it simple?

238
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Together.

239
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Together?

240
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
How do we bring the jewel?

241
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Of course, with a horse-drawn chain.

242
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Our jewel hasn't been listed yet.

243
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
How did I forget about this?

244
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
My designs

245
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
are due to Nan Xi's credit.

246
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Even if Keke doesn't attend,

247
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'll let him join.

248
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Enough, Yifan.

249
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Don't think too much.

250
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I thought you and your brother-in-law...

251
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Help me see

252
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
if Shi Qi is suitable for this.

253
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Does he deserve his noble temperament?

254
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
How can I explain it to my sister?

255
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
But isn't it inappropriate in the company?

256
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Will it scare my sister so suddenly?

257
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Shi Qi?

258
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Shi Qi, why are you here?

259
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I just happened to pass by and came to see.

260
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I was just about to find you.

261
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I want to show you the jewelry I designed for you.

262
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'll show it to you.

263
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Shi Qi, come and see

264
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
the jewelry I just designed for you.

265
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Look.

266
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I designed all of these for you.

267
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And these.

268
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
They are really good.

269
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's a pity

270
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
that they can't be displayed on the jewelry banquet.

271
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Why?

272
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Because you need to have a code chain.

273
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
That's the hottest design now.

274
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I haven't even released these.

275
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
My new design is very suitable for you.

276
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's better if it's not released.

277
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It happens that the reporter is here.

278
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
You can promote Yi Hai Jewelry.

279
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Nothing is more influential than Lisha Banquet.

280
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Am I right?

281
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Yes.

282
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Why is Shi Qi so good?

283
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I didn't expect it.

284
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Hello, I'm in the room.

285
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Hello, grandpa.

286
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Hello, grandpa.

287
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Ke Ke.

288
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
What are you doing?

289
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm discussing with Shi Qi

290
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
about the new jewelry.

291
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Why didn't you tell me

292
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
when Shi Qi came?

293
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
He came suddenly.

294
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
How could I tell you?

295
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You asked Shi Qi to answer the phone.

296
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Shi Qi, my grandpa wants to talk to you.

297
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Hello, Mr. An.

298
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Shi Qi.

299
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
How long have we not met?

300
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I've been busy recently.

301
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I'll visit you another day.

302
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
No need.

303
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's better to meet on the next day.

304
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Let's have a meal at home today.

305
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
What? Is it inconvenient?

306
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Yes, it is.

307
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
See you tonight.

308
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
See you tonight.

309
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Wen Xi.

310
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Mr. Xiao.

311
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Why haven't you left?

312
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I haven't left.

313
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I saw the lights in your office.

314
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
So I came to see you.

315
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I was about to get off work.

316
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
At this time,

317
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
would you like to have a meal together?

318
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
No.

319
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I'm a little tired after work.

320
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Go ahead.

321
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
The shareholder meeting is about to start.

322
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I have something to talk to you.

323
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Okay.

324
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Okay, you go first.

325
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'll close the door.

326
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Go.

327
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Shi Qi.

328
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
You've been busy recently.

329
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It's rare for you to come to me.

330
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
How are you and Keke?

331
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You know it.

332
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I have only one baby granddaughter.

333
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You have to take good care of her in the future.

334
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
If I know that you are not good to her,

335
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I will be polite to you.

336
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Okay, grandpa.

337
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Where are we?

338
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It's not what you think.

339
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Why not?

340
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
You are so enthusiastic to help her.

341
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Work and life are all around her.

342
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You are my granddaughter.

343
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
A thousand golds of jewelry.

344
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Why can't you match her?

345
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
There are things that can't be ambiguous.

346
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I don't understand.

347
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It's time to make it clear.

348
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Grandpa, are you hungry?

349
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'm hungry.

350
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Let's eat.

351
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Let's eat.

352
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Okay, let's eat.

353
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Okay.

354
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Let's go.

355
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Shi Qi.

356
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I know Keke's personality the best.

357
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
She is so kind to you.

358
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I envy her.

359
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
She has always liked and wanted to do

360
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
everything.

361
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I have no conditions to support her.

362
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I just want to hear your thoughts.

363
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Mr. An.

364
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Keke is a very good girl.

365
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
She is cute, kind and talented.

366
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It helps me a lot in my career.

367
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
But I have nothing to do with her.

368
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I know.

369
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
You young people like to work.

370
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I can understand.

371
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Take your time.

372
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Take your time.

373
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Take your time.

374
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
You should get to know each other.

375
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Mr. An.

376
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I don't want you to misunderstand.

377
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I don't have any other thoughts about Keke.

378
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I hope she can find someone who loves her and treats her well.

379
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Grandpa.

380
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Is Shi Qi also in her prime?

381
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I don't want to affect her career.

382
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Look.

383
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
We are chatting.

384
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
The dishes are getting cold.

385
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Let's eat.

386
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Keke loves to eat ribs.

387
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Come on.

388
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Have a piece of ribs.

389
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Mr. Xiao.

390
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
The environment here is good.

391
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
But there are not many people.

392
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
There may be a surprise later.

393
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Surprise?

394
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Didn't you tell me we were going to talk about the board meeting?

395
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Wait a minute.

396
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Nan Qi.

397
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I keep everything about you.

398
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Like the chain.

399
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
For so many years.

400
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I have never forgotten you.

401
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I brought you here today.

402
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I want to tell you the truth.

403
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Nan Qi.

404
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Give me another chance.

405
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
You should cherish Li Na.

406
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It's all because you came back.

407
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
And...

408
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
And after I met you again.

409
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I know.

410
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
The person I love is you.

411
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Li Na, I will tell her.

412
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
For you.

413
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I don't want the company.

414
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I don't want everything now.

415
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I don't want anything.

416
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Nine.

417
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,220
No more

418
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,000
telling器

419
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
neglect

420
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I'll just take it as a compensation for my past, okay?

421
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Is it really just a matter of power between us?

422
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Seeing these now, I think of another person.

423
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Thank you for making me understand this.

424
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Is it Qin Shiqi?

425
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,040
Okay, then let's do it.

426
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,000
Let's have a look first andDon't be ἀło investigation.

427
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,400
Never mind.

428
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
You say too much.

429
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Tell me the truth

430
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Do you really like Qin Shiqi?

431
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Not finely.

432
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
You love her.

433
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
What do you need to say now?

434
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,180
Your love is mine,

435
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,000
and it will not be disappeared,

436
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
wherever.

437
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Let's clear this up.

438
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,660
Dismiss.

439
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,300
You really think you should worth to pick me with that?

440
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,100
you have to get the blessings from people around you.

441
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,540
You will only lose each other

442
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,940
sooner or later.

443
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,260
Listen to me.

444
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:12,900
Listen to me.

445
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,900
Listen to me.

446
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,900
Listen to me.

447
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:17,940
Are you there?

448
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,220
Let's have a midnight snack later.

449
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:21,540
Come on.

450
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,100
Go after your happiness.

451
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,220
Calm down.

452
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,020
You must think it through.

453
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,380
Wait for me.

454
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,900
I'll be right back.

455
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:35,940
Thank you, boss.

456
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,460
Thank you.

457
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,540
You're welcome.

458
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,540
I'm glad you came.

459
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,860
It's been years.

460
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,660
Yes, it is.

461
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:44,820
It is.

462
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,700
I didn't expect

463
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,220
I would become a big star

464
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,140
with the kid behind you.

465
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,100
No, boss.

466
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,060
It's a public occasion.

467
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,260
Don't say it.

468
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:57,980
Enjoy your meal.

469
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,420
I'll go back to my work.

470
00:22:59,420 --> 00:22:59,900
Okay.

471
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:00,580
Thank you, boss.

472
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,060
Wait.

473
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,260
Seriously,

474
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,100
it's a public occasion.

475
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,660
It's okay for you to eat here.

476
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,660
You don't understand.

477
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,340
The more lively the place is,

478
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,500
the less people recognize it.

479
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:13,660
Really?

480
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,860
But are you done with your work today?

481
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,260
Kind of.

482
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,340
Nanxi,

483
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,660
I have something to tell you.

484
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,940
I have something to tell you too.

485
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,620
Go ahead.

486
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,420
You go first.

487
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,540
Actually, I and Keke...

488
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,740
You and Keke?

489
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,180
You and Keke are good friends.

490
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,020
You're thinking too much, Nanxi.

491
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,900
We're just friends.

492
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:47,980
Nothing else.

493
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,980
Actually,

494
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:00,220
I've always had a girl I like.

495
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,340
I'm not sure if I can be her girlfriend.

496
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:05,420
I'm not sure if I can be her girlfriend.

497
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,100
Nanxi,

498
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,420
are you listening?

499
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:13,620
Yes.

500
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,020
You...

501
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,260
You have a girl you like.

502
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:18,860
She's pretty good.

503
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,820
You don't want to know who she is?

504
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,420
I don't know.

505
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:27,780
Okay.

506
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,420
I'll tell you

507
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,820
my story with her.

508
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:36,020
When I first met her,

509
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:39,420
she was just a normal girl.

510
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,500
But I fell in love with her at first sight.

511
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,500
She didn't care about how I looked,

512
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,660
or what others thought of me.

513
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,900
I wanted to protect her.

514
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,460
I wanted to stick to her every day.

515
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,660
No matter what others thought of me,

516
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,420
I wanted to be with her.

517
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,980
I never had the courage to confess to her.

518
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,180
Nanxi,

519
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,620
do you think I should give up?

520
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,180
Is it possible that you two are not suitable at all?

521
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,220
There's nothing suitable.

522
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,260
Only whether it's enough or not.

523
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,500
When I look at her now,

524
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,980
I think about

525
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,580
whether she's happy

526
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,340
and tired from work.

527
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,580
How is she doing today?

528
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,540
Even if a man shows up by her side,

529
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,420
I'll be jealous.

530
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,460
Sometimes,

531
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,740
you can't just ignore

532
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,100
the things that are in your head.

533
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,380
I'm not sure

534
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,580
what it feels like to like someone.

535
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:51,220
The feeling of liking someone

536
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,500
is to be able to look at her every day.

537
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,060
Just like you sitting in front of me.

538
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:58,900
You...

539
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,540
You're making fun of your sister.

540
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,460
She's not my sister.

541
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,780
Sheng Siqi's sister.

542
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:08,500
Nanxi,

543
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,420
if I say that person

544
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:14,900
is you...

545
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:26,540
Siqi,

546
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,300
you're still young.

547
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,980
You have time

548
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,620
to find your own happiness.

549
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,460
You'll definitely have a better choice.

550
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,500
Besides, your sister and I are so close.

551
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,620
How can we...

552
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,020
What's wrong with my brother and sister?

553
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:42,860
They're not scumbags.

554
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,740
I'm reliable.

555
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,220
Don't be angry with the kids.

556
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,420
Just give up.

557
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:48,780
We...

558
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,620
It'll be hard for us to do this.

559
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,740
I knew your attitude.

560
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,180
I was just kidding.

561
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,180
Come on, let's drink.

562
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,340
You're making fun of me?

563
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,100
Drink it all.

564
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,340
Then...

565
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:34,500
Nothing we made is I close to you

566
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,660
Close to you

567
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,380
With you

568
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,900
Slow down.

569
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,900
We're here.

570
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,220
Here we are.

571
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,140
Slow down.

572
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,340
Don't go.

573
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,340
Don't you think

574
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:09,500
I'm a little silly?

575
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,380
You're not silly.

576
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,780
Not at all.

577
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:22,220
Then I'll change...

578
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,260
Change my clothes.

579
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:25,980
Well...

580
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,300
Sister Nanxi.

581
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,500
I'll put my clothes here.

582
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,780
You can change.

583
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:34,900
I'll go now.

584
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,580
hatchet

585
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,860
No way.

586
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,660
I must have drunk too much toыш

587
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,260
I'm sorry.

588
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,660
I'm sorry.

589
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,420
You came all the way here

590
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,340
just to keep staring at me?

591
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,860
Of course not.

592
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:04,820
Tell me.

593
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,420
Is it about Gu Nanxi?

594
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,300
I'll tell you one last time.

595
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,780
Stay away from Gu Nanxi.

596
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,740
Don't hurt her anymore.

597
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,300
Don't harass her anymore.

598
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,140
How did she get here all these years?

599
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,100
I watched her from the start.

600
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,020
No one knows her better than I do.

601
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,860
And you are engaged now.

602
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,180
Stop making trouble for her.

603
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,980
Do you know her well?

604
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,500
I used to do wrong things.

605
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,940
But this time, I want to make up for it.

606
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,180
No matter how you make up for it,

607
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,380
it's useless.

608
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,700
In this world,

609
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,100
no man

610
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,260
knows her better than I do.

611
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,860
If you feel guilty,

612
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,060
stay away from her.

613
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,020
Lin Jiaxin

614
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:21,300
이

615
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,500
Yes, she's not like her.

616
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,900
Of course not.

617
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,500
I think she's just a lady.

618
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,300
To be honest,

619
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:34,300
the company's performance this year is very good.

620
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:37,500
I think it's all because of Mr. Xiao.

621
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,900
Li Na is always unquestionable.

622
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,900
She's the chairman.

623
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,900
No matter how she is, she's not right.

624
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,500
If this continues,

625
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,300
even if she tires Mr. Xiao to death,

626
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,700
she still can't take away

627
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,700
all the people here.

628
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,700
Mr. Li is right.

629
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,500
But this company has Li Na's father

630
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,900
to start it.

631
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,300
The chairman is gone.

632
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,300
But if we say Li Na is like this,

633
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,900
it will be a little rude.

634
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,700
Business is like a battlefield.

635
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,500
Don't do business if you want to be polite.

636
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,300
Do you have to destroy the reformation?

637
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,700
Is this what you deserve?

638
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,300
I want to thank all the shareholders

639
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,100
for their approval of my work.

640
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,700
Li Na may be a little bit willful,

641
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,300
but the company is the old chairman's hard work.

642
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,900
If we do this,

643
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,300
the old chairman will be very angry.

644
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,900
Now, the domestic jewelry market

645
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,900
is no longer the same as before.

646
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,300
As far as I know,

647
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,300
many new companies

648
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,900
are doing very well.

649
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,700
If we don't change,

650
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,100
we will be finished sooner or later.

651
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,300
That's right.

652
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,100
I'm sorry, everyone.

653
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,500
I'm a little out of shape today.

654
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:01,700
I have a suggestion.

655
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,100
I think we should consider

656
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,100
to let Li Na

657
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:09,300
temporarily leave the position of chairman.

658
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,500
She can go to other positions,

659
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,500
or even go to the grassroots

660
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,300
to accumulate experience.

661
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,500
Or,

662
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,300
she can go abroad

663
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,700
to study,

664
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,300
create and study.

665
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,700
When she has the experience,

666
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,700
she can sit back in the position of chairman.

667
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,900
I think this is

668
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,500
a very good arrangement

669
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,900
for both Kai Ge and all of you here,

670
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,100
even Li Na.

671
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,500
What do you think?

672
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,220
Maybe

673
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,900
no matter how good the money is,

674
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,800
the money means Sy distinction

675
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,700
and shine is order.

676
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,300
I'm Seung Gi,

677
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,100
a fortune teller.

678
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,200
I like to sight read arrival.

679
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,100
Afteres spite endured,

680
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:02,100
backstab and make mistakes.

681
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,400
I'm always an alert.

682
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,100
Whether it'll be right or left,

683
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,300
whether not,

684
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:11,200
not caring for love and hate,

685
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:45,200
You are the brightest in the world, the brightest in the universe

686
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,200
You are the best in the world

687
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:53,200
I miss you day and night, only because I want to hold you

688
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:57,200
My world is because of you

689
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:01,200
The snow is falling, the stars are burning

690
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,200
Let the whole world have romance

691
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,200
And I'm more greedy now

692
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,200
I turn around and kiss you

693
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,200
You are the brightest in the world, the brightest in the universe

694
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,200
The calm sea also raises waves

695
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,200
I miss you day and night, only because I want to walk forward

696
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,200
My world is because of you

697
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,200
Warm

698
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,200
The cold sea also raises waves

699
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,200
I miss you day and night, only because I want to walk forward

700
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,200
My world is because of you

701
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,200
Warm
