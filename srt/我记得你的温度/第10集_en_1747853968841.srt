00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,860
1 year ago

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,160
Can't understand the separation with me

3
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,560
In my arms, who are you talking about

4
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,960
How can you hide in my soft heart

5
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,320
I want to be closer to you, but your little stars

6
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,680
Always surrounding you, never leaving, never leaving

7
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,040
I want to be closer to you, to protect your secret

8
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,640
I will keep looking for you

9
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,720
I will be with you for the rest of my life

10
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,160
I want to be closer to you, but your little stars

11
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,600
Always surrounding you, never leaving, never leaving

12
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,000
I want to be closer to you, to protect your secret

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,040
I will keep looking for you

14
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,080
I will be with you for the rest of my life

15
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,000
To protect you

16
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,920
Hello, Shu Guo

17
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,040
Hello, there

18
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,320
Hello, Shu Guo

19
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,080
Seriously

20
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,480
I heard that you are very good at my work

21
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,600
Don't worry

22
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,920
At least till I reach home

23
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,920
Why are you discussing it?

24
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,160
Li Na.

25
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,320
Everyone here

26
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,880
has been working hard

27
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,360
with your father

28
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,680
all these years.

29
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,800
We've witnessed

30
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,840
the growth of Kai Ge.

31
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,160
We can say that your father and I

32
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,120
are family

33
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,520
or even relatives.

34
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,600
So today,

35
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,760
let's talk about

36
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,080
what we said to each other.

37
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,000
I think in this situation,

38
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,800
you'd better take the initiative to step down.

39
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,920
It's good for everyone.

40
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,840
Brother Zheng Ling,

41
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,400
I'll step down.

42
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,080
You can do it.

43
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,040
Well,

44
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,120
we need to discuss it with the board.

45
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:44,880
Yes.

46
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,640
You know that there's a board meeting.

47
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,480
Well,

48
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,880
if you want to remove me from the board,

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,280
at least we need to discuss it

50
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,760
with the board before we make a decision.

51
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,960
You shouldn't be the one

52
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,320
who's making a fuss here.

53
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,680
Li Na.

54
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,400
You must do this.

55
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,120
And know it lookin' watering.

56
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,720
You watch laughing 큰 business well.

57
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,520
It's your turn.

58
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,320
I'll say it.

59
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,200
Besides,

60
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:24,880
in this case,

61
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,320
I don't think

62
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,080
many people

63
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,200
can say they want to push me away from the board.

64
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:30,720
Well,

65
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,280
you're not following the rules

66
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,280
Li Na.

67
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,280
What Mr. Li said

68
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,280
may be a little hard to understand.

69
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,280
But it's not unreasonable.

70
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,280
We need to learn

71
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,280
a lot of things.

72
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,280
Li Na,

73
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,280
the situation is very bad.

74
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,280
I see.

75
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,280
I think

76
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,280
you'd better withdraw.

77
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,280
Of course,

78
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,280
we'll keep your equity for you.

79
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,280
Okay?

80
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,280
Brother Chunlin,

81
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,280
don't worry.

82
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,280
The number of votes

83
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,280
hasn't been over half yet.

84
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,280
These are all department directors

85
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,280
who are in charge of technical shares.

86
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,280
They don't need to

87
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,280
invest in shareholders.

88
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,280
No.

89
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,280
You can't say that.

90
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,280
Since you've acquired equity,

91
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,280
you're all the shareholders of Brother Kai.

92
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,280
Don't let them talk.

93
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,280
Brother Chunlin,

94
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,280
are you a little

95
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,280
professional?

96
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,280
Okay.

97
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,280
Please.

98
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,280
I don't know much about management.

99
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,280
I just came to the company.

100
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,280
I don't know much about management.

101
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,280
I'll withdraw.

102
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,280
I object.

103
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,280
Han,

104
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,280
I like you very much.

105
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,280
Because you never lie.

106
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,280
Sister-in-law,

107
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,280
why did you suddenly say that?

108
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,280
Because you can't hide it from me.

109
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,280
You know that, right?

110
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,280
Tell me.

111
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,280
What's your plan?

112
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,280
What's going on

113
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,280
with Gu Nanxi?

114
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,280
Sister-in-law,

115
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,280
I don't understand what you're talking about.

116
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,280
Nothing happened.

117
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,280
Don't think too much.

118
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,280
I'm at home with your brother.

119
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,280
Nothing happened.

120
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,280
Your brother just said

121
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,280
he would accompany you for a few more days.

122
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,280
I just found a reason.

123
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,280
You just accepted it.

124
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,280
And you said it's okay.

125
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,280
Han,

126
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,280
where did everything

127
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,280
you and your brother have come from?

128
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,280
Where did it come from?

129
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,280
Your brother doesn't know.

130
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,280
Don't you understand?

131
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,280
Sister-in-law, I'm wrong.

132
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,280
I've persuaded my brother about Gu Nanxi.

133
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,280
But don't worry.

134
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,280
My brother is really for work.

135
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,280
They broke up a long time ago.

136
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,280
Break up?

137
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,280
This has nothing to do with my brother.

138
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,280
It must be that Gu Nanxi

139
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,280
came back to my brother.

140
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,280
I've never questioned

141
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,280
your brother's feelings for me.

142
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,280
But now it seems

143
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,280
your brother is completely

144
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,280
fascinated by Gu Nanxi.

145
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,280
Sister-in-law,

146
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,280
you must believe my brother.

147
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,280
He is wholeheartedly loyal to you.

148
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,280
I don't know your brother yet.

149
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,280
But Han,

150
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,280
you have to help your brother.

151
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,280
You can't let him be so present.

152
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,280
If you lose me,

153
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,280
you and your brother,

154
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,280
even your family,

155
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,280
what will it be like?

156
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,280
You should be more clear than me.

157
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,280
I know, sister-in-law.

158
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,280
As long as you can help my brother,

159
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,280
I will do my best.

160
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,280
I'd like to see

161
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,280
what that Gu Nanxi

162
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,280
really wants to do.

163
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,280
You keep an eye on your brother and Gu Nanxi

164
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,280
in the company.

165
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,280
If anything happens,

166
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,280
report to me immediately.

167
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,280
Look, Brother Chunlin.

168
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,280
It seems that

169
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,280
everyone's opinions

170
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,280
are not consistent with yours.

171
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,280
Since I am still

172
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,280
the president of Brother Kai,

173
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,280
let's call it a day.

174
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,280
I won't waste your time.

175
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,280
Brother Chunlin.

176
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,280
Ten minutes later,

177
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,280
the coffee downstairs in the company will be stopped.

178
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,280
Li Na,

179
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,280
I underestimated you.

180
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,280
Do you think

181
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,280
you won today,

182
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,280
and you can sit in this position?

183
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,280
Brother Chunlin,

184
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,280
you misunderstood me.

185
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,280
Actually, I asked you to stay

186
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,280
to talk about your business.

187
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,280
My business?

188
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,280
What business do I have?

189
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,280
Look,

190
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,280
you have been in the company for so many years.

191
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,280
You have suffered a lot.

192
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,280
Is it time

193
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,280
to find a place

194
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,280
to spend the holiday

195
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,280
and get old?

196
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,280
Me?

197
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,280
Getting old?

198
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,280
What do you mean?

199
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,280
I mean,

200
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,280
all the shares in your hands,

201
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,280
I bought them at the price of three times the original share.

202
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,280
Is that enough?

203
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,280
You are easy to retreat.

204
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,280
Keep your three times.

205
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,280
It's not that easy.

206
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,280
Brother Chunlin,

207
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,280
don't worry.

208
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,280
Don't rush to return me.

209
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,280
I really do it for your own good.

210
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,280
No need.

211
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,280
Look at this first.

212
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,280
Do you want to answer?

213
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,280
You are not familiar with this, right?

214
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,280
You have been in the company for so many years.

215
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,280
How much did you lose?

216
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,280
Don't you know?

217
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,280
If I give this to the police,

218
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,280
will you get through the prison?

219
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,280
Then you might have to

220
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,280
work in the prison.

221
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,280
I don't know.

222
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,280
I don't know.

223
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,280
I don't know.

224
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,280
I don't know.

225
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,280
I don't know.

226
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,280
So,

227
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,280
do you want to consider my suggestion again?

228
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,280
When did you get together with Li Na?

229
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,280
Brother,

230
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,280
I really just want to help you.

231
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,280
Believe me, Li Na really loves you.

232
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,280
Help me?

233
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,280
You did this for this position, right?

234
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,280
We have done so much for the Kaige Jewelry.

235
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,280
Now we have everything we deserve.

236
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,280
Xiao Han,

237
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,280
if it weren't for you,

238
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,280
the whole Kaige Jewelry would be mine.

239
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,280
At first, for this family,

240
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,280
I even abandoned Gu Nanxi.

241
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,280
I have endured so many years

242
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,280
just to be the Kaige's co-founder.

243
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,280
I never thought,

244
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,280
never thought

245
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,280
that you would ruin my plan.

246
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,280
Brother, believe me.

247
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,280
I really just told Li Na about Gu Nanxi.

248
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,280
I promise

249
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,280
that she knows nothing about you.

250
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,280
She knows nothing?

251
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,280
I guess Li Chunlin has left the company now.

252
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,280
I am the next one.

253
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,280
Because after I leave,

254
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,280
Li Na will leave you.

255
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,280
Then...

256
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,280
Then I will beg her.

257
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,280
I will beg her.

258
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,280
Is this okay?

259
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,280
No need.

260
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,280
It's too late.

261
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,280
I advise you

262
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,280
to resign yourself.

263
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,280
What should I do?

264
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,280
I will die every day.

265
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,280
I am getting more and more confused.

266
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,280
Why did Zhou Baoyan arrange this?

267
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,280
Coming.

268
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,280
Hurry up. Sit down.

269
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,280
Why haven't you left?

270
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,280
What are you doing?

271
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,280
I have a lot of things to do.

272
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,280
I bought you coffee.

273
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,280
And the biggest thing for you now

274
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,280
is me.

275
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,280
Okay.

276
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,280
Tell me.

277
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,280
I am listening.

278
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,280
I confessed yesterday.

279
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,280
Confessed?

280
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,280
I am not going to tell you.

281
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,280
I am not going to tell you.

282
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,280
Confessed?

283
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,280
Confessed.

284
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,280
But I don't think I confessed.

285
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,280
What do you mean?

286
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,280
Did you confess or not?

287
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,280
I think about it.

288
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,280
I didn't confess.

289
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,280
Oh my god.

290
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,280
Then what did you say?

291
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,280
I told her I like you.

292
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,280
And then?

293
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,280
And then I saw her reaction was a little strange.

294
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,280
I told her I was kidding.

295
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,280
Go.

296
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,280
Have you arranged everything about the jewelry party?

297
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,280
Great.

298
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,280
Everyone is looking forward to it.

299
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,280
I just think it's a little strange.

300
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,280
Strange?

301
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,280
What's strange?

302
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,280
It's about Yihai Jewelry and Kai Ge Jewelry.

303
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,280
No.

304
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,280
Everyone thinks it's normal.

305
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,280
I am sorry.

306
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,280
I didn't mean to do that.

307
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,280
I didn't mean to do that.

308
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,280
I didn't mean to do that.

309
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,280
Yufan.

310
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,280
Do you think

311
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,280
Shiqi is interested in Nanxi?

312
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,280
They two?

313
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,280
Impossible.

314
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,280
Absolutely impossible.

315
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,280
Shiqi is more dependent on Nanxi.

316
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,280
She definitely doesn't mean what you said.

317
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,280
Maybe I think too much.

318
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,280
You think too much.

319
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,280
I think

320
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,280
Shiqi and Kai Ge are more compatible.

321
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,280
What's Shiqi's attitude towards Kai Ge?

322
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,280
I don't know.

323
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,280
I asked Shiqi.

324
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,280
She never gave me a positive answer.

325
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,280
I hope I made the right decision this time.

326
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,280
I think it's like this.

327
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,280
Because I like someone.

328
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,280
I can't hide my eyes.

329
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,280
Do you think she likes me

330
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,280
but doesn't show it on purpose?

331
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,280
I think you don't care

332
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,280
who is proactive and who is not.

333
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,280
As a man,

334
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,280
what can you do if you are proactive?

335
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,280
Right?

336
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,280
Just like now.

337
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,280
Everyone is off work.

338
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,280
Right?

339
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,280
You can send her a message at this time.

340
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,280
Are you off work?

341
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,280
Did you have dinner?

342
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,280
Do you want to have dinner together?

343
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,280
That's good.

344
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,280
Good idea.

345
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,280
I'll send her a message.

346
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,280
Do you want to have dinner together?

347
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,280
Sure.

348
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,280
Okay.

349
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,280
Let's go.

350
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,280
What are you doing?

351
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,280
Do you want to have dinner together?

352
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,280
Don't you want to have dinner together?

353
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,280
You are proactive.

354
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,280
You can work overtime today.

355
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,280
I'll go first.

356
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,280
I'll go first.

357
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,280
Do you think you can work overtime

358
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,280
by relying on Li Chunlin?

359
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,280
I'm really confused.

360
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,280
I'm really confused.

361
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,280
I'm used by him.

362
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,280
Used by him?

363
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,280
Leader.

364
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,280
I can't betray you

365
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,280
even if I have to.

366
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,280
I've always believed

367
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,280
in your feelings for me all these years.

368
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,280
But these days,

369
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,280
I'm hesitating.

370
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,280
Li Na, I admit

371
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,280
that the company's things

372
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,280
have made me feel a little out of breath

373
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,280
and neglected your feelings.

374
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,280
But...

375
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,280
Do you know what I'm talking about?

376
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,280
It's not about the company.

377
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,280
Do you know about Gu Nanxi?

378
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,280
It's all in the past.

379
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,280
Zeyuan.

380
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,280
Do you really think I don't know anything?

381
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,280
Li Na, it's not what you think.

382
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,280
I know Gu Nanxi's power.

383
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,280
She did bring benefits to the company.

384
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,280
I hired her to the company

385
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,280
for only one reason.

386
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,280
It's for our future.

387
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,280
Li Na,

388
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,280
I know what I did

389
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,280
has disappointed you.

390
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,280
As long as you're happy,

391
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,280
you can do anything for me.

392
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,280
I can leave Kai Ge.

393
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,280
Okay.

394
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,280
From now on,

395
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,280
you're only Kai Ge's shareholder.

396
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,280
You don't have to ask about the company.

397
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,280
I think you need some time

398
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,280
to prepare for our wedding.

399
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,280
Okay.

400
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,280
As long as you're happy,

401
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,280
I'll listen to your arrangement.

402
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,280
From now on,

403
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,280
thank you for your hard work.

404
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,280
This design draft

405
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,280
may need to be revised.

406
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,280
Okay, go ahead.

407
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,280
Okay.

408
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,280
Na Qi.

409
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,280
What's wrong?

410
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,280
I heard that

411
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,280
Li Na was very angry

412
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,280
about the shareholders' meeting.

413
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,280
So,

414
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,280
Mr. Xiao

415
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,280
shouldn't be coming to the company recently.

416
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,280
By the way,

417
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,280
Li Na is waiting for you in the office.

418
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,280
I don't know what she wants from you.

419
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,280
Okay, go ahead.

420
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,280
Li Na.

421
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,280
You're here so early.

422
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,280
Yes.

423
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,280
I haven't been in the management office for a long time.

424
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,280
I suddenly feel a little uncomfortable.

425
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,280
Sit down.

426
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,280
Nan Xi.

427
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,280
You're the one

428
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,280
that Mr. Xiao invited, right?

429
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,280
How long have you known each other?

430
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,280
We...

431
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,280
We've known each other for a long time.

432
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,280
We've been together for a long time.

433
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,280
I'm sorry.

434
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,280
I'm sorry.

435
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,280
We've known each other for a long time.

436
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,280
But we haven't been in touch for five years.

437
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,280
And if it weren't for Ma Ti Lian,

438
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,280
we wouldn't have had a chance to meet.

439
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,280
But as far as I know,

440
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,280
Mr. Xiao is very special to you.

441
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,280
When you were promoted,

442
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,280
he gave you a lot of shares.

443
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,280
I heard from Mr. Xiao

444
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,280
that it was a benefit

445
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,280
for every senior employee

446
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,280
in the company.

447
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,280
Is there any problem?

448
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,280
These shares are not a problem.

449
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,280
It's just...

450
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,280
You can say it straight.

451
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,280
It's okay.

452
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,280
But as far as I know,

453
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,280
besides the shares of these directors,

454
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,280
he also gave you a lot of shares.

455
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,280
Yes, there is such a thing.

456
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,280
Then I'll say it straight.

457
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,280
Nan Xi.

458
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,280
I want you to transfer

459
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,280
these shares to me.

460
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,280
The price is easy to discuss.

461
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,280
No, Li Na.

462
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,280
When Mr. Xiao signed the contract with me,

463
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,280
we agreed

464
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,280
that these shares

465
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,280
are actually his.

466
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,280
I was there for him for a while.

467
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,280
Nan Xi.

468
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,280
You know that.

469
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,280
Now I'm the president of the company.

470
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,280
I need you to take care of these shares.

471
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,280
Is it better

472
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,280
for you to discuss this matter

473
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,280
with Mr. Xiao directly?

474
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,280
Because after all,

475
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,280
all the rights are still his.

476
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,280
I can't make this decision.

477
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,280
Nan Xi, you have to know

478
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,280
that the entire Kai Ge

479
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,280
and the entire company are mine.

480
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,280
I understand.

481
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,280
But I have my own principles.

482
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,280
Please understand.

483
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,280
Okay.

484
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,280
I respect your principles.

485
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,280
You can take it as I didn't say it.

486
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,280
You have to be careful.

487
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,280
Xiao Rui is chasing you

488
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,280
and giving you shares.

489
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,280
He even asked you to be the president of Kai Ge.

490
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,280
You should return the shares to Li Na.

491
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,280
After all, the entire Kai Ge is his.

492
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,280
That's right.

493
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,280
I think so too.

494
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,280
Xiao Rui's contract

495
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,280
said that I would give him the loan.

496
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,280
Who knows who said that?

497
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,280
So I made a new contract

498
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,280
and I want to return all the loans.

499
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,280
Nice.

500
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,280
You're as smart as me.

501
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,280
But will Li Na misunderstand you

502
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,280
and give you more money?

503
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,280
I don't care what she thinks.

504
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,280
I explained everything to her

505
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,280
in the company today.

506
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,280
No matter what she thinks,

507
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,280
it's none of my business.

508
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,280
It's been a long time since I saw Leng Ran.

509
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,280
What is she busy with?

510
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,280
She's busy with Wan Yan.

511
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,280
But when she's done,

512
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,280
she'll have time to spend with me.

513
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,280
Leng Ran

514
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,280
Yu Fan.

515
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,280
Yu Fan.

516
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,280
Why are you still here?

517
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,280
It's almost too late.

518
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,280
I'd better not go.

519
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,280
I can't help you with anything.

520
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,280
I have to distract you.

521
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,280
But it's such a big celebration.

522
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,280
I still want to join with you.

523
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,280
Be good.

524
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,280
You should behave yourself.

525
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,280
I'll cheer you up at home.

526
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,280
I'll celebrate with you when you come back.

527
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,280
Don't be so fast.

528
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,280
Come on.

529
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,280
Give me your hand.

530
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,280
Come on.

531
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,280
Go.

532
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,280
Come on.

533
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,280
Come on.

534
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,280
Come on.

535
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,280
You're alive.

536
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,280
Come on.

537
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,280
Didn't you say you wanted to play?

538
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,280
Stop playing.

539
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,280
It'll get deeper.

540
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,280
Let's go.

541
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,280
Sister.

542
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,280
Sister.

543
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,280
Sister.

544
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,280
Sister.

545
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,280
So handsome.

546
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,280
Sister.

547
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,280
Sister.

548
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,280
Sister.

549
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,280
Sister.

550
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,280
Sister.

551
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,280
Sister.

552
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,280
Sister.

553
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,280
Sister.

554
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,280
Sister.

555
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,280
Sister.

556
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,280
Sister.

557
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,280
Sister.

558
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,280
Come on.

559
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,280
Come on.

560
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,280
Come on.

561
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,280
Come on.

562
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,280
What's that?

563
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,280
So mysterious.

564
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,280
It's nothing.

565
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,280
Ke'er.

566
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,280
You…

567
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,280
So beautiful.

568
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,280
Who sent you here?

569
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,280
Give it to me.

570
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,280
What happened?

571
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,280
Nothing.

572
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,280
Listen to me.

573
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,640
Shi Qi asked me to buy this.

574
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,440
Don't let her know

575
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,440
that you saw me.

576
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,480
Shi Qi.

577
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,400
I'm leaving.

578
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,400
I thought the necklace

579
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,120
was given to me by Shi Qi.

580
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,880
I'm being too self-willed.

581
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,400
I'm not as good as

582
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,960
Nan Xi.

583
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,760
This necklace suits you.

584
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,160
It's her honor to wear it.

585
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,520
I just thought

586
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,520
it would go well with her clothes.

587
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:12,600
Let's go.

588
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:13,920
Look.

589
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,840
This way.

590
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,840
Sorry, sir.

591
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,040
Mr. Qi Shi Qi.

592
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,040
The way you attended the dinner was special.

593
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,040
Is there any meaning to it?

594
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,920
I thought I would go to the red carpet twice.

595
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,520
But I still followed

596
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,280
the host's advice.

597
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,240
We all know

598
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,760
that the new products of Kaige Jewelry

599
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,280
are very popular.

600
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,240
And the harmony between you and

601
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,760
the designer Gu Nan Xi is also very high.

602
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,440
This time, I arranged for you three

603
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,560
to go out together.

604
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,240
Is it on purpose?

605
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,040
First of all, I'm very grateful

606
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,040
to the two companies for choosing me.

607
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,280
Like Yi Hai Jewelry,

608
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,240
they have always been my partners.

609
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,400
And Kaige Jewelry

610
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,360
is also the number one and number two

611
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,520
jewelry company in China.

612
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,920
The host also feels very sorry

613
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,160
about how I will go to the red carpet.

614
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,440
Fortunately, I went down once.

615
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,120
These jewelry

616
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,720
are new products that Yi Hai is about to sell.

617
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,800
This time, I will use the opportunity of Lisa's dinner

618
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,160
to show them to you.

619
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,080
Oh my god.

620
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:14,840
I didn't expect that

621
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,800
we would see the new products of Yi Hai Jewelry

622
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,600
in Lisa's dinner.

623
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,840
This is a big exclusive.

624
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,080
This time, the ad is not for sale.

625
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,760
I'll put it on for you.

626
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,480
It's so beautiful.

627
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,600
This is so beautiful.

628
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,840
This is so beautiful.

629
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,040
This is so beautiful.

630
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,240
This is so beautiful.

631
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,600
This is so beautiful.

632
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,840
This is so beautiful.

633
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,120
This is so beautiful.

634
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,160
This is so beautiful.

635
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,280
Thank you.

636
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,280
Welcome.

637
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,320
This way.

638
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,320
This way.

639
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,600
Are we going back now?

640
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,520
I'm a little afraid.

641
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,760
I don't like crowded places.

642
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,560
No.

643
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,960
You did very well today.

644
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,360
And everyone is very interested

645
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,120
in your design.

646
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:13,840
I'm still good at

647
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,600
doing design at home.

648
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,640
This kind of thing

649
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,640
doesn't suit me.

650
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,000
Now, there are not many people

651
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,920
who are so serious about creating

652
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,920
like you.

653
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,920
No.

654
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,520
Why didn't Yufan see him?

655
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,320
He didn't come.

656
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,520
How could that be?

657
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,560
He used to like this kind of

658
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,560
lively place the most.

659
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,600
He told me

660
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,560
he didn't want me to be distracted.

661
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,160
Yufan really changed for you.

662
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,360
You guys are developing so fast.

663
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,360
Once Ai Qing comes,

664
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,360
she really doesn't make sense.

665
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,360
I'm leaving now.

666
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,360
Okay.

667
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,360
Sister Nanxi.

668
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,960
Shiqi.

669
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,360
Brother-in-law.

670
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,360
Sister Nanxi, why are you here?

671
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,360
I've been looking for you inside for a long time.

672
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,360
I'm a little tired.

673
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,360
I'm going to leave.

674
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,360
You're leaving now?

675
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,360
Let me see you out.

676
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,360
No need.

677
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,360
You can play your game.

678
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,360
No need.

679
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,360
I'll see you out.

680
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,360
Let's go.

681
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,360
Brother-in-law, we're leaving.

682
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,360
Okay.

683
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,360
Okay.

684
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,360
Go.

685
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,360
It's not appropriate for you

686
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,360
to come out like this, is it?

687
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,360
How is it not appropriate?

688
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,360
Anyway, I don't like

689
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,360
that place very much.

690
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,360
But you didn't

691
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,360
tell K如 at all.

692
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,040
What's wrong?

693
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,480
Nothing.

694
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,800
It's an old problem.

695
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:43,840
My stomach hurts.

696
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:45,920
Your stomach hurts?

697
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,680
Why don't we go to the hospital?

698
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,520
No, no.

699
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,560
No need to go to the hospital.

700
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,600
I'm not that delicate.

701
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,560
Why don't you go to my house

702
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,320
and take some medicine?

703
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,760
I'm worried about you going back.

704
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,120
Okay.

705
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,680
What can you do all day?

706
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,600
It's such a critical moment.

707
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,640
I can't find you.

708
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,720
I'll drive for you.

709
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,560
You're so good.

710
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,640
You don't understand anything.

711
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,680
Can you pay attention to it?

712
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,320
I'm so impressed with you.

713
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,400
Let's go.

714
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:21,760
Yan Yan.

715
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,240
Ke Ke.

716
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,360
Where's Shi Qi?

717
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,360
Shi Qi?

718
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,360
She left early.

719
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,520
She left?

720
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,440
When?

721
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,000
She left

722
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,720
before we finished.

723
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,920
What's wrong?

724
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,080
Nothing.

725
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,760
I was thinking

726
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,160
about discussing the jewelry with Shi Qi.

727
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,840
She left early.

728
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:46,960
It's okay.

729
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,360
If she left,

730
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,160
I'll leave too.

731
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:49,640
Okay.

732
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,240
Why don't you go with us?

733
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:53,760
It's okay.

734
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,800
Let's go. I'll drive you.

735
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,240
Thank you.

736
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:56,880
Get in the car.

737
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:57,920
Be careful.

738
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,640
Yan Yan.

739
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,000
Where's Shi Qi?

740
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,680
She said

741
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,280
she went to see Sister Nan Xi off.

742
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,520
Then she left.

743
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,720
Sister Nan Xi?

744
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,200
It was too noisy inside.

745
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,400
She said something.

746
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,800
I didn't hear it clearly.

747
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,720
Yan Yan.

748
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,640
Stop the car here.

749
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,920
I don't have to drive you home?

750
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:42,640
No.

751
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,720
I want to walk around.

752
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,000
Okay.

753
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,240
Be careful.

754
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,160
Brother, we'll go now.

755
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,400
Bye.

756
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,360
I'm sorry, Sister Nan Xi.

757
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,600
I was going to send you home.

758
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,000
But now you're taking care of me.

759
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,280
I should tell Yu Fan.

760
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,320
No need.

761
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,440
They just finished their dinner.

762
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,440
They're having fun.

763
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,560
Don't bother them.

764
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:51,920
That's right.

765
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,840
Then you can stay here.

766
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,240
You can sleep in the room.

767
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,080
I'll sleep on the sofa.

768
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,600
No need.

769
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,040
I'll sleep on the sofa.

770
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,320
It's close to the toilet.

771
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,320
I can use the toilet.

772
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,640
It's okay, Sister Nan Xi.

773
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,480
I'm just an old stomach disease.

774
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,040
I'm just an old stomach disease.

775
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,160
I'll be fine in a while.

776
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,480
I'll make you millet porridge.

777
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,480
No need, Sister Nan Xi.

778
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,120
I'll just rest.

779
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,480
Okay.

780
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,640
Look at you.

781
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,720
Have a good rest.

782
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,520
I'll find you some medicine.

783
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,040
Okay.

784
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,040
The wind blows people and那麼

785
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:54,880
The girl

786
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,720
The wind brings someone be

787
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:03,440
Where the kiss and state of mind

788
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,000
Crow New Year

789
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,480
I'm so lonely.

790
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,480
It's the best wish in the world.

791
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,480
Day and night, I miss you.

792
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,480
Only because I'm walking forward,

793
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,480
my world is because of you.

794
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,480
The snow is slowly melting.

795
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,480
Let the whole world be romantic.

796
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:59,480
And I'm more greedy now.

797
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:03,480
Surrounding you, I turn around.

798
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,480
The world is so colorful.

799
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,480
It's so cold in the universe.

800
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:11,480
The calm sea of mountains and seas is also blue.

801
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,480
Day and night, I miss you.

802
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,480
Only because I'm walking forward,

803
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,480
my world is because of you.

804
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,480
It's warm.
