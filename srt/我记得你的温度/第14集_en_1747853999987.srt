00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
My technology has Для Une영

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:04,760
But I can't help you

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,840
Do you care As long as I tell you

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:07,820
My phone number

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,100
I don't think it ASMs

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:13,680
Great

7
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,160
But I want to tell you

8
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,160
I want to be closer to you

9
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,160
and guard your secret

10
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,160
I will keep looking for you

11
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,160
I am waiting for you

12
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,160

and be your little star

14
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,160

I will stay here and keep you company

18
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:19,160
I want to be closer to you

19
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,160
and keep you secret

20
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,160
I will keep looking for you

21
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:31,160
I want to be with you forever

22
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,160
and protect you

23
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,160
Episode 2

24
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,160
Li Na, you want to see me?

25
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,160
I didn't expect this would happen

26
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,160
What do you mean?

27
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,160
Leng Ran asked me before

28
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,160
to say that my design

29
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,160
is similar to Yi Hai's

30
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,160
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

31
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,160
I didn't expect it to be so serious

32
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,160
Nan Xi, such an important thing

33
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,160
you didn't report to the company in advance

34
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,160
Do you have any hidden secrets?

35
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,160
Of course not

36
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,160
Are you sure your design...

37
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,160
I am sure my design has no problem

38
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,160
If necessary, I can get the evidence at any time

39
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,160
Let's think about it

40
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,160
You should handle the case

41
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,160
Since they can sue us so directly

42
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,160
it means they are sure of it

43
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,160
It's hard to deal with

44
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,160
What can I do now?

45
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,160
You go back first

46
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,160
We will talk about it

47
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,160
What are you doing?

48
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,160
When will you come back?

49
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,160
I miss you, baby

50
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,160
Hello

51
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,160
I am here

52
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,160
I am here

53
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,160
I am here

54
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,160
I am here

55
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,160
I am here

56
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,160
Hello, Nan Xi

57
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,160
Hello, Shi Qi

58
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,160
I have something to do at the company today

59
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,160
I might go back a little late

60
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,160
What's the problem? Is it serious?

61
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,160
Do you need my help?

62
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,160
No, no

63
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,160
I can solve it myself

64
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,160
Don't worry

65
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,160
That's good

66
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,160
Don't worry

67
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,160
I am here

68
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,160
I will always be your strong support

69
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,160
Okay, I know

70
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,160
Wait for me at home

71
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,160
Okay, I'll wait for you to come back

72
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,160
Hello

73
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,160
Hello

74
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,160
What's the matter?

75
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,160
Shi Qi, where are you?

76
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,160
Where can I be?

77
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,160
I am at my wife's house

78
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,160
You know it?

79
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,160
What do I know?

80
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,160
Nan Xi's company is in trouble

81
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,160
I heard about it

82
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,160
But I don't think it's that serious

83
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,160
It's nothing more serious than this

84
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,160
It's like a copy of the lawsuit

85
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,160
Lawsuit?

86
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,160
Is it that serious?

87
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,160
Yes, the whole company knows

88
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,160
Do you know which company did it?

89
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,160
Tell me, don't sell the lawsuit

90
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,160
Yi Hai Jewelry

91
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,160
Yi Hai?

92
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,160
Hello, Shi Qi

93
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,160
Where are you? I want to see you

94
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,160
Okay, I'll book a seat

95
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,160
No need

96
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,160
I'll send you the location now

97
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,160
See you later

98
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,160
Okay, see you later

99
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,160
That's great

100
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,160
Shi Qi came to me on his own

101
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,160
I can see him again

102
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,160
Shi Qi

103
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,160
I didn't expect you to ask me out

104
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,160
We haven't seen each other for a long time

105
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,160
An Keke, you know why I asked you out

106
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,160
What are you talking about?

107
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,160
I don't know

108
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,160
What's going on with Qingquan?

109
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,160
You mean this?

110
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,160
I did hear about it

111
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,160
I did hear about it

112
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,160
But I don't know what happened

113
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,160
I've told you many times

114
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,160
You're an enemy to Gu Nanxi

115
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,160
You're an enemy to me

116
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,160
Shi Qi

117
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,160
This is a company against a company

118
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,160
Not against a person

119
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,160
Then why did you use Chen Zhe as a designer?

120
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,160
Of course it's because of Chen Zhe's design

121
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,160
That moved the company

122
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,160
It's okay if you admit it

123
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,160
It's okay if you don't admit it

124
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,160
Now immediately fire Chen Zhe

125
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,160
To cancel the lawsuit against the Keke jewelry

126
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,160
Are you begging me?

127
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,160
You think so

128
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,160
Okay, I agree

129
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,160
But I have a condition

130
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,160
What condition?

131
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,160
Leave Gu Nanxi and come back to me

132
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,160
Impossible

133
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,160
It's your wishful thinking

134
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,160
There is some misunderstanding between us

135
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,160
But it has nothing to do with Gu Nanxi

136
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,160
Shi Qi

137
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:12,160
Are you begging me for another woman?

138
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,160
Other than love, anything else is fine

139
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,160
But I don't want anything else but love

140
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,160
Shi Qi

141
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,160
I beg you

142
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,160
Come back to me, okay?

143
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,160
Come back to me

144
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,160
I beg you, Shi Qi

145
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,160
I shouldn't have come to you today

146
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,160
I beg you

147
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,160
Shi Qi

148
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,160
What is he?

149
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,160
In my heart, he is good in everything

150
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,160
Gu Nanxi

151
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,160
Nanxi

152
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,160
Shi Qi

153
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,160
What are you doing?

154
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,160
It's all people, what if you are not photographed?

155
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,160
So what if there are many people?

156
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,160
Stop it, why are you here?

157
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,160
I'm afraid you are not in a good mood

158
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,160
So I come to pick you up from work

159
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,160
You know it all

160
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,160
But don't worry

161
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,160
I believe you didn't copy

162
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,160
No matter what you do, I will support you

163
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,160
Let's go

164
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,160
Go

165
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,160
Ok, I will handle it as soon as possible

166
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,160
Don't worry

167
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,160
I will continue to follow up on this

168
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,160
I will definitely reduce the impact on the company

169
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,160
Ok, bye

170
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,160
Who?

171
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,160
What happened?

172
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,160
Don't you know?

173
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,160
How can I know about your company?

174
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,160
It's not our company, it's yours

175
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,160
We?

176
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,160
Just today

177
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,160
Yi Hai Jewelry has officially sued Kai Ge Jewelry for new plagiarism

178
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,160
What?

179
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,160
You guessed it right

180
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,160
An Keke and Chen Zhe must have made a story

181
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,160
New jewelry

182
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,160
Isn't that designed by Nanxi?

183
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,160
Will Nanxi be in trouble?

184
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,160
I don't know for now

185
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,160
It's about the company and the company's level

186
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,160
I can't design it for now

187
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,160
Then Nanxi

188
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,160
I think Nanxi can't do plagiarism

189
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,160
Of course

190
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,160
Chen Zhe copied Nanxi to copy

191
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,160
Have you ever thought about it?

192
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,160
Where did Chen Zhe's design come from?

193
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,160
I don't know

194
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,160
Keke

195
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,160
Keke

196
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,160
Keke

197
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,160
If you came to me because of the lawsuit

198
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,160
I'm sorry, I don't have time

199
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,160
I'm just doing this

200
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,160
Keke, why are you doing this?

201
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,160
Kai Ge Jewelry plagiarism

202
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,160
I shouldn't sue

203
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,160
Besides, this designer is Chen Zhe

204
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,160
Why don't you go to him and come to me?

205
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,160
There must be a misunderstanding

206
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,160
Are you doing this for Kai Ge Jewelry or for Gu Nanxi?

207
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,160
Of course for Nanxi

208
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,160
This matter

209
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,160
He is the most hurt inside

210
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,160
Then I don't have this obligation

211
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,160
Keke

212
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,160
We were the best sisters before

213
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,160
Best sister

214
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,160
You really think so

215
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,160
Of course

216
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,160
Where is the good

217
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,160
Fortunately, I gave Qin Shiqi

218
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,160
Is the relationship between Gu Nanxi and Gu Nanxi exposed?

219
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,160
Some things I am willing to do for Shiqi

220
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,160
I didn't expect Shiqi to do it for Gu Nanxi

221
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,160
And you know all this

222
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,160
Come over today to question me

223
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,160
Also for Gu Nanxi

224
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,160
This is what you said

225
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,160
Best sister

226
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,160
Keke

227
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,160
You have to believe me

228
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,160
I only found out later

229
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,160
Shiqi and Nanxi

230
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,160
I believe Nanxi

231
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,160
He never plagiarized

232
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,160
You know

233
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,160
Chen Zhe is not a good person

234
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,160
I'm not only worried about Nanxi

235
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,160
I'm also worried about Yi Hai's reputation

236
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,160
I don't know why you became like this today

237
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,160
If you are for me

238
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,160
I can leave now

239
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,160
If you want to leave

240
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,160
Okay, no problem

241
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,160
Why are you still here?

242
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,160
You should be familiar with the personnel department

243
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,160
You don't need me to send you

244
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,160
No

245
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,160
Shiqi

246
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,160
I didn't expect you to come to me

247
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,160
I heard that you signed a contract with Brother Kai

248
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,160
Then there will be a family

249
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,160
Sit down

250
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,160
Stop pretending

251
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,000
What's wrong?

252
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,600
Why are you so angry

253
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,880
after meeting me?

254
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,240
What are you going to do?

255
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,160
How can you

256
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,280
give up on me?

257
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,000
I don't understand.

258
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,120
It's strange enough

259
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,520
that Yi Hai used Chen Zhe as a designer.

260
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,360
He even copied

261
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,680
Nanxi's work.

262
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,400
Who hates

263
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,960
Keike Jewelry so much?

264
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,560
Who doesn't like

265
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,760
Gu Nanxi?

266
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,480
Who can get the design draft

267
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,760
again?

268
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,760
Shi Qi,

269
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,080
you're a Chen Zhe.

270
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,800
You're an adult.

271
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,240
Adults should be responsible

272
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,160
for what they say.

273
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,040
I'm the shareholder of Keike Jewelry.

274
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,520
I can't do

275
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,520
such a thing.

276
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,560
You want to destroy Keike

277
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,280
and Gu Nanxi.

278
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,480
I think you're

279
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,200
Yu Fan and Nanxi's brother.

280
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,040
I'm not as well-educated as you are.

281
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,080
But if you dare to

282
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,240
talk nonsense,

283
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,120
don't blame me for protecting myself

284
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,320
with legal weapons.

285
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,720
What?

286
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,400
Are you going to do it?

287
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,200
I won't fight back.

288
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:04,840
Do you know

289
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,600
the standard of quantity of the two people?

290
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,560
Think about it.

291
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,400
Xiaorui,

292
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,400
listen to me.

293
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,520
The crime of plagiarism

294
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,160
will ruin Nanxi for life.

295
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,760
If you still have two fingers,

296
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,240
don't make another mistake.

297
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,200
Xiaorui,

298
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,480
it's been a long time.

299
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,760
You don't come to me every time.

300
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,080
What's the matter this time?

301
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,360
I heard about

302
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,520
Keike plagiarism.

303
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,480
If you don't handle it well this time,

304
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,600
it won't affect Keike

305
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,880
at all.

306
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,880
What about Nanxi?

307
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,480
I thought

308
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,200
you should care more about Keike.

309
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,120
I'm sure I'm worried about Keike.

310
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,680
But from what I know about Nanxi,

311
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,480
she can't do plagiarism.

312
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,160
Moreover,

313
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,920
she is very important to the law.

314
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,320
Everyone doesn't believe in Gu Nanxi plagiarism.

315
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,080
And some time ago,

316
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,480
Gu Nanxi showed me

317
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,720
her design draft.

318
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,880
Later, Yi Hai sent a new design.

319
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,360
But it's a bit similar to Gu Nanxi's design.

320
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,800
I think there's something wrong with it.

321
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,000
So you also think

322
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,240
Chen Zhe plagiarized it?

323
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,760
I just doubt it.

324
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,840
I have no evidence.

325
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,040
I'd rather believe it.

326
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,760
Keike's design draft

327
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,160
has been stored in the company's account.

328
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,040
Only the director-level manager

329
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,160
has this draft.

330
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,600
I'm wondering if Chen Zhe used this

331
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,320
to launch the design project.

332
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,640
It's more useful to tell Linda about this.

333
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,320
Actually,

334
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,840
Linda has always suspected

335
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,200
Nanxi and I have a lot of things to do.

336
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,880
So I don't want to tell her.

337
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,240
If I just tell Nanxi directly,

338
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,200
I'm afraid Linda will misunderstand.

339
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,000
Are you really just afraid of misunderstanding?

340
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,120
I've been thinking about it lately.

341
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,800
I was too greedy before.

342
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,760
Of course.

343
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,120
Please tell Nanxi

344
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,480
about this.

345
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,040
I hope she and Keike

346
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,520
will be punished.

347
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,040
Any news?

348
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,400
For the exhibition of nine-clwalve 어떻게

349
00:16:50,400 --> 00:17:02,520
to celebrate the serving of nên

350
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,000
in victory of my land.

351
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,040
When man doesn't understand

352
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,400
his spouse,

353
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,400
he uses his power

354
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,520
to be there.

355
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,080
I'll wait for you.

356
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,720
Today,

357
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,480
Xiao Rui came to see me.

358
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,280
What did he want?

359
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,280
He told me

360
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,400
that there is a Yun account

361
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,560
in the company.

362
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,400
All the files and documents

363
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,320
are stored there.

364
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,960
If Chen Zhe really did it,

365
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,520
is he...

366
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,240
There is such an account,

367
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,600
but

368
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,360
after Chen Zhe resigned,

369
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,760
all the passwords should have been changed.

370
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,680
Will there be a record of the entry?

371
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,240
Only the authority can check it.

372
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,360
We can't be sure that Chen Zhe did it.

373
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,760
How can we get the authority?

374
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,240
Between designers,

375
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,120
it's possible that the designs are similar.

376
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,760
But I really want to get rid of the charge of plagiarism.

377
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,640
Xiao Rui.

378
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,160
Will he come to you

379
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,600
with this opportunity?

380
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,160
I don't think so.

381
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,160
Xiao Rui is sincere today.

382
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,040
He looks like he's been ruined.

383
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:19,640
Otherwise,

384
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,320
I wouldn't have mentioned this to Nanxi.

385
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,240
Besides,

386
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,160
he's no longer working at Kaige.

387
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,200
I think

388
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,160
he's been through so many blows.

389
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,920
He should be happy now.

390
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,520
I don't know if he's happy.

391
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,120
Anyway, An Ke has changed.

392
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,760
I don't know him anymore.

393
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,680
He knew that Chen Zhe was unprofessional.

394
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,880
He still used him.

395
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,240
He's already made it clear.

396
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,040
So I quit.

397
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,360
I resigned.

398
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,240
Yu Fan.

399
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,040
Don't do this for me.

400
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,640
We can't be friends.

401
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,080
We're sisters.

402
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,240
Drink with me.

403
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,440
Come on.

404
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:57,760
Come on.

405
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,640
What's my brother doing?

406
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,080
I'll call him.

407
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,320
Don't call him in the middle of the night.

408
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,680
Let him call him.

409
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,800
No one can stop him after drinking.

410
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,320
Call him.

411
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,320
I'll ask him to come here.

412
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:16,800
Come here.

413
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,240
It's over.

414
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,080
Let's stop drinking.

415
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:21,960
Let's stop drinking.

416
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,960
Let's stop drinking.

417
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:24,760
Okay.

418
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,280
Let's drink.

419
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,880
Gu Nanxi.

420
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,920
Listen.

421
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,600
I've never

422
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,520
admired you in my life.

423
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,160
But today,

424
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,720
I admire myself.

425
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,800
You do?

426
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:43,600
Hey.

427
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,120
Nanxi.

428
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,440
You must drink.

429
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,280
Then hit their faces.

430
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,680
No.

431
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,400
Nanxi.

432
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,120
Tell me.

433
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,200
Is Shi Qi nice to you?

434
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,640
Yes.

435
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,640
Really?

436
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,000
Let me see.

437
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:12,840
Really?

438
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,240
I've thought about it.

439
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,600
Shi Qi likes you.

440
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,240
When we were in school,

441
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,200
why did he always stick to you?

442
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,480
He's more affectionate than my sister.

443
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,560
Really?

444
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,440
He always sticks to Nanxi?

445
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,840
Do you remember?

446
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,560
When we were in school,

447
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,120
someone asked for your phone number.

448
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,600
It's true.

449
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,440
It happened one day.

450
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,280
Shi Qi almost got into a fight with you.

451
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,160
Yes.

452
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,400
Actually,

453
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,000
I'm not sure

454
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,480
if Shi Qi can give you happiness.

455
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,200
But look.

456
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,400
He's always

457
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,200
sticking to you.

458
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,160
I think

459
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,200
he's sincere this time.

460
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,480
He must be.

461
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,920
He's sincere.

462
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,880
Don't worry.

463
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,240
Shi Qi.

464
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,000
Hey.

465
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,560
You brat.

466
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,800
You're late.

467
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,800
I'm coming.

468
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:14,840
Come here.

469
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,200
Why are you still drinking?

470
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,080
Let's have a drink.

471
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:24,920
Come on.

472
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,040
Let's go.

473
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,000
Let's go.

474
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,320
Slow down.

475
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,240
Okay.

476
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,200
Can you slow down?

477
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,240
No problem.

478
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,040
Nanxi, are you okay?

479
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,880
I'll transfer the money to you later.

480
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,480
Here.

481
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,880
Your sister saw it.

482
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,720
It's okay. She's drunk.

483
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,880
Shi Qi.

484
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,840
Nanxi.

485
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,440
Your sister is behind you.

486
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,080
Your sister is behind you.

487
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:07,880
I have something to say.

488
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,520
It's okay.

489
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,040
They're drunk. They can't see.

490
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,080
They can see.

491
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,360
I'm happy today.

492
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,440
What are you doing?

493
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,640
Brother.

494
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,040
I want to say something to Shi Qi.

495
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,080
Be careful.

496
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,600
Shi Qi.

497
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,560
Nanxi.

498
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,720
Today,

499
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,720
I think

500
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,000
you and my brother

501
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,520
must be together.

502
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,920
Lu Dongfang.

503
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,800
Shi Qi.

504
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,640
You and An Keke

505
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,720
are not suitable at all.

506
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:45,640
Not suitable?

507
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,040
Not suitable at all.

508
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,960
I'll leave it here today.

509
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,520
This is called the hand of the nephew.

510
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,840
You'll grow old together.

511
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,440
Okay.

512
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,120
Okay.

513
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,040
Then can you go back on your word?

514
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,560
No.

515
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,480
Nanxi.

516
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,760
Lu Dongfang.

517
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,680
Don't talk nonsense.

518
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,680
Okay.

519
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,680
Okay.

520
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,360
Lu Dongfang.

521
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,680
Slow down.

522
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,320
Slow down.

523
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,320
We're home.

524
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,440
We're home.

525
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,360
Hold on.

526
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,360
Hold on.

527
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,560
We're home.

528
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,800
Are you okay, brother-in-law?

529
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,560
Shi Qi.

530
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,200
Okay.

531
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,560
I'll leave the car to you.

532
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,240
Let's go.

533
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,240
Don't worry.

534
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,040
Slow down.

535
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,360
Wait for him to leave.

536
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,000
It's okay.

537
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,560
They can't see.

538
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,560
He's drunk.

539
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,080
Shi Qi.

540
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,640
Shi Qi.

541
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,640
I'll leave Nanxi to you.

542
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,640
You'll move out tonight.

543
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,040
Okay.

544
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,840
Move out.

545
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,840
Go back.

546
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,440
We must move out.

547
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:13,640
Go.

548
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,640
Okay.

549
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,240
Let's go.

550
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:15,640
Okay.

551
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,640
Go.

552
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,840
I want to move out.

553
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,840
Go back, sister.

554
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,840
I want to move out.

555
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,640
Go back.

556
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,640
He's drunk.

557
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,640
He's drunk.

558
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,640
I'm not drunk.

559
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,640
Let's go back.

560
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,640
Let's go back.

561
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,640
I want to move out.

562
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,240
Shi Qi.

563
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,240
Nanxi.

564
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,240
Nanxi.

565
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,640
I want to move out.

566
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,240
Are you okay?

567
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,440
I'm fine.

568
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,240
Let's go.

569
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,640
Wait a minute, brother-in-law.

570
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,640
Wait a minute.

571
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,640
You're drunk.

572
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,040
I feel so bad.

573
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:02,840
Come on.

574
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,840
Drink some soup to sober up.

575
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,840
Come on.

576
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,640
How did I come back yesterday?

577
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,840
You forgot everything?

578
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,440
Oh, no.

579
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,440
Bad news.

580
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,240
You married Shi Qi to Nanxi last night.

581
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,240
I guess you two are done for now.

582
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:19,840
Me?

583
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,840
Yes.

584
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,640
Where are you going?

585
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,040
I'm going to find them.

586
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,240
Come on.

587
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,640
You drank so much last night.

588
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,440
No one can hear you.

589
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,840
Drink some soup first.

590
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,240
But why did you

591
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,240
break up with Shi Qi and Nanxi?

592
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,240
Don't ask.

593
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,240
Let's eat.

594
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,440
Tell me.

595
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,640
I'll analyze it for you.

596
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,840
One is my good brother.

597
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,840
The other is my best friend.

598
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,840
They're really getting married.

599
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,040
They're going to divorce and break up.

600
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,640
I...

601
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,040
I want Nanxi to have a good home.

602
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,840
Shi Qi is too young.

603
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,440
Sometimes,

604
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,040
he doesn't even tell me.

605
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,240
Are you really good to Nanxi?

606
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,440
Or why do you think

607
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,040
Shi Qi doesn't deserve you?

608
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,440
Let's eat.

609
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,440
I'll answer the phone.

610
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,440
Shi Qi.

611
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,640
Brother-in-law.

612
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,640
Are you free?

613
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,040
I want to see you.

614
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,240
Yes.

615
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:28,840
Okay.

616
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,640
Don't tell my sister.

617
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,040
Just the two of us.

618
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,440
Okay.

619
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,640
Leng Ran.

620
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,240
Who is it?

621
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,240
The company.

622
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,640
It's my first time

623
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,840
to come to the cafe so early.

624
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:51,840
Brother-in-law.

625
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,040
What did my sister say

626
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,640
this morning?

627
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,840
I knew you'd ask me.

628
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,440
Your sister drank too much last night.

629
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,240
She forgot everything.

630
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,640
I'm done.

631
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,440
I'm done.

632
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,640
I'm happy now.

633
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,640
What?

634
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,640
You don't know what your sister is like.

635
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,240
You think your sister doesn't drink too much.

636
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,440
Can she admit what she said today?

637
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,840
You're right.

638
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,240
She's just stubborn.

639
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,640
Shi Qi.

640
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,240
Do you think

641
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,840
you love Nanxi?

642
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,040
Of course I do.

643
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,440
I'm sure.

644
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,440
Do you know what love is?

645
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,840
I didn't know before.

646
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,440
But now I know more and more.

647
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,440
Nanxi is my dream.

648
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,440
I feel like my dream has come true.

649
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,040
I understand.

650
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,840
I bless you.

651
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,840
Shi Qi.

652
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,640
Don't worry.

653
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,240
I've been to your sister's place.

654
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,840
But don't bother her

655
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,240
for the next few days.

656
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,440
Besides,

657
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,240
you're under a lot of pressure.

658
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,040
Don't just focus on love.

659
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,440
Think of a way

660
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,440
to help Nanxi get through this.

661
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,440
Wait.

662
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,040
I'll leave it to you.

663
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,040
Good luck.

664
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,040
Okay.

665
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,040
Good luck.

666
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,240
Nanxi.

667
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,240
Nanxi.

668
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,440
How's your preparation going?

669
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,640
Almost done.

670
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,640
We can't do much for you.

671
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,440
This is the information

672
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,640
we used during the night.

673
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,040
Hope it'll be useful to you.

674
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,040
Thank you.

675
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,440
What are you talking about?

676
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,440
We're a team.

677
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,640
No need to be polite.

678
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,640
You can do your work.

679
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,640
Good luck.

680
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,040
If the lawsuit fails,

681
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,640
then it's up to Nanxi

682
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,240
to take the responsibility.

683
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,640
She's responsible.

684
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,640
Nanxi.

685
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,640
You're here.

686
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,040
Xiaorui.

687
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,240
Long time no see.

688
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,840
Sit down, Nanxi.

689
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,440
Xiaorui has something to tell you.

690
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,440
Nanxi.

691
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,440
You should know

692
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,040
what An Keke's purpose is.

693
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,040
An Keke's purpose?

694
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,040
Chen Zhe is Yi Hai's designer.

695
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,040
If Yi Hai says a word,

696
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,040
it'll be a flop.

697
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,240
The best way

698
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,240
is to negotiate with An Keke.

699
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,240
Or cooperate with her in the name of the reform.

700
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,640
As for Li Na,

701
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,040
I can help you persuade her.

702
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,640
I can't negotiate with An Keke.

703
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,040
Thank you for your kindness.

704
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,040
But plagiarism is not something

705
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,240
a designer can bear.

706
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,440
This is a life-long problem.

707
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,240
I know I didn't plagiarize.

708
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,240
If Yi Hai has registered the copyright,

709
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,040
I'll at most be cleared.

710
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,240
I knew it would be like this.

711
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,440
To help you,

712
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,440
I asked you to come here several times.

713
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,240
Nanxi.

714
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,840
Since I can't persuade you,

715
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,240
I'll respect your choice.

716
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,640
And

717
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,840
wish you and Qin Shiqi happiness.

718
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,040
I'll leave now.

719
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,040
I'll leave now.

720
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,040
I'll leave now.

721
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,040
You and my brother-in-law

722
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,440
will be fine, okay?

723
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,640
Don't worry about us.

724
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,040
Take care of yourself.

725
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,440
You're so sweet.

726
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,840
Am I right?

727
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,240
You're right.

728
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,440
That's Xiaorui.

729
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,040
Nanxi.

730
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,840
Nanxi.

731
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,040
Did Xiaorui kick you again?

732
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,840
No.

733
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,240
Isn't Leng Ran still here?

734
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,040
Xu Fan, sit down.

735
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:55,840
Why are you in a hurry?

736
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,040
Sit down.

737
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,640
Xiaorui wants to help Nanxi.

738
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,040
But Nanxi refused.

739
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,840
I think she's so kind this time.

740
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,240
I think Xiaorui has changed.

741
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,840
All right.

742
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,440
Why are you talking to her?

743
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,440
We're gathered here

744
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,440
to cheer up Nanxi.

745
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,440
That's right.

746
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,440
Why are you talking about her?

747
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,240
Nanxi, don't be nervous.

748
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,240
We're all

749
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,840
your strong backing.

750
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,840
It's so nice to have you.

751
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,640
I'm not nervous.

752
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,840
Let's have a drink.

753
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,840
Come on, let's have a drink.

754
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,840
Waiter,

755
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,840
serve the wine.

756
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,240
I think

757
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,040
we're just too worried.

758
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,440
We didn't do anything wrong.

759
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,840
What are you worried about?

760
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,840
Right?

761
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,440
All right, let's not talk about this.

762
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,040
Yufan,

763
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,440
how's your job?

764
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,440
Don't mention it.

765
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,440
I'm just a housewife now.

766
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,040
Mr. Leng's full-time nanny.

767
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,640
You just said

768
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,640
my brother-in-law took care of you.

769
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,640
Qin Shiqi.

770
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,040
You're good at talking.

771
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,440
Don't say it again.

772
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,440
Isn't it great?

773
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,440
It's called

774
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,440
love and support, right?

775
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,440
Love and support.

776
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,440
Nanxi is good at talking.

777
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,440
Come on, let's drink.

778
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,440
Let's drink.

779
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,640
The wind blows in front of the eyes,

780
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,640
listening to your complaints.

781
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,640
Kissing the ancient valley,

782
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,640
the gentle hand is lazy.

783
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,640
The fireworks go off in a moment,

784
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,640
the light fades in the darkness,

785
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:07,640
and the youth is in a rush.

786
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,640
How soft is your heart.

787
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,640
You are the most brilliant in the world,

788
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,640
the best in the universe.

789
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,640
The calm deep sea also raises waves.

790
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,640
You are like a heart,

791
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,640
letting all the things disappear.

792
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,640
I don't want time to keep me from you.

793
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,640
You are the most brilliant in the world,

794
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,640
the best in the universe.

795
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,640
You are the best in the world.

796
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,640
Day and night, I miss you.

797
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,640
Only because I walk forward,

798
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,640
my world is because of you.

799
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:44,640
The snow is falling slowly, the star and the light are on.

800
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,640
Let the whole world have romance.

801
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,640
And I'm more greedy now.

802
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,640
I turn around and turn around.

803
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,640
You are the most brilliant in the world,

804
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,640
the best in the universe.

805
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,640
The calm deep sea also raises waves.

806
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,640
Day and night, I miss you.

807
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,640
Only because I walk forward,

808
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,640
my world is because of you.
