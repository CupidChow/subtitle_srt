1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Don't you understand that you have to say you want to be apart from me

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
In my arms, you are asleep

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
How can you hide in my soft heart?

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I want to get closer to you, but your little stars

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Always circling you, never leaving, never leaving

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I want to get closer to you, to protect your secret

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I will keep looking for you

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I will be with you for the rest of my life

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I want to get closer to you, but your little stars

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Always circling you, never leaving, never leaving

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I want to get closer to you, to protect your secret

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I will keep looking for you

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I will be with you for the rest of my life

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I will be with you for the rest of my life

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I will protect you

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
That's great

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
But let me tell you something

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The company has arranged a new movie for you

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I want you to meet the director now

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Another day

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
If I go now, sister Nanxi will be off work

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
She won't see me

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Now, sister Nanxi and I are of great importance

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
No, no, no, why do you change the day?

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Work is work, see her is see her

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
She doesn't understand you, right?

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You come here now

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
If the boss asks you, you say I disappeared

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
That's it

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Oh my god

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
No

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
No one can disturb the two worlds of me and Nanxi

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Two worlds

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
When will you come back? I miss you

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I won't be late today

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You should stay at home and wait for me

38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Sometimes the right person is at the Shen family

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Oh my god, Gu Nanxi

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
He is Qin Yufan's brother

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Hello

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Keke, someone is looking for you

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Who?

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I don't know

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
He didn't say, he has left

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
He said he would wait for you in the restaurant

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Is it Shiqi?

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Keke

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Mr. Xiao, why are you here?

50
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Long time no see

51
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
What?

52
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Who do you like to see?

53
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
No, you came to see me

54
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I didn't expect

55
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I came to see you recently

56
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I came to talk about cooperation

57
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Cooperation? You and me?

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Let's talk inside

59
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm back

60
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
What do you want to eat today?

61
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
How about we order takeout today?

62
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You don't want to eat my food?

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
No, no

64
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I think you are working too hard recently

65
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Let's change to something else

66
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Your necklace

67
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I think it's pretty

68
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Really?

69
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Do you want to order takeout?

70
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Or I will cook

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yes, yes

72
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
We will order now

73
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
See what you want to eat

74
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Mr. Xiao

75
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I don't know what you mean

76
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's simple

77
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You help me arrange a person

78
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
These design drafts

79
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
belong to Yihai jewelry

80
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You can use these design drawings

81
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
To become the number one jewelry company in China

82
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
But

83
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Keke, listen to me

84
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
There is no bad place

85
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I will help you

86
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I will help you

87
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I will help you

88
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
There is no bad place

89
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Mr. Xiao

90
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I don't know what you are looking for

91
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
But I know

92
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
There is no limit

93
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You are wrong about this

94
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Qin Shiqi

95
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Don't you want to get Qin Shiqi?

96
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
As far as I know

97
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
He has been in the Guanyin family for a long time

98
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Don't worry, Keke

99
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You see these design drawings

100
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Gu Nanshi carefully selected them for the reform

101
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I will use my own method

102
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
To get their design direction first

103
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Then you will design it first

104
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I will ask them to be patient

105
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Not only will the reform be destroyed

106
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Gu Nanshi will also be confused

107
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It will be a matter of time before the reform is left

108
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Do you think

109
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Gu Nanshi will choose me

110
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
After he leaves?

111
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Qin Shiqi has been waiting for him

112
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
He has been waiting for him for five years

113
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Keke

114
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Even if he doesn't choose you

115
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
But he only has you by his side

116
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
This is not the best time for you to do it

117
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You are really scary

118
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
But

119
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What's the use of destroying Brother Kai?

120
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I won't let Brother Kai destroy him

121
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I only want Li Na to leave Brother Kai

122
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Don't worry, Keke

123
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
As long as I succeed in becoming Brother Kai

124
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
We are not enemies

125
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
We are not enemies

126
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
We are good friends

127
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You want to squeeze Li Na in the shareholders' meeting

128
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I have heard

129
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Mr. Xiao really did it for the interests

130
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I am flattered

131
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
But if people find out about the plagiarism

132
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
We will be in danger

133
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I have thought about it for you

134
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
As long as you use someone

135
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I will leave all the blame to him

136
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Who?

137
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Chen Zheng

138
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
The original design director of Brother Kai

139
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
He left from Brother Kai

140
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Push all the blame on him

141
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
There will be no doubt

142
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Thank you for your kindness

143
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
But this matter is better left alone

144
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You like Qin Shiqi

145
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Gu Nanshi is your biggest obstacle

146
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I like Gu Nanshi

147
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Qin Shiqi

148
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Qin Shiqi is also my biggest obstacle

149
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Why don't we work together for each other's happiness?

150
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Please

151
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Keke

152
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's not much

153
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Think about it

154
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I will go to the bathroom

155
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
How about we change the play?

156
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
This is boring

157
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Don't change it

158
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's interesting

159
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's the critical time

160
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
This is a fake play

161
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Is that kiss real?

162
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You really want to know?

163
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You will know when you try

164
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Gu Nanshi

165
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Gu Nanshi

166
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
What are you thinking?

167
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
We are shooting kiss scenes

168
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's not real

169
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Why are you blushing?

170
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm going back

171
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Good night

172
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I feel more and more regretful recently

173
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Is it because I fell in love with Shiqi?

174
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
No

175
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I mean

176
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Sister Nanshi

177
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You still have to work overtime today?

178
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Yes

179
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
A new plan of the company needs to be released as soon as possible

180
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,600
The police are waiting for us.

181
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,960
When will they come back?

182
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,800
I don't know yet.

183
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,160
Don't you need to go to the police station?

184
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,600
No.

185
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,520
Yan Yan will come if I need to.

186
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,320
Yan Yan didn't come to see you

187
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,040
after he sent you here last time.

188
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,720
He really doesn't care about you.

189
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,280
Yes, why is he like this?

190
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,280
What kind of person is he?

191
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,800
I have to go now.

192
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,600
I'm going to be late.

193
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,880
Call me if you need anything.

194
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,400
Okay.

195
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,480
Aren't you too hair-growing?

196
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,960
I don't know.

197
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,640
Actually...

198
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,240
I don't know.

199
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,240
Maybe

200
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,760
he's currently pregnant.

201
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,520
When will he come back?

202
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,080
Quandian하하 u hormóidó

203
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,480
The report has chef!

204
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Thank you.

205
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,400
Coming.

206
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,920
Coming.

207
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,800
Keke.

208
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,360
Sorry, Nanxi.

209
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,160
I asked you to work overtime on the weekend.

210
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,160
Thank you.

211
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,160
It's my duty.

212
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,520
I was slow before.

213
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,800
Otherwise, the latest design draft

214
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,000
should have been released long ago.

215
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,000
You don't have to be so modest.

216
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,040
Everyone knows

217
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,520
that since your horse has become a tycoon,

218
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,360
your team has been under a lot of pressure.

219
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,280
Everyone is waiting to see

220
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,760
your follow-up designs.

221
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,680
We will build it.

222
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,160
This is the design plan

223
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,880
for the latest season we just set.

224
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,640
It's called A Life of Love.

225
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,000
Our design concept is...

226
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,080
Nanxi.

227
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,440
Have you ever touched

228
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,160
the design plan with the marketing department?

229
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,600
This is the marketing department's survey report.

230
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,720
Very good.

231
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,000
Then let's implement it according to this plan.

232
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,400
Nanxi.

233
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,600
This is the first draft

234
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,760
that I will release

235
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,840
after I take over the company.

236
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,520
I don't want to be said

237
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,560
that I have a much worse ability than Mr. Xiao.

238
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,440
Of course.

239
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,880
I know that most of your team

240
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,200
is invited by Mr. Xiao.

241
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,880
Don't worry.

242
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,360
We are all here for the company.

243
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,800
I'm just kidding.

244
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:41,800
Okay.

245
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,480
Since the design plan has been set,

246
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,240
let's implement it according to this plan.

247
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,080
Thank you for your hard work.

248
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,400
I'm looking forward to your big project.

249
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,080
How could this...

250
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,120
How could this happen?

251
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,400
It turns out that

252
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,400
they have been lying to me.

253
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,280
It turns out that they were together long ago.

254
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,360
How could this happen?

255
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,360
I'm with that bad guy.

256
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,520
You know that I like Shi Qi.

257
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,960
You pretend that you don't know anything.

258
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,960
You use Shi Qi...

259
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,960
You use Shi Qi to realize your own career

260
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,680
and your own illness.

261
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,200
Xiao Rui.

262
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,760
Since you are like this,

263
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,840
don't blame me.

264
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,200
I'm not a bully.

265
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,600
Why can't I even use my phone?

266
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,520
Why?

267
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,480
Xiao Rui.

268
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,160
Giving me extends you to someone tiny,

269
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,360
ONLY

270
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,920
by the side.

271
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,040
Not loving anyoneuffy.

272
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,920
Is there anything I can't do?

273
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,600
Xiao Rui,

274
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,840
I agree to your plan.

275
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,960
So, when can I start working?

276
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,960
I'll provide you with a design draft.

277
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,960
You just need to modify it a little.

278
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,960
Where did you get the draft?

279
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,960
It's from Kai Ge.

280
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,960
I didn't expect you to hate Kai Ge so much.

281
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,960
You just need to listen to my arrangement.

282
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,960
What's wrong, Li You?

283
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,960
Yu Fan?

284
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,960
Why are you here?

285
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,960
My big designer is still so busy on the weekend.

286
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,960
Work overtime.

287
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,960
I can't finish my work.

288
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,960
There's no work that you can't finish.

289
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,960
Let's go.

290
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,960
I'll take you to relax.

291
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,960
What are you doing?

292
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,960
We're all working overtime.

293
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,960
We're all working overtime.

294
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,960
I'm not working overtime.

295
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,960
I'm working overtime.

296
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,960
What are you doing?

297
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,960
What are you doing?

298
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,960
If you don't leave,

299
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,960
I'll take out the power.

300
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,960
No.

301
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,960
Let's go.

302
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,960
I'll stay with you for a while.

303
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,960
It's not too late.

304
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,960
You need to learn to be a leader.

305
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,960
Don't think about work.

306
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,960
It's all out.

307
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,960
Can you not think about it?

308
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,960
You forced me to come out.

309
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,960
How did you get out?

310
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,960
Anyway, you're already here.

311
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,960
Didn't Ge Ge say she was coming?

312
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,960
Don't mention it.

313
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,960
We agreed two days ago.

314
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,960
When she came, she couldn't make the phone call.

315
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,960
Couldn't make the phone call?

316
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,960
Did something happen?

317
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,960
Something happened.

318
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,960
It happened to Qin Shiqi.

319
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,960
Shiqi?

320
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,960
Don't mention them.

321
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,960
I'll do a spa later.

322
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,960
Then I'll go eat something delicious.

323
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,960
Do spa again?

324
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,960
I've been out for a long time.

325
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,960
Let me go back.

326
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,960
You designers are busy.

327
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,960
You're busy every day.

328
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,960
You're busy every day.

329
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,960
You still have work to do.

330
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,960
Wait for me to finish this new product.

331
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,960
Then I'll take a few days off

332
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,960
to play with you.

333
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,960
Okay.

334
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,960
I'll take you home now.

335
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,960
Be good.

336
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,960
I'm leaving.

337
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,960
I'm leaving. Bye.

338
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,960
Nanxi.

339
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,960
Nanxi.

340
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,960
What's wrong?

341
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,960
I'm not busy today.

342
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,960
Mr. Leng is also busy

343
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,960
with the new magazine.

344
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,960
I'll go to your house.

345
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,960
No.

346
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,960
Why not?

347
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,960
I...

348
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,960
I'm busy today.

349
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,960
I'm busy with work.

350
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,960
I don't have time to accompany you later.

351
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,960
Gu Nanxi.

352
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,960
You're really ungrateful.

353
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,960
Did your family hide a man?

354
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,960
Did your family hide a man?

355
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,960
Why did you say that again?

356
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,960
Actually, I cooked two days ago.

357
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,960
My kitchen was clogged with earthworms.

358
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,960
It was very smelly.

359
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,960
I asked my master to come later.

360
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,960
Really?

361
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,960
It was very smelly.

362
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,960
Go.

363
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,960
Bye.

364
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,960
You're still sleeping?

365
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,960
Xiaorui.

366
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,960
Xiaorui.

367
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,960
What are you doing?

368
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,960
You scared me.

369
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,960
Come with me.

370
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,960
Come with me.

371
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,960
Li Na.

372
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,960
Today,

373
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,960
I'm really sorry

374
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,960
for what I did before.

375
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,960
I'm sorry.

376
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,960
I'm sorry.

377
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,960
Really?

378
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,960
Before,

379
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,960
I always saw

380
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,960
your kindness to me.

381
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,960
But I forgot your kindness to me.

382
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,960
This is for you.

383
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,960
Li Na.

384
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,960
I've been

385
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,960
waiting for our wedding.

386
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,960
I will

387
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,960
give you a perfect wedding.

388
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,960
Sit down.

389
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,960
I'm sorry.

390
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,960
It's good that you can understand

391
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,960
my good intentions.

392
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,960
What's up?

393
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,960
I've been

394
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,960
in contact with Gu Nanxi.

395
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,960
I found that

396
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,960
he's good at designing.

397
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,960
The design plan

398
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,960
is also very well-developed.

399
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,960
But

400
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,960
his cooking

401
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,960
is really bad.

402
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,960
How about

403
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,960
we change it

404
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,960
as soon as possible

405
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,960
and find someone to replace him?

406
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,960
A new designer

407
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,960
can't be found

408
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,960
in a second.

409
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,960
How about

410
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,960
we wait for the new product to be released

411
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,960
and then change it?

412
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,960
It's not too late.

413
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,960
You're right.

414
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,960
After all,

415
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,960
there are not many designers

416
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,960
who can complete

417
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,960
the design plan

418
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,960
in such a short time.

419
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,960
And

420
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,960
we don't have a suitable person

421
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,960
to choose from now.

422
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,960
Let's talk about it later.

423
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,960
Let's not talk about this.

424
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,960
Let's have another drink.

425
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,960
Mr. Qin,

426
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,960
this is the information

427
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,960
of the new person in the company.

428
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,960
Please have a look.

429
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,960
What's wrong with this person?

430
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,960
Why don't I know?

431
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,960
Oh, it's like this.

432
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,960
He's a very good designer.

433
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,960
He's very good at designing.

434
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,960
He's very good at designing.

435
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,960
He's very good at designing.

436
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,960
He's very good at designing.

437
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,960
Oh, it's like this.

438
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,960
The designer Chen is

439
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,960
a designer of the design department.

440
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,960
He didn't pass through our HR department.

441
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,960
But the recording process

442
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,960
requires us to cooperate with Shen Pi.

443
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,960
Design department's staff?

444
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,960
Yes.

445
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,960
The design department said that

446
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,960
there are not enough people recently.

447
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,960
And Keke

448
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,960
personally said hello.

449
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,960
Keke?

450
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,960
Are you sure?

451
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,960
Yes.

452
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,960
Because this matter

453
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,960
is very unsuitable for the program.

454
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,960
So I asked

455
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,960
very clearly.

456
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,960
I see.

457
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,960
Go back to your work.

458
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,960
Ghosh, mei Xuan.

459
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,960
As long as you're here...

460
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,960
Finish first.

461
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,960
Yes.

462
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,960
Mei Xuan.

463
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:24,960
Just put it on.

464
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,120
That doesn't pass through the program.

465
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:26,960
It's just Gu Beming.

466
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,520
Yes,

467
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,700
it's my self-denial.

468
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,960
has a Institute of��면재력과 Wallet.

469
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,960
It's my self-denial.

470
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,960
I'm from the average university.

471
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,960
That doesn't pass through the program.

472
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,960
I'm from the average university.

473
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,960
Because

474
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,560
fits our design concept.

475
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,360
Okay.

476
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,160
Especially the colors of

477
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,360
the gems on it.

478
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,760
It's really a classic.

479
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:47,960
Yu...

480
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,560
Coco.

481
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,960
Director Qin.

482
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,960
You're just in time.

483
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,960
Let me introduce you.

484
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,360
This is Chen Zhe,

485
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,360
the new designer of our company.

486
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,560
He's in charge of the new jewelry.

487
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,760
This is Mr. Qin,

488
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,360
the HR of our company.

489
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,160
Hello, Mr. Qin.

490
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:07,960
My name is Yang.

491
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,360
Coco.

492
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,960
I have something to tell you.

493
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,160
I don't know if you're available.

494
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,960
Just say it here.

495
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,160
Chen Zhe.

496
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,760
It seems that Director Qin

497
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,360
has something to tell you.

498
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,160
You can leave now.

499
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,160
I'll call you later.

500
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,360
Okay.

501
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,560
You guys can talk.

502
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,360
What kind of person is Chen Zhe?

503
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,360
Don't you know?

504
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,160
How dare he

505
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,360
come to our company again?

506
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,360
What do you think?

507
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,360
The door is closed now.

508
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,560
No outsiders are allowed in.

509
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,360
I'm sorry.

510
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,160
It's work time now.

511
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,560
Okay.

512
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,360
Designer An.

513
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,960
As HR of our company,

514
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,560
I have to be responsible

515
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,960
for every language of our company.

516
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,360
I have to be responsible for every language of our company.

517
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,160
I have to be responsible for every language of our company.

518
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,760
I have to be responsible for every language of our company.

519
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,960
I have to be responsible for every language of our company.

520
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,960
I don't want to be a person

521
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,960
with bad character.

522
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,960
I don't want to be a person with bad character.

523
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,960
You don't want to be a person with bad character?

524
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,560
Director Qin.

525
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,360
As far as I know,

526
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,960
we are an excellent jewelry design company.

527
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,560
Our purpose

528
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,160
is to make excellent jewelry.

529
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,960
And as far as I know,

530
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,960
Chen Zhe doesn't seem to have

531
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,320
any bad records of

532
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,960
buying and committing crimes.

533
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,760
What do you mean?

534
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,960
I don't mean anything.

535
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,560
The company has decided to use Chen Zhe's design

536
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,160
as the latest main character.

537
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:52,960
I believe that

538
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,160
our design is a one-off.

539
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,760
Designers are talented.

540
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,160
I believe in Chen Zhe.

541
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,160
I understand.

542
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,760
Since you understand,

543
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,960
is there anything else?

544
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,160
If there's nothing else, please leave.

545
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:05,960
I'm busy.

546
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,240
You got it wrong today.

547
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,920
Or after I live in our companies,

548
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,280
I don't care what you do.

549
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:27,960
Not a chance that

550
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,960
I'll run todimensional callimg or not.

551
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,080
And I'm not here

552
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,560
you get my point.

553
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,560
I won't miss my transfer.

554
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,480
I know that your object is...

555
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,560
I will take my words among my watercolorreal provinces.

556
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,440
Yes.

557
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:43,920
Hello.

558
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,360
Hello, Nan Xi.

559
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,520
Are you busy now?

560
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,320
Li Na.

561
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,400
I just finished a meeting.

562
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,040
What's up?

563
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,880
Come to my office.

564
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,240
I need to talk to you.

565
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,240
OK.

566
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,480
I really don't understand

567
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,280
what An Ke Ke is thinking.

568
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,320
Maybe

569
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,520
this is just for the company's arrangement.

570
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,600
I didn't see it.

571
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,400
He obviously has a different attitude

572
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,800
towards me today.

573
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,040
Yu Fan, are you too sensitive?

574
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,840
There must be something.

575
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,800
It must be Shi Qi.

576
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,960
Yu Fan, don't think too much.

577
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,480
What do you know?

578
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,720
The sixth sense of women is the most accurate.

579
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,640
I don't care.

580
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,480
I have to ask him about this.

581
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,160
What does he mean?

582
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,320
Does Chen Zhe still dare to use this kind of person?

583
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,520
Yu Fan,

584
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,680
Chen Zhe may have a problem.

585
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,840
But his ability

586
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,120
is obvious.

587
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,800
I think the company's arrangement

588
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,320
has its own reason.

589
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,880
Let's see, okay?

590
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,480
As the HR of the company,

591
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,560
I'm of course responsible for my work.

592
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,760
Yu Fan, let's observe again.

593
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,120
Don't be impulsive, okay?

594
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,680
The same goes for Nanxi.

595
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,040
He can never find someone at critical moments.

596
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,080
Yu Fan,

597
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,600
everyone is busy with the new product.

598
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,760
He will definitely come back to you

599
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,960
after he sees it.

600
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,360
Yu Fan, remember, don't be impulsive.

601
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,400
I have something on my hand.

602
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,680
I need to deal with it right away.

603
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,000
Okay, okay, okay.

604
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:07,920
Bye.

605
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,520
Have some water.

606
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:14,920
Thank you.

607
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,360
I'm not a person who is so impulsive.

608
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,800
I'll be straight.

609
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,680
You and Qin Shiqi

610
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,480
have a good relationship, right?

611
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,160
Shiqi?

612
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,320
Yes.

613
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,200
The contract with Yi Hai Jewelry

614
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,680
is about to expire.

615
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,680
I think

616
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,880
you can introduce him to me.

617
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,360
I want to talk to him

618
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,000
about the endorsement of our Kaige.

619
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,800
You mean

620
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,120
to fight with Yi Hai?

621
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,960
It's not like that.

622
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,520
Their contract is expired.

623
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,960
And I can give him

624
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,360
better conditions and resources.

625
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,360
I think they will definitely not refuse.

626
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,320
Of course I know

627
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,640
that you have a good relationship

628
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,760
with Yi Hai Jewelry.

629
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,000
But Nanxi,

630
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,800
you are still a member of Kaige.

631
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,440
If you can work with Qin Shiqi,

632
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,800
it's best for you

633
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,080
and Kaige.

634
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,560
I...

635
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,640
I can help introduce him to you.

636
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,200
But Yi Hai Jewelry

637
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,360
has long considered Qin Shiqi

638
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,640
as the only one.

639
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,800
They value him very much.

640
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,880
Even if I can persuade Shiqi,

641
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,360
it's not easy for Yi Hai to explain.

642
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,760
Don't worry about that.

643
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,560
The problem that can be solved

644
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,760
is not a problem.

645
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,360
As long as Qin Shiqi agrees,

646
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,800
everything else is easy to say.

647
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,880
Okay.

648
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,240
I'll find a chance to communicate with him.

649
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:33,960
Okay.

650
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,280
Shiqi.

651
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,280
Are you feeling better?

652
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,600
Yes, I'm feeling better.

653
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,320
Let me see.

654
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,720
Much better.

655
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,840
Much better than I expected.

656
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,400
That's good.

657
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,000
Shiqi,

658
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,840
I have something to ask you.

659
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,680
What is it?

660
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,960
When will your endorsement

661
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,240
with Yi Hai Jewelry be terminated?

662
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,040
I'm not sure about the exact date.

663
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,120
But it's soon.

664
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,000
What's wrong?

665
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,080
It's just that Lina asked me in the company today.

666
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,160
She said

667
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,920
if your endorsement with Yi Hai

668
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,000
is terminated,

669
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,800
is it possible to talk to Kaige

670
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,200
about the possibility of the endorsement?

671
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,440
Does this mean Lina's

672
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,520
or yours?

673
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,680
Of course it means the company.

674
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,120
I'm just a designer.

675
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,320
What can I mean?

676
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,880
Do you want me to sign?

677
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,840
What does it have to do with me?

678
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,720
Did you order takeout?

679
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:48,680
No.

680
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,720
Your sister is here.

681
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:03,920
Yes.

682
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,280
No, you...

683
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,320
Get in.

684
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,120
Get in.

685
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,200
Coming.

686
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,920
Coming.

687
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,000
Open the door.

688
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,520
Coming.

689
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,800
Gu Nanxi, what are you doing?

690
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,880
Why are you so quiet?

691
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:24,960
No.

692
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,560
Sorry, Yifan.

693
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,160
I...

694
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,360
I didn't answer your call during the day

695
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,520
because I didn't see you.

696
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,640
I was too busy.

697
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,640
I forgot to answer you.

698
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,480
I didn't mean that.

699
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,120
I think something big is going to happen.

700
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,000
What's wrong?

701
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,360
Guess who I met in the company today.

702
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,240
Chen Zhe.

703
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,560
Chen Zhe?

704
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
He's going to your company for an interview?

705
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,120
If he dares to go to our company for an interview,

706
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,720
I won't even let him in.

707
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,600
Keke.

708
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,560
You appointed Chen Zhe

709
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,080
as our company's designer.

710
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,520
Why did you choose him?

711
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,560
Yes.

712
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,000
He just accepted the job and jumped over me.

713
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,080
It's normal to jump over you.

714
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:01,920
The company

715
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,440
doesn't want to appoint anyone.

716
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,080
How is it normal?

717
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,640
Why are you saying the same thing as Leng Ran?

718
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,080
Besides,

719
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,120
An Keke's attitude towards me today

720
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,360
is extremely cold.

721
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,400
Don't you think it's strange?

722
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,600
Are you a little sensitive?

723
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,880
Why can't you communicate?

724
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,600
I heard the same thing twice today.

725
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,160
I won't talk to you.

726
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:26,840
Where are you going?

727
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,880
I'm going back.

728
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,360
It's no use talking to you.

729
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,440
Nanxi.

730
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,760
Let me say one more thing.

731
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,760
This matter is not that simple.

732
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,280
Think about it.

733
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,280
You're so beautiful.

734
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,680
You're so beautiful.

735
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,080
You're so beautiful.

736
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,480
You're so beautiful.

737
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,080
You're so beautiful.

738
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,680
You're so beautiful.

739
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,280
You're so beautiful.

740
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,880
You're so beautiful.

741
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,680
You're so beautiful.

742
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,680
You're so beautiful.

743
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,680
You're so beautiful.

744
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,680
You're so beautiful.

745
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,680
You're so beautiful.

746
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,680
You're so beautiful.

747
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,680
You're so beautiful.

748
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,680
You're so beautiful.

749
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,680
You're so beautiful.

750
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,480
You're so beautiful.

751
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,480
You're so beautiful.

752
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,280
You're so beautiful.

753
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,480
She's so beautiful.

754
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,880
This is for you.

755
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,480
I don't need anything.

756
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,480
Your current Fei Pu researcher

757
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,280
has been on the phone with me.
