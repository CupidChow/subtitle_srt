1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,660
Not

2
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,760
You fall into myλέflige and express your secret to me

3
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,760
Are you angry or not? You have to say goodbye to me

4
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,760
In my arms, who are you?

5
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,760
How can you hide in my soft heart?

6
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,760
I want to see you closer

7
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,760
From your little heart

8
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,760
The sky is gentle and you are not in use

9
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,760
I want to see you closer

10
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,760
I will keep your secret and look for you

11
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,760
I am waiting for you

12
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,760
I want to see you closer

13
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,760
From your little heart

14
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,760
The sky is gentle and you are not in use

15
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,760
I want to see you closer

16
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:23,760
I will keep your secret and look for you

17
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,760
I want to see you closer

18
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,760
I will keep your secret and look for you

19
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,760
I will keep your secret and look for you

20
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,760
What's up? When are you coming back?

21
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,760
Tomorrow, the afternoon

22
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,760
The wedding gown is ready

23
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,760
Do you want to show it to you?

24
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,760
No

25
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,760
You are professional with these things

26
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,760
But remember this

27
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,760
You must be a machine

28
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,760
Don't worry

29
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,760
I will show you

30
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,760
I will show you

31
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,760
I will show you

32
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,760
I will show you

33
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,760
I will show you

34
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,760
Don't worry

35
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,760
I will show you

36
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,760
I will show you

37
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,760
Don't worry

38
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,760
These things are too easy for us

39
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,760
Since it's ready

40
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,760
Tomorrow morning

41
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,760
I will send the wedding gown

42
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,760
I can go to the morning

43
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,760
To get the money

44
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,760
I will watch you

45
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,760
If you do well

46
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,760
There is an external reward

47
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,760
Good bye

48
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,760
Go

49
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,760
Go

50
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,760
Nanxi

51
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,760
I know this game

52
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,760
I won't go

53
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,760
He is the one who is looking for you

54
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,760
If you join

55
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,760
You have a great chance to win

56
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,760
I don't care about winning

57
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,760
I just want to do my job well

58
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,760
I heard

59
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,760
The competition now

60
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,760
Is very good in China

61
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,760
It has a great impact

62
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,760
It's even more effective

63
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,760
I can't go there

64
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,760
I can go there as a cannon

65
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,760
You must join this time

66
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,760
I won't go there if you go there

67
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,760
Listen to me

68
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,760
You forgot how the doctor told you

69
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,760
What's the relationship between you and the competition?

70
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,760
Nanxi

71
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,760
Think about it

72
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,760
If you join

73
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,760
If there is no name

74
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,760
There is no effect

75
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,760
If there is a name

76
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,760
It must be helpful to you

77
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,760
And if you get your disease

78
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,760
That's not perfect

79
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,760
Go

80
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,760
Gu Nanxi

81
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,760
Hello

82
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,760
Qin Shijie

83
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,760
Where are you?

84
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,760
Ximen, did you see it?

85
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,760
I'm in Chunzhou

86
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,760
I'm back after the show

87
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,760
What news?

88
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,760
Hurry up and take a look

89
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,760
I'm here

90
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,760
I'm here

91
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,760
I'm here

92
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,760
I'm here

93
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,760
I'm here

94
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,760
I'm here

95
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,760
I'm here

96
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,760
I'm here

97
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,760
I'm here

98
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,760
I'm here

99
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,760
I'm here

100
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,760
I'm here

101
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,760
I'm here

102
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,760
I'm here

103
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,760
What are you doing?

104
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,760
No

105
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,760
You said it slowly

106
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,760
I don't know what the news is

107
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,760
I'm afraid Ximen will send you a phone

108
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,760
I hope you can explain to me

109
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,760
Okay

110
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,760
I'm here

111
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,760
I'm here

112
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,760
I'm here

113
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,760
I'm here

114
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,760
I'm here

115
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,760
I'm here

116
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,760
I'm here

117
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,760
I'm here

118
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,760
I'm here

119
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,760
I'm here

120
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,760
I'm here

121
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,760
I'm here

122
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,760
I'm here

123
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,760
I'm here

124
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,760
I'm here

125
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,760
I'm here

126
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,760
I'm here

127
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,760
I'm here

128
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,760
I'm here

129
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,760
I'm here

130
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,760
I'm here

131
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,760
I'm here

132
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,760
I'm here

133
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,760
I'm here

134
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,760
I'm here

135
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,760
I'm here

136
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,760
I'm here

137
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,760
I'm here

138
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,760
I'm here

139
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,760
I'm here

140
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,760
I'm here

141
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,760
I'm here

142
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,760
I'm here

143
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,760
I'm here

144
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,760
I'm here

145
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,760
I'm here

146
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,760
I'm here

147
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,760
I'm here

148
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,760
I'm here

149
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,760
He's doing quite well

150
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,360
Let things continue to fall

151
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,960
Continue to grow

152
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,480
Let's go.

153
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,080
Nanxi,

154
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,960
don't think too much.

155
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,560
There must be a misunderstanding.

156
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,720
This is what the ugly kid's truth report said.

157
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,920
Look, I won't kill him.

158
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,360
Nanxi, believe me.

159
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,320
I promise you,

160
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,880
Qin Shiqi is definitely not like this.

161
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,240
Why are you laughing?

162
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,880
You should take a look at it.

163
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,560
Is there any familiar thing here?

164
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,720
He really is so creepy.

165
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,000
He must be stretching his legs so much.

166
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,480
He's just very energetic.

167
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,400
He's my kind of person.

168
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,120
There should be a足.

169
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,240
And I don't know either.

170
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,440
Could voices such as

171
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,600
the legacy of the dare 필 worship

172
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,360
be true to you?

173
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,000
Are we talking about laughs?

174
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,600
Why is An Keke in the crew?

175
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,840
I think it's because of work.

176
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,320
Then,

177
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,320
is Shiqi and An Keke...

178
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,760
It's okay.

179
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,840
They're fine.

180
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,840
Don't worry.

181
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,280
What a pity.

182
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,520
We should worry about Shiqi now.

183
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,240
When the crew is shooting,

184
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,520
the news about her

185
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,320
will be very influential.

186
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,440
I don't know

187
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,040
who's actually doing it.

188
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,160
What's the purpose?

189
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,480
But we must find a way to help her.

190
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,160
I'll call Shiqi and ask her.

191
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,120
Shiqi's phone.

192
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,120
Hello, Shiqi.

193
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:21,880
Hello.

194
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,120
Nanxi.

195
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,920
You saw the news, right?

196
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,200
Don't.

197
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,160
I saw it.

198
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,440
You don't need to explain it to me.

199
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,520
I understand.

200
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,880
Thank you, Nanxi.

201
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,080
How about this?

202
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,440
I'll go back to the company right now

203
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,480
and study the solution.

204
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,280
See you later.

205
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,640
Jin Zhiqi.

206
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,480
I know you don't want people to be upset.

207
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,240
But you're too much.

208
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,160
Dawei, don't worry.

209
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,400
I'm not worried.

210
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,680
You know the company

211
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,440
and the money you paid for it.

212
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,120
How much did you spend?

213
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,000
You know my position.

214
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,000
I can't do this.

215
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,440
I believe in the money.

216
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,560
I want to trust my friends.

217
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,560
I want your fans to trust me.

218
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,000
I want you to trust me.

219
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,160
Let's explain it to everyone.

220
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,400
What do you mean?

221
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,440
You're so unfair.

222
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,560
Who believes you?

223
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,480
How's the crew now?

224
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,760
Is there any impact?

225
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,720
It seems...

226
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,840
It seems to be still on the scene.

227
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,560
What's the rush?

228
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,200
We have to finish the work

229
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,280
of the film first.

230
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,080
And then we'll

231
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,120
slowly solve it and discuss it.

232
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,960
That makes sense.

233
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,160
Such a big boss

234
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,080
can't do anything.

235
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,200
Who are you?

236
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,640
I didn't say you.

237
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,080
I'm going back to the crew tonight.

238
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,680
You're the one who's on this side.

239
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,200
I'm leaving.

240
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,760
Be good.

241
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,400
I'll leave.

242
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,160
Come back.

243
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,280
Come back.

244
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,120
I really am sorry

245
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,680
that I kept you on this side of the movie.

246
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,040
I don't know anything.

247
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,000
When you were playing with the Guo Jia family,

248
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,440
you said you wanted to,

249
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,840
but you said you didn't want to.

250
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,160
But I told you not to hurt Shi Qi.

251
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,440
Miss An Da, I'm not your subordinate.

252
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,560
I don't have any obligation to do anything for you.

253
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,760
So you didn't plan to work with me at the beginning?

254
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,560
I'm smart. I'm a little smart.

255
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,840
Why?

256
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,520
I just praised you for being smart.

257
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,720
Why are you making a mess again?

258
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,920
You want to know that?

259
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,120
Fine.

260
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,280
Then I'll tell you that

261
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:12,520
you're the only one who has and isn't you.

262
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:16,200
But you're in my sight now.

263
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,560
Because you and Qin Shi Qi's relationship

264
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,560
will make my plan more sweet and simple.

265
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,960
Aren't you afraid that I'll be too serious about what I did to you?

266
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,160
So you changed.

267
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,760
Because of Qin Shi Qi's scandal,

268
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,040
the company will open a shareholders' meeting tomorrow.

269
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,040
At that time,

270
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,680
Li Na will be the father.

271
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,040
You can be the real controller of the treasure of Kai Ge.

272
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,840
At that time, no matter what happens, you don't care.

273
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,760
Smart.

274
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,880
But you have to get Kai Ge in many ways.

275
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,560
Why do you want to hurt Shi Qi?

276
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,160
Like you,

277
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,960
I don't just want to be Kai Ge.

278
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,160
I also want to be Gu Nan Xi.

279
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,760
Xiao Ru.

280
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:16,560
In fact, you're also a pitiful person.

281
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,560
Me?

282
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,960
Yes.

283
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,560
Just like the previous me,

284
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,760
I understand this now.

285
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,560
We can't hurt anyone with the name of love.

286
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,360
Do you think you'll return to your side after you get the treasure of Kai Ge?

287
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,360
No. Love is not materialistic.

288
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:47,360
I can't get Qin Shi Qi's heart in Qin Shi Qi's hands.

289
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,560
That's just an excuse for your failure.

290
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,560
No matter what you think,

291
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,960
Xiao Ru, I'm telling you, you touched my bottom line.

292
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,360
The person who hurt Shi Qi is my enemy.

293
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,560
You're just a coincidence.

294
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,160
Just you?

295
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,560
Let go of yourself.

296
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,560
You've been in the industry for so many years.

297
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,560
You don't know how to be careful.

298
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,560
How do I know that I have eyes?

299
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,560
You're reasonable.

300
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,160
Stay away from An Ke Ke.

301
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,560
Luckily, Nan Xi is generous.

302
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,960
Otherwise, you'll explain.

303
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,560
Enough. Let's not talk about it now.

304
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,560
Let's think of a solution.

305
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,560
Shi Qi, shut up.

306
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,560
Shut up.

307
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,560
You know what to do.

308
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,560
How do you solve it?

309
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,560
I've asked someone.

310
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,560
The news is about a famous dog team in the industry.

311
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,560
Since they can report the first news,

312
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,560
I believe there will be other news in the future.

313
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,560
Qin Shi Qi, what are you doing in the crew?

314
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,560
I didn't do anything.

315
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,560
Enough.

316
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,560
I think they've reported the photo.

317
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,560
Then we'll have to wait for them.

318
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,560
I think they've reported the photo.

319
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,560
Then there must be a reason.

320
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,560
I think they're all doing it for money.

321
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,560
They've been using it for so long.

322
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,560
Someone will contact Shi Qi or his company

323
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,560
to talk about the payment.

324
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,560
Don't be anxious.

325
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,560
Then we can solve it quickly.

326
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,560
No.

327
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,560
Why should we give money?

328
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,560
I didn't do anything wrong.

329
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,560
When is it?

330
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,560
Can we solve it with money?

331
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,560
Isn't it good?

332
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,560
Yufan,

333
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,560
we can't solve it with money.

334
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,560
If we spend money,

335
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,560
it's like we've forgotten that this news is true.

336
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,560
We can't spend it.

337
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,560
This is a physical problem.

338
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,560
What do you think we should do now?

339
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,560
How about this?

340
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,560
I'll be the one to face it.

341
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,560
Okay.

342
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,560
Let's face it together.

343
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,560
We'll admit our love relationship.

344
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,560
Not together.

345
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,560
It's myself.

346
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,560
What do you mean?

347
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,560
Shi Qi,

348
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,560
you're still in the upper class.

349
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,560
The public love is a big blow to your career.

350
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,560
You can't be publicized.

351
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,560
Dan Xi,

352
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,560
what do you mean?

353
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,560
I mean,

354
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,560
I'm Shi Qi's sister.

355
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,560
So,

356
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,560
will it really work?

357
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,560
Of course.

358
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,560
There are two girls in the picture.

359
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,560
I'm her sister.

360
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,560
Another girl,

361
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,560
even if she's in a normal relationship with her,

362
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,560
it's not a boat to her.

363
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,560
Then the company will be publicized.

364
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,560
This thing will go on.

365
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,560
Yes, yes.

366
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,560
That's how it will end.

367
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,560
No.

368
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,560
This thing is so unfair to you.

369
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,560
Shi Qi,

370
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,560
calm down.

371
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,560
What do you mean?

372
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,560
Gu Dan Xi,

373
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,560
you're my girlfriend.

374
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,560
Why should I make you suffer?

375
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,560
You said a lie,

376
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,560
and you're a liar.

377
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,560
Do you understand this?

378
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,560
Shi Qi,

379
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,560
your current mission is to shoot a movie.

380
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,560
You can't share these things.

381
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,560
Okay, I don't need you to do that.

382
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,560
Then we'll really break up.

383
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,560
No one will say that.

384
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,560
Break up?

385
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,560
You're so clear-headed.

386
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,560
Do you want to say that

387
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,560
you're my sister?

388
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,560
Shi Qi,

389
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,560
can't you hear me?

390
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,560
Is this for your own good?

391
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,560
Now,

392
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,560
the most important thing is to solve the problem first.

393
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,560
You go back and make up.

394
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,560
Look at you two.

395
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,560
Let's talk about something.

396
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,560
How about this?

397
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,560
Let's keep the southern west's plan in mind.

398
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,560
Let's see the development of the future.

399
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,560
We'll make a deal.

400
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,560
Okay?

401
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,560
Yufan,

402
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,560
talk to the southern west first.

403
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,560
I'll send Shi Qi to eat.

404
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,560
Okay?

405
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,560
You're crazy.

406
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,560
I know it's hard at the novice level,

407
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,560
but he wouldn't either.

408
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,560
How do you know this?

409
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,560
You said we were always one when Master Shi Qi inside.

410
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,560
It's a meaningful moment.

411
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:58,120
men

412
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,560
I knew he'd get nervous.

413
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,960
The more Nan Xi says this,

414
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,960
the more it proves that he doesn't want to be separated.

415
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,560
Shiqin,

416
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,360
I was quite worried that you two couldn't make it.

417
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,560
I'm getting more and more envious of you two

418
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,960
after this.

419
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,960
Look at your brother-in-law.

420
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,560
You and my brother-in-law are good.

421
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,560
Okay.

422
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,160
I'm happy to see you two.

423
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,160
Brother-in-law,

424
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,160
I'm begging you.

425
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,160
Stop it.

426
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,360
I know.

427
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,360
I'm helping you to keep Nan Xi safe.

428
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,760
Don't let her do anything stupid.

429
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,360
Yes.

430
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,960
She really doesn't know the power of netizens.

431
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,960
Once she does that,

432
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,560
the secret will be revealed.

433
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,560
There's nothing left.

434
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,160
What are you going to do?

435
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,160
I'm not quite sure yet.

436
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,560
Please look at me.

437
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:10,960
Wait.

438
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:12,960
Let's go first.

439
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,260
講报告MAE

440
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:35,660
Guys.

441
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,460
Wait.

442
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,800
I'm so worried.

443
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,160
Now the situation in the idol's room

444
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,120
is getting worse.

445
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,680
How can the company

446
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,960
sign the contract with the director?

447
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,480
Right.

448
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,960
The company has invested in the film industry.

449
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,760
This is the field

450
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,440
that the company has never touched.

451
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,960
It's so big.

452
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,960
Now that it's out of this,

453
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,600
I guess it's a flood in eight cities.

454
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,520
Linan, how can you handle it?

455
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,320
Uncle.

456
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,520
Before the company makes all the decisions,

457
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,040
the directors usually vote for it.

458
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,040
I think

459
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,040
it's not the time to be in charge.

460
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,080
Linan,

461
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,960
although Li Chunlin has some problems,

462
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,400
he did say something right.

463
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,160
You're not suitable to be in the position of the president.

464
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,160
It seems that you all have a background today.

465
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,200
Linan,

466
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,280
I suggest you to let go as soon as possible.

467
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,800
Otherwise, the company will be in your hands sooner or later.

468
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,640
Do you all think so?

469
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,000
Linan,

470
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,600
you really don't want to be in this matter.

471
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,240
And recently,

472
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,960
you've been busy with work in the company.

473
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,280
It's too hard.

474
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,560
You should take a good rest.

475
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,760
Xiaorui,

476
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,960
I really want to see you.

477
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,520
Linan,

478
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,040
I did this for your own good.

479
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,360
I suggest you

480
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,280
you should let Xiaorui be your main villain.

481
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,400
Before that,

482
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,660
how old were you

483
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,520
under the leadership ofómissing President Xia?

484
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,800
Director Wang, you're wrong.

485
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,840
But you should

486
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,720
make the final decision about this.

487
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,880
I believe that

488
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,760
everyone's eyes are white colored.

489
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:56,520
OK,

490
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,800
Forget my voters.

491
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:02,960
You were able to kill

492
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:03,920
my uncle?

493
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,920
I'm leaving.

494
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,920
Don't mind him.

495
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,920
Li Na is still in a good mood.

496
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,920
Let's give him a break.

497
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,920
It's good to have a break.

498
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,920
Well, President Xiao.

499
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,920
We are a group of five.

500
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,920
You are the substitute.

501
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,920
I think you have no opinions.

502
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,920
Well,

503
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,920
I'll be more respectful.

504
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,920
From now on,

505
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,920
I'll take all the blame for Li Na.

506
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,920
I'll be more respectful.

507
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,920
I'll be more respectful.

508
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,920
I'll be more respectful.

509
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,920
I'll be more respectful.

510
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,920
I'll be more respectful.

511
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,920
And,

512
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,920
I've decided

513
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,920
to stop the background information of the crew.

514
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,920
And end the cooperation between Qin Shiqi and him.

515
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,920
President Chen.

516
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,920
Yes, Qin Shiqi.

517
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,920
It's okay.

518
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,920
Director.

519
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,920
What's going on?

520
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,920
Why didn't you start the work today?

521
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,920
Shiqi.

522
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,920
I think you should know something.

523
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,920
What is it?

524
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,920
It's because of you.

525
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,920
Kaige's jewelry

526
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,920
has been decided to withdraw the money from us.

527
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,920
Reject the money?

528
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,920
You know all the inspections here?

529
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,920
That's right.

530
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,920
Many decibels here still exist.

531
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,920
Is it right?

532
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,920
Big brother,

533
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,920
please give me some information check it up.

534
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,920
Hello?

535
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:29,920
You areammed, are not you?

536
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,920
What is that?

537
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,360
I'll pass on my love only to you.

538
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,920
No, I don't want to face you.

539
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,300
This way.

540
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,120
This way.

541
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,560
This way and this way.

542
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,120
Let me ask you about this letter first because you said you were hungry.

543
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,400
Sister Lan Xi.

544
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,940
KO?

545
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,020
Why are you here?

546
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:58,280
Sister Lan Xi, can you look for me to give you完了 advice?

547
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,160
I'm sorry.

548
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,120
I'm sorry? Why?

549
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,760
If it wasn't for me,

550
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,120
it wouldn't have been like this.

551
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,560
Don't say that.

552
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,320
We're all victims.

553
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,760
Someone must have planned this.

554
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,000
It's all my fault.

555
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,880
I'm sorry.

556
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,680
I'm sorry.

557
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,560
I'm sorry.

558
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,560
I'm sorry.

559
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,560
I'm sorry.

560
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,560
I'm sorry.

561
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,560
I'm sorry.

562
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,560
I'm sorry.

563
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,560
I'm sorry.

564
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,560
I'm sorry.

565
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,560
I'm sorry.

566
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,560
I'm sorry.

567
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,560
I'm sorry.

568
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,800
It's all my fault.

569
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,000
I should have told you earlier.

570
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,360
It's all Xiao Rui.

571
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,520
Xiao Rui made a mistake.

572
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,480
She made me confused and I'm with her.

573
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,680
If I told you earlier,

574
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,800
I wouldn't have...

575
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,680
I didn't expect

576
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,560
it's all Xiao Rui's fault.

577
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,320
Sister Nanxi,

578
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,080
how should I make up for it?

579
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,320
We're in a hurry to help Shiqi.

580
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,560
Yes.

581
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,080
I'll do whatever you say.

582
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,080
How about we help her make a statement?

583
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,080
Okay.

584
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,480
I have experience in this.

585
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,880
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

586
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,920
What's wrong, Grandpa?

587
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,880
Disgusting.

588
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,200
Is it that serious?

589
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,200
Okay, I get it.

590
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,200
What's wrong, Sister Nanxi?

591
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,200
Brother Kai withdraws his money.

592
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,520
Shiqi is taking the film break.

593
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,360
It's all my fault.

594
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,880
It's all my fault.

595
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,600
Don't say that.

596
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,800
The money must be in Xiao Rui's plan.

597
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,800
Sister Nanxi,

598
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,200
I have a way.

599
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,880
What way?

600
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,480
It's all my fault.

601
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,680
Don't worry.

602
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,080
I'll take responsibility for it.

603
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,280
Wait for my good news.

604
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,280
Xiao Rui.

605
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,880
I was going to look for you.

606
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,080
But I found you weren't here.

607
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,280
So I waited for you here.

608
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,880
Nanxi,

609
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,480
I prepared this for you personally.

610
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,280
No need.

611
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,280
I and Li Na are done.

612
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,680
It's over.

613
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,080
Nanxi,

614
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,080
I promised to hide things from Li Na before.

615
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,480
But you have to believe me.

616
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,280
I did this

617
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,280
for the future between us.

618
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,480
Li Na has left Kai Pavilion.

619
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,480
Now Kai Pavilion is my fault.

620
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,480
As long as you're here,

621
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,880
you can come back anytime.

622
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,880
Nanxi,

623
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,480
you're my love.

624
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,880
Love?

625
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,680
Love is not worth it

626
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,280
to say it out loud.

627
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,680
Don't say that.

628
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,880
Then what do I say?

629
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,680
Thank you for your love.

630
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,880
I love that boy so much.

631
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,680
Gu Nanxi,

632
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,480
are you that heartless?

633
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,680
Heartless?

634
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,680
Is there any problem between us?

635
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,280
You've always loved yourself.

636
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,880
You've never loved me.

637
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,680
An Keke has told me

638
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,280
what you did before.

639
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,680
Whatever you want to do,

640
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,880
just do it.

641
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,480
We won't give up.

642
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,680
You can do it.

643
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,840
Step down,

644
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,280
to two,

645
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,780
hurt yourself,

646
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,780
and hug.

647
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,460
Episode 7

648
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,480
Grandpa.

649
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,280
Grandpa.

650
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,480
Grandpa.

651
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,480
Grandpa.

652
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,480
I have something to ask you to help me.

653
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,480
It's the information about the investment of Qin Shiqi.

654
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,480
You already know?

655
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,880
I've read the news.

656
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,080
So you agreed?

657
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,680
Actually, Qin Shiqi's crew is poor and not enough.

658
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,880
You see, there are many things in society that need help.

659
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,680
Why should I invest in Qin Shiqi?

660
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:51,680
Yan Yan, if it's not because of me,

661
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,680
won't it turn out like this?

662
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,680
Keke, I am your grandfather.

663
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,680
But now you are already old.

664
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:06,680
You should solve your own mistakes.

665
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,680
Yan Yan.

666
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,680
If you don't give me a good reason today,

667
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:15,680
I won't help you even if you say you are a big man.

668
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,680
I like Qin Shiqi.

669
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,680
Didn't she already have a girlfriend?

670
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,680
Yan Yan, I've been thinking a lot lately.

671
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:35,680
Sometimes, I don't necessarily have to do it.

672
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,680
I can also be a little bit of a burden.

673
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,680
I can also be a little bit of a burden.

674
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,680
I like Shiqi.

675
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,680
I just want to see her happy.

676
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,680
Then I am satisfied.

677
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,680
If she is unhappy with me,

678
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,680
then why should I force her?

679
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:01,680
Yan Yan, actually, I am doing this not only for Shiqi,

680
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,680
but also for Yi Hai's jewelry.

681
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,680
Yi Hai's jewelry has always been a big problem.

682
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,680
Actually, our cash flow is very strong.

683
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,680
It is a lack of market.

684
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,680
I used to keep looking for a good propaganda environment.

685
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,680
But the effect is not very ideal.

686
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:24,680
You want to promote our Yi Hai's jewelry through Qin Shiqi's play.

687
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,680
But now, in addition to this matter,

688
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,680
whether the new play can be released or not,

689
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:36,680
I don't know if the risk is too high.

690
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,680
I have already thought about it.

691
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,680
This matter is because of me.

692
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,680
I will let the company release a new article tomorrow

693
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,680
to clarify my relationship with Shiqi

694
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,680
and to fight for the lowest public opinion.

695
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,680
As for Sister Nan Xi,

696
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,680
I think Shiqi will have a way.

697
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:59,680
It seems that you have already planned everything.

698
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,680
Isn't that so? I will do everything in my power

699
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,680
to help you get this winter wind.

700
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,680
Yan Yan, you...

701
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:26,680
I have already known about it since the incident happened.

702
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,680
You will find me.

703
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,680
It is still so difficult for me to do this before the cold.

704
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,680
Sit down.

705
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:37,680
Ke Ke, I am a businessman.

706
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,680
I am not like a charity.

707
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,680
But after hearing what you said,

708
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,680
I suddenly felt that my granddaughter

709
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,680
has grown up.

710
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,680
She is all over the country.

711
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,680
Go ahead.

712
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,680
Here is the investment.

713
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,680
It's yours.

714
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,680
Thank you, Yan Yan.

715
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,680
If you say it again,

716
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,680
this is the investment.

717
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,680
I will ask the responsibility.

718
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,680
Don't worry, Yan Yan.

719
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,680
I didn't expect that the one who sent the charcoal in the snow

720
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,680
would be Ke Ke.

721
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,680
But Ke Ke is quite good.

722
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,680
The previous things

723
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,680
should be too much for Shiqi.

724
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,680
My brother is a little charming.

725
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,680
Of course.

726
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,680
I have a lot of eyes.

727
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,680
Okay.

728
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,680
The crisis of Shiqi has been solved for the time being.

729
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,680
Let's think about the competition.

730
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,680
You really want to participate?

731
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,680
Of course.

732
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,680
I tell you,

733
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,680
this matter is not discussed.

734
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,680
I heard from the internal news that

735
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,680
you are also participating in the treasure hunt.

736
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:58,680
Don't you want to defeat Xiao Rui?

737
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,680
Okay, I will participate.

738
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,680
I am very happy to be a part of this project.

739
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,680
I am very happy to be a part of this project.

740
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:31,680
I am very happy to be a part of this project.

741
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,680
I am very happy to be a part of this project.

742
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,680
I am very happy to be a part of this project.

743
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,680
I am very happy to be a part of this project.

744
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,680
I am very happy to be a part of this project.

745
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,680
I am very happy to be a part of this project.

746
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,680
I am very happy to be a part of this project.

747
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,680
I am very happy to be a part of this project.

748
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,680
I am very happy to be a part of this project.

749
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,680
I am very happy to be a part of this project.

750
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,680
I am very happy to be a part of this project.

751
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,680
I am very happy to be a part of this project.

752
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,680
I am very happy to be a part of this project.

753
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,680
