1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,160
Can't understand the separation with me

2
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,560
In my arms, who are you talking about

3
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,960
Why are you hiding in my soft heart

4
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,320
I want to get closer to you, but your little stars

5
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,720
Are always around you, never leaving, never leaving

6
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,080
I want to get closer to you, to guard your secret

7
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,680
I will keep looking for you

8
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,880
I'm waiting for you in this life

9
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,200
I want to get closer to you, but your little stars

10
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,600
Are always around you, never leaving, never leaving

11
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,000
I want to get closer to you, to guard your secret

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,600
I will keep looking for you

13
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,640
I want to be with you for the rest of my life

14
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,440
To protect you

15
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,240
What to do

16
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,760
So awkward

17
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,240
What to say

18
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,640
You say first

19
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,720
That one

20
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,240
You say first, you say first

21
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,240
Nothing, you say first

22
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,000
What do you usually like to do

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,480
I see your figure is so good

24
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,400
It should be fitness

25
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,000
See

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,400
I also see

27
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,280
What's wrong, did I say something wrong

28
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,000
No, I just wanted to ask you this question

29
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,240
I usually work busy

30
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,480
Except for fitness, I basically rest

31
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,880
I'm like you

32
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,960
Let's go over and toast

33
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,160
Let's go

34
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:46,960
Please

35
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,280
Being your DIY

36
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,120
Zar gleich

37
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,440
Be careful

38
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,600
Thank you

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,920
Everybody

40
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,920
This time,

41
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,800
our collaboration with Lisa magazine

42
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,800
was particularly successful.

43
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,280
It also helped us, Kaige,

44
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,520
to achieve a higher level in the market.

45
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,720
Let us thank

46
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,320
the editor-in-chief of Lisa magazine,

47
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,040
Mr. Leng Ran.

48
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,160
Secondly,

49
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,760
I want to thank all the employees of the company.

50
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,760
Without your hard work,

51
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,400
Kaige will not have today.

52
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,000
On behalf of the company,

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
on behalf of the company,

54
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,080
and on behalf of myself,

55
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,800
thank you.

56
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,840
Lastly,

57
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,920
I want to thank

58
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,720
the jewelry design team.

59
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,120
Because of your expertise,

60
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,960
and your talent,

61
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,480
you have this

62
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,400
rare jewelry.

63
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,800
Thank you.

64
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,040
You've worked hard.

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
On this important day,

66
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,560
I want to announce one thing.

67
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,120
I will hire a designer from Gu Nanxi

68
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,840
to be the chief designer of our company.

69
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,960
Thank you.

70
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,000
Let's welcome the designer from Gu Nanxi.

71
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,520
Great.

72
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,520
Great.

73
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Great.

74
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,320
Nanxi,

75
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,640
thank you.

76
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,400
I didn't expect

77
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,240
Gu Nanxi is so skilled.

78
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,560
You just joined the company,

79
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,880
but you lost the position of your designer.

80
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,720
Now you are the chief designer.

81
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,240
I didn't expect

82
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,760
you would do something

83
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,240
that you couldn't do in the past six or seven years.

84
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,560
At least I have shares in Kaige.

85
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,200
If I remember correctly,

86
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,560
you've been in Kaige for three or four years.

87
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,800
Are you jealous of Mr. Xiao's

88
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,440
special care for Gu Nanxi

89
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,440
that you are here?

90
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,920
I'm afraid Gu Nanxi will press you down.

91
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,520
You won't even have a chance to turn over in Kaige.

92
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,760
Lu erreichen

93
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,440
Listen,

94
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,840
we haven't explained the shoots yet.

95
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,120
How can we know?

96
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,760
Don't worry.

97
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,060
There will be a whole ribbon work

98
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,000
and so can you.

99
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,120
You've prepared what you want?

100
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:35,960
Okay.

101
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,200
You can't bungee-jump and stop.

102
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,800
I'm so tired.

103
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,760
I just got up and went to the restroom.

104
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,080
I'm so tired.

105
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,280
Today...

106
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,120
Sister Nanxi.

107
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,600
We're going back.

108
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,320
Bye.

109
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,200
Bye, sister Nanxi.

110
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:57,760
See you tomorrow.

111
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,400
Bye.

112
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,240
Bye, sister Nanxi.

113
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,040
Be safe.

114
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,320
Nanxi.

115
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,080
Yufan.

116
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,400
Yufan.

117
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,800
You drank too much.

118
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,000
Let me send you back.

119
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,800
Okay.

120
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,520
Let's go.

121
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,360
Let's go together.

122
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,600
I'm dizzy.

123
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,040
I want to take a walk.

124
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,360
Go.

125
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,600
Let's go.

126
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,400
Let's go.

127
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,200
Let's go.

128
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:23,800
Go.

129
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Tao Muchu

130
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,720
危險

131
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,440
陳喆

132
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I aanedize from the Cabinet Office.

133
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm a designer assistant.

134
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
For my career,

135
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm very careful.

136
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm going to succeed if you just watch me.

137
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Because of your appearance,

138
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm in a loss.

139
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Designer Chen,

140
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I understand your feelings.

141
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But my

142
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
martellin

143
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
doesn't suit you.

144
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Your design style is very good.

145
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Very unique.

146
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But

147
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I can't give it to you.

148
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I think you...

149
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You...

150
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You can have your own work later.

151
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You can choose.

152
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm leaving now.

153
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Gu Nanxi.

154
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Now there are only the two of us.

155
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You don't have to learn.

156
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You ruined everything about me.

157
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
All your glory today,

158
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
all your achievements,

159
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
should be mine.

160
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Chen Zhe's.

161
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Mine!

162
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Nanxi, are you okay?

163
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Chen Ruiqi, why are you

164
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
here?

165
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Chen Zhe,

166
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
no one can compare to you.

167
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Mr. Xiao.

168
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And I'm warning you.

169
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Stay away from Gu Nanxi.

170
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You...

171
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You're drunk at night.

172
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
How dangerous is it?

173
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Why are you here?

174
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I...

175
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I was just passing by.

176
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I was just passing by.

177
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
What a coincidence.

178
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm sleepy.

179
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Nanxi.

180
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I...

181
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm so drunk.

182
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
We're here.

183
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Okay.

184
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Do you have anything to say to me?

185
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
No.

186
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Then... I'm going upstairs.

187
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Okay.

188
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Are you drunk?

189
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I have coffee upstairs.

190
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Do you want to drink some fresh wine?

191
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
No.

192
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's late.

193
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'll go to bed early.

194
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Good night.

195
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm really leaving.

196
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Do you have anything else to drink?

197
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm going to bed.

198
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm going to bed.

199
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm going to bed.

200
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Your hand is so high.

201
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'm sorry.

202
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm sorry.

203
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm sorry.

204
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'm sorry.

205
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Shiqi.

206
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Did you find this card for me?

207
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You know everything, Nanxi.

208
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Ma Qiyuan.

209
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm the one who took the photos.

210
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Nanxi.

211
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Don't think too much.

212
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Have a good rest.

213
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
So cute.

214
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
So cute.

215
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I want to fall into your arms.

216
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I won't leave you.

217
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I'm defeated by you.

218
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I love you.

219
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I can't stop.

220
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Good boy.

221
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You're my talent.

222
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
As long as you're willing to take me back.

223
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I don't need to be alone when I have you.

224
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Love you.

225
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Yufan.

226
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
What was that?

227
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
My good- odd one.

228
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Are you asleep?

229
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
SoNER, it's really you.

230
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Congratulations.

231
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,200
I'm really grateful to you.

232
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,600
If it weren't for you,

233
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,960
I wouldn't have met Yufan.

234
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,160
All right, Keke.

235
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,680
Love is love.

236
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,040
I still have to see your design.

237
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,520
Of course.

238
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Love is love.

239
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,040
Keke, do you have any hope?

240
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,200
It's okay.

241
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,280
If it's not good,

242
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,560
I can go back and fix it.

243
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,600
Keke.

244
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,600
Are you so not confident

245
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,320
in your design?

246
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,720
I mean,

247
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,880
your design is very good.

248
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,080
Really?

249
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,120
Your improvement

250
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,400
has fixed all the problems

251
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,440
I mentioned last time.

252
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,240
And there's something

253
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,560
I didn't expect.

254
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,600
Keke, I knew it.

255
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,920
You're not a problem.

256
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,640
It's all thanks to you.

257
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,560
We're preparing

258
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,840
a Lisha jewelry party.

259
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,560
I think your design

260
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,760
can be one of our cooperatives.

261
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,240
That's great.

262
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,840
Thank you, Luoran.

263
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,360
I'll lower my voice.

264
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
But don't be too happy too early.

265
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,640
It depends on your work

266
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,760
whether you can attend the party.

267
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,440
I'll be fine.

268
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,960
Thank you.

269
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,640
Well, I'll get to the point.

270
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,880
I won't disturb your relationship.

271
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,840
I'll go back to work.

272
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,800
Keke.

273
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,520
I'm going back too.

274
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,400
After all, this is my boss.

275
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,280
It's not good to

276
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,920
date in front of him.

277
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:17,880
I'm leaving.

278
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,400
Let's go, Keke.

279
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,960
I didn't see him.

280
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:22,920
Bye.

281
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,920
I hope you're happy.

282
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,400
What does it mean?

283
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,840
It's beautiful.

284
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,040
Shi Qi is so thoughtful.

285
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:52,720
Let's go.

286
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,640
What are you doing?

287
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,640
What are you doing?

288
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,640
It's early morning already.

289
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,400
Why aren't you eating your food or speaking?

290
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,520
You'regenerous.

291
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,840
What's wrong?

292
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,280
Do I look

293
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,600
different?

294
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,240
You shouldn't be.

295
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,360
I have tattoos.

296
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,840
What did you say?

297
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,600
Me?

298
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,680
Who?

299
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,400
Sister Nanxi.

300
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,320
What's the situation between you two?

301
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,280
What situation?

302
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,760
Nothing happened.

303
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,360
A gentleman never takes advantage of others.

304
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,640
You're so annoying.

305
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,600
You're just a thief.

306
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,560
You don't have the guts.

307
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,800
Tell me.

308
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,880
Do you care about

309
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,800
what happened between you and An Ke?

310
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,000
There's no follow-up.

311
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,560
And I think

312
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,640
she didn't mean it

313
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,360
last night.

314
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,080
Oh my god.

315
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:51,800
Then...

316
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,320
She's not conscious.

317
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,160
Does she mean anything to you?

318
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,480
I don't know.

319
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,760
I feel embarrassed

320
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,800
when I see Sister Nanxi.

321
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,200
I don't know how to ask her.

322
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,080
What are you embarrassed about?

323
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,360
As a man,

324
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,840
you should be more proactive.

325
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,280
What?

326
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,080
You want me to be more proactive?

327
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,480
More proactive?

328
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,800
Well...

329
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,680
I don't know

330
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,640
if she was conscious last night.

331
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,040
How can I be more proactive?

332
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,480
You're so straightforward.

333
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,280
You're so late.

334
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,280
You're late.

335
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:28,880
An Ke.

336
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,800
You're so stupid.

337
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,840
Why did I teach you to be a student?

338
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,200
What student?

339
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,760
You're still a student.

340
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,760
Listen.

341
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,600
From now on,

342
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,160
I'll be your

343
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,760
love advisor.

344
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,760
I believe you all know

345
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,040
why I'm here today.

346
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,200
After all the efforts

347
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,040
of our company,

348
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,040
our new season of jewelry

349
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,680
is finally on the market.

350
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,960
And

351
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,520
the market is very good.

352
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,280
First of all,

353
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,400
we'd like to thank

354
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,080
our CEO,

355
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,880
Mr. Xiao Rui.

356
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,240
Without his help,

357
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,240
we might have to

358
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,840
get through

359
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,800
such a good design.

360
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:22,920
Next,

361
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,280
we'd like to thank

362
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,560
our new designer,

363
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,560
Gu Nanxi,

364
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,920
who joined us

365
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,760
in the short term.

366
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,320
He used his design ideas

367
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,320
and his hard work

368
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,920
to create new furniture

369
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,600
for our Keige Jewelry.

370
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,040
Let's give a round of applause

371
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,480
to Miss Gu Nanxi.

372
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,480
Thank you.

373
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,080
Next,

374
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,280
I'd like to announce

375
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,360
a change in our company's personnel

376
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,280
and work.

377
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,760
I believe you've all seen it.

378
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,560
Our previous design director,

379
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,560
Mr. Chen Zhe,

380
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,480
didn't attend our meeting today.

381
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,320
Some people already knew it yesterday.

382
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,400
Maybe some people don't know it yet.

383
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,760
Because of Mr. Chen Zhe's

384
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,640
evil behavior,

385
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,520
it seriously affected

386
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,720
the company's image.

387
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,640
So I decided

388
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,240
to hire Mr. Chen Zhe.

389
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,560
Gu Nanxi

390
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,440
will be the director.

391
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,320
Nanxi,

392
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,040
you're in a big trouble again.

393
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,320
Ms. Li Na,

394
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,560
will this matter...

395
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,920
Don't say it.

396
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,600
The personnel change

397
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,160
will be decided by the board.

398
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,280
Besides,

399
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,160
our market director

400
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,640
has been absent for a long time.

401
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,360
After a long time of observation,

402
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,400
I've decided

403
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,040
to hire Xiao Han

404
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,640
as our new

405
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,120
market director.

406
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:51,840
Ms. Li Na,

407
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,960
will Xiao Han

408
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,640
be the director at this age?

409
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,800
Mr. Xiao,

410
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,080
the position of our company

411
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,240
is decided by ability.

412
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,040
It has nothing to do with time.

413
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,640
If we're talking about time,

414
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,160
maybe Gu Nanxi is still

415
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,160
a small assistant.

416
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,920
Of course.

417
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,760
Ms. Gu,

418
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,280
I'm not talking about you.

419
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,000
We all know

420
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,800
your ability.

421
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,800
You're in this position.

422
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,160
We're convinced.

423
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,040
Xiao Han,

424
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,120
I believe

425
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,840
you won't let me down.

426
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,600
Thank you, everyone.

427
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,320
I'll try my best to help you.

428
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,280
I think

429
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,880
Ms. Li Na's decision today

430
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,200
is too right.

431
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,920
Xiao Han, Nanxi,

432
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,840
you're a hero.

433
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,240
We all believe

434
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,600
in you two.

435
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,880
You'll definitely win.

436
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,160
This position

437
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,280
won't let us down.

438
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,040
Come on.

439
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,920
If there's nothing else,

440
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,000
I won't waste your time.

441
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,880
Mr. Xiao,

442
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,400
do you have anything else to add?

443
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,120
Nothing.

444
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,200
We're all busy.

445
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,200
Let's call it a day.

446
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,280
Li Na,

447
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,840
I'd like to talk to you

448
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,440
about Xiao Han.

449
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:38,920
At his age,

450
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,280
he's in this position.

451
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,280
I'm afraid...

452
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,480
What's wrong?

453
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,560
I have your sister.

454
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,560
Why are you unhappy?

455
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,160
I'm too grateful.

456
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,240
If it weren't for your proposal,

457
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,440
I wouldn't be here today.

458
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,320
If you're really grateful,

459
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,600
have dinner with me.

460
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,400
I have a lot of work to do in the company.

461
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,400
I'm looking for time.

462
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,040
Okay.

463
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,640
Are you in the office?

464
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,800
What's wrong?

465
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,600
Are you embarrassed

466
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,960
or afraid that others will see you?

467
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,480
No.

468
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,640
I'm thinking too much.

469
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,280
Come on.

470
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:14,880
Sit down.

471
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,320
We've been walking for a day.

472
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,000
Aren't you tired?

473
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,720
This design

474
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,840
has made great progress.

475
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,360
Really?

476
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,320
I've got a master's instruction.

477
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,400
Master?

478
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,320
Master?

479
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,920
I'm telling you a secret.

480
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,080
I have my own arrangement.

481
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,760
You've made it.

482
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,160
It seems that love

483
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,080
is indeed different.

484
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,440
Grandpa.

485
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,800
Why are you embarrassed?

486
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,400
When are you going to

487
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,640
bring your grandson-in-law to see me?

488
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,440
Grandpa, leave me alone.

489
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,880
I have my own arrangement.

490
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,000
I'm going to

491
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,480
try love and break up.

492
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,600
It seems that I support you.

493
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,440
Keke.

494
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,000
You're

495
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,280
very nice to me.

496
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,600
But

497
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,640
work is important.

498
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,040
But you should take care of yourself.

499
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,480
You've been thinner recently.

500
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,360
Really?

501
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,040
That's great. I'm on a diet.

502
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,400
What kind of diet?

503
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,080
You should be fatter.

504
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,120
Grandpa, you don't understand.

505
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,000
Okay, I won't talk to you.

506
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,480
Is Qin Yifan

507
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,200
Qin's sister?

508
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,520
I'm right.

509
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,960
You're a good family.

510
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,160
Keke.

511
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,440
You have a good taste.

512
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,480
Of course.

513
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,440
What's wrong with my taste?

514
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,000
Especially when I see my grandpa.

515
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,280
He chose you?

516
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,200
Xiao Du, congratulations.

517
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:04,920
I'm fine.

518
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,040
Don't come to my office.

519
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,480
Why are you so nervous?

520
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,800
The new collection of jewelry

521
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,120
is very well-made.

522
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,000
The board of directors is very impressed with you.

523
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,880
The shareholders' meeting

524
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,440
is about to begin.

525
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,400
Some shareholders

526
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,880
have already given me a hint in private.

527
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,640
By then,

528
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,240
they will stand by our side.

529
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:36,280
Let's drink to our hearts' content, buddy.

530
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,720
Cheers.

531
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,440
The more it's at this moment,

532
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,280
the more we should be careful.

533
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,440
But, what do you think

534
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,680
about Li Nan?

535
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,980
Not only did she pass

536
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,280
Gu Nanshi's approval,

537
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,680
she even promoted Xiao Han

538
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,040
as the director of the marketing department.

539
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,120
Isn't this way

540
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,480
more beneficial to us?

541
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,120
Tell me.

542
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,720
What strategy do you use?

543
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,720
Why doesn't she suspect you at all?

544
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,720
I don't know.

545
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,720
I don't think it's that simple.

546
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,720
It's not that complicated.

547
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,720
Don't you know Li Na?

548
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,720
She's a broken shopping addict.

549
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,720
She's a professional.

550
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,720
She doesn't understand the company.

551
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,720
I hope so.

552
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,720
Bro,

553
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,720
you've been a silver man for so many years.

554
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,720
You'll be out of your mind soon.

555
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,720
You should be careful.

556
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,720
But don't be too much.

557
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,720
Listen,

558
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,720
with the shares we have now,

559
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,720
I can replace her at the board of directors.

560
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,720
If you want to sympathize with her,

561
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,720
you can give her some money.

562
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,720
I don't mind being a shareholder.

563
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,720
It's a humanitarian act.

564
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,720
You can't be careful until you succeed.

565
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,720
Anything else?

566
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,720
Are you leaving?

567
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,720
It's still early.

568
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,720
I'll buy you a drink.

569
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,720
Let's go.

570
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,720
To celebrate.

571
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,720
Let's go.

572
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,720
Okay.

573
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,720
Let's go.

574
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,720
The company has a rule that

575
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,720
the management of the board of directors

576
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,720
will have some technical shares

577
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,720
to participate in the annual share.

578
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,720
Qingguo was in a hurry.

579
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,720
We didn't have time to send you

580
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,720
the shares of Weijia Mei and Qingtui Chenzhe.

581
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,720
Take a look.

582
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,720
If there's no problem, just sign it.

583
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,720
Here.

584
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,720
So many?

585
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,720
I've taken out a part of myself.

586
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,720
Here you go.

587
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,720
What do you mean?

588
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,720
Naqin,

589
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,720
I don't know how to make up for

590
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,720
what happened before.

591
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,720
It's just a small token of my gratitude.

592
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,720
Thank you.

593
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,720
Mr. Xiao, this isn't appropriate.

594
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,720
And you didn't owe me anything before.

595
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,720
Don't say that.

596
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,720
Naqin,

597
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,720
most of these are

598
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,720
the technical shares you deserve.

599
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,720
If you don't want to take

600
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,720
the extra part,

601
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,720
you can return it to me.

602
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,720
And the shareholders' meeting is coming up.

603
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,720
It's really difficult to change the contract.

604
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,720
Just treat it as

605
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,720
you've been waiting for me for a while.

606
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,720
Okay?

607
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,720
Okay.

608
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,720
I'll sign this first.

609
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,720
But I'll return the extra part to you later.

610
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,720
It's a deal.

611
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,720
The so-called

612
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,720
chasing girls,

613
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,720
what are you going to do?

614
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,720
You have to show

615
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,720
the feeling of chasing.

616
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,720
If you can do it,

617
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,720
you'll be happy.

618
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,720
If you can't,

619
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,720
you'll be sad.

620
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,720
It's been so many years.

621
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,720
Have you ever

622
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,720
shown that you love her?

623
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,720
That you like her?

624
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,720
Do you have to let her

625
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,720
tell you that?

626
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,720
Of course.

627
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,720
Because of your position,

628
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,720
your image,

629
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,720
right?

630
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,720
Many girls will tell you.

631
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,720
Right?

632
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,720
But your goal is different.

633
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,720
Right?

634
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,720
So what are you going to do?

635
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,720
You have to confess.

636
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,720
Sister Nanxi,

637
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,720
I've always had a wish.

638
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,720
Today, under the watchful eye of so many people,

639
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,720
I hope you can help me realize

640
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,720
that I'm your girlfriend.

641
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,720
Okay?

642
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,720
Qin Shiqing,

643
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,720
I think

644
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,720
you've been an actor for so many years.

645
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,720
You can't always

646
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,720
make people think that you're

647
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,720
a playboy.

648
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,720
Right? So what are you going to do at this time?

649
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,720
You have to show your true feelings.

650
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,720
Nanxi,

651
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,720
for so many years,

652
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,720
I've always had a dream.

653
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,720
This dream

654
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,720
can only be realized by you.

655
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,720
Today,

656
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,720
under the watchful eye of so many people,

657
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,720
I beg you

658
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,720
to help me realize this dream.

659
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,720
Gu Nanxi,

660
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,720
will you be my girlfriend?

661
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,720
Will you be my girlfriend?

662
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,720
Sister Nanxi,

663
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,720
will you be my girlfriend?

664
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,720
Okay,

665
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,720
that's it.

666
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,720
Hello, please find

667
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,720
Gu Nanxi.

668
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,720
Sorry, Mr. Gu and Mr. Xiao just went out.

669
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,720
Where did they go?

670
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,720
I don't know. Do you need me to help you?

671
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,720
No, I'm fine.

672
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,720
I'm fine.

673
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,720

I'm fine.

692
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,720
I'm fine.
