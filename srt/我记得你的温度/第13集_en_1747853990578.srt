1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Don't you understand that you have to say you want to be apart from me

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
In my arms, you are asleep

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
How can you hide in my soft heart?

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I want to be closer to you, be your little star

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm always around you, never leaving you

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I want to be closer to you, protect your secret

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I will keep looking for you

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm waiting for you

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I want to be closer to you, be your little star

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm always around you, never leaving you

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I want to be closer to you, protect your secret

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I will keep looking for you

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I will always be with you

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Protect you

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Where are you going?

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm going back

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's no use talking to you

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Don't worry

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'll say one more thing

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
This is not that simple

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Think about it

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm leaving

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm leaving

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Coco invited Chen Zhe into the company

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Let's talk about your business first

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
My business? What about mine?

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Why did you lie to me?

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
What are you talking about?

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I saw you coming out and running pretty fast

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Nanxi, let me explain this to you

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Nanxi

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Nanxi, I didn't mean to do this

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I swear, I didn't think of this idea

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yan Yan thought of it

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What does it have to do with Yan Yan?

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's none of your business

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You're in my house now

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You told me you had a leg injury

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Do you know how worried I was?

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I was worried about you every day

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I came back to take care of you as soon as I got off work

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Do you think lying to me is interesting?

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I just want to...

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Qin Shi Qi, you're really childish, okay?

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm almost 30 years old

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I don't have time to play with you

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
with this kind of kid

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Who says you're 30 years old when you're old?

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Anyway, you're too much

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You're too much. You have a good leg

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You can go

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Nanxi, I'm not childish

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm not immature

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I just...

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I just want an excuse to stay with you

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And you said I was childish

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You said I was immature

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You said I was lying to you

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Don't you have anything to lie to me?

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What did I lie to you?

61
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Psychological touch disorder

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You know it all

63
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I wanted to find a chance to talk to you

64
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
If you feel uncomfortable, I apologize to you

65
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You don't have to apologize to me

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
If I can cure your disease

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I want to be by your side every day, okay?

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
No need. I don't want to drag you down

69
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I love you

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I understand your concern

71
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Don't worry

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'll go and solve your concern now

73
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Shiqi

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I have something to tell you

75
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Come in

76
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Just say it

77
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Shiqi

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Don't worry

79
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Come in and say it

80
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
This kid

81
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Come on

82
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What's wrong with this kid?

83
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Shiqi

84
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You're so beautiful

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm so happy

86
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm so happy

87
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm so happy

88
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm so happy

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm so happy

90
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm so happy

91
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm so happy

92
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm so happy

93
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm so happy

94
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm so happy

95
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm so happy

96
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm so happy

97
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm so happy

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm so happy

99
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm so happy

100
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm so happy

101
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm so happy

102
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm so happy

103
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm so happy

104
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm so happy

105
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm so happy

106
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm so happy

107
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm so happy

108
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm so happy

109
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm so happy

110
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm so happy

111
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm so happy

112
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm so happy

113
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
The story starts and ends

114
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
All pass

115
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
This boy

116
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It seems to be always by my side

117
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
But I've been ignoring him

118
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
When I'm happy and sad

119
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
He appeared at the first time

120
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But I never noticed

121
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The person who loves me most in the world

122
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Just by my side

123
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But the moment of regret

124
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
When we parted

125
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You just say I'll go

126
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
How easy it is to finish

127
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
But you never say it

128
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Slow feet don't take too long

129
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Will go far in the end

130
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I will become a luxury

131
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Even if time is not a promise

132
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Just leave it to you

133
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Shi Qi

134
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Sister Nanxi

135
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Where is Shi Qi

136
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
He just went out

137
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
He just went out

138
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Went out

139
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Oh, my God

140
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Where did he go

141
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You go in first

142
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You go in first

143
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm not going in

144
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'll tell you here

145
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm so anxious

146
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Nanxi

147
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I think I still have to tell you

148
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Only you can persuade him

149
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You say

150
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Shi Qi

151
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
To get more contact with you

152
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So he's living in a bomb

153
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Now the company has given him a play

154
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
He's like a different person

155
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
He's very, very slow with his career

156
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Yes, the company did something

157
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Let him violate his own will

158
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
But he doesn't have to black me up

159
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Now Liu Dawei has already issued a label

160
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Said if you can't find him again

161
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Just terminate the contract with him

162
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And let him pay the breach

163
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Why didn't you tell me earlier

164
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You don't know too much

165
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Since the words are said

166
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'll tell you everything first

167
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Qin Shi Qi, in order to shoot the horse-horses

168
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I wanted to borrow 500,000 from me

169
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Compensate the company

170
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Just become

171
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
The endorsement of Kaige Jewelry

172
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Thanks to Coco's help

173
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Then he Liu Dawei

174
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
He used this to talk about it

175
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Let him not be with Coco

176
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm not interested in the relationship

177
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Cooperate with the company sales

178
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Why are you so stupid

179
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Why do you do this

180
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
But sister Nan, I want to ask you

181
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Are you and Shi Qi possible?

182
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
If it's impossible

183
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I think you should tell him earlier

184
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
If you don't say it, he will never die

185
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I know you have concerns

186
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Don't worry

187
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'll go and get rid of your concerns now

188
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I know

189
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm looking for you, Qin Shi Qi

190
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Who do you like?

191
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Like my best friend

192
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I tell you

193
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You and Nan Xi are impossible

194
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
How is it impossible

195
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Just because she is your best friend

196
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
She is my sister

197
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Not my sister

198
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I just don't agree with you being with her

199
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
If you are with her

200
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I will cut off all ties with you

201
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Okay, now immediately cut off ties

202
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Just so happen that I am not your brother

203
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I also have a reason to pursue Gu Nan Xi

204
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Okay, okay

205
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Let's have a good talk

206
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You are just like an enemy when you meet

207
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
What's the matter with you

208
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Shi Qi

209
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Leng Ran

210
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Nan Xi

211
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Nan Xi

212
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I know you are inside

213
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I know you can hear

214
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I want to tell you

215
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I didn't expect my sister to disagree

216
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I didn't expect her to be so stubborn

217
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I like you

218
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It's my own business

219
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It has nothing to do with others

220
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It has nothing to do with anyone

221
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Nan Xi

222
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I never care about what others think

223
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I don't care about my sister's opinion

224
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
If you don't want to see me today

225
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I can wait for you

226
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'll come again tomorrow

227
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Boss

228
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
My god

229
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You're finally here

230
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You know

231
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Where are you going today

232
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I go where

233
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You go to my company tomorrow

234
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Okay

235
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You drink with me first

236
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Okay

237
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Come

238
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Come

239
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Come

240
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Come

241
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Come

242
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Get up.

243
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Get up.

244
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Get up.

245
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
What are you doing?

246
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Let me ask you.

247
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I like Gu Nanxi.

248
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Am I wrong?

249
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You're wrong.

250
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I just want to be nice to her.

251
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Am I wrong?

252
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You're wrong.

253
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
She lied to me.

254
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm willing to.

255
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Am I wrong?

256
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Bitch.

257
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Bitch.

258
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
No, no, no.

259
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
This is not a bitch.

260
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
This is not a bitch.

261
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
This is love.

262
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Love.

263
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Do you understand?

264
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Love.

265
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
She has been talking to you all night.

266
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
What happened to you today?

267
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You haven't told me yet.

268
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Leave me alone.

269
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
No.

270
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Didn't Gu Nanxi go to you?

271
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
What do you mean?

272
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Did she go or not?

273
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I didn't see her.

274
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You shouldn't have.

275
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
What did you tell her?

276
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I told her everything.

277
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
What did you tell her?

278
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I told her everything

279
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
that you didn't allow me to say.

280
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
How about this?

281
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Tomorrow,

282
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'll go to Liu Dawei tomorrow

283
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
and admit my mistake.

284
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You cover for me.

285
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
What do you want to do?

286
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
What do you want to do?

287
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Leave me alone.

288
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I want to do something for her in the end.

289
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm sorry.

290
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm sorry.

291
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm sorry.

292
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm sorry.

293
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'm sorry.

294
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I'm sorry.

295
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'm sorry.

296
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'm sorry.

297
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm sorry.

298
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm sorry.

299
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm sorry.

300
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I'm sorry.

301
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I'm sorry.

302
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm sorry.

303
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm sorry.

304
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm sorry.

305
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I'm sorry.

306
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I'm sorry.

307
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm sorry.

308
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'm sorry.

309
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm sorry.

310
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm sorry.

311
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I'm sorry.

312
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm sorry.

313
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I'm sorry.

314
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'm sorry.

315
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm sorry.

316
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm sorry.

317
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm sorry.

318
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I'm sorry.

319
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,560
So that you won't go against this marriage.

320
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,560
Stop wasting time,

321
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,320
and just go back to how you were born.

322
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,740
Go!

323
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,200
Go to the lot you left for before the saints.

324
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,400
Stop wasting time.

325
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,740
Alright.

326
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:40,920
We'll leave now.

327
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,380
I'll need to go.

328
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,360
I'm so exhausted now.

329
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,760
I think of him in my heart

330
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,760
and push him out.

331
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,560
Our design is basically done.

332
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,960
I guess it's a little late today.

333
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,760
I can send you the sample photos.

334
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,160
I'm not here to talk about this.

335
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,560
What is it?

336
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,560
I think you've been in a bad state these days.

337
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,960
I... I just have too much pressure at work.

338
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,760
You heard what Yu Fan said that day, right?

339
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,160
I know you're at the door.

340
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,560
You don't have to deny me.

341
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,760
What do you think?

342
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,760
I didn't think of anything.

343
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,360
I'm not here to talk about Yu Fan.

344
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,960
I just take Shi Qi as my brother.

345
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,360
I really didn't think of anything.

346
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,560
Okay.

347
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,160
No matter what you say,

348
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,760
I still want to advise you

349
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,760
to respect your own thoughts.

350
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,360
I've always seen

351
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,960
Shi Qi's feelings for you.

352
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,360
I care about what Yu Fan thinks.

353
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,560
It's a matter of two people.

354
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,360
It has nothing to do with others.

355
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,560
Yu Fan just wants you to be happy.

356
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,560
He just doesn't have confidence in you.

357
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,360
Nanxi, if you like him,

358
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,560
just take him.

359
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,360
Don't regret it in the future.

360
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,560
I hope you understand.

361
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,960
No matter what decision you make,

362
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,360
I will support you.

363
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,560
Thank you, Luoran.

364
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,560
Then I'll go first.

365
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,360
You should go back early, too.

366
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,960
Don't let Shi Qi worry.

367
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,160
Just let him thoughtlessly

368
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,360
treat you as her brother and sister.

369
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:03,960
Er...

370
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,720
Shen Little Hong,

371
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,960
are you okay?

372
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,760
I found someone who truly liked you.

373
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,800
But yeah,

374
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,360
you should give her diferentes hopes.

375
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,560
Respect your own thoughts.

376
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,960
I've always seen Shi Qi's feelings for you.

377
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,360
The wind is blowing in the dark.

378
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,360
Listening to your complaints.

379
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,360
The kiss is breaking through the mountains.

380
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,360
The gentle hand is lazy.

381
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,360
The fireworks are suddenly blue.

382
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,360
I'm sorry. I've made you sad.

383
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,360
What are you talking about?

384
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,360
Why are you here?

385
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,360
I shouldn't hide anything from you.

386
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,360
I came for you.

387
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,360
For me?

388
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,360
Don't be silly.

389
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,360
I'm not silly.

390
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,360
I've figured it out.

391
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,360
Everything I've been struggling for is for you.

392
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,360
But I can't be your burden.

393
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,360
And ruin your dream.

394
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,360
You can't be without me in my dream.

395
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,360
It depends on your performance.

396
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,360
I'll continue to be strong.

397
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,360
And protect you.

398
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,360
What are you doing, Wang Yu?

399
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,360
Thank you for your trust.

400
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,360
Kai Ge won't let you down.

401
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,360
Happy cooperation.

402
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,360
Happy cooperation.

403
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,360
You're welcome.

404
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,360
You're welcome.

405
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,360
Let's work together.

406
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,360
Work together to make a good country.

407
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,360
I'll leave if you have nothing else.

408
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,360
So angry.

409
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,360
Let him go.

410
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,360
I have something to talk to you.

411
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,360
I'll go first.

412
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,360
The longing day by day.

413
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,360
Only because I always go forward.

414
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,360
My world is because of you.

415
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,360
The snow is falling slowly.

416
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,360
The starlight is burning.

417
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,360
Let the whole world have romance.

418
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,360
And I'm more greedy now.

419
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:00,360
I turn around and turn around.

420
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,360
You are the most brilliant in the world.

421
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:08,360
The ocean of peace is also a wave.

422
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,360
The longing day by day.

423
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,360
Only because I always go forward.

424
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,360
My world is because of you.

425
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,360
Warm.

426
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,360
You're together now?

427
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,360
Why?

428
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,360
You regret so soon?

429
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,360
No, I don't regret.

430
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,360
I never regret anything.

431
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,360
That's good.

432
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,360
I just feel...

433
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,360
I'm just a little scared.

434
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,360
I'm afraid I'll lose you one day.

435
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,360
Don't worry.

436
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,360
I won't let you lose me.

437
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,360
But I'm afraid.

438
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,360
Wait for me here.

439
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,360
Don't go. Wait for me.

440
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,360
Lan Xi.

441
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,360
Where have you been?

442
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,360
So long.

443
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,360
I've been to many stores and closed.

444
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,360
So I made a her as a substitute.

445
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,360
What are you doing? Get up.

446
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,360
Today I want to give you a formal confession.

447
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,360
I like you since you were 18.

448
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,360
In these ten years,

449
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,360
I've never stopped my love for you.

450
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,360
In front of so many people,

451
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:11,360
I want to say what I've never said in my heart for 11 years.

452
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,360
Gu Nan Xi, I love you.

453
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,360
Let's be together, okay?

454
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,360
Mom, mom, mom is asking for you.

455
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,360
Sorry, you go in.

456
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,360
Get up, everyone is watching.

457
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,360
If you don't promise me, I won't get up today.

458
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,360
I've promised you before.

459
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,360
No, I need a formal reply.

460
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,360
I'm willing.

461
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,360
Thank you.

462
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,360
Thank you.

463
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,360
So good.

464
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,360
I can't breathe when I see you.

465
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,360
Just a glance into my heart.

466
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,360
Be careful, little by little.

467
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,360
I'm getting closer to you.

468
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,360
Give you all my time.

469
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,360
I can't leave you by my side.

470
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,360
I really like you.

471
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,360
Okay, I'm going home.

472
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,360
You should rest early.

473
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,360
I miss your face.

474
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:54,360
And hair on your shoulder.

475
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:58,360
I confess to you in your ear.

476
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,360
What are you doing?

477
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,360
I'll see you tomorrow.

478
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,360
I've been dreaming for ten years.

479
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,360
Today finally came true.

480
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,360
I want to feel the beauty of the present.

481
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,360
Actually, I don't think I can play the role.

482
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:20,360
I'm afraid I'll hurt you by doing something wrong.

483
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,360
Don't think too much.

484
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,360
Close your eyes.

485
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,360
I love you.

486
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,360
Mr. Xiao, is it really okay for us to do this?

487
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,360
What are you afraid of?

488
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,360
What about Chen Zhe?

489
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,360
I'm talking about Shi Qi.

490
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,360
As long as Gu Nanxi is gone,

491
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,360
Qin Shiqi will definitely come back to you.

492
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,360
Gu Nanxi will be mine in the end.

493
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:03,360
For Qin Shiqi, for Gu Nanxi,

494
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,360
for Kai Ge and Yi Hai,

495
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,360
cheers.

496
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,360
Drink some milk.

497
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,360
Don't stay up so late.

498
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,360
I'll be fine after I finish reading this.

499
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,360
You go to sleep.

500
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,360
Be good.

501
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,360
I'll be back.

502
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,360
Leng Ran.

503
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,360
Yes.

504
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,360
Stop it.

505
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,360
Let's talk tomorrow.

506
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,360
Okay, okay. I'll be right there.

507
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,360
BeerJ three to one, check.

508
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,360
One, two, three.

509
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,360
This one?

510
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,360
What about the rest?

511
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,360
I want to share with you.

512
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,360
Okay.

513
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:28,360
Where's sauce?

514
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,360
Was it if Qin Shiqi broke up with Yi Hai

515
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,360
or not?

516
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,920
The three of us are going to the red carpet together.

517
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,960
The atmosphere is not very good.

518
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,080
Speaking of which,

519
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,640
Yi Han

520
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,120
doesn't have the reputation of a reformer.

521
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,480
So,

522
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,320
my resources are also rising.

523
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,640
Okay.

524
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,600
Hugging you for a while

525
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,520
is too much.

526
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,040
How can it be?

527
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,080
I just want to hug you like this for a lifetime.

528
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,600
I'm afraid

529
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,960
that you will be

530
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,800
released from prison by hugging me like this.

531
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,840
How can she come at will?

532
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,280
Maybe...

533
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,720
No way.

534
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,600
I'll go take a look.

535
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,720
Wait a minute.

536
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,920
I'll go take a look.

537
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,080
It's not my sister.

538
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,240
It's my brother-in-law.

539
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,560
It's okay.

540
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,280
Open the door.

541
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,440
I'll open it.

542
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,320
Shu Qing.

543
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:33,760
Come on.

544
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,240
Let's go inside.

545
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,320
Did I disturb you?

546
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,840
A little.

547
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,120
I thought it was a rain storm.

548
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:42,920
I was so scared.

549
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,480
Shu Qing.

550
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,320
I have to borrow Nanxi.

551
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,280
You don't mind, do you?

552
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,080
No.

553
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:49,680
Then you two talk.

554
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,680
I'll go back first.

555
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,080
Let's talk outside.

556
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,080
Okay.

557
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,080
Then...

558
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,760
Then wait for me at home.

559
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,760
I'll be back in a while.

560
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,360
Okay.

561
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:01,720
Then

562
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:02,880
when you come back,

563
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,760
I'll cook for you.

564
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,360
Don't worry.

565
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,600
I'll wait for you outside.

566
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,160
Go ahead.

567
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,840
Come back early.

568
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,440
Okay.

569
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,920
Seeing you and Shi Qi like this,

570
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,560
I'm really happy for you.

571
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,880
I'm embarrassed.

572
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,520
To be honest, Nanxi.

573
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,760
I was worried about your work condition before.

574
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:31,760
You know,

575
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,240
in the jewelry industry,

576
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,440
if you don't have a crush on someone,

577
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,840
the work designed

578
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,120
must be soulless.

579
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,360
You're right.

580
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,200
I always thought that

581
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,040
as long as there's technology,

582
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,640
design is enough.

583
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,120
Now that I'm with Shi Qi,

584
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,440
I've changed my mind.

585
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,360
But you came to me so early.

586
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,840
Are you here to say that?

587
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:53,880
Of course not.

588
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,720
I'm here to show you something.

589
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,200
This is your latest magazine?

590
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:01,800
Yes.

591
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,840
This is my design.

592
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,480
Turn it back.

593
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,440
Look at this.

594
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,360
This one

595
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,240
doesn't seem to have anything to do with my design.

596
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,360
But the people in that industry can see

597
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,880
that it has a very similar design concept to mine.

598
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,640
Which one is this?

599
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,360
This one.

600
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,120
This one.

601
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:31,920
This one.

602
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,640
This one.

603
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,400
This one.

604
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,160
This one.

605
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:34,960
This one.

606
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,560
Which company is this?

607
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,720
Yi Hai Jewelry.

608
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,440
Coco?

609
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,320
No.

610
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,800
This time, the designer is Chen Zhe.

611
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,160
Chen Zhe?

612
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,320
Nanxin,

613
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,480
our Lisha is just a fashion magazine.

614
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,880
If it's published like this,

615
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,960
there's no problem.

616
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,600
Just like what you said,

617
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,800
the people in the outside world can't see anything.

618
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,560
Then your worry is...

619
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,880
I'm worried that someone will take this matter as a witness.

620
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,200
I don't think so.

621
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,360
My design draft is still in my hands.

622
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,520
And I'm 100% sure

623
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,000
that this is our team's original creation.

624
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,400
Even if someone really does something,

625
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,840
I think I can handle it.

626
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,440
Yu Fan once told me

627
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,160
that An Coco used Chen Zhe.

628
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,280
I didn't think anything at that time.

629
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,080
But now it seems

630
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,320
that things may not be as simple as I thought.

631
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,120
I understand.

632
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,000
But I don't think there's any problem.

633
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,360
Okay.

634
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,760
I hope my worry is unnecessary.

635
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,760
Actually, I came here today

636
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,280
to remind you that

637
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,480
our magazine has started to print.

638
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,600
Now,

639
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,360
we can't catch up with it.

640
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:44,960
I see.

641
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,400
Thank you for your reminder.

642
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,560
You're welcome.

643
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,160
Mr. Qiao,

644
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,200
Lisha magazine has prepared a batch of tea.

645
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,360
The next issue of the magazine will be published next week.

646
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,680
What should we do next?

647
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,920
I think

648
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,640
we should tell Gu Nuanxi

649
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,840
that our two companies design the same thing.

650
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,160
What should we do?

651
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,800
Wait until they relax their guard

652
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,280
and make a mistake.

653
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,360
How can I say

654
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,120
that you can be the CEO?

655
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,680
Or you're a certain person?

656
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,320
Anyway, remember,

657
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,320
no matter when,

658
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,360
you have to make sure

659
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,160
that this design is designed by you.

660
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,360
Don't worry.

661
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,360
I've prepared it.

662
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:28,960
Okay.

663
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,880
I have to find An Coco.

664
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,840
Why do you look for him?

665
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,240
He didn't help us with this.

666
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,560
What does it have to do with him?

667
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,520
What do you know?

668
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,080
It's called being a good son-in-law.

669
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,400
Boy,

670
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,520
there's one thing

671
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,960
that I don't quite understand.

672
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,880
You're

673
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,640
a son-in-law of Kai.

674
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,240
Isn't it good?

675
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,640
What's your purpose?

676
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,480
To do what you want.

677
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,320
I'm sorry.

678
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,120
I'm talking too much.

679
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,040
What did you talk about with Leng Ran today?

680
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,280
Nothing.

681
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,920
It's about the new issue of the magazine.

682
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,080
Did you hide something from me?

683
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,120
We didn't hide anything from you.

684
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,480
What could we hide?

685
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,640
Did you have something between you?

686
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,640
Something?

687
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,440
What's wrong with you?

688
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,720
That's your brother-in-law's vinegar.

689
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,680
You can eat it.

690
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,680
Why would I eat his vinegar?

691
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,280
You're now my person.

692
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,640
I'm not your brother-in-law.

693
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,920
You're now my person.

694
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,600
You belong to me.

695
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,640
I belong to myself.

696
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,760
Fine.

697
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,840
You belong to yourself.

698
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,520
I belong to you.

699
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,880
Who wants you?

700
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,800
Nanxi.

701
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,160
Don't worry.

702
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,680
You have me now.

703
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,160
I'll be by your side at any time.

704
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,360
The sales of this product...

705
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,920
Very good!

706
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,720
Thank you, everyone.

707
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,440
Also, our design director,

708
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,840
Miss Gu Nanxi,

709
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,320
you've done a great job.

710
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,520
Thank you.

711
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,520
Thank you.

712
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,520
Thank you.

713
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,520
Thank you.

714
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,520
Thank you.

715
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,520
Thank you.

716
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,520
Thank you.

717
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,520
Nanxi,

718
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,520
thank you for your hard work.

719
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,520
Keep up the good work.

720
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,360
It's all the team's contribution.

721
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,200
We won't let down the company's expectations.

722
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,200
Please.

723
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Ms. Li Na,

724
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,400
here's your package.

725
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,000
Didn't you see that I was in a meeting?

726
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,520
Ms. Li Na,

727
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,000
you should take a look first.

728
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,520
Okay, then.

729
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,520
That's it.

730
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,520
Let's call it a day.

731
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,020
For your hard work.

732
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,020
Thank you.

733
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,620
The meeting is over.

734
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,620
Let's go.

735
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,480
Is

736
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,680
seeing Mr. Xia

737
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,400
tell us something?

738
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,300
Mr.- Ton.

739
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,760
I'm happy to see don't miss you.

740
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,800
But what should I say.

741
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,800
It's really...

742
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,800
it's really...

743
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,800
I'm not leaving.

744
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,800
Are you willing to be with me?

745
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,940
It's Lunar New Year's Day today.

746
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,440
The first one is Bon meatballs,

747
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,220
Liu Parterring

748
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,780
Lina

749
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,020
What?

750
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,180
You are here

751
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,440
I'm sorry.

752
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,440
I'm sorry.

753
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,440
I'm sorry.

754
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,440
I'm sorry.

755
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,440
I'm sorry.

756
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,440
I'm sorry.

757
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,440
I'm sorry.

758
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,440
I'm sorry.

759
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,440
I'm sorry.

760
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,440
