looked down on me

175
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,880
What's wrong?

176
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,440
Mr. Wang, Prof. Jiang, look at this

177
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,880
This is my experiment report

178
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,200
She marked my report

179
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,600
without my knowledge

180
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,280
Who gave her the authority?

181
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,200
Prof. Jiang

182
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,640
I am your student but not hers

183
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,600
How can she mark my report?

184
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,360
I questioned her

185
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,440
and she told me

186
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,560
even Gu Wei Yi could

187
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,000
accept her guidance modestly

188
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,320
Why can't I?

189
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,480
Why did she compare Gu Wei Yi with me?

190
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,000
I'm smarter than him

191
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,480
I get here by my strength

192
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,720
instead of using the back door like he did

193
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,160
You're wrong

194
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,640
You...

195
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,920
You...

196
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,120
The red color remark

197
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,960
is to keep you reminded
your mistakes in the report

198
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,800
I'm helping you s a senior,
but you refused to accept it

199
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,040
That's why I gave you

200
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,280
an example of a successful
person after my guidance,

201
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,360
Gu Wei Yi

202
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,200
I didn't expect your big response

203
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,360
You...

204
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,200
Prof. Jiang, look at here

205
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,160
How could she...

206
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,520
Look at it

207
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,720
Xie Yu Yin

208
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,080
has marked

209
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,400
the mistakes

210
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,360
as long as

211
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,680
the correct answers at the bottom

212
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,360
Wang, check it out

213
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,760
It's wrong

214
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,840
All wrong

215
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,000
Where?

216
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,360
Impossible! I have
calculated it for a few times

217
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,040
I can't see any wrong too

218
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,320
It's wrong

219
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,720
Yes

220
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,040
It's because your writing

221
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,720
is too horrible

222
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,840
Gu Wei Yi

223
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,680
Prof. Jiang, here is
my experiment report

224
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:52,920
Don't read it

225
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,040
We won't look at his report

226
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,800
Well, I'll check it later

227
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,080
Zhou Lei

228
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,600
I have checked your report

229
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,120
The calculation is wrong

230
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,200
I have written the correct
answer by pencil

231
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,880
If you find it wrong,

232
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,590
erase it and calculate it yourself

233
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,240
We can discuss it later

234
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:11,440
That's all

235
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,040
I'm leaving first

236
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:14,590
Okay

237
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,720
The writing is so nice

238
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,160
Why? Are you going to leave?

239
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,560
How long you'll go back for this time?

240
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,000
About a week

241
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,400
I'll come back after
the completion of the experiment

242
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,440
Why can't you do it at here?

243
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,000
What's the purpose to move in here?

244
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,520
Some equipment is still
at the old campus

245
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,480
I don't really understand
the scientific research

246
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,040
Could you lend me your house key?
My key was left at your house

247
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,960
I'll go back to pack
my belonging and move out

248
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,100
I'll move out today

249
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,760
Please don't tell anyone that
I stayed at your house before

250
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,000
I really had my bad day

251
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,320
After I failed in interviews,

252
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,200
I noticed that the girl I like

253
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,920
still entangles with her ex

254
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,360
He visited her everytime
when she was sick

255
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,400
It has nothing to do with him, right?

256
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,440
Hello, you there?

257
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,440
Her ex never wants to be with her again

258
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,600
but only flirt with her

259
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,440
However, she is happy with it

260
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,760
What is actually in girl's mind?

261
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,440
Si Tu Mo, remember to
bring back the report tomorrow

262
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,000
Okay

263
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,760
Let's go to Ori Advertising
together tomorrow

264
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,040
Okay

265
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:29,160
What's wrong? Don't scare me

266
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,240
Hello

267
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,040
Gu Wei Yi

268
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,640
Why didn't you reply my message?

269
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,160
My phone is in silence

270
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,640
You forgot the key, right?
Let's go back together

271
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,000
Bus or cab?

272
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,280
Anything

273
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,040
Gu Wei Yi

274
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,640
Gu Wei Yi

275
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
What's wrong again?

276
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,000
It is not in proper zipped

277
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,160
Thank you, let's go

278
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,560
Is that your girlfriend?

279
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,440
No

280
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,200
Let's go

281
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,600
Where?

282
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,440
Anywhere

283
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:28,920
Thank you

284
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,640
Not at all

285
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,080
Young man

286
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,320
I saw many kinds of people
when I was driving around

287
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,120
Don't be sad

288
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,200
I guess you are not married yet, right?

289
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,920
I'm not cheating you

290
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,120
I took a female passenger before

291
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,160
She asked me to wait downstairs

292
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,720
as she wanted to beat
her husband and the mistress

293
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,520
Unexpectedly,

294
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,160
her husband has rented a room

295
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,040
to put those plastic dolls

296
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,320
What you called it?

297
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:01,720
Alright

298
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,680
The sex dolls

299
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,800
They have quarreled on the way back

300
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,880
She acted without checking

301
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,720
and made a joke

302
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,440
Master

303
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,360
Please u-turn

304
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,240
Why do you look at me?

305
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,840
Nothing

306
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,440
I... I'm looking at the fridge magnet

307
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,480
So cute, how wasted it's with you

308
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,240
Take it

309
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,720
Don't waste it

310
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,480
Are you in a bad mood?

311
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,080
No

312
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,320
I washed your bed sheet yesterday,
but it's not dry yet

313
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,280
I'll hang it now

314
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,800
You set it back later

315
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,000
Wait until it's dry

316
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,560
I can't do that

317
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,640
I will help you when I'm free, okay?

318
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,240
No way

319
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,400
Hey, you!

320
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,920
If you don't set it on,

321
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,880
I can't sleep on it

322
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,800
Alright

323
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,440
Crazy

324
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,120
I should beat him up, he must be crazy

325
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:49,880
Come on

326
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,600
Take it

327
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,000
Why did you let it go?

328
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,840
I thought you want to beat me

329
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,200
No, I won't do that

330
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,920
Go and get the bed sheet

331
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,720
Try this, see whether can get it or not

332
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,520
Give it to me

333
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,800
Hold it high, can you reach it?

334
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,080
Hold it higher

335
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,560
Pick it up

336
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,480
Pick it up

337
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,920
Why did you jump?

338
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,840
You told me to jump, right?

339
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,320
I told you to pick it up

340
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,840
and swing it out, I'll catch it

341
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,240
Try to pick it up

342
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,560
Why did you jump again?

343
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,920
I'm not tall enough

344
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,120
I'm 1.87m

345
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,360
Is it?

346
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,160
It's true

347
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,000
Alright

348
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,040
Alright, the man of 1.87m,

349
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,200
pick up the bed sheet and swing it down

350
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:41,800
Jump

351
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,120
You almost get it

352
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,440
Jump higher

353
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,880
How come there's no fruits?

354
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,440
This plate looked strange

355
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,360
It's green color

356
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,520
Fu Pei

357
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,600
You got it wrong

358
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,200
I'll bring you some fruits next time

359
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,200
What fruit you like?

360
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,080
Watermelon...

361
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,480
Watermelon is good, you like it?

362
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,400
Watermelon is good for summer

363
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,200
Do I look great?

364
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,760
Trendy

365
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,400
Not bad

366
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,280
This hat is not bad

367
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,440
It's dirty

368
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,840
Take your time,
I'm going out for a while

369
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,240
Sit down

370
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,960
Where do you want to go?

371
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,440
This is your house, right?

372
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,080
Understood

373
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,840
I am disturbing you

374
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,520
I'll be leaving shortly, okay?

375
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,720
It's not like what you think

376
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:06,880
You got it wrong

377
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,680
What?

378
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,000
How could it be?

379
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,440
Are you saying that
you never live together?

380
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,280
Gu Wei Yi, are you okay?

381
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,760
The green color bed sheet

382
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,760
is not suitable for you

383
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,840
It's fit to me

384
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,960
Look

385
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,560
Is it nice?

386
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,800
Together with the hat

387
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,320
Nice?

388
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,200
Green Light Hero

389
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,520
The house is just nice

390
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,360
for you two to live together

391
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,000
Fu Pei

392
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,640
Are you feeling shamed?

393
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,680
You don't have to feel shamed

394
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,000
Don't hide it as you
have been living together

395
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,880
Am I right?

396
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,680
Moreover,

397
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:38,920
look at Mo Mo

398
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,080
She's so good

399
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,320
It is good to settle down now

400
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,840
Mo Mo, you shouldn't do this to me

401
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,880
How can you keep it from me
as we're good friends?

402
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,520
You shouldn't do this to your friend

403
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,840
What is our relationship?

404
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,160
What shall we do between friends?

405
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,160
As your best friend,

406
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,040
I shall tell you that

407
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,560
Si Tu Mo,

408
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,960
Gu Wei Yi really suits you

409
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,280
Wish you good in happiness

410
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,960
Alright,

411
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,680
I won't disturb you anymore

412
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,880
I have a game in this afternoon

413
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,520
I shall leave first

414
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,920
Gu Wei Yi, Mo Mo

415
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,200
I leave first

416
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,000
Si Tu Mo

417
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,840
It's really look strange
that the plate with no fruit

418
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,680
I'll go and buy some

419
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,600
Si Tu Mo

420
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,800
I'm asking you, what fruits you like?

421
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,320
Watermelon

422
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,480
Watermelon

423
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,400
I like watermelon too

424
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,960
I go and wash the bed sheet

425
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,280
Si Tu Mo

426
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,560
It gets dirty again

427
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,480
Let me see

428
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,800
Painful?

429
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,120
Yes

430
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,240
You can cry it out, it's alright

431
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,520
It's painful, but I don't want to cry

432
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,320
I buy you a band-aid

433
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,150
Young man, this is the last station

434
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:34,040
Fu Pei, why are you here?

435
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,320
To clean it up?

436
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,880
I'm so sorry, coach

437
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,040
I'm speechless

438
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,360
Think about it yourself

439
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:20,960
You're back?

440
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,320
Why did you buy the watermelon?

441
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,960
Because the plate was empty

442
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,720
Didn't you tell me to get it?

443
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,080
Thank you

444
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,600
Your hand still painful?

445
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,040
No

446
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,160
You and Fu Pei...

447
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,360
What?

448
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,560
Look like yours is sweeter

449
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,080
I'm hungry

450
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,800
-Is watermelon okay for Gastroenteritis?
-I can

451
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,080
It's up to you

452
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,000
Do you really like to eat watermelon?

453
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,720
Yes

454
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,120
I don't think you like it

455
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,400
How about like this?

456
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,560
I like watermelon

457
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,840
more than like you do

458
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,440
Hello

459
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,440
Have you done the report?

460
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,080
It's done

461
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,840
Bring it to office now

462
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,760
Okay

463
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,600
Which is nicer?

464
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,360
This one

465
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,400
All are nice

466
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,040
My baby is so pretty

467
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,120
You look pretty in any style

468
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,440
This one, okay?

469
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,640
This is too small

470
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,200
The bigger will look nicer

471
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,080
Pink fits you

472
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,160
This one?

473
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,160
Keep it

474
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,240
I will make you
the most beautiful hairstyle

475
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,600
Hello

476
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:40,920
What's up?

477
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,880
Could you give me a rubber band?

478
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:45,840
Sure

479
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,640
This is mine

480
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,800
Honey, you got so many
Give him one, okay?

481
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,520
No

482
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,400
I'm so sorry

483
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,680
She has been spoiled

484
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,760
I'll pay RMB10 for one

485
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,600
RMB20

486
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,560
Deal
