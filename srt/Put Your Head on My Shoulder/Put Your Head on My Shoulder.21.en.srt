00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,460
The stadium is so big

179
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:37,810
Can't I just come and play football?

180
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:39,100
Alright, go ahead

181
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,020
No balls

182
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,740
Kick me then

183
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,300
I dare not

184
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:46,660
What are you afraid of?

185
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,540
Since you dare to let
someone wear the tie for you

186
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,940
I didn't notice it, I'm innocent

187
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:51,900
Really?

188
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,300
You seemed enjoying it

189
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,660
Look! You're caught red-handed
and have nothing to say now

190
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,580
Nonsense

191
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,180
Stop following me

192
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,140
I told you, don't follow me

193
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,660
Be reasonable

194
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,300
Okay, I'm not reasonable

195
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,060
It's all for now,
I'll go back to the dorm

196
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,540
I'll never go back to
your stupid house again

197
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,260
What are you doing?

198
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,980
Put me down

199
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,260
Put me down

200
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,380
What do you want me to do?

201
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,740
No idea, think about it yourself

202
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:33,380
"A little feeling"

203
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,300
"A little strong"

204
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:42,820
"Make the ordinary life different"

205
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,740
"Like surrounded by the warmth"

206
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,420
"The story was shaking the destiny"

207
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,380
"Take up the courage
to make a promise"

208
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,900
What are you doing?

209
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:00,500
What?

210
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,900
Nothing, you're experienced in flirting

211
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,220
Think so

212
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,380
Put me down first

213
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,300
"I want to go further with you"

214
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,300
"It's all I miss"

215
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:17,220
"Shoulder to shoulder
with the touching moment"

216
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,100
"I want to go further with you"

217
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,060
"Despite the changing of world"

218
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:25,020
"Still holding each others hand"

219
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,580
"Let the time of a love song"

220
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,660
"witness our love forever“

221
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,980
I'm so hungry, are you hungry?

222
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:45,940
Hungry

223
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,460
But we don't have the money to eat now

224
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,140
Why don't we join them?

225
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,820
Fu Pei promised to
buy all of us a meal

226
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,020
No

227
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,500
Are you still jealous of Fu Pei?

228
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,140
My senior is going to buy me a meal

229
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,780
Don't hold me, you should
hold your senior instead

230
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,540
Stop laughing

231
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,860
Let's go home, I'll cook you porridge

232
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,180
You can't cook

233
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,300
You teach me

234
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,620
No way

235
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,140
I thought you're excellent

236
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,500
You know everything, don't you?

237
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,060
Where are you going?
Finish the porridge

238
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,940
We have eaten the
same porridge for 3 days

239
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,180
This is the last meal,
no more in the future

240
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:25,580
Finish

241
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,740
Gu Wei Yi

242
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:45,940
What's wrong?

243
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,620
Come and check the hose

244
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,620
No more water

245
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,580
Is it broken?

246
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,260
No water supply

247
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,740
Until when? I didn't see any notice

248
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,140
I forgot to pay the water bill

249
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,820
Prof. Jiang just promised
to pay  me the project fee

250
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,460
I'll pay the bill once I get the money

251
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:12,820
Let me pay first

252
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:13,780
No way

253
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,900
Pay me back when you get the money

254
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:16,780
No way

255
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,500
Are you sure you want to do this?

256
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:21,620
Let's go

257
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,300
Luckily, I made a pot of tea before

258
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,580
I don't want it anymore

259
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:37,820
What are you looking for?

260
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,820
The remote control
of the air conditioner

261
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,460
I feel hot after drinking the hot tea

262
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:46,660
Stop it

263
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,020
Why?

264
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,340
No electricity supply

265
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,700
I didn't pay the electricity bill

266
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:02,900
The house is stuffy

267
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,060
Let's go out for a walk

268
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:07,740
Let's go

269
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,580
Are you going to criticize
the table tennis again?

270
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,060
I was in bad shape last time

271
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,220
I thought it's a problem with
the coefficient of the racket

272
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,420
That's one of the reason too

273
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,660
Are you sure you want to play it?

274
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,180
Don't regret if you lose

275
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,500
You serve

276
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,100
Or you'll miss it if I serve

277
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,060
It's alright

278
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:37,580
Are you sure?

279
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,860
I'm Zhang Yi Ning No. 2

280
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,140
You experienced it before

281
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,500
Hurry

282
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,140
I told you

283
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,500
Don't look at me

284
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,660
I will not let you win

285
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:56,860
I'll serve

286
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:57,580
Come on

287
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:10,420
Come on

288
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:15,740
Come on

289
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,580
You serve

290
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:25,980
I can't believe it

291
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:26,460
Come on

292
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:54,700
I'll quit

293
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:56,820
I won

294
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,060
How did you make it?

295
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,300
In a sudden again, huh?

296
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,500
I told you that I was in
bad shape last time

297
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,180
I happened to catch the arc of the balls

298
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,060
So the continuity of
the ball will be better

299
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:07,860
Its forward momentum...

300
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,860
I know you're awesome

301
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:12,700
I'm hungry

302
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,300
Let's go home and eat

303
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,340
There's no water and
electricity in the house

304
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,420
I'll figure something out

305
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:26,740
I have money

306
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,420
Let's go and have a luxury food

307
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,380
-Alright
-Let's go

308
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,260
So luxurious

309
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,020
We bought the instant noodles in a cup

310
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,500
It's not environmentally friendly

311
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,580
You should think about it

312
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,460
when you don't want to wash the bowl

313
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,700
Let's buy a dishwasher

314
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,370
I'll get my scholarship in a few days

315
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:05,940
No way

316
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,570
Why do you always want to buy robot?

317
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:09,660
Look

318
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:11,780
We've all bought so many noodles,

319
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,940
rice and pickled mustard

320
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,300
Even if the end of
the world breaks out,

321
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,300
we still can live half
a month more than others

322
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:20,500
So I think we're capable

323
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:22,180
to get a dishwasher now

324
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:23,460
No way

325
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,140
I wanted to study the structure

326
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,300
of the dishwasher for a long time

327
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,100
Look at the parameter

328
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,220
High temperature of 70 degrees

329
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,860
Sterilization rate up to 99.99%

330
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,580
We have nothing to lose

331
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,060
Pick either Circle or dishwasher

332
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,820
Good boy

333
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,560
There are 15 minutes
left before the test

334
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,480
Take your time

335
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,240
Are you ready to move?

336
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,760
I'm just free at the end of the project

337
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:32,600
You?

338
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,920
I applied for a delay
in leaving campus

339
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,680
I'll stay in the postgraduate
dorm for temporary

340
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,960
Then I'll send the luggage
directly to the University of North

341
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,560
You're not going home, huh?

342
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,040
Fu Pei doesn't allow it

343
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,640
So you listen to him, huh?

344
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,600
What if you go to the university later?
Will he cry every day?

345
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,120
He wanted to go with me,
but I stopped him

346
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:49,960
Why?

347
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,600
There are preferential policies
under local graduate entrepreneurs

348
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,400
If he wants to start a company,
it's better for him to stay here

349
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,080
He wanted to start a company, huh?

350
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,000
-He has a entrepreneurial mind
-You've been blinded by love

351
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,880
So you'll be in a long-distance love

352
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,880
Yeah

353
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,320
It's terrible

354
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,760
It seems like falling
into the air every day

355
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,000
I'm sure I can't stand it

356
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,520
Gu Wei Yi and you
see each other every day

357
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,400
You don't have to worry about that

358
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,280
Shan Shan, look at this

359
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,800
When I first got this,
I couldn't fall asleep all night

360
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,600
Now we suddenly graduated.

361
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,360
Yeah

362
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,240
When Lulu first arrived, she
couldn't even hang a mosquito net

363
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,600
She even washed the apple with
laundry liquid and you ate the apple

364
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:42,600
Shan Shan

365
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,040
I know we can't be too
sensational at this moment

366
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,040
Or we're going to cry

367
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,040
No

368
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,120
Look! I made the money when
I worked as a tutor for the first time

369
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,760
I hid it to avoid spending

370
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,040
until I forgot it

371
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,720
I'm rich

372
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,480
RMB 800!

373
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,320
So silly!

374
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,520
Oh, my God!

375
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,160
Hello

376
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,720
I'm done with the test and packing

377
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,200
I'm not done yet,
Lu Lu and Niu Niu are not here

378
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,880
I want to have a meal with them first

379
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,120
Take your time then

380
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,720
I'll go to the lab first

381
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,560
Call me when you're okay,
I'll pick you up

382
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,080
Okay

383
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:23,760
Shan Shan

384
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,800
When will Lu Lu and Niu Niu come back?

385
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,680
Lu Lu went for a movie with Ke

386
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,440
Hu Niu went out for
the personnel files

387
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,600
It's so hard for me to
have a meal at the canteen

388
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,720
I have something to do later,
I can't go with you

389
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,080
Make sure you send
the old books to the warden

390
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,200
Okay

391
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,640
Gu Wei Yi

392
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,800
Let's check the answer in the lab

393
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,080
I'll not stay in the lab after this

394
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,480
Are you staying in the lab?

395
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,160
Yeah, it's easier for my revision here

396
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,640
Prof. Jiang knew about it?

397
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,360
He'll surely stop me if he knows it

398
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,560
I used to bring the cat to the lab
and he complained a lot

399
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,920
You even brought a cat to the lab?

400
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,240
Do you know how expensive
the lab instruments are?

401
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,000
Can you afford to pay
if anything happens?

402
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,840
The lab has its rules, I have to
report this to the university

403
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:19,960
Gu Wei Yi

404
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,480
She's going to report to the university
that I was staying in the lab

405
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,760
And you even raise a cat

406
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,760
You'd better be prepared with a review

407
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,080
I used to take care of the cat too

408
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,960
Gu Wei Yi, don't protect him

409
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,400
I know you were forced by him

410
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,200
No

411
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,600
You're biased against me

412
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,040
Why do you always target me?

413
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,720
Why should I? I just
judge the matter as it stands

414
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,040
You're biased against me

415
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,000
It's not that serious

416
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,200
What?

417
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,240
If that's serious, it may affect
your eligibility to go abroad

418
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,160
Senior

419
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,880
Let's leave it to Prof. Jiang

420
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,440
What happened?

421
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,360
What's going on?

422
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,040
Zhou Lei stays in the lab

423
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,720
and even keeps a cat here

424
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,680
Zhou Lei, why are you
messing in the lab again?

425
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:08,800
Prof. Jiang

426
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,040
I just did my revision in the lab

427
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,920
The lab has its rules and
there are many instruments here

428
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,760
It's okay

429
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,000
I know about it

430
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,000
Leave it to me

431
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,560
So what are you going to do with it?

432
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,280
Don't you have to report
it to the university?

433
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,440
Senior

434
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,760
I have a problem in my experiment

435
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,320
-Let's check it out
-What about this...

436
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,640
Help me

437
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,200
Help her to check it out

438
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,520
Zhou Lei

439
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:36,680
Come with me

440
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,760
You're right

441
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,400
I've been emotional lately

442
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,640
I went on a blind date that day

443
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,600
I ran into a parvenu family

444
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,920
They're so cocky

445
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,840
When we're eating,

446
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,400
his girlfriend suddenly came in

447
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,680
and smashed thing

448
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,280
It's really wicked

449
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,160
Really?

450
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:00,960
Yeah

451
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,000
The cocky man said his son
is the hottest man in our campus

452
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,480
I don't know if you know him

453
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,360
Fu Pei from Management school

454
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,440
I don't know him

455
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,520
Yeah

456
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,520
You shouldn't know that kind of guy

457
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,800
He's rude and cocky

458
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,840
We're not on the same level

459
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:20,800
Excuse me

460
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,320
I'm already downstairs

461
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,200
I'm right at the school gate

462
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:36,920
Just a minute

463
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:37,520
Okay

464
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:45,840
Uncle Fu

465
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:49,880
It's you

466
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,880
Why are you here?

467
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,480
I'm not here to see you anyway

468
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,280
Uncle, you don't even know me

469
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,960
Why do you hate me so much?

470
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,520
I don't even need to know you

471
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,920
Fu Pei always finds a flirt
to be his girlfriend

472
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,200
They all like him
all because of my money

473
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,640
If you're going to be with him again,

474
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,120
I'm not giving him any money

475
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,760
You can't get anything from him

476
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:14,880
Uncle

477
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,120
Are you saying this

478
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,640
to insult me

479
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,000
or your son?

480
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,160
I have no time for you

481
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,040
I'm here to see Jian Shi

482
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,240
The rascal brought disgrace
on me in the last dinner

483
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:28,920
Uncle

484
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,480
I knew you stopped
me to be with Fu Pei

485
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,040
because you don't know me yet

486
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,560
But why don't you

487
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,760
even understand Fu Pei?

488
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,760
I don't understand him, huh?

489
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,520
Who knows him then?

490
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:41,880
You?

491
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,960
Do you know he is going
to start his own company?

492
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,920
What?

493
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,400
It will take less than
one month to close

494
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:55,000
He used the money which he saved
from the winning basketball games

495
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,320
Everyone thought

496
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,760
he's playing with his dad's money

497
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,360
But he didn't ask you

498
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,800
for money for so long, did he?

499
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,560
Even if he did, I won't
give him any single cent

500
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,240
He used to do every thing quietly

501
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,280
But I know he still wishes
for your recognition

502
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,240
Should I recognize him
because he runs a company?

503
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,080
I just want to say that

504
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,440
Fu Pei is much more mature
than what you think

505
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,560
I hope two of you sit down

506
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,120
and chat with an open-heart

507
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,840
And not solving the problem
by smashing things like that day

508
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,440
Shan Shan

509
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,640
What are you doing here?

510
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,240
Is this your territory?

511
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:34,840
No

512
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,240
Help yourself then

513
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,320
Wait a minute

514
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,200
I heard you're going to run a company

515
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,600
Why? Are you afraid to compete with me?

516
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,280
Get your business license first

517
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,360
I did it

518
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,400
Sorry

519
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,000
Let's go

520
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,640
-Did he give you a hard time?
-No

521
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,520
He's quite easy going

522
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,120
He's not as scary as you think

523
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,200
Easy going?

524
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,760
Did he give you money
to get you out of me?

525
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,120
1 million?

526
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,600
No

527
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,200
What? Doesn't he have 1 million?

528
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,920
He made parvenu in disgrace

529
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,600
Please help me promote it

530
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,480
You won't use the books anymore

531
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,160
Right?

532
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:22,920
Okay

533
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,040
Thank you, see you

534
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:24,560
Okay, bye

535
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,040
Can I put the books here?

536
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,000
-Put it here and weigh it yourself
-Alright

537
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,360
RMB1 per kg

538
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,840
Count yourself

539
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,520
You're learning accounting right?

540
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,320
The total is 11.5kg

541
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,320
11.5kg

542
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,240
I don't have small change

543
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,480
Keep the change

544
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,240
Help me sort it out

545
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,600
Please pick out
non textbook for donation

546
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,520
Okay

547
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,800
11.5kg

548
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:55,880
Girl

549
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,800
You didn't back to the dorm
for a long time, right?

550
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,280
You found a house outside?

551
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,640
You still remember me, huh?

552
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,240
Of course

553
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,200
You always came back late and
looked unhappy when I scolded you

554
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,000
I was busy with internship back then

555
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,360
I knew, people who came back late

556
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,960
were all sent back by a boy

557
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,400
Only you came back on your own

558
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,160
Apparently, you're a single
who worked overtime

559
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,320
Do you have a boyfriend now?

560
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,640
-What kind of man do you like?
-A scientist

561
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,600
You got the right person

562
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,360
My husband is doing
scientific researches

563
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,800
He has 2 students

564
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,120
They're quite nice

565
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,440
One of them is handsome,

566
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,800
but a little silly

567
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,320
But, at your age...

568
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,760
I have a boyfriend

569
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:42,960
That's good

570
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,720
I just merely mention it

571
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,440
Actually, you shouldn't

572
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,360
get a scientist as your boyfriend

573
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,920
They always read for a whole day

574
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,440
You can't understand
what he's talking about

575
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,800
And they always do weird things

576
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,040
Always suddenly get up from sleeping

577
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,640
to do the calculation

578
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,200
And always bring machines home

579
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,280
Are you feeling better?

580
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,800
I feel better now

581
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:14,880
Si Tu Mo

582
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:15,920
Hey, senior

583
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,560
I'm looking for Gu Wei Yi

584
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,800
He just left the lab

585
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,040
You can give him a call

586
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,640
Okay, thank you

587
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:23,800
See you

588
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,520
See you

589
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,640
Who's she?

590
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,760
She's Gu Wei Yi's girlfriend

591
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:36,920
Is she in our field?

592
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:37,920
No

593
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,320
Some sort like
Accounting or Advertising

594
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,560
Do they have a common topic?

595
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,120
You and Gu Wei Yi are
quite close during in the lab

596
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,160
I thought you two...

597
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,160
I don't know much about them too

598
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,640
Prof. Jiang wanted to see me

599
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,920
I'm going to help him
correct the paper

600
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,520
I'm going to check some
information in the library

601
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,000
-Bye
-Bye

602
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,000
Gu Wei Yi

603
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,320
Your girlfriend just
looked for you in the lab

604
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,000
I just went to the lab,
but you're not there

605
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,960
I guess you're in the library

606
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,560
Wait for me, I'm coming

607
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,840
I have never expected
that you like that kind of girl

608
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,440
Why don't you get a girlfriend
from the physics department?

609
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,160
Not your concern

610
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:03,600
What?

611
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,040
My girlfriend has nothing to do with you

612
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,720
The guy named Fu Pei which
you mentioned is my friend

613
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,800
He is not cocky as you are and
he is more courteous than you

614
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,040
One more thing

615
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,400
Don't bully Zhou Lei anymore

616
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,480
He's been in
rehabilitation center before

617
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,880
You seem in a good mood

618
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,360
I just punished the evil

619
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,760
Scientists are really weird

620
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,520
Today, while I was packing my things,

621
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,440
I found RMB800

622
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,880
Let's spend it

623
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,280
We can't keep the windfall

624
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:33,520
Okay

625
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:42,720
Say it

626
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,720
Do you have a girlfriend?

627
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,200
Yes, I do

628
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,280
Look at this

629
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,160
Alright

630
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:49,840
This one

631
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:50,720
How about this?

632
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,640
I'll change the color of
the sofa to a different mood

633
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:53,680
Okay

634
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,240
Let's pay for the bill

635
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,520
That looks good

636
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,600
I like it

637
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,440
Let's go

638
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,320
So nice

639
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,960
The rabbit is so cute

640
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,040
Look at its face

641
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,680
What's wrong? You look dull

642
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,760
Shopping is more tiring
than doing experiments

643
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,640
You lack of exercises

644
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,720
I'm doing mental exercise every day

645
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,160
You're awesome

646
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,520
These are all made
by the guests themselves.

647
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,480
You can make your own ceramics too

648
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,520
Let's take a mental exercise

649
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,160
Okay

650
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:49,070
Si Tu Mo

651
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,320
Si Tu Mo

652
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:54,960
Si Tu Mo

653
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,200
Is this the result of
your mental exercise?

654
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,880
It's hard to do this

655
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,200
Put it by the bed and enjoy it

656
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,960
Screw harder

657
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:24,800
Harder

658
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,760
Screw harder

659
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,040
Harder

660
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,520
Harder

661
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,120
Harder

662
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,720
"The signal in the eye"

663
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,520
Stick the bottom

664
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,000
-Ready?
-It's done

665
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,440
"Love your tone and your grumble"

666
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:50,000
"Love your smile and your hug"

667
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,480
"You please me like a cat,
I can't help falling into it"

668
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,360
"No one can replace it"

669
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,560
"Hand in hand and"

670
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,320
"walk together with you"

671
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,600
"Feel it the love is getting more and more"

672
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,440
"I'm lucky to meet you,
smile in the dreams"

673
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,200
"I got a heart thump"

674
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,360
"Let the sweet love"

675
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,200
"brew day by day"

676
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,000
Alright

677
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:22,800
Okay

678
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,720
Alright

679
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,480
"A love loaf"

680
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,760
"The sweetness of a couple"

681
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,320
Let's try it

682
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:38,960
Okay

683
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,240
It's done

684
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,960
Finally, we have done it

685
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,360
So tired

686
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,160
Looks like I cleaned it all up

687
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,600
Me too

688
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,960
I helped you too

689
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:33,150
[Here comes the Easter Egg...]

690
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,520
Fu Pei

691
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,320
Why are you back?

692
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:58,640
Looking for you

693
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:00,680
Why?

694
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:05,840
To borrow money

695
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,560
I can't believe my ears

696
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,560
What about your scholarship? Finished?

697
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,600
Si Tu Mo is such a spendthrift

698
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,000
I haven't got it yet

699
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,360
Yes or not?

700
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:20,880
How much do you want?

701
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,560
How much can I borrow from you?

702
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,440
Say it, I'm a son
of rich family, after all

703
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:27,600
RMB5,000

704
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,120
That's too much

705
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,440
RMB500

706
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,320
RMB50

707
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,520
See you

708
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,280
The business tycoons
who start from scratch

709
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,280
always being looked
down at the beginning

710
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,360
I'll not give up
