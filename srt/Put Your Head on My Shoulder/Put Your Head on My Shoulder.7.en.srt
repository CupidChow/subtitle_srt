a caution sticker on the packing

17
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,480
But, not everyone
will take caution on it

18
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,120
They'll think

19
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,800
it won't be broken easily

20
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,320
It's alright

21

It's all okay in the past

Why?

First, it's near to the company
that you went for interview

148

00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,360
I'll be here

175
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,520
You can leave now

176
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,400
I go back first

177
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,280
You didn't come back last night

178
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,240
Did you

179
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,600
overnight at Gu Wei Yi's house?

180
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,880
I have told you

181
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,760
Don't pretend

182
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:50,560
Go on

183
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,720
Mo Mo

184
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,560
How come Niu Niu's eyebrow

185
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,520
can't fit in any of the colors?

186
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,680
Will it be fine if you draw it thicker?

187
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,600
Thicker?

188
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,360
She will then become Crayon Shinchan

189
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,240
Let me try it

190
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,000
No way

191
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:06,640
Niu Niu

192
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,680
-Help me!
-No way

193
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,550
Don't run!

194
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,310
Help!

195
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,120
Thicker will be nicer

196
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:11,840
Believe me

197
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,400
No way

198
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,310
Believe me

199
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,310
Don't move, I'm coming

200
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:14,920
I don't...

201
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:15,790
Niu Niu

202
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,070
Niu Niu

203
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,400
Don't run, Niu Niu

204
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,070
Don't run

205
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,160
Help me! Shan Shan

206
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,200
You're back

207
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,070
Yes

208
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,560
Hello

209
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,120
Hello, are you Si Tu Mo?

210
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,320
Yes, I am

211
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,880
I'm calling from Ori Advertising

212
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,680
I'm pleased to inform you that
you have passed the interview and test

213
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,120
Really?

214
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:12,640
Yes

215
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:13,800
Thank you

216
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,640
Bye

217
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,360
Bye

218
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,160
What's up with you and Shan Shan?

219
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,560
Nothing

220
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,560
Are you sure?

221
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,240
Nothing

222
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,240
Oh yeah, I'm going to move out again

223
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,480
Why?

224
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,920
I was shortlisted by Ori Advertising

225
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,000
Really?

226
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,240
Mo Mo, you're so awesome

227
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,040
What a smart girl!

228
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:58,960
I knew it

229
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,640
Don't you feel troublesome with
a gathering just because of that?

230
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,800
Girls are always meddlesome

231
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,360
Just a small quarrel
They'll be fine in several days

232
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,640
Who touched my things?

233
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,480
Ah Ke

234
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,400
Where are my socks?

235
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,640
He gave all of our socks to
his girlfriend just to hide the boiler

236
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:29,960
Hide the boiler?

237
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,880
That was the story

238
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,280
Such a nice boyfriend

239
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:41,240
His girlfriend has been calling him
to do a club gathering

240
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,680
Are you going?

241
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,040
No

242
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,080
I knew that

243
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,520
Okay

244
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,080
I'll hang up, bye

245
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,760
Can you help me?

246
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,920
My girl has low marks in co-curricular

247
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,560
She wanted to do a club gathering

248
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,800
It's hard to get people to join it

249
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,120
I don't join activities

250
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,040
We're seniors and
have no time for gatherings

251
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,840
The girls who join it are still single

252
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,320
I suddenly have time now

253
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,080
Right?

254
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,160
You must go

255
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,480
No, thanks

256
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,280
Mo Mo

257
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,320
Here

258
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,840
You know each other?

259
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,160
He is my boyfriend

260
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,920
You have a new boyfriend?

261
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,440
How long we didn't share
secrets to each other?

262
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,280
I have broken up with my ex

263
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,600
and I met a new guy through
games after the campus merged

264
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:54,800
What?

265
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,240
Didn't I tell you?

266
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,560
I remember I did

267
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,000
Mo Mo

268
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,080
He's Ah Ke

269
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,240
Si Tu Mo

270
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,880
Hello

271
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,600
For you

272
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:21,760
Thank you

273
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,200
I'm Meng Lu

274
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:27,680
Hello

275
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,040
My girlfriend

276
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:30,880
I knew

277
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,680
How come I don't know anything?

278
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,440
Both of you are...

279
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,680
-Roommates
-Roommates

280
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,880
Felt like I've been fast-forwarded

281
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,360
-Eat the prawn
-Take off the shell please

282
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,400
Try this, it's delicious

283
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,960
Give me an egg

284
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,040
Okay

285
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:52,920
Well

286
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,200
Did Ah Ke tell you

287
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,760
about the gathering?

288
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:57,760
Yeah

289
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,360
What?

290
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,280
How come I knew nothing?

291
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,600
-I'll take you out for fun
-What?

292
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,800
Don't bother so much

293
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,720
Just come with me

294
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,000
But I'll be on internship

295
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,880
It's before your internship

296
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,360
I have to get more co-curricular marks

297
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,440
You must support me

298
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,320
But I...

299
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,480
No but

300
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,640
Don't you want to Take a rest

301
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,040
before the internship?

302
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,720
Furthermore,

303
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,800
we'll go to the beach

304
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,240
Count me in

305
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,480
Will you go?

306
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,400
He won't

307
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:31,800
I'll go

308
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,160
Didn't you say you wouldn't go?

309
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:45,000
-You didn't mention the beach
-But, we used to go to the aquarium...

310
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,920
Yeah, it's aquarium

311
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,760
You like beach too?

312
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:50,720
Yes

313
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,880
Eat more vegetables

314
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,960
I'll send it to you once
I complete the schedule

315
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:03,600
Okay

316
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,640
We'll go dating

317
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,680
You may do whatever you like

318
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,320
-Are you free this afternoon?
-Yes

319
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,360
Help me move my things,
I'll treat you watermelon

320
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,200
Okay

321
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:16,760
Let's go

322
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,480
Tell me once you've done
the calculation, I'll rent the tents

323
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,000
Okay

324
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,240
Okay, no worries

325
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,520
Go and take a bath

326
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,040
You stink

327
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,640
How can it be only 14 people?

328
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,120
Have you included Si Tu Mo?

329
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:44,760
What's wrong?

330
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:46,840
What activity?

331
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:47,520
We...

332
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,160
Count me in

333
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,200
I'm okay, it's not heavy

334
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,960
Help me to hold it then

335
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,560
Give it to me

336
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,280
Take out the key

337
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:18,600
Where is it?

338
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,600
The first slot

339
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,320
Not here

340
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,120
I got it

341
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,080
The chewing gum we bought?

342
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:30,880
Don't...

343
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,800
-Not me...
-I knew

344
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,200
Sorry

345
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:57,680
Sorry

346
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,520
First floor?

347
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,040
I found it in the bag when we bought

348
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,920
the sweeping robot

349
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,680
I must have thought it was a chewing gum

350
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,640
and took it

351
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,040
Shall I

352
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,960
put it in your drawer?

353
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,280
Throw it away

354
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,600
Are you sure?

355
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,120
Then you keep it

356
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,600
Throw it

357
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,400
I'll throw it

358
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,760
Actually, I want to ask you

359
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,760
Why did you keep it in your bag?

360
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,600
Any activity tonight?

361
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
You want to join?

362
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,720
Do you want watermelon?

363
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,000
Come in

364
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:12,800
Anything else?

365
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,560
That...

366
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,480
The rectangle paper

367
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,120
Are you listening to me?

368
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,040
Yeah

369
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,400
Give me the contract my mom sent you

370
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,280
I didn't take it

371
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,520
Where is it?

372
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,000
I can't find it

373
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,440
I don't know

374
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,600
Didn't you take it?

375
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,040
Why should I?

376
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,680
It's true

377
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,640
You won't be so bored as to keep it

378
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,200
to help my mum to threaten me

379
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:43,840
I won't

380
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,200
Alright, I will look for it

381
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,800
A Chance!

382
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,560
Yes!

383
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,240
A Chance!

384
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,840
No! No!

385
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,280
No Chance!

386
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,440
A loan, usurious loan

387
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,040
-Can I?
-No way

388
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,640
You are back

389
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,160
How long will you get here?

390
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,040
I saw you guys

391
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,320
Get into the car

392
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,760
The security won't allow us
to stop for long

393
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:41,640
Get in

394
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,080
I can smell the sea

395
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,360
Help carry the things

396
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,680
Look at Xiao Pang

397
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,440
Okay, shall we go now?

398
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,080
Is this the sea?

399
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,880
More like a river

400
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,560
A river is much cleaner than it

401
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,640
This is not what I expected

402
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,400
Since we're here, we can't just go back

403
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,600
Let's set up the tents

404
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,000
Chop, chop!

405
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
"Happiness is ringing beside the ears"

406
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,520
"So happy to be young"

407
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,040
"Love is the sweet transform by rain"

408
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,640
"Dropping one by one"

409
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,360
"The eyes full with sunshine"

410
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,520
"Warm the memories"

411
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,480
"Can't speak out most of the plots"

412
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,200
"Just keep it warm inside my heart"

413
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:27,360
"Never get tired of missing you"

414
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,320
-What are you doing?
-Taking a selfie

415
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,520
Come join me

416
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:34,440
Alright

417
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,440
What are you doing?

418
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:36,920
What...

419
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:37,760
You guess it

420
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,520
What say you?

421
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,920
Help me, Shan Shan

422
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,560
Be careful

423
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,160
"Speak slowly and don't be nervous"

424
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,160
What's up?

425
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,480
Slow down

426
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,480
"Like the sunny day we just met"

427
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:55,240
"The little time of aroma"

428
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,960
"Growing naturally in noise"

429
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,480
"Looking and greeting you in happiness"

430
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:07,720
"It's worth keeping it forever"

431
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,190
"The little time of aroma"

432
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,960
"Speak slowly and don't be nervous"

433
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:19,320
"The sky is warm"

434
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:22,280
"Like the sunny day we just met"

435
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,840
"The little time of aroma"

436
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:29,520
"Growing naturally in noise"

437
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:33,000
"Looking and greeting you in happiness"

438
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:38,240
"It's worth keeping it forever"

439
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,400
Mo Mo

440
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,440
Anyone inside?

441
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,320
No

442
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,000
Get changed, don't catch a cold

443
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,120
Meng Lu, help me tie my hair

444
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,160
Thank you

445
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,120
Let's have a fair competition

446
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,400
For Fu Pei?

447
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,160
I won't do that

448
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,640
What do you mean?

449
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,600
All of a sudden I feel like

450
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,160
I don't like him anymore

451
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,360
Is it because of me?

452
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,280
-You don't need to...
-I swear

453
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,680
It's not because of you

454
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,320
Let's go

455
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,720
-What are you doing here?
-Are you walking with the kite?

456
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,360
You fly it then

457
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,600
Take it

458
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,560
The wind blows this way

459
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,640
Let it go when I say so

460
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,320
Alright

461
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:35,680
Let it go

462
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,640
It's up

463
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,760
It's up to the sky

464
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,360
Higher

465
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,640
Get higher

466
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,400
Slowly

467
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,160
Get higher

468
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,720
I don't know how

469
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:06,840
It's simple

470
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,600
Pull it when you feel it loosened

471
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,680
It's flying up

472
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,200
Are you okay?

473
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,400
Some people are just like a kite

474
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,480
Keep flying once the string
is held in someone's hands

475
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,680
Never think the person holding
the string might get tired

476
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,360
They don't let it go

477
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,200
because they feel hard to do so

478
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:58,920
It's very simple

479
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:04,960
Gu Wei Yi

480
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,920
It's hard for me to fly it up

481
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,200
I want to kill you

482
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:08,840
Calm down

483
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,080
I'll kill you

484
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,640
My footprints are so deep

485
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:34,840
Mine are deeper

486
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,720
By visual check, mine are deeper

487
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,320
-My visual check is different
-You should follow mine

488
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,840
Look, what is this?

489
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,240
A shell

490
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,480
What shell is it?

491
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,560
A shell

492
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:04,920
This...

493
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:05,960
This...

494
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,120
Is this a gem?

495
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,040
A mosaic tile of the toilet

496
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,240
I heard we can hear
the ocean through a conch

497
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,400
It's true

498
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,880
Listen, it is really the sound of ocean

499
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,560
Have you watched the SpongeBob?

500
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,920
There's a magical conch who
knows all the secrets of the ocean

501
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,320
This one might know

502
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,320
many secrets too

503
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,880
It is really the sound of ocean

504
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,800
That's just the blood flows in your brain

505
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,760
and the sound of air

506
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,960
In the theory of resonance,

507
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,840
when the vibration frequency
of sound equals to

508
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,360
the frequency inside of the conch,

509
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,520
the amplitude and intensity of the sound
will be magnified and form a resonance

510
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,280
So

511
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,200
what you heard was

512
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,880
the sound of air flowing
inside the conch

513
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,320
and your blood flowing

514
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,080
What?

515
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,040
Just like you put
a thermos near your ear

516
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,360
Why should I do that?

517
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,640
Or a glass will do

518
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:16,560
No way

519
