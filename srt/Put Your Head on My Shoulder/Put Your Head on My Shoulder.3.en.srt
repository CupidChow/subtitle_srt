You or me first?

3
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:33,960
You first

4
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,200
Wait for me

5
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,280
Hurry up!

Fu Pei

11
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,040
Pick up the call. It has been
ringing from the morning

12
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,640
Hello

13
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,520
Hello, are you Si Tu Mo?

14
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,280
Yes, I am, who are you?

15
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,480
I'm calling from Pu Hua Accounting Firm

16
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,680
We have received resume

17
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,600
You're suitable and
meet our requirements

18
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,640
Do you want to come over
for more details and let's discuss?

19
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,400
Pu Hua? Now?

20
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,840
Yes

21
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,280
I'll be there soon

22
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,400
Wait for me

23
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,360
Hey

24
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,120
I need your favour

25
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,160
What's up?

26
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,520
Help me look for someone of 208

27
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,440
-I'm from 208, whom you're looking for?
-Si Tu Mo

28
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,960
Are you Fu Pei?

29
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,760
Mo Mo mentioned about me?

30
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,360
Please help me look for her

31
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,800
I couldn't get her by phone

32
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,000
She just awoke

33
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,640
You have been calling from
the morning and it woke us up

34
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,440
So sorry

35
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,600
Wait a moment, she is coming

36
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,440
I have a class now, see you

37
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
-What are you doing here?
-Waiting for you

38
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,040
Why? I'm rushing out for an interview

39
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,920
Yesterday...

40
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,800
Don't mention it

41
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,040
I couldn't remember it

42
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,080
Did I do anything shameful last night?

43
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,600
Yes

44
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,680
You

45
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,960
hugged me tightly

46
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:04,960
After that,

47
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,200
you held my face and wanted to

48
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,120
kiss me

49
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,600
I said no

50
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,200
Behave and be calm

51
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,720
And you touched me

52
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,760
in this way

53
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,640
Here,

54
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:16,760
here

55
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,440
and here

56
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,910
And you hold me

57
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:21,680
Is that Fu Pei?

58
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,240
What's wrong?

59
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,120
Yeah

60
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,520
You kissed me and hugged me

61
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,680
I said no as there're many people around

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,200
You said, it's alright

63
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,120
You enjoyed it very much

64
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,000
Come in

65
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,360
Good day, Prof. Jiang

66
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,520
You're

67
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,320
Gu Wei Yi

68
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,840
Did you complete the paper alone?

69
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,120
Yes

70
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,680
Well, you should join our project team

71
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,360
I think you're quite suitable

72
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,000
This is out of the rules

73
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,120
There's a top scorer
in the last examination

74
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,720
He should join your project team

75
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,240
You didn't sit for the exam.

76
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,280
I have checked your level

77
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,480
If you sit for it,

78
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,240
you may get the highest mark

79
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,880
But I didn't sit for it anyway.

80
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,040
But you didn't sit for it anyway?

81
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,640
Look at this

82
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,320
I have taken the top scorer

83
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,040
to join our project team too

84
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,600
Don't you want to

85
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,440
work and study together

86
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,680
with the top students?

87
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,400
-Are you recruiting for 2 person?
-Not really

88
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,240
I can recruit more candidates
if the experiment needs it

89
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,320
After all, I don't have to pay you guys

90
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,960
Alright?

91
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,400
Think about it

92
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,640
This is the top team of the college

93
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,560
Don't you want to join us?

94
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,120
Look

95
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,160
If someone gossips behind you,

96
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,440
I'll hit him with this

97
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,560
Thank you, Prof. Jiang

98
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,440
Finally, you agreed

99
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,160
Mr. Xu

100
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,800
told me that you're so fussy

101
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,320
and won't join us easily

102
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,640
So, I have prepared
a lot of reason to convince you

103
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,360
It's alright

104
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,280
I want to join in the best team

105
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,840
I'll brief you about
our company's background

106
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,600
Recently, we'll recruit some trainees

107
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,280
We'll pick the elites among them
and keep them in our company

108
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,480
How many trainees

109
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,240
that you have recruited?

110
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,160
10 persons

111
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,560
But you're the only
trainee in my department

112
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,960
If you have no problem,

113
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,040
just do your best

114
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,720
I will try my best to keep you

115
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,200
Alright, thank you

116
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,200
Anyway,

117
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,320
the employment

118
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,240
is a two-ways choice

119
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,080
You may think about it after this

120
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,360
Mom, I'm not going back

121
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,960
Your father has talked to Uncle Li

122
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,160
Uncle Li wants you to work
as an accounting clerk in his factory

123
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,680
I found a trainee job
and I'm not going back

124
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,440
Why don't you back to the hometown?

125
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,800
You don't have to pay for
the rental and food

126
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,200
You can save more money

127
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,960
I found a job in a big company and
many people want to work for them

128
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,640
What company is that?

129
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,680
Pu Hua Accounting Firm

130
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,640
What?

131
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,040
Putonghua?

132
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,800
I have never heard it, is it reliable?

133
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,600
You went to several
interviews before and still jobless

134
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,680
Don't decide recklessly

135
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,680
Come back after the graduation

136
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,040
Even if you found a trainee job,

137
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,800
you don't know if they want to
keep you as a permanent staff

138
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,400
It's hard to make a living in a big city

139
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,720
You have to go out in the
early morning and go back late

140
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,880
You are a girl

141
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,560
Your father and I are worried about you

142
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,160
Mo Mo

143
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,280
Mo Mo

144
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,190
Mo Mo, I'm talking to you

145
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,600
You...

146
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:41,640
Mo Mo

147
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,880
Mo Mo, are you listening?

148
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,600
I'm talking to you

149
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,640
How is the company?

150
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,000
You don't know about it

151
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,400
Mind your words

152
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,840
Let me try

153
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,480
Where is the location?

154
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,920
Far from your college?

155
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,680
It's in Guomao, a bit far from here

156
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,280
I'll look for a room later

157
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,880
My friend has a house

158
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:08,640
I'll...

159
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,600
Mom, let me handle it myself

160
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,840
Since you're so smart,
can't you just give birth to yourself?

161
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,920
Alright

162
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,520
You're really...

163
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,040
Okay, bye

164
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,280
Bye

165
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,080
Attention to everyone

166
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,840
She is our new trainee,

167
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,600
Si Tu Mo

168
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,640
If you need help,

169
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,800
you may look for her

170
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,160
Hello, everybody!

171
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,520
I'm Si Tu Mo

172
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,720
That's your seat

173
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,760
Sit there

174
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,320
I'll get the administration staff
to set up the computer

175
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,440
Thank you

176
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,600
Do your work

177
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,280
Sis Qing

178
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,400
Sis Qing

179
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,400
Record the certificate

180
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,400
Okay

181
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:42,840
Hello

182
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,640
Don't push

183
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,680
Don't push

184
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,640
I never push

185
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,640
Hurry up

186
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,520
-Move inside please
-My bag!

187
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,520
Just move inside

188
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,440
Can't board it

189
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,840
Let's take another bus

190
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,800
Ths bus is full

191
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,200
Hello, mom

192
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,680
Mo Mo, are you back to the dorm?

193
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,240
-Taken your meal?
-No

194
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,880
Why aren't you back at this hour?

195
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,040
Still working?

196
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,000
The bus was too crowded

197
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,320
I'll walk to the next two station

198
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,800
You travel so hard everyday

199
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,800
I have talked to Aunt Xu,
her house is near to your office

200
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,080
No one is staying there

201
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,680
You just need to clean it up

202
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,600
Aunt Xu

203
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,200
left the keys in the mailbox

204
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,360
I'll send the number to you

205
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,800
Okay

206
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,640
Gu Wei Yi

207
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,080
What's your name?

208
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,760
Xie Yu Yin, Graduation Class 2

209
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,960
Senior Xie

210
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,240
You got it wrong here

211
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,200
Here

212
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,760
Thank you

213
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,960
It's okay as long as you correct it

214
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,200
FP

215
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,000
FP

216
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,000
Fart?

217
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,880
It's done

218
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,000
Let's go for lunch

219
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,160
Okay

220
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,720
What are we going to eat?

221
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,920
There's a new nice beef noodle downstairs

222
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,840
Alright

223
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,760
Si Tu...

224
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,080
Mo

225
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,120
I'm Kang Lin

226
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,080
Call me Xiao Lin

227
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,320
Hello, Xiao Lin

228
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,560
Are you having lunch in the office?

229
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,920
That's right

230
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,360
The smell of Liuzhou River
Snails Rice Noodle is too strong

231
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,680
It lasts for the whole noon

232
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,600
You might not smell it

233
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,680
But all of us are going
to be crazy in the chat group

234
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:30,840
I'm so sorry

235
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,600
I don't know that you hate it

236
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,520
Aren't you in the chat group?

237
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,080
You have been here for several days

238
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,720
Let me add you

239
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,960
Be smart

240
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,160
Okay

241
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,400
Scan my ID

242
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,800
Let's eat together

243
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,520
Where's the Liuzhou River
Snails Rice Noodle?

244
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,680
Wait, let me look for it

245
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,640
Xiao Lin

246
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,200
The shop was penalized
due to the hygiene problem

247
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,680
You have a strong stomach

248
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,000
Fortune telling?

249
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,200
Please check my fortune

250
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,160
It's not funny

251
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,640
I heard you joined Prof. Jiang's lab

252
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,120
You made it, didn't you?

253
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,000
You're right

254
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,640
Si Tu Mo

255
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,680
Do you smell something stinking?

256
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,600
No

257
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,520
It comes from your body

258
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,950
I just took
Liuzhou River Snails Rice Noodle

259
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,120
You'd better take bath in the dorm first

260
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,120
I'm no longer staying in the dorm

261
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,440
I have moved out for a week

262
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,040
If I go there, they will
ask me to pay on the bill

263
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,560
I'm quite poor recently

264
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,960
Have you ever rented a house?

265
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:45,960
No

266
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,800
My landlord is really strange

267
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,520
The decoration of the house
is just like a sample house

268
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,880
Cool and lack of sense of humanity,
I feel like sleeping in the mortuary

269
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,040
So, I'll...

270
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,320
I want to read a book.

271
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,840
It looks like a mortuary here

272
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,800
Hello, mom

273
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,160
-Are you staying in Aunt Xu's house?
-Yes

274
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,000
Did you dirty the house?

275
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,320
No it's clean

276
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,840
Alright

277
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,160
Aunt Xu said,

278
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,920
her kid might go back to
the house for several days

279
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,440
When?

280
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,960
Tomorrow

281
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,320
Are you cleaning it up?

282
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,440
Don't dirty the house

283
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,480
No it's clean

284
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,920
Why are you here?

285
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,800
Are you Aunt Xu's...

286
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:27,800
Son

287
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,040
Hi

288
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,360
So,

289
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,600
you said

290
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,280
that my house is a mortuary?

291
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,160
I'll increase the temperature

292
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,480
It's a bit cold

293
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,760
I can explain it.

294
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,000
Explain it then

295
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,200
I wanted to restore it

296
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,760
to original before tomorrow

297
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,560
My mother told me that
you'll be back tomorrow

298
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,640
I had an experiment in the old campus
and couldn't get a cab as it's raining

299
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,360
Will you stay here tonight?

300
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,960
That's why I'm here.

301
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,520
That's right

302
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,880
I don't know Aunt Xu's kid

303
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,600
is a boy

304
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,560
I don't know the child

305
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,640
of my mother's friend is a girl

306
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,720
I'll move out then

307
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,160
I'll back to the dorm now

308
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,120
Can I just

309
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,720
move out tomorrow?

310
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,840
Okay, keep the things

311
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Okay

312
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,880
Throw the Liuzhou River
Snails Rice Noodle first

313
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,200
I haven't finished it

314
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,520
Throw it

315
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,080
Please

316
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,520
Okay

317
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,440
I'll throw it

318
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,240
What are you waiting for?

319
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,280
Put down the bolster

320
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,920
It will be smelly

321
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,080
Alright then, you throw it

322
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,640
Help me throw it

323
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,080
It stinks and I don't want to touch it

324
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,280
I'll throw it later

325
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,480
It's stink

326
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,520
Okay, wait a moment

327
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,560
Why?

328
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,440
Can't you just throw it right now?

329
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,800
Wait a moment

330
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,320
Right now

331
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,320
I don't wear my inner! Understand?

332
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,200
Take your time

333
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,400
Take your time

334
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,720
Why didn't you wear it?

335
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,080
Are you wearing an inner in the house?

336
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,680
Let me clean it

337
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,320
Thank you

338
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,760
Let me help on it

339
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,480
It's done

340
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,760
You or me first?

341
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,240
You first

342
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,320
Wait for me

343
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,640
Hurry up

344
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,200
So tired

345
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,560
Done?

346
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,920
Almost done?

347
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,960
Not yet

348
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,480
I'm done, go ahead

349
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,200
I'll go to bath now

350
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,000
Si Tu Mo

351
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,120
You have only one toothbrush?

352
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,640
That's right

353
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,760
My toothbrush!

354
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,520
Wait a moment

355
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,680
That's what I could find in the house

356
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,920
Thanks

357
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,840
What now?

358
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,520
Can you give me one?

359
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,880
Mom, what's wrong with you?

360
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,240
Why didn't you tell me

361
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,040
that Aunt Xu's kid is a boy?

362
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,360
How?

363
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,200
I heard he's good-looking

364
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,600
Mom

365
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,800
Okay

366
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,560
It's alright

367
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,480
Aunt Xu said, he won't be always there

368
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,960
Moreover,

369
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,000
it's alright for you
two to stay together

370
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,240
You can know him better

371
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,360
I heard he has been holding
the scholarship all the time

372
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,960
and he's handsome

373
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:36,920
I'll have to pray in the
temple if he's into you

374
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,720
Si Tu Mo, are you listening to me?

375
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,840
Yes, I'll move back to the dorm tomorrow

376
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,280
You p!g-headed

377
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,120
You really piss me off!

378
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,360
You piss me off too

379
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,040
Mom

380
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,600
Why didn't you tell me
the kid of your friend is a girl?

381
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,480
What's the problem?
You don't like a girl, do you?

382
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,480
I mean...

383
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,440
You don't like a girl

384
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,200
and even a boy

385
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,880
Moreover,

386
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,200
you're not staying there now

387
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,000
You pissed off by me?

388
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,160
It's okay, I'll go to bed now

389
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:18,760
Okay

390
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,040
What's wrong?

391
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,720
I only sleep on my bed, so I'd like
to exchange the room with you

392
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,160
What's wrong?

393
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,200
I'm stomach-ache

394
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,920
Wait, I'll get the medicine for you

395
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,480
I used to take this during my childhood

396
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,640
Hold it

397
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,680
Si Tu Mo

398
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,000
Si Tu Mo

399
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,920
Hello, this is service of 120

400
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,640
I'm in No.1708, Guan Mei Garden
of Xiu Xin Road, Gu Qian

401
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,760
I need an ambulance

402
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,600
Okay, where did the patient hurt?

403
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,520
Stomach-ache

404
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,320
When will the ambulance arrive?

405
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,280
I have arranged it for you

406
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,920
Is she conscious?

407
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,680
No, when will the ambulance arrive?

408
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,040
Is the breathing smooth?

409
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,040
Has she taken any medicine?

410
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,520
When will the ambulance arrive?

411
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,520
Sir, calm down and answer my question

412
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,200
Has she taken any food
or medicine before?

413
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,840
I killed her with poison!
When will the ambulance arrive?

414
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,080
What happened?

415
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,760
Dirty Rice Noodle caused
an Acute Gastoenteritis

416
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:34,920
Poison?

417
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,120
She took the expired gastric pill

418
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,480
and her boyfriend was very anxious

419
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,000
Let's go

420
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:41,760
Okay

421
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,240
I told you that I can't go back now

422
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,160
My child is sick

423
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,360
That's all

424
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,440
Okay

425
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,760
You look familiar

426
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,400
You checked her leg when
she was injured

427
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,720
The wheelchair

428
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,760
You again, huh?

429
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:13,310
The pain of Acute Gastoenteritis
makes her fainted

430
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,440
She can go home after finish the drip

431
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,120
and observation for one night

432
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,270
Doctor

433
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,440
Why isn't she awake?

434
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,310
Is it Gastoenteritis?

435
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,920
Yes, it is.

436
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:26,790
Don't worry

437
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,350
She's just sleeping

438
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,040
Well

439
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,870
If you love your girlfriend so much,

440
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,520
please take good care of her

441
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,120
Don't give her poison

442
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,480
Doctor

443
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,310
Look at my child

444
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,160
He's painful for a long time

445
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,640
What's his problem?

446
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,640
What happened to him?

447
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:50,640
He's having a stomach-ache
since the morning

448
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:54,560
The check-up shows everything's fine,
but he cried when we got home

449
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:55,830
Let me check it out

450
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,920
It's okay

451
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,160
It's okay

452
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,080
It's painful

453
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,000
Boy, you have an
examination tomorrow, right?

454
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,520
How did you know?

455
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,960
It's okay, you can go home now

456
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:13,520
Doctor

457
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,320
He's crying

458
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,720
How could you say it's fine?

459
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,800
He's acting as he has an exam tomorrow

460
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,440
It's painful

461
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:19,880
Wait a moment

462
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,040
My boy's painful. How could
you say he's pretending?

463
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,240
Are you really a doctor?

464
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,480
Mind your words

465
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,400
I'm a doctor

466
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,400
When I said he's fine, he is fine

467
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,440
So what?

468
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,920
You must check his body

469
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,960
This is a hospital, don't act recklessly

470
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,480
So what?

471
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,520
If you heal my boy, I'll keep quiet

472
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,720
Otherwise,

473
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,440
I'll destroy the hospital

474
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,320
Gu Wei Yi

475
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,880
Happy birthday

476
00:36:59,120 --> 00:36:59,920
Thank you

477
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,320
Why do you look so cool?

478
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,000
Thank you

479
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,640
Happy birthday

480
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,560
Come on, I have a present for you

481
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,280
I didn't allow you to lie
on my bed. Come down

482
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,840
I'm giving myself to you

483
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,040
Come down now

484
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,640
Don't show a fierce look on your face

485
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:20,680
Come on

486
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,240
I have a present for you

487
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,280
Take off the blanket

488
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,760
Be patient

489
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,400
Fu Pei

490
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,880
The basketball is me

491
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,480
I'm a basketball

492
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,440
I'm giving myself to you

493
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,760
Fu Pei

494
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,840
You're so shameful

495
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,360
We paid for the present together

496
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,240
Why did you only put your name?

497
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,680
I'm the one who bought it

498
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,320
I'm not going to play the basketball

499
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,480
You have to work it out
