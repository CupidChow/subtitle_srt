-What are you designing?
-A rabbit's butt

62

A rabbit's butt?

63
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,040
Yeah

64
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,680
It's a logo of the film studio

65
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,360
You made it in a rabbit's butt, huh?

66
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,560
It's so cute. You don't know about it

67
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,800
What's this?

68
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,440

Almost there

78
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,280
Why are you coming here?

79
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,160
I just want to see you

80
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,520
Let's ask Aunt Xu's son
to take dinner together

81
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,080
Why didn't you listen to me?

82
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,240
I told you to inform me
before you come, did I?

83
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,320
Why didn't you tell me?
You didn't respect me

84
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,880
I can't talk now

85
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,080
Don't ask him out

86
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,440
Or I'll get mad

87
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,520
Bye

88
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,080
What a beautiful place!

89
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,560
Have a seat here

90
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,160
It's vacant

91
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,400
Come on

92
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,560
Look at the menu and
see what you want to eat?

93
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,400
Make your order here

94
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,240
So high-tech

95
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,720
I can't do this

96
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,400
It's so simple, I'll teach you

97
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,400
It's okay

98
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,920
As long as your father can do it

99
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,120
Don't be so cheesy

100
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,440
Hi,

101
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,520

102
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,960
Thank you

103
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,080
You're welcome

104
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,120
Let's dig in

105
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,120
How can we finish the food?

106
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,840
I told you to ask Xiao Gu out,
but you refused

107
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,120
No worries, I can finish it

108
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,480
You're really cranky

109
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,800
You've been staying at his house
for so long, I should visit him

110
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,560
and buy him a treat

111
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,400
It's alright, he's busy

112
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,760
Two of you seem so close

113
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,040
Mom

114
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,360
Alright

115
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,560
Don't be stubborn

116
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,560
I have

117
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,800
talked to Aunt Xu

118
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,440
Let's go home
when Xiao Gu reaches home

119
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,480
Whose home?

120
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,000
You and Xiao Gu's home

121
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,240
I told you, I'll move out

122
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,440
Why are you going there?

123
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,880
No way

124
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,320
I won't agree with it

125
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,880
Moreover,

126
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,200
you are transferred

127
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,720
to another company now

128
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,560
Since you're mobile in workplaces,
you shouldn't move

129
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,480
Forget it

130
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,600
You must think about the safety

131
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,120
Aren't you worried
that I stay with a guy?

132
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,640
I...

133
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,920
That's why I'm here to observe him

134
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,040
Dig in

135
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:40,720
Aunt, have some tea

136
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:42,480
It's hot

137
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,680
Thank you

138
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,360
Nice tea!

139
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,040
Xiao Gu

140
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,520
Sorry that Mo Mo gives
you a lot of troubles recently

141
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,960
Thank you for taking care of her

142
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,360
I should have come earlier,

143
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,200
but I had something
to do in the hometown

144
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,280
Thank you for coming

145
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,840
In fact, I did carry you

146
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,440
when you're small

147
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,680
My mom told me before

148
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,960
You peed all over me

149
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,320
Well

150
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,360
Time really flies

151
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,520
Now,

152
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,640
you're a big boy

153
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,000
You got a girlfriend?

154
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,040
No

155
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,720
You must choose a good one

156
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,600
Okay

157
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,400
Your mother said,

158
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,120
you're good at your studies

159
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,480
and holding scholarship since you're small

160
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,040
But don't work too hard

161
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,560
in the studies

162
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,800
Okay

163
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,440
Studies is important

164
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,600
But you can't neglect
your personal things too

165
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,560
You must work hard

166
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,760
to get a girlfriend

167
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,120
Okay

168
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,760
How dare you?

169
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,160
Why are you laughing?

170
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,600
Do you have a boyfriend?
How dare you laugh?

171
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,280
Actually, both of you can...

172
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,680
Cut the crap, mom!

173
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,200
What did I say?

174
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,280
I'm not giving you pressure

175
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,120
I just merely say it

176
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,600
I just merely say it

177
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,480
Okay

178
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,760
What is your height and weight?

179
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,880
1.87m

180
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,040
65,000g

181
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,640
65,000g?

182
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,880
65kg

183
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,040
That's too thin of you

184
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,840
You have to take more food

185
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,240
Alright

186
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,480
I brought some walnuts for
you which I plant myself

187
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,680
in my hometown

188
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,280
This is good

189
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,840
for your brain

190
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,000
Thank you, aunt

191
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,960
Well, let me make you

192
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,200
a dessert of walnut and black sesame

193
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,360
A scientist should eat more nuts

194
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,080
I'll make a yummy dessert for you

195
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,720
Mom, we don't have any sesame

196
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,480
It's late, let's go

197
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,880
Look

198
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,840
I brought some black sesame as well

199
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,960
The making is just simple and fast

200
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,720
Do you want to try my cooking?

201
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,360
I just don't want to disturb you

202
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,160
No, don't say that

203
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,160
Do you think I'm a busy body

204
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,080
and

205
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,360
you don't want to eat the dessert?

206
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,080
No

207
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,400
I'm craving for it

208
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,400
That's good

209
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,160
Well

210
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,160
Why don't you help me

211
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,880
open the walnuts and get the nut from it?

212
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,480
I'll stir the sesame first

213
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,760
What are you doing?

214
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49,500
[Midnight snack]

215
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,640
You girlfriend drinks beer too?

216
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,000
She is not my girlfriend

217
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,080
She'll pass

218
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I do

219
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,960
I want to stop my crush on you

220
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:27,920
You get drunk

221
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,160
Bullshit

222
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,720
What is our relationship?

223
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,520
What should we do between friends?

224
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,520
Hi, one take-away fried
rice noodle with beef

225
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,280
Okay

226
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,400
Just a moment

227
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,200
Okay, thank you

228
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,520
Okay

229
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,200
Give me a baked noodle

230
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:09,840
Okay

231
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,640
Okay

232
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,960
Do you want it?

233
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,000
No, I don't

234
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,840
Just give me one

235
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,120
Okay

236
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,480
Here you are

237
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,840
Thank you

238
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,160
Come on

239
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,520
Okay

240
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,280
Sorry

241
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,520
Are you blind? What's wrong?

242
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,880
-Pay it!
-Sorry

243
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,120
-Pay for the medical
-Sorry

245
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,800
Just forget it

246
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,640
-Sorry
-Forget it

247
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,400
Do you know how much it costs?

248
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,880
Can't afford it? You pay!

249
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,040
You pay

250
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,200
I'm so sorry

251
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,320
Nonsense!

252
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,600
I want you to pay for it!

253
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,080
Pay now

254
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,680
I'll pay for it

255
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:42,880
Can you afford?

256
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,640
Do you know how much it costs?

257
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,360
-Take it
-RMB3,800

258
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,400
Pay the bill as well

259
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,480
You're rich, huh?

260
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,400
Don't show off

261
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,560
Do you know who I am?

262
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,520
Just forget it

263
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,520
Don't fight with the young man

264
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,840
Do you know who I am?

265
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,920
Come with me

266
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,280
Where are you going?

267
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,320
Forget it

268
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,640
You're safe now

269
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,840
Thank you

270
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,240
I'll pay you back

271
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,640
It's alright

272
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,560
Why did you drink alone here?

273
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,960
I failed in CET 4

274
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,440
It makes me down

275
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,720
Really? You almost graduate,
but you didn't pass it?

276
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,120
Yeah

277
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,400
CET 4 is not a big deal

278
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,040
Can it really make you drunk?

279
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,560
Yeah

280
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,400
I'm so sad

281
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,400
Work harder and sit for the exam again

282
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,040
No point sitting sadly here

283
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,920
I have no chance anymore

284
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,200
I'll help you

285
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,600
to thank you for the help just now

286
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,480
Didn't Mo Mo tell you
that I'm a studybug?

287
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,680
Mo Mo

288
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,800
Okay

289
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,200
What are you doing?

290
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,880
Open the walnuts

291
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,800
You can't do it this way

292
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,960
You press too hard. Let me show you

293
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,240
It will be cooked in paste

294
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,440
So, it doesn't matter

295
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,320
Let me see

296
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,920
Look at this

297
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,040
Let's celebrate

298
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,240
and eat this

299
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,280
Alright

300
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,840
So yummy

301
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,800
Remember the strength?

302
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:20,920
Carry on

303
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,920
The size is not suitable,
I'll get one for you

304
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,520
This is better

305
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,800
Mom, what are you doing?

306
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,400
I...

307
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,400
I'm watching you two

308
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,440
We're opening the walnuts

309
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,760
Opening walnuts in that way?

310
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,240
So romantic

311
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,600
What should we do then?

312
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,560
Come on

313
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,000
Look at me

314
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:56,720
Come on

315
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,000
Give it to me

316
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,320
Give me one

317
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,440
I'll take this

318
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,520
When we're small, we used to
open walnuts

319
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,950
in this way. It has its own method

320
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,150
Look at this

321
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,760
There's a gap here

322
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,640
Put the key inside

323
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:15,560
See?

324
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,150
It's done, got it?

325
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,080
No one opens the
walnuts with a door

326
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,560
You will break the door

327
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,190
So we'll leave it to you

328
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:24,720
What now?

329
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,430
Open it

330
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,190
Alright

331
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,480
I will just leave it to you

332
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,160
Keep practicing

333
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,440
Carry on

334
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,920
I have to check the sesame

335
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,360
Why don't you try to open it?

336
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,320
I don't have a key

337
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,240
Here you are

338
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,840
Taste it

339
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,360
Thank you, aunt

340
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,720
Come on

341
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,320
Stop playing. Come on

342
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:09,840
Wait a moment

343
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,920
Why?

344
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,120
Let's dig in together

345
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,000
You're really a good boy

346
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,240

00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,720
You're back

521
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,200
Look at you

522
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,920
Behave yourself

523
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,280
You are a girl

524
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,360
If Xiao Gu sees it,

525
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,120
he won't be into you

526
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,480
Who cares?

527
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,200
Xiao Gu, you're back

528
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:30,960
Aunt

529
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,160
Are you hungry?

530
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,320
No

531
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,200
Chop, chop!

532
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,120
Hurry up!

533
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,280
Put away the clothes

534
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,440
and fold them nicely

535
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,240
You come back

536
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,440
so late, you must be hungry now

537
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,280
I'll cook for you right now

538
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,480
Mo Mo, quickly help me
to clean the vegetables

539
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,240
Actually, Mo Mo is quite hardworking

540
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,000
and good at doing chores

541
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,240
No!

542
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:58,920
Well...

543
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,200
Help me clean the vegetables

544
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,440
-Okay.
-What a lazy girl!

545
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,120
You can't wash it in this way

546
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,680
You're wasting the water

547
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,680
Well

548
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,600
What about you

549
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,760
help me to cut

550
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,080
the carrot in cube?

551
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,360
Go

552
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,840
What is the size of the cube?

553
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,760
About 1cm

554
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,360
It's obvious that you
never do any chores

555
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,800
Mo Mo, come and help us

556
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,280
How many person
you need just for cooking?

557
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,840
Oh, my goodness!

558
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:06,880
What's up?

559
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,720
Are you kidding me?

560
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,600
I want to make it similar

561
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,680
Do you need a microscope?

562
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,480
You know nothing

563
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,560
He is a scientist, he made his point

564
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,760
You must respect to
the national pillar to-be

565
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,640
It's okay, very good

566
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,000
Just carry on

567
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,440
It's good

568
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,560
Just carry on

569
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,080
Are you myopia?

570
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,560
Over 100 degrees

571
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,000
Why didn't you wear glasses?

572
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:17,520
The light will reflect on the glasses and
affect the view when I used the microscope

573
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,760
You seem to like Physics very much

574
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,440
Why did I do it if I don't like it?

575
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,280
Come on

576
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,160
Take a rest and have some fruits

577
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,440
Come on

578
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,160
Come on

579
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,120
-Thanks
-Come on

580
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,760
Here you are

581
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,520
Young people

582
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,120
can't just stay in the house
all the time

583
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,280
What about this?

584
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,000
Come on

585
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,640
Let's go out together

586
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,040
and feel the healthy

587
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,360
and happy living of the elders

588
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,320
Okay?

589
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,600
Where to?

590
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,760
Don't care about it, just come with me

591
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,440
Come on

592
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,440
Stop reading, it will spoil your eyes

593
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,280
Get up

594
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,080
I'm not going

595
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,280
Get up

596
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,240
Hurry up!

597
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,320
Let's go

598
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,680
Reshuffle the tiles

599
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,960
How did she know this place in this area?

600
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,720
The middle-aged women
always have the radar,

601
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,080
it can't be explained

602
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,800
But I can't play this

603
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,360
It's okay, I'll teach you

604
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,280
Arrange the tiles

605
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,200
Do you know how to play it?

606
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,360
I know

607
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,560
It's okay

608
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,440
Take it easy

609
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,280
Pong!

610
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,440

612
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,240
Pong!

613
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,240
Kong!

614
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,480
6 Sticks

615
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,360
Kong

616
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,600
9 Sticks. I won.

617
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,680
East wind, I won.

618

I won

619
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,160
Pay the money

620
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,280
Let me play

621
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,550
Let me play

622
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,640
It's okay

623
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:10,960
I got it

624
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,120
Okay

625
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,680
I won

626
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,070
Here you are

627
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,070
I won

628
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,400
I won

629
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,400

00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,240
Kong and win

631
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:58,560
Pay the money

632
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,480
Pay the money

633
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,800
I quit

634
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,240
What a bad day!

635
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:09,960
I quit

636
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,240
How smart

637
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:12,880
Clever

638
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:13,680
So smart

639
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,120
He is a scientist

640
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,480
You play with your luck

641
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,240
But he played with his brain

642
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,600
You're so smart

643
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,120
Awesome

644
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,040
Excellent

645
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,520
Really smart

646
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,480
You're really something

647
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,360
Take it

648
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,040
You won so much

649
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,600
Be careful

650
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,120
You too

651
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,840
Your purse

652
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,960
Just keep it

653
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,880
You're forgetful
Lower your voice

654
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,480
Did you see my book?

655
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:21,880
No, I did not

656
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,480
Come on

657
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,520
Have some sesame soup

658
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,160
Come on

659
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,040
Hurry up dig in

660
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,960
-Where did you get this?
-Leftover

661
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,680
Don't keep the leftover next time

662
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,760
Don't sit on the floor, it's cold

663
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,520
Get up

664
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,320
Come on

665
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,400
Sit on the sofa

666
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,120
Well

667
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:42,880
Come on

668
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,720
Xiao Gu, get up

669
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,480
Where is

670
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,720
my magazine?

671
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,160
Move aside

672
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,760
I remember

673
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,920
I put it somewhere here

674
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,000
This...

675
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,880
Where did I put the magazine?

676
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,000
That...

677
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,640
Here it is

678
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,440
Mom

679
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:12,960
What's wrong?

680
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,120
Nothing

681
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,960
You should learn to keep calm

682
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,600
Two of you are matched

683
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,960
People might think

684
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,600
that you have been
living together for years

685
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:02,340
[Here comes the Easter egg...]

686
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,760
Wake up!

687
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,880
-Get up!
-No!

688
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,400
You're such a lazy girl

689
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,920
You're going to be late

690
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,800
No! Wake up now!

691
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,040
Mom, give me 10 minutes

692
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,680
You're really...

693
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,720
Xiao Gu

694
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,200
Are you awake?

695
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,000
Is he having a nightmare?

696
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:10,680
He looks peaceful even in a nightmare

697
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,440
Mo Mo should learn from him

698
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,920
He sleeps gracefully

699
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,480
Mo Mo

700
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,480
Aunt

701
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:24,960
I'm awake

702
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,360
Are you awake?

703
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,960
Did I disturb you?

704
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,080
No
