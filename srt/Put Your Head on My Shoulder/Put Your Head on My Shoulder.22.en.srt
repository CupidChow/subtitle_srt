He got mad with me

3
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:33,230
I didn't get mad with her

4
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,110
I just asked her what's
going on for 100 times

5
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:37,790
But she kept quiet

6
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,790
Look at his attitude,
why should I tell him?

7
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,070
If she refused to tell,
what for I show her my tolerance?

8
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:42,710
Let's have a cold war

9
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:44,910
I'll never be afraid

[Episode 22]

11
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,670
Finally, we have done it

12
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,070
So tired

13
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,790
Looks like I cleaned it all up

14
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,350
Me too

15
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,670
I helped you too

16
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,510
I'll take a shower

17
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:44,710
No, I mean,

18
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:48,710
we can have a good rest after a shower

19
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,230
I'll go now

20
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,110
It's time for you to take a bath

21
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,470
Okay

22
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,470
I'm going to hang the bed sheets

23
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,190
Let me help you

24
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:24,470
No need

25
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,230
You've washed the both bed sheets,
where do you want to sleep tonight?

26
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,390
It's okay, I can sleep on my mattress

27
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:32,790
Sleep in my room

28
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:34,950
Why?

29
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:37,830
I don't mean it

30
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,670
I sleep on the mattress
and you sleep in my room

31
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:41,990
No need

32
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,670
It's up to you

33
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,470
Got water in my ears?

34
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:23,750
Are you going to sleep
in the living room?

35
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:28,710
What's wrong?

36
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,350
The cotton bud poked into my ear

37
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,310
Let me see

38
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,310
Is it bleeding?

39
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:36,950
No

40
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:37,790
Hurt?

41
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:45,070
Si Tu Mo's ears are sensitive

42
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,390
What are you doing?

43
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,430
Just test it

44
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,350
What kind of test? Insane

45
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,390
I want to check if your
eardrum is broken

46
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,030
Are you sure?

47
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,510
Sleep in my room

48
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,030
No, I can sleep in the living room.

49
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,070
Go

50
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,830
I told you, no need

51
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,670
Si Tu Mo

52
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,870
I wanted to ask you
a question for so long

53
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:27,670
I heard you have a good temper

54
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,190
But why are you always
having trouble with me?

55
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,310
Alright, I'll sleep in your room

56
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:32,830
Gu Wei Yi

57
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,150
What's wrong with you?

58
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,110
I can't sleep at other place
besides on my bed

59
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,110
Si Tu Mo

60
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:54,910
What's wrong?

61
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,630
I'll sleep outside

62
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,070
I can't sleep here

63
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,310
Sleep

64
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:04,870
I trust you

65
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:09,990
Don't trust me

66
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:12,630
I'll sleep outside

67
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,470
Sleep

68
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,510
Your touched my...

69
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,670
Sorry

70
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:11,950
The light is still on

71
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:13,710
I'm going to turn it off

72
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:14,390
Gu Wei Yi

73
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:20,470
Do you really like me?

74
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,590
Why do you suddenly ask this?

75
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:29,390
I just wanted to make sure

76
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:38,820
I love you

77
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:43,390
Me too

78
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,310
It's okay

79
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,910
You always said,

80
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:39,230
there's a difference
between theory and practice

81
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:42,830
Not to mention

82
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,270
we didn't even learn the theory

83
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,870
Anyway, the teacher felt ashamed

84
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:53,270
to explain it when I was
in the physiology class

85
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:01,430
So, it's normal that you don't know
how to do it for the first time

86
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,190
I can understand it

87
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:07,790
Can you stop talking?

88
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,550
Why are you so quiet?

89
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,670
Didn't you ask me to stop talking?

90
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:31,990
Say something

91
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:34,710
What do you want me to say?

92
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:37,590
I don't know

93
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,350
Let me sing you a song

94
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:43,550
You'd better sleep

95
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:50,910
The ovary size and shape
is similar to an almond

96
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:00,910
Almond?

97
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,270
At the end of the fallopian tube,

98
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,910
close to the pelvic wall

99
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:09,630
The uterus is in the
middle of the pelvic cavity

100
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,910
Inverted pear-shaped

101
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,390
Why do they describe it with food?

102
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,790
The above is attached to
the opening of the fallopian tube

103
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,150
Gu Wei Yi

104
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,350
You get up so early

105
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,310
What are you looking at
in the early morning?

106
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,790
Open class of the Stanford's College

107
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,310
What open class?

108
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,990
Do you think I can understand it?

109
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,710
What are you listening to?

110
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,710
Human sexuality

111
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,830
Why are you studying this
in the early morning?

112
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:36,110
Continue it

113
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:40,470
Where are you going?

114
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:42,710
Go to work

115
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,870
I thought you're off today

116
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,670
Xu Jie Er texted me and asked
me to cancel my leave

117
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,430
She said there's something important

118
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:54,830
Let me send you

119
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:55,630
No need

120
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:58,950
Do your work

121
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,070
Take your time

122
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:19,250
Jie Er

123
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:20,690
Mo Mo

124
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:22,010
Hurry, come with me

125
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:23,890
What's up? Where are we going?

126
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:24,810
Don't ask

127
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,250
-Come with me
-What happened?

128
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:27,530
Don't ask

129
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:28,770
Hurry up

130
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,410
What makes you so mysterious?

131
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,250
Do you know why
I told you to come back?

132
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:37,610
They've announced the short-list of
the advertising designing contest

133
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,490
-Both of us are shortlisted
-Really?

134
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,130
Where can I check it out?

135
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,650
Take it easy, let me finish it first

136
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,050
What's wrong?

137
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,170
It didn't show our name on the artwork

138
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:48,330
Why?

139
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:51,210
Did we forget to put it
or the organizer made it wrong?

140
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:52,450
No

141
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,050
It only shows the company's name

142
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,090
Just change it

143
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,250
Are you stupid?

144
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:01,050
We took part by the name of
the 4th creative department

145
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:02,690
They won't let us change it

146
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:08,370
You meant they did it on purpose?

147
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:12,170
That's why I looked for you
to figure it out together

148
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,610
Let's talk to Miss Sha Sha

149
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:17,330
It shows Miss Sha Sha's name as well

150
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:19,090
What for we talk to her?

151
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:22,450
You meant...

152
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:24,770
I don't know

153
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,290
We have a meeting later

154
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,890
I guess they will talk about this

155
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,130
Let's listen to them first

156
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,050
That's all we can do

157
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:33,850
Let's go

158
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:41,730
Hello

159
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:44,410
The result will be announced tomorrow

160
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:45,570
Did you check the mark?

161
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:46,890
What mark?

162
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:48,890
What's wrong with you?

163
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,210
Didn't you mark the exam
of the Germany exchange?

164
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:52,450
No

165
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:54,490
Let me mark for you

166
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,290
What did you put
for the first question?

167
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,010
I don't remember it

168
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,080
Hello

169
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:14,130
The number you've dialed is engaged

170
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:15,610
Please dial again later

171
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,560
I'll read you the question

172
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:22,320
You do it again

173
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:23,080
First question

174
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,280
During the Compton effect,

175
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:27,610
if the speed of the Compton electron

176
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:29,570
is 60% of the speed of light,

177
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:33,650
how much the energy will be acquired?

178
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:34,690
0.25 times

179
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:36,450
Okay

180
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:39,330
When the microscopic particles
which don't keep zero static mass

181
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:40,690
stand as a high-speed movement,

182
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:44,090
what's the relation between wavelength
and the speed V of the particle?

183
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:47,650
Hello

184
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,970
Let's summarize the recent work

185
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:54,090
The orange juice ads
received a lot of compliments

186
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,090
On this occasion, I want to praise Mo Mo

187
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:00,770
She made a very good impression

188
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,890
on the client on behalf our company

189
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,290
There's one more thing

190
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,770
The artwork of the
4th creative department

191
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,570
was shortlisted to the final round

192
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,610
in the advertising contest

193
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:14,810
Mo Mo and Jie Er has made

194
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,330
a very big contribution

195
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:17,810
So the company decided

196
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:20,330
to transfer them to be
our permanent staff earlier

197
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:21,810
Congratulation!

198
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,850
Alright, let's talk about other work

199
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,130
About the next project

200
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:33,010
Li Na

201
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:34,850
What's your idea about
the next projects?

202
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:37,090
I'm in a meeting,
let's talk after this

203
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:54,770
What should I do now?

204
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:57,250
What are they doing?

205
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:59,410
Turn to permanent staffs, huh?

206
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,050
Maybe they want

207
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:03,690
to block our mouth with it

208
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,290
Why do you come back so early?

209
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:13,170
I'm going to pick you up

210
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:30,130
What's wrong?

211
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:31,570
Tired?

212
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:35,730
Why did you call me?

213
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:40,810
You engaged for so long today.
I couldn't even get you

214
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,050
Zhou Lei

215
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:54,370
What's wrong?

216
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:07,730
What's wrong?

217
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:10,930
The Harvard open class
says hugging is important

218
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:14,490
Harvard open class?

219
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:19,010
The importance of
touching, sleep and love

220
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:24,370
So you hugged me as
you just wanted to...

221
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:27,610
What?

222
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:29,890
Get off me

223
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:36,010
What's wrong?

224
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,050
What makes you angry?

225
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,170
Think about it yourself

226
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:56,170
Because of this?

227
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,210
Gu Wei Yi

228
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:22,250
Can't you think of something else?

229
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:24,050
What else?

230
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,850
Say it directly, I don't understand

231
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:29,330
Don't regret if
I straight to the point

232
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:33,850
Why should I regret it?

233
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,370
You know I'm angry

234
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:48,210
Why are you still trying
to do that with me?

235
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,210
So that's what you think of me?

236
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:56,490
Forget it

237
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:03,850
Go to hell

238
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,010
Really want to do it here?

239
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:21,810
It's free of charge here

240
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:24,610
It seems that I'm poor

241
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:26,210
Cut the crap!

242
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:26,930
Find it

243
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:29,930
Where is it?

244
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:33,610
Got it

245
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:46,370
Shan Shan

246
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:50,610
We always date at somewhere
we could avoid spending recently

247
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,290
Will you feel unhappy?

248
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:53,770
No

249
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:56,170
Let's quickly figure
out the total cost

250
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:00,010
Alright, I'll read it
and you calculate it

251
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:07,130
Software development 20,000

252
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:09,970
Monthly rental 4,800

253
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:12,890
6 months in total 28,800

254
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:41,330
Total 389,300

255
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,730
80,000 more than

256
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,650
our budget

257
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:47,490
it's a big amount

258
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:53,290
It's okay

259
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:56,250
I have a lot of limited-edition jerseys

260
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:59,010
How much you can get from the jerseys?

261
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:04,210
My mom will sell her handbags to help me

262
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:09,050
I don't need to trouble her

263
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:12,530
I can just sell the jerseys,
it's more than enough

264
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:35,690
There's a temple in the building

265
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:44,290
The girl with the white
top is the mastermind

266
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,010
You haven't cleaned it yet

267
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:22,410
The color of your
picture is a bit strange

268
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:24,170
I think so

269
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:26,450
I've asked them to
adjust it for several times

270
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:27,810
It's getting worse

271
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:31,490
Let's ask Mo Mo to sort it out
and we follow her idea

272
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:34,050
Sure

273
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:39,810
Mo Mo is calling me

274
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:48,810
Hello

275
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:52,770
I worked so hard to complete it,
but it didn't show my name

276
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:54,210
And he got mad with me

277
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:55,370
I didn't get mad with her

278
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:58,650
I just asked her what's
going on for 100 times

279
00:25:59,010 --> 00:25:59,650
But she kept quiet

280
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:01,970
Look at his attitude,
why should I tell him?

281
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,090
If she refused to tell,

282
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:04,730
what for I show her my tolerance?

283
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:05,770
I don't care

284
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:07,370
Anyway, I've had enough

285
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:09,130
If he doesn't apologize to me,

286
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,410
I'm not going to talk to him

287
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:11,850
Why should I apologize?

288
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,050
I didn't do wrong

289
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:16,610
The unconditional apologies
when there's a dispute

290
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:18,130
is unreasonable

291
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:19,730
Let's have a cold war

292
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,210
I'll never be afraid

293
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:23,170
I'm not going to apologize anyway

294
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:35,970
Si Tu Mo

295
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:37,890
What's wrong?

296
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:41,410
Why did you just knock on my door?

297
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:44,490
I didn't

298
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:46,210
You did

299
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,650
I didn't knock on your door

300
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,170
I heard it clearly

301
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:00,370
You knocked on my door

302
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:06,970
Don't scare me

303
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:09,530
Maybe I misheard it

304
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:47,050
Why is it suddenly no sound?

305
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:49,490
I don't know

306
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:57,450
Gu Wei Yi

307
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:00,010
Don't scare me

308
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:02,610
Because I'm really going to cry

309
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:09,170
I'm kidding with you

310
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:23,610
I'm so sorry

311
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:27,570
It's my fault

312
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:31,690
Don't be angry

313
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:33,090
Don't touch me

314
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:45,370
You're not crying, are you?

315
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:51,010
Don't cry

316
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,210
I didn't cry

317
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:55,130
Okay

318
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:56,650
Alright then

319
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:07,730
Why don't you bite me?

320
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:16,170
Why are you so silly?

321
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:17,210
You should run away

322
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:23,690
What happened today?

323
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:29,530
I was shortlisted
in a designing competition,

324
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,410
but the company didn't
put my name on the artwork

325
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:38,010
What contest?

326
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:41,170
Golden Pin Advertising
Designing Contest

327
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:45,970
Why are you asking that?

328
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:50,730
I can hack into their website and
put your name on all the artworks

329
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:54,370
Insane

330
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:55,450
It's so simple

331
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:58,010
And I can keep them from knowing

332
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:00,410
No need

333
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:03,210
I'll listen to you then

334
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:16,850
Where's my snails powder?

335
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:18,650
I remember there's another packet

336
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:26,090
Off today?

337
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:28,970
Replacement leave of yesterday

338
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:31,410
I'll go to the lab first

339
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:33,170
Okay, I'll see you at the campus later

340
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:35,210
We'll have dinner
together tonight, right?

341
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:39,250
Did you see my snails powder?

342
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:40,890
I remember there's another packet

343
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,570
Didn't you eat it yesterday?

344
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:46,770
I was so angry and
only ate a few bites

345
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:47,770
I'm craving for it now

346
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:50,570
Gu Wei Yi

347
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,450
Did you actually see my snails powder?

348
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:58,690
Above the second cupboard

349
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:05,490
Nothing

350
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:07,650
I just checked it

351
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,650
It's here

352
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:17,570
Why do you keep it there?

353
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:19,250
I put it up yesterday

354
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:35,130
Why?

355
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:36,730
Because you ignored me yesterday

356
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:38,530
I want you to beg me to get it for you

357
00:31:58,010 --> 00:31:58,890
Gu Wei Yi, you're here

358
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:00,850
The result will be announced today

359
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:02,130
Are you nervous?

360
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:04,170
No

361
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:06,730
I tell you

362
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:09,810
I can feel it that I definitely
did better than you

363
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:11,810
When I checked your answer yesterday,

364
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:12,890
I felt my score

365
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:15,130
is much more than yours

366
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:16,610
The most important thing is

367
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:18,290
Senior Lu

368
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:19,770
is especially nice to me recently

369
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:22,770
Because she knows that
we're going abroad soon

370
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:24,570
We'll need to get along in the future

371
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:26,050
So she wants to build a
good relationship with me

372
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:29,970
Because I told her, you've
been rehabilitation center before

373
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:32,410
Gu Wei Yi

374
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:33,130
How can you...

375
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:34,570
How can you slander me?

376
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:36,490
She didn't

377
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:37,650
bully you again, did she?

378
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:39,690
Think so

379
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:42,930
We're going to be
rooted in the lab soon

380
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:44,250
I can't

381
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:45,570
sleep in the lab again

382
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:47,970
Senior Lu is terrible

383
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:49,490
You're all here

384
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:52,050
Prof. Jiang, you're here

385
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:53,690
You have the result?

386
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:54,810
Are you going to announce it?

387
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:57,930
Take it easy

388
00:32:58,370 --> 00:32:59,610
Sit down first

389
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:01,410
Sit down

390
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:02,530
Okay

391
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,010
Professor, what are you doing?

392
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:14,490
Hurry up announce it

393
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:23,530
Xie Yu Yin is not here yet

394
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:24,450
Wait for her

395
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:26,690
Why?

396
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:28,930
We should make it in formal

397
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:29,810
Right?

398
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:31,050
Okay

399
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:32,890
Senior

400
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:35,210
Prof. Jiang, she's here

401
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:38,930
Professor said,

402
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:41,490
he'll only announce the
result when you're here

403
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:42,770
Announcement?

404
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:45,170
This...

405
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,650
Now that we're all here,

406
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:50,290
I'll announce the result

407
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:52,050
In this examination,

408
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,050
two of you made it

409
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:55,210
very well

410
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:56,810
It's beyond my imagination

411
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:58,210
Especially Zhou Lei

412
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:00,010
You managed to answer
the questions of Physics

413
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:02,650
as good as the student of Physics

414
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:06,370
But,

415
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:10,600
Gu Wei Yi is from

416
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:13,090
this professional, after all

417
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:17,250
So, in terms of scores,

418
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:19,530
he's slightly better

419
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,090
than you

420
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:23,850
Just a little bit

421
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:31,930
How little?

422
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,930
Not much

423
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,010
From the paper,

424
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,250
it's about 10...

425
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:46,010
More than 10 marks?

426
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:48,930
19 marks

427
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:51,370
Impossible

428
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:54,290
Did you mark it wrongly?

429
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:59,050
Zhou Lei

430
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,770
I tell you

431
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:02,770
Gu Wei Yi

432
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:05,210
is a student of this major

433
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:08,490
By judging from the result,
he's far from your efforts

434
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:12,770
He has an unfair
advantage in the competition

435
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:15,050
One day,

436
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:16,850
you must be able to overtake him

437
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:17,730
Don't worry

438
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:22,050
Impossible, I marked
his answer yesterday

439
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:23,450
I definitely did better than him

440
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,770
This is impossible

441
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:29,010
Gu Wei Yi, Xie Yu Yin

442
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:31,090
Come to my office

443
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:38,450
These are

444
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:40,610
the forms for you

445
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:41,810
There's a lot of information

446
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,050
Go back and check it out

447
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:44,370
Oh yeah

448
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:47,530
You have to do a body
checkup and a vaccine first

449
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:48,650
Okay

450
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:49,970
That's all

451
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:51,370
You can go now

452
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:54,450
How?

453
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:55,570
I'm done

454
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:56,330
Oh yeah

455
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:57,290
You two have to

456
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:58,810
take a look at Zhou Lei

457
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:01,850
pay attention to his emotion

458
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:03,210
You can go now

459
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:04,290
Wait a minute

460
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,170
Did you tell your parents?

461
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:08,770
There was a female student before

462
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:11,570
Her parents suddenly
came and looked for her

463
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:13,770
after she went abroad for a month

464
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:15,530
They didn't know their
daughter went abroad

465
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:16,770
I have already told them

466
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:18,850
I didn't tell them

467
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:20,010
You...

468
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:22,450
I won't tell if that's not confirmed

469
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:23,850
Well.

470
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:24,570
Gu Wei Yi

471
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:26,930
Did you think you're not
doing as well as Zhou Lei?

472
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:30,650
There's a 5% chance too

473
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:32,410
Moreover, I always

474
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,730
make my own decisions

475
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:35,570
I'll make the decision and inform them

476
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:37,050
What about your girlfriend?

477
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:38,490
You didn't tell her too?

478
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:41,010
No
