I'll let you listen it again! Listen!

[Episode 18]

6
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,200
Is the car arrived? We're almost there

7
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,840
Gu Wei Yi

8
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,320
Why are you coming without replying me?

9
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,800
My phone's dead

10
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,800
So-called lovely contrast?

11
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,480
What are you looking at?

12
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,480
Let's go

13
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,960
Are you going to pick
me up in the future?

14
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:46,880
Yeah

15
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,680
What if I work overtime?

16
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,720
I'll pick you up

17
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,960
What if it is cold, heavy rain,
flood or typhoon?

18
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,320
I'll pick you up

19
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,880
What's wrong with you?

20
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,960
Is your colleague

21
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,440
very close to you?

22
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,360
Who? Xu Jie Er?

23
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,640
The man who was hit in the eyes

24
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,960
Lin Zhi Cun

25
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,280
It's special effects makeup

26
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,400
He's the artist of the advertising

27
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,320
So?

28
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,520
What?

29
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,400
Are you two very close?

30
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,080
Is this so hard to answer?

31
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,360
Not bad

32
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,400
We used to have lunch together

33
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,760
What did you eat?

34
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,400
Snails Rice Noodle?

35
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,400
I only eat that with you

36
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,320
You're jealous!

37
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,560
You're jealous!

38
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,320
-I want to eat Snails Rice Noodle
-No way, it stinks

39
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,480
It doesn't stink

40
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,280
Here you are

41
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,200
Where do you want to eat?

42
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,560
Here

43
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,680
This is not healthy

44
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,800
That is not healthy either

45
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,000
If my mom gets to know,

46
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,840
she'll definitely kill us

47
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,960
She invites me to visit your hometown

48
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,240
You two always chat?
What did you chat about?

49
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,040
She always asked me about Mah-jong

50
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,280
and I explained the
logical probability to her

51
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,560
as well as the
arrangement combination

52
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,480
Really chat, huh?

53
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,200
Can she understand it?

54
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,440
You want to hear it?

55
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,640
No, thanks

56
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,040
What's wrong?

57
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,080
Didn't you say
Snails Rice Noodle stinks?

58
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,480
I'm used to it

59
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,240
Since you're used to it,

60
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,720
try it out then

61
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,160
It's delicious

62
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,160
It stinks, but tasty

63
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,240
Try it out

64
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,200
Delicious?

65
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,040
Eat more then

66
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,760
What if you

67
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,240
put the instant noodle

68
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,080
into the soup of

69
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,280
Snails Rice Noodle?

70
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,280
Forget it

71
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,040
I'll eat it then

72
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,400
The Snails Rice Noodle is
tastier than the instant noodle

73
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,960
It doesn't stink

74
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,720
Take it

75
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,080
Thanks for washing the bowl

76
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,360
Thanks for cooking for me

77
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,680
You always drink tea at home

78
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,560
Yeah, my father is a tea lover

79
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,440
I used to drink with
him since I was small

80
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,520
My mom told me

81
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,960
you're brought up by your father

82
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,520
My father works for
artifacts restoration

83
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,200
I used to go to his
workshop when I was small

84
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,120
Sometimes, he fixed a bottle

85
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,280
without saying a word
in a whole afternoon

86
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,520
And he didn't let me talk

87
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,800
I always read "Tell Me Why?" there

88
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,720
No wonder your mom complained
that your dad made you an oddity

89
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,480
Do I look like oddity?

90
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,320
Yes,

91
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,560
but pretty good

92
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,400
Did he teach you
how to fix the porcelain?

93
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,920
I can do the simple one

94
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,680
I should have let you fix the broken mug

95
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,560
If you see an antique, can you
guess the price at a glance?

96
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,960
No

97
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,760
But I can see the approximate dynasty

98
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,520
Let's go to the museum and
guess the age of the antiques

99
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,800
-When?
-During the winter holiday

100
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,920
-You have a winter holiday?
-Yeah

101
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,320
I thought I wouldn't have it

102
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,640
- I never...
-Are you going back to hometown?

103
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,320
Yeah, I must go home for the new year

104
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,950
When are you going back?

105
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:39,830
When the holiday starts

106
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,120
My mom has been urging me

107
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,360
Are you going back?

108
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,040
You're going back

109
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,400
Why do I stay here then?

110
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,400
I'll go back to my hometown later

111
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,840
and come back early

112
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,160
How late and how early?

113
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,920
Don't show me this

114
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,680
What did I show you?

115
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,280
I promised you I'd be back there later

116
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,520
But my mom has been pushing me

117
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,200
I'll be back here early

118
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:38,960
Really

119
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,920
How early?

120
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,640
After the new year

121
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,920
Once they burn the firecrackers

122
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,880
and before it's finished, I'll bring
my luggage out of the house

123
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,600
Tell me when you get on the plane

124
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,640
It's almost the time

125
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,800
Hurry up!

126
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,480
I'm leaving

127
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,280
Gu Wei Yi

128
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,360
Gu Wei Yi...

129
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,560
Hey, move on

130
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,160
I'm in the bus now, what about you?

131
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,320
Be careful

132
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,880
I'm taking off soon too

133
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,560
Sir

134
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,000
We're going to take off soon
Please turn off the electronic device

135
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,840
I'm going to off my phone,
tell me when you get there

136
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,720
Alright, have a safe journey

137
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,740
I'm home, what about you?

138
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,820
Are you home yet?

139
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,540
The plane is so slow

140
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,700
Where are you now?
Why didn't you reply me?

141
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,780
Sis, let's dig in

142
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,500
Mom cooked a lot
of your favorite food

143
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,060
Don't we need to wait for sis?

144
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,420
You don't know?

145
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,860
She went on a trip to Thailand

146
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,020
She won't come back for new year

147
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,380
Dad was pissed off

148
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,860
What a carefree life she had!

149
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,340
Oh yeah

150
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,100
Mom said, sis had some cats and dogs

151
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,300
in her house before

152
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,460
Where are they?

153
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,020
I sold it all to my classmates

154
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,540
I thought mom said dad liked it

155
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,020
We secretly sold it

156
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,220
when dad was away to work

157
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,020
Dad wanted to buy it back,
but my classmate refused

158
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,060
Dad even offered a higher price

159
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,980
Then, my classmate double up the price

160
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,220
and dad finally left

161
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:42,980
Where's the money then?

162
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,140
Let's eat

163
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,740
You're really something

164
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,580
I'm home

165
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,700
I'm ready to have dinner
with my parents

166
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,980
Take the drumstick

167
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:12,820
Mom, it's alright

168
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,060
-I can't finish it
-Eat slowly then

169
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,140
You seldom

170
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,380
eat delicious food at outside

171
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,220
No

172
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,220
Come on

173
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,420
You have to eat more
for building up your body

174
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,940
Mom, give it to sis

175
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:28,740
Don't give it to me

176
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,700
I'll give you this too

177
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:31,980
What do I eat then?

178
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,900
You have a fatty liver,
shouldn't eat meat

179
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,300
I'm eating too

180
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,500
Are you happy?

181
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,220
So much, can you finish it?

182
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,860
What do you want to eat for dinner?

183
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,260
Anything

184
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,380
Do you want to go to my workshop?

185
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:30,020
I have collected a porcelain which was
broken to more than 10 pieces

186
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,060
Are you interested in it?

187
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,180
He's just home

188
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,660
He should have some good food

189
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,420
Why do you bring him to your workshop?

190
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,700
I want to go

191
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,780
I can't finish the food

192
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,460
Dad, what are you doing?

193
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,540
I want to eat the meat

194
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,620
No way

195
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,500
Eat the bitter gourd

196
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,220
It's not easy

197
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,260
That's why it's challenging

198
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,100
How?

199
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,340
Do you want to fix it with me?

200
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:26,980
Let's dig in

201
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,380
Mom, you eat first

202
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,060
Dad and I will eat later

203
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,180
Honey

204
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,460
Let's dig in first

205
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,100
Okay

206
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,380
That's right

207
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,020
Eating on time is good for health

208
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:49,780
Xiao Yi

209
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,220
Don't learn from your dad

210
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,780
He care about nothing when he works

211
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,500
You have an hypoglycemia,
do take care of your health

212
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,980
I'm thinking if someone
can take care of you one day

213
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,540
-If...
-That's enough

214
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,180
Just cut it out

215
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,100
Xiao Yi is busy in scientific research

216
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,060
He has no time to think about it

217
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,540
Let's don't be so vulgar

218
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,900
Only think whether he is going
to marry or having a baby or not

219
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,900
We should think

220
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,460
about his ambition,

221
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,380
happiness

222
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,700
and the goal

223
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,500
of his life

224
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:20,700
He is...

225
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,300
All right, stop it

226
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,380
Professor Gu, this is a family dinner

227
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,340
You don't have

228
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,220
to talk about the philosophies

229
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,260
You're depriving me of speaking

230
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,620
Well, continue your talk

231
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,980
Don't eat

232
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:35,940
Dig in

233
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,180
Xiao Yi, dig in

234
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:44,100
Xiao Yi, eat more

235
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,820
There's no way out of there

236
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,340
But every cloud has a silver lining

237
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:12,300
Finally, we managed to restore
the artwork to the original

238
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,820
Congratulation! Mr. Gu

239
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,380
It's finally done

240
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,260
Oh, my goodness

241
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,180
Video call

242
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,580
Si Tu Mo, I can't see you

243
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:09,580
I know

244
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,140
You can see me, but I can't see you

245
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,980
It's not fair

246
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,260
I'm afraid that I'm too pretty

247
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,900
and it will break your screen

248
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,780
What's that look on your face?

249
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,540
You must believe it

250
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,780
I'm wearing a sling sleepwear now

251
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,020
It's very sexy

252
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,020
I'm afraid that you can't hold it

253
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,100
Mo!

254
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,300
-Do you have any cloth to wash?
-No

255
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,860
Look at your pants

256
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,220
You wear it for a week
Don't you want to wash it?

257
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,580
Look at your hair

258
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,940
It is so oily

259
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,940
Even the flies and

260
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,260
the mosquitoes will slip on it

261
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,940
Hurry up go to bath!

262
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,700
What kind of sin
I committed in the past?

263
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,300
How could I have a
lazy daughter like you?

264
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,300
You're such a big girl

265
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,580
I really can't hold it

266
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,460
Xiao Yi

267
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,540
You can't eat too many mantis prawn

268
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,260
How did I educate you
when you're small?

269
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,060
Don't be choosy about food

270
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,900
Moderate and don't eat too much

271
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,700
It's alright, honey

272
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,140
It's new year now,
let him eat whatever he wants

273
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,500
Xiao Yi, eat more

274
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,220
I thought you have
an allergy to mantis prawn

275
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,820
Last time when we had dinner

276
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,740
with Si Tu...

277
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,500
Who's Si Tu?

278
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:51,820
My friend's daughter

279
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,780
She's living with Xiao Yi now

280
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:54,700
What?

281
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,460
Xiao Yi lives with a girl?

282
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,020
How come I don't know?

283
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,500
You are busy with the broken

284
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,340
bottles, tanks and jar every day

285
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,460
Of course you don't know

286
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,300
That's crap!

287
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,940
It's terrible mess!

288
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,620
It will cause suspicious!
You should avoid it!

289
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,940
Alright, don't scold him
during the new year

290
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,340
What's wrong with you?

291
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,740
Do you know

292
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,900
what's flat share?

293
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:18,940
The girl and Xiao Yi

294
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,100
are sharing a house

295
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,580
Moreover,

296
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,180
she's polite and

297
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,780
understanding

298
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,140
She's pretty too

299
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:28,860
I think...

300
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,500
It has nothing to do with him
no matter how good is she

301
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,740
She's not Xiao Yi's girlfriend anyway

302
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,300
-They are not in love
-Yes

303
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,740
You see

304
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,300
No matter how good is she,
it has nothing to do with him

305
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,820
Well...Since the girl is living there...

306
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,060
Wait

307
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:44,620
Son

308
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,940
You said "Yes"

309
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:48,620
I feel like

310
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,540
you and Si Tu already...

311
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,140
We're already in love

312
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,180
Sis

313
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,180
Give me one!

314
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,900
Mom, sis bullies me

315
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,860
Mom, scold her

316
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,380
Watch out

317
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,340
Don't fight

318
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,220
Go over there

319
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:31,860
Hello

320
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:32,380
Hello

321
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,060
We are having firework here

322
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,260
What about you?

323
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,300
Let me see

324
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,220
Can you hear the fireworks?

325
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,900
Listen it!

326
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,100
Hear it?

327
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,180
Yes

328
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,100
Do you have nice fireworks there?

329
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:52,420
Nice

330
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:55,020
I'll let you listen
to the firework again!

331
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,860
"I want to be with you
for the longer journey"

332
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,900
"The sky of glowing starlight"

333
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:07,900
"Melt me into your eyes"

334
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,700
"I want to be with you
for the longer journey"

335
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,700
"It's all I miss"

336
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,500
"Shoulder to shoulder
with the touching moment"

337
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,620
"I want to be with you
for the longer journey"

338
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,580
"Despite the changing of world"

339
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:23,500
"Still holding each others hand"

340
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:28,140
Look, the firework is so beautiful!

341
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,500
It's colorful

342
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:31,620
Yeah

343
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,460
It's wonderful

344
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,780
It would be nice to
enjoy it with Si Tu Mo

345
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,120
[Half a month later...]

346
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,860
No one answers it

347
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,220
Si Tu Mo

348
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,420
Here I am

349
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,220
Why didn't you answer the phone?

350
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,540
I was skateboarding

351
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,980
It's dangerous to answer the phone

352
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,180
I am skateboarding

353
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,140
How did you learn it in a sudden?

354
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,660
It's just a sudden

355
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,460
It's just a sudden?

356
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,620
Yes, do I look awesome?

357
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,740
Well

358
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,220
How do you take my luggage
with skateboarding?

359
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:01,660
It's okay

360
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,700
I'll hold the skateboard

361
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,260
Are you sure?

362
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,580
I think I can

363
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,380
Take it

364
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,140
Let's go

365
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,700
Heavy?

366
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:29,740
Let me take it

367
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,820
-I'll hold the skateboard
-No need

368
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,660
-Give it to me
-I can do it

369
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:35,900
Okay

370
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,780
What a good maintenance!

371
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,140
They have changed the dustbin
after the winter holiday

372
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,380
Let me hold your bag

373
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,020
I'll hold the luggage
and you hold my hand

374
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,460
It's more romantic

375
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:02,780
Gu Wei Yi

376
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,260
I wanted to hold it, but you refused

377
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:06,780
I'll take it

378
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:13,820
Give me

379
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,100
Let's go

380
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,940
Finally, we're home

381
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:43,060
I'll hold the luggage
and you hold my hand

382
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,420
It's more romantic

383
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,660
Forget about it

384
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,700
Where did you learn all this?

385
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,140
I didn't learn it

386
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,020
Gu Wei Yi

387
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,060
What's wrong?

388
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,980
Give me back my luggage

389
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,460
Gu Wei Yi

390
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,460
Give me a hug

391
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,140
Gu Wei Yi

392
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,820
You're romantic

393
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,500
Thank you

394
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,660
Si Tu Mo

395
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,780
I miss you very much

396
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,980
I thought it was Senior Lu

397
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,700
I'm your senior too

398
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,020
But you never respect me

399
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,980
You can't decide whether I can go
to Heidelberg University or not

400
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,260
If I'm not going,

401
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,420
you'll be able to go then

402
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,900
You're not going?

403
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:26,700
Of course I'll go

404
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,420
Gu Wei Yi, you'd better don't go

405
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,860
You're just in love
and have no time for it

406
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,340
Senior Lu

407
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,580
Morning

408
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,620
This is my lab report
for last semester

409
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:43,660
Why did you give it to me?

410
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,780
I didn't join your
experiment in last semester

411
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:46,580
I know

412
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,260
I just want you to see
the quality of my lab report

413
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,180
I've seen it

414
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,100
I've seen all your lab reports

415
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,260
Gu Wei Yi did better than your,
you should refer his report

416
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,700
Prof. Jiang

417
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,900
Did Gu Wei Yi do better than me?

418
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,460
Yu Yin

419
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,300
Look at here

420
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,500
and here

421
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:15,980
See it?

422
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,860
Yes

423
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,020
Right?

424
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,020
It's true

425
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,060
Mo Mo

426
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:29,660
Jie Er

427
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:32,460
Submit 2 proposals to me
before the coming weekend

428
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:33,260
Okay

429
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,900
We need it in CDR format

430
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,700
I used PS

431
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:43,980
Me too

432
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,620
Can you convert the format?

433
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,300
Do I look like that smart?

434
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,620
I'll go home and study it tonight

435
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,140
Teach me when you're done

436
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:58,820
Professor

437
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,740
Why does Zhou Lei act like a child

438
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,420
but no one's ever corrected him?

439
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,540
Don't you think Zhou Lei is funny?

440
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,620
I don't think so

441
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:14,100
In my observation, Gu Wei Yi's level
is much higher than Zhou Lei

442
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,500
It's unnecessary for us
to give them the exam

443
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,860
You don't understand Zhou Lei

444
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,500
The examination is a must

445
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,060
I don't understand

446
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,300
Why do we have to do

447
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,460
the useless thing just
to comfort his emotion?

448
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,020
This is the fairness that
I must give it to them

449
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,780
But you don't know,

450
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,700
the two guys're so
excited about the exam

451
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:38,380
So,

452
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,980
just treat it as their benefit

453
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,660
But there are many questions

454
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,340
of calculation in the paper

455
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,100
It's more beneficial to Zhou Lei

456
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,500
who's from math school

457
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,980
You don't understand Gu Wei Yi either

458
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,100
Thank you

459
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,300
Welcome

460
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,300
Are you going to the lab?

461
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,620
I want to get something

462
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,420
Let me open the door

463
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,380
Thank you

464
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:33,940
Anything else?

465
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:38,020
I'll check if all the
equipment are closed

466
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,180
Is this a hand dynamo?

467
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,660
You made it yourself?

468
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,620
I did it long time ago

469
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,020
There's always been
a blackout at my home

470
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,060
I want to improve it and bring it back

471
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,220
When I went to your house,

472
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,740
you two haven't in love yet

473
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:05,020
Why did you suddenly fall in love?

474
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,620
I wanted to be in love for a long time

475
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,220
What are you doing?

476
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:20,940
What brings you here?

477
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:24,940
Xie Yu Yin

478
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,260
Are you giving tips to Gu Wei Yi?

479
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:31,100
Do you think he needs it?

480
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:32,980
You're right

481
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,380
What are you doing here?

482
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,180
We just chatted about his girlfriend

483
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,580
I'm leaving first

484
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,780
Remember to lock the door

485
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:44,860
Gu Wei Yi

486
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,660
Why did Xie Yu Yin ask
about your girlfriend?

487
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,340
Why does everyone care
so much about your girlfriend?

488
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,900
They don't even care about me

489
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:56,020
The seminar of Heidelberg University
makes me can't eat and sleep well

490
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:56,860
What about you?

491
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:57,980
I'm okay

492
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,260
The man in love is really different

493
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,820
What did you do when you're in love?
Doing math questions?

494
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,580
We did whatever we
should do in a relationship

495
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,220
You've done all of it?

496
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,300
No

497
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,740
Don't be ashamed

498
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:19,940
We're all adults

499
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,820
You are living with Si Tu Mo

500
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,980
You can do everything easily

501
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:25,780
Tell me

502
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,060
I'm leaving

503
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,220
Remember to lock the door

504
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,340
Why would everyone
remind me to lock the door?

505
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,380
Gu Wei Yi, let's dig in

506
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,660
Gu Wei Yi

507
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,180
Gu Wei Yi

508
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,380
Gu Wei Yi

509
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,540
I'm here

510
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,380
There's a blackout

511
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,300
I turned off the switch

512
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,100
This is my hand dynamo

513
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:31,330
We don't have to be afraid
of blackout in the future

514
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:49,060
You made it yourself? How?

515
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,330
The conductor coil

516
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,730
rotates in the magnetic field

517
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:54,540
makes the magnetic flux
kept on changing constantly

518
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:57,460
It forms alternating
current in the wire

519
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,180
The faster the flux changes,

520
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,460
the greater the voltage

521
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,460
The greater voltage produces
greater current as well as the brightness

522
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,100
How bright is that?

523
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:07,820
Don't tell me it's the brightest now

524
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,580
This hand dynamo was just
my preliminary experiment

525
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:17,060
I'm sure it can achieve the brightness
of normal lighting after improvement

526
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,980
It's twinkling and you
have to generate it by hands

527
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,300
And

528
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,460
it can't beat the light of my phone

529
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,220
I'm not saying you're not good

530
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,500
You're really...

531
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,500
I'll improve it

532
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,660
Can we dig in now?

533
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,260
I'll switch it on

534
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,900
Let's dig in

535
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,700
She has been in the room all night

536
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,180
What's she doing?

537
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:06,540
Si Tu Mo

538
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:07,860
What's up?

539
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,580
Do you want to watch TV?

540
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:11,980
I'm doing my work

541
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,980
You can do your work
in the living room too

542
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,380
Asking for help from
the Designing Experts

543
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,180
Any can tell me

544
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,420
how to convert PS into CDR?

545
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:33,340
I can't fill the colors in anyway

546
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:44,580
Same request

547
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:45,500
I don't understand

548
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,780
Try to drag it

549
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,140
into the layer you want

550
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,500
I've tried it out, it isn't useful

551
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,620
I know

552
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:01,980
What's the matter?

553
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,860
Help me!

554
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,140
I don't know why

555
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,500
I can't fill the color

556
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,180
after converting it into CDR

557
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,740
Let me see

558
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,780
How? Can you do it?

559
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,140
Of course

560
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,780
Will it take a long time?

561
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,860
Don't know, I'll try

562
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,740
Sit on my bed and wait

563
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:36,220
Tell me after you convert it

564
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,020
I'll wait in my room

565
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:42,660
What are you afraid of?

566
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,180
I'm not afraid

567
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,780
Why don't you dare to sit here then?

568
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,140
Says who?

569
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,900
Sleep for a while if you're sleepy

570
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,740
I'll tell you when it's done

571
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,980
Will it take a long time?

572
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,580
I'll try my best

573
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,580
Gu Wei Yi

574
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,060
Tell me after you make it

575
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,100
Make sure you call me

576
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,540
Okay

577
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:40,060
Si Tu Mo, wake up

578
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:44,740
I did call you

579
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,240
