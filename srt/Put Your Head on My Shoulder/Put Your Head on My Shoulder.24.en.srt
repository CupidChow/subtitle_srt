She's been annoying
and I can't get rid of her

33

She won't be so brave

if you didn't give her hints

35

So as I, I don't understand

45
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,060
You just said it

46
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,140
What?

47
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,860
My English is poor and
can't remember any words

48

"Come" and "Go"

I now pronounce you
man and wife officially

I've been here once before

106
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,500
The sausage platter is delicious

107
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:50,900
Still angry?

108
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,900
Shouldn't I be angry?

109
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,540
I didn't even wear a wedding gown

The bank offered me a loan

Really?

I didn't even wear the wedding gown

Where's the ring?

Where's my ring?

No breathing, what should I do now?

136
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,340
Oh yeah, CPR

137
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:14,980
You're dead

138
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,060
You're finally dead

139
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,620
CPR requires artificial respiration

140
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,220
You know?

141
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,260
I don't know

That's what I wanted to ask you

How could he have

Si Tu Mo's resignation letter?

149
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,430
I'm working on it too,
I can't reach him now

150
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,230
I'll call you back after this

00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:14,710
Bye

152
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,110
Hello

153
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:24,790
"Reason of resignation:
The leader is too ugly"

00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,660

and put it under her name"

Si Tu Mo

157
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:53,150
Are you okay?

158
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,030
You're going to be a dad, huh?

159
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,030
Shut up!

160
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,510
Why did you throw up all of a sudden?

161
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:08,310
We ate the same food, right?

162
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,350
I don't know

163
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,510
I threw up several times
when you were asleep

164
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,750
Did you eat anything else?

165
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,230
-I took medicine
-What medicine?

166
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:19,550
Contraceptives

167
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:22,950
Where did you get it?

168
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,470
His girlfriend gave it to me

169
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:25,790
Don't mention it

170
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,870
Give me the medicine

171
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,150
It has a strong side effect

172
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,910
And you ate with an empty
stomach, you can't stand it

173
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:14,790
Still want to throw up?

174
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:16,870
I'm better now

175
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,230
That's good

176
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,550
Why did you take the medicine?

177
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,990
The baby might not

178
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,630
be in your plan yet

179
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:40,110
Everything about you is in my plan

180
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,430
I'm leaving

181
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:03,910
Wait a minute

182
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,590
You forgot something

183
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,110
What's that?

184
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:18,630
Hello

185
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,190
Si Tu Mo, you're really something

186
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,790
You're so close

187
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:24,910
with Lin Zhi Cun, huh?

188
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,150
What are you talking about?

189
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,190
Don't you surf the Internet?

190
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,950
Lin Zhi Cun stands up for you
regarding the artwork

191
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:33,230
What?

192
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,230
I'm not sure from where
he got your resignation letter

193
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,350
He posted it in his blog

194
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:41,030
and it's a hot topic now

195
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:43,230
Miss Sha Sha was soon found out

196
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:44,630
Now the company says

197
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,270
they'll look into her problem

198
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,070
I just saw an interview on the TV

199
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,830
A reporter asked her about it

200
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,150
Guess what she said

201
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,230
What did she say?

202
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:55,830
Si Tu Mo

203
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:58,350
Congratulation!
Finally, the justice served

204
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,950
What are you talking about?

205
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:03,070
You're so lucky

206
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,350
Even my idol stands up for you

207
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,550
I didn't expect you two

208
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:08,910
have a relationship

209
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:10,870
I envy you

210
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:11,790
You forgot me

211
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:26,950
Let's go home

212
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,550
Welcome home

213
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,590
Welcome home

214
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:33,070
What is going on?

215
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:35,590
I just studied it on the plane

216
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,430
How did you make it?

217
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,470
As long as I'm on a same
local area network with it,

218
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,950
I can control it with my phone

219
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,270
I called its current state

220
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,190
as pet mode

221
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,710
Have you studied other modes too?

222
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,910
Want me to try it all for you?

223
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:50,630
Okay

224
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,590
I've set up an escape mode as well

225
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,230
If there is a fire, it will
automatically run to the balcony

226
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,710
and jump down into the bushes

227
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,310
I've set the parabola

228
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,070
Did you ever think

229
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,630
how many pieces it will break into?

230
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:05,910
Don't worry

231
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,590
We're on the 17 floor

232
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,750
The height of each floor is about 3.5m

233
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,430
Altogether

234
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,070
is about 59.5m

235
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,390
So, even if it jumps down...

236
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:16,110
Gu Wei Yi

237
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:17,910
Welcome home

238
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,390
Welcome home

239
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,310
Welcome home

240
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:23,350
Welcome home

241
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:36,270
I cleaned it up and
found something's wrong

242
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:37,550
What's wrong?

243
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,390
I think we should

244
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:41,670
live in the same room

245
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,750
What about the empty room?

246
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,310
I'll change it to a lab

247
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:10,510
I'll divorce

248
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,310
I'll tell your mom then

249
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,230
My mom didn't even know
I was getting married

250
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,110
I haven't told my parents

251
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,590
about our marriage

252
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,470
I didn't tell my parents either

253
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,710
Let's call them later

254
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:26,140
Okay

255
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:29,990
No way

256
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:33,870
If my mom knew that we're
married in a church in Germany

257
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:34,630
without her knowledge...

258
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:36,790
Oh, no!

259
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,790
We haven't got the
marriage certificate yet

260
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:41,390
So, in a legal sense,

261
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:42,630
we're not married

262
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:44,550
That's good

263
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:45,710
I'm safe

264
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,790
I've booked online
for the marriage registration

265
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:49,830
When?

266
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:51,110
On the plan

267
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,750
Why did you do
so much things on a plane?

268
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:56,430
You want to go?

269
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,110
Sure

270
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,830
Come on, please sit down and smile

271
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,430
Cheers, the photoNwill be used for a life time

272
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:19,750
Ready

273
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:22,310
1, 2, 3

274
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:26,110
Why did they give us
2 copies of the certificate?

275
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:27,390
To avoid of losing it?

276
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,310
Since there are 2 copies,

277
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,910
it doesn't matter if you lose one

278
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:35,390
Let me keep it

279
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:36,750
Why?

280
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,230
One of the certificates is mine

281
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,750
Give it to me

282
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,070
Give me back

283
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:45,870
Give me back

284
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,750
Cut it out! Your mom is calling

285
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,070
My mom

286
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,670
always calls you

287
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,510
and she seldom calls me

288
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:02,270
Hello, aunt

289
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,950
Xiao Gu, have you two
got your certificate?

290
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:05,830
Yes

291
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,390
Don't call me aunt again

292
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:18,630
Mom

293
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:23,270
Wishing you a happy marriage

294
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,230
I planned to have a meal together

295
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,950
for celebration after you got the certificate

296
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:29,950
But Mo Mo's sister

297
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,270
suddenly wants to study abroad

298
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:51,390
They...

299
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,390
Dad, please drink the tea

300
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:57,590
Okay

301
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,230
It's okay

302
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,270
It's okay

303
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:03,550
So good

304
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:04,830
Thank you

305
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,390
Mom, please drink the tea

306
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,430
So sweet

307
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:22,670
So sweet

308
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,030
You're so sweet

309
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:33,190
Mo Mo

310
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:36,030
I just talked to Xiao Yi
about the banquet

311
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,350
He still rejected it

312
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,950
Can I just tell him that
my family insisted to do so?

313
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:40,550
Okay?

314
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,510
Forget it, it's okay

315
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,230
Since he didn't want it,

316
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,870
I just feel hard to force him

317
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,910
In fact, we're here to see you two

318
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,430
Aunt, you may...

319
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:54,510
Mom

320
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,790
You and dad can stay here longer

321
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,430
No way

322
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,550
You are just married

323
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:02,950
If we stay here longer,

324
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,710
Xiao Yi will get mad with us

325
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:05,830
No, he won't

326
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:34,310
Xiao Yi, come on

327
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:43,550
What's up?

328
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:47,030
Look, it's amazing

329
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,270
The sunset is nice,

330
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,270
but it just near dusk

331
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,710
It's going to rise again tomorrow

332
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:56,830
Just the Earth's rotation

333
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:03,870
Xiao Yi

334
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,230
It's not scary to get married

335
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:10,190
But marriage is not that easy

336
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,190
I know

337
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,470
Are you sure?

338
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:26,710
Marriage is not like doing a scientific
research which always with traces

339
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:33,390
Just like what you said just now,
the Earth's rotation

340
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,950
If you say it to your mom,

341
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,670
she's going to be
nagging for a long time

342
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,390
But, Si Tu Mo won't

343
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:51,470
My son, I wish you

344
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:56,270
have a very good time in your marriage

345
00:22:59,350 --> 00:22:59,910
Thank you

346
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,350
Why? You've never seen
anyone looking for a job?

347
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:22,150
Can't get a job?

348
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:27,670
Look at here

349
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:31,350
This company doesn't recruit
married women with no child

350
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,270
And this one

351
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:34,910
Must drink 500ml of liquor

352
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:36,910
And this one

353
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:39,390
Must recognize 300 stars

354
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,390
This is more outrageous

355
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:45,030
Must have a story in your eyes

356
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:52,350
Let me see

357
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,550
There's a story in your eye

358
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,070
No gloating please

359
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,630
I want to hit the person who doesn't

360
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:01,950
have to look for
a job like what you do

361
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,190
You really hit me, huh?

362
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,510
Because you're gloating

363
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,190
Don't look for a job first

364
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:16,270
Take a break first and think about it

365
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:18,670
Are you going to
raise me if I'm jobless?

366
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:20,190
Sure

367
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:29,390
Do you have enough money
in your bank account to raise me?

368
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,630
My grandma sent it to me when
she knew that we got married

369
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,550
How can we spend Grandma's money?

370
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:36,950
Actually, I gave all my scholarship
to her since I was small

371
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,310
Unexpectedly, she saved it

372
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:40,390
That means, it's not much

373
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,070
RMB240,000

374
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,790
You're so generous

375
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:57,470
I was really terrified

376
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:59,110
Forget it

377
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,950
No way, you can't keep the money

378
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:05,310
Or some weird machines
will appear in our house tomorrow

379
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:08,110
I'll keep it for you, I won't spend it

380
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:26,830
Don't you want to sleep?

381
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:28,110
Wait a minute

382
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,590
I'll sleep when
I'm done with this test

383
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:31,150
What test?

384
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,830
The most reliable company is the one
asking people to recognize 300 stars

385
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,550
So I found their test

386
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,190
and tried to do it

387
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:46,670
Gu Wei Yi

388
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:50,110
You know the Four Flow Men after 1985?

389
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:52,110
Flow?

390
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:54,710
I knew

391
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:57,110
You know Flow, huh?

392
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:00,150
The "flow" in Physics means
the flow through a closed pipe

393
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,550
or the amount of fluid
in the effective cross section

394
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,790
of the open channel in a unit of time

395
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,470
It's also known as instantaneous flow

396
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:11,630
Isn't that flow?

397
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:14,270
Forget it, I think too much

398
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:15,910
You wouldn't know it

399
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:18,430
You probably don't even
know who are the Four Kings

400
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,070
What is that?

401
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:23,110
Oh, my goodness

402
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:25,110
You really don't know, huh?

403
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,550
Isn't that common sense?

404
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:27,950
Even my dad knows that

405
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:30,390
Do I need to know it

406
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:32,470
Do you know the
Four Physical Mechanics?

407
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:37,030
The Four Kings of Hong Kong

408
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:39,350
Andy Law, Jacky Cheung,
Leon Lai and Aaron Kwok

409
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,430
Four Physical Mechanics

410
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:44,870
Theoretical, statistical,
quantum and electrodynamics

411
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:52,430
You're awesome! You're knowledgeable

412
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,390
Awesome

413
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:54,110
I'll sleep first

414
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:08,910
Take off your glasses first

415
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:19,590
Come down

416
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:22,790
No, I'm going to
sleep like this tonight

417
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:25,190
You'll regret it then

418
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:26,750
Why should I?

419
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,390
Your parents are in the next room

420
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,230
What can you do to me?

421
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:49,630
Here it comes

422
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:51,870
I'll go to the lab first

423
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:01,390
Alright

424
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:04,270
Wait a minute

425
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:09,870
Mom cooked the herbal tea

426
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,310
Drink it first, it will
make your body cold

427
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:28,750
Bitter?

428
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:30,110
What say you?

429
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,030
Come back early

430
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,150
Mom, I'll clean it up

431
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,270
Come back early

432
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:09,350
Prof. Jiang and seniors will
arrive at 8 pm tonight, right?

433
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,210
8 pm tonight

434
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:15,310
So, the four swordsmen
of the lab finally reunite

435
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,750
Why must be four swordsmen?

436
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,070
What's the special meaning

437
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:23,550
of four?

438
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,990
Yeah, why they always use four?

439
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,030
Four Masterpieces

440
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:28,590
Four beautiful women and four kings

441
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,910
You know who're the Four Kings?

442
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,830
I know, don't you know it?

443
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,550
Have you finished reading
the German experiment report?

444
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,910
I sorted it out for you
before I came back

445
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,710
I'm done, wait for me

446
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:50,670
Hello, Shan Shan

447
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,230
Mo Mo

448
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,750
Where do you think I am?

449
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:54,790
Where are you?

450
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:56,830
I'm at Fu Pei's company

451
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:00,070
Why are you back? Break?

452
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:02,310
I'm here to spend the
anniversary with Fu Pei

453
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,470
Anniversary?

454
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,190
I thought Fu Pei is going to...

455
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:08,310
Si Tu Mo, shut up!

456
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,270
When are you going
to buy us a meal?

457
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:12,270
Why should I?

458
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:13,590
You two get married

459
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:14,830
You should invite us to the banquet

460
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:15,910
You should ask Gu Wei Yi

461
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:16,990
I'm jobless

462
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,110
and it has nothing to do with me

463
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,270
You haven't got a job yet, huh?

464
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:21,510
Do you want a part-time job?

465
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,350
Please design posters for me

466
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:24,710
How much you're going to pay me?

467
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,670
We're old friends

468
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:28,670
Don't hurt our relationship with money

469
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:29,310
I'm going to an interview

470
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:31,030
You should call Gu Wei Yi,
don't bother me

471
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:44,070
Why is it so dark?

472
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,110
Dad! Mom!

473
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:50,950
Fell asleep?

474
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:53,510
I don't think so

475
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:58,190
Dad! Mom! We're back

476
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,630
They aren't here

477
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:03,750
They already went home

478
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:05,750
Impossible

479
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:08,550
They will tell us before that

480
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,390
Are they taking a walk?

481
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,430
They will tell us before that

482
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:19,950
Mo Mo, Xiao Yi

483
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,430
We're going back

484
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,670
We didn't mention it earlier
just to avoid you to send us

485
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,630
And I have an urgent job,

486
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:27,110
that's why we're rushing back

487
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,310
We're at ease

488
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:30,830
when we saw the way
you two get along

489
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,630
There's pepper mantis prawn
in the pot, remember to eat it

490
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:36,390
Don't forget to post
the wedding photos to us

491
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:39,910
They already went home

492
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:46,790
And they left a lot of mantis prawn

493
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,230
So strange

494
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,550
Aren't you allergic to mantis prawn?

495
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:56,510
I can't finish it

496
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:58,030
But we'll turn them down

497
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:59,630
if we don't finish it

498
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:01,230
It's alright

499
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:03,230
Just leave it to me

500
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:05,310
Let me help on it

501
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:18,630
It smells good

502
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:24,830
So fresh

503
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:39,110
The mantis prawn is so nice

504
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:58,350
Can't you just eat one and clean one?

505
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,350
You don't understand

506
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,910
We must eat the whole plate of it
to feel a sense of accomplishment

507
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:20,710
Okay

508
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,590
Let's just eat this first

509
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:35,750
It is too fresh

510
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:49,670
You can have one

511
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,870
It doesn't matter if you eat little

512
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,550
It's alright

513
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,350
Allergies don't kill people

514
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:58,510
At worst you'll be admitted

515
00:33:58,710 --> 00:33:59,710
It doesn't matter

516
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,870
Forget it, you'd better don't eat

517
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,950
If anything happens on you,

518
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,030
I can't carry you

519
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:09,390
If you're admitted, how should
I explain to mom and dad?

520
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:10,390
You'd better don't eat

521
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,670
Just one, it won't be allergic

522
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:18,220
Yes

523
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:22,550
Mom said, someone ate a lot
of mantis prawn during the New Year

524
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:23,870
Definitely not allergic

525
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:35,910
So you started to fall into me

526
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,070
when we're by the sea

527
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:38,830
No

528
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:40,150
No?

529
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:42,470
Why did you give me
the mantis prawn then?

530
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:44,510
I suspected the mantis
prawn was poisonous

531
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:45,470
You're poisonous

532
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:47,110
You hate it because you love it

533
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:21,510
What's wrong with you?

534
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,910
You've been quiet since the dinner

535
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:42,750
What are you doing?

536
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:43,670
Get up

537
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:48,070
I...

538
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:50,350
I'm proposing

539
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:52,270
We're in a long-distance love

540
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:54,270
You still have to study and
I just started my business

541
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:55,110
I have no achievement yet

542
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:57,550
But, everything will be okay
after we get married

543
00:35:58,510 --> 00:35:59,950
What do you think?

544
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:01,230
Okay

545
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:02,190
Maybe you think

546
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,150
it's so sudden

547
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:04,750
But, I'm sincere

548
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:07,110
Wait

549
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:09,190
What did you say?

550
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:10,910
I said "Okay"

551
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:36,070
She said Okay

552
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:37,710
Did you hear that?

553
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:39,110
Calm down

554
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:23,910
Hi, the bride is changing
clothes on the second floor

555
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:24,750
Just a minute

556
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,070
Okay, thank you

557
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:32,390
Not ready yet?

558
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:34,830
Almost there

559
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:38,470
That's what you said an hours ago

560
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,590
You may leave first

561
00:37:58,630 --> 00:37:59,310
Take your time

562
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:10,710
Why? Spellbound by my beauty?

563
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:13,830
No

564
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:17,390
Let's go

565
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:19,350
We're going for outdoor shooting first

566
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:26,030
I was really caught by Si Tu Mo

567
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:29,470
I got 187 in my IQ

568
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,350
After meeting Si Tu Mo,

569
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:34,510
it seems only 87 left

570
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,310
I started to do a lot of stupid things

571
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:40,590
Buy for your girlfriend?

572
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:42,030
It's really comfortable

573
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:44,750
Wait!

574
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:47,150
"Like surrounded by the warmth"

575
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:51,030
"The story was shaking the destiny"

576
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:53,710
"Bamboo Dragonfly and the Time Tunnel"

577
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:56,190
"can go anywhere"

578
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:59,350
I started to do craps

579
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:01,550
Are you writing a thesis?

580
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:03,830
"The sky of glowing starlight"

581
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:07,670
"Melt me into your eyes"

582
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,910
"I want to go further with you"

583
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,270
"It's all I miss"

584
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:14,030
And lost the calmness I've always had

585
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:15,390
I poisoned her

586
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:16,470
When will the ambulance be here?

587
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:17,790
"I want to go further with you"

588
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:19,830
"Despite the changing of world"

589
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:22,910
You got scratched by it?

590
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:25,150
Aren't you allergic to cats?

591
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:31,470
And watch her giggling at all times

592
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:38,550
"Strand the lost memories"

593
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:42,150
"Write a new romantic poem"

594
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,750
I haven't driven a car
since I got my driving license

595
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:46,990
Do you know where the
throttle and the brakes are?

596
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:48,590
Do you really think I'm a stupid?

597
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:50,190
The shooting theme

598
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:51,670
which was chosen by
you is kind of stupid

599
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:53,070
"I want to go further with you"

600
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:55,110
"Despite the changing of world"

601
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:57,950
Let's just forget it

602
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,030
But,

603
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:03,150
I found my IQ is in
the continuously declining trend

604
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:04,750
For example,

605
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:09,510
Although I knows it's dangerous,
but I still get into the car

606
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:14,270
I'm willing to

607
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:25,990
"Promise me to be
by my side every day"

608
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:37,750
Gu Wei Yi

609
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:39,070
Please tie my hair

610
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:01,710
Just fine

611
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:29,430
Gu Wei Yi, bring me a glass of juice

612
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:31,510
I'm Si Tu Mo

613
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:43,230
Gu Wei Mo
