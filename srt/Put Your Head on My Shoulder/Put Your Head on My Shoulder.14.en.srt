What is science?

240

No matter what Gu Wei Yi does,

259
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,600

Where are you taking me?

349
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,200
Here it is

350
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,280
Amusement park?

351
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,000
To have fun here?

352
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,080
Meet you at the entrance

353
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,680
Must find a place where

354
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,800
Si Tu Mo can't run away
to confess to her

355
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,560
You only play this?

356
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,960
I want to ride the roller-coaster

357
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,560
Too noisy

358
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,200
Why did you come then?

359
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,520
Just want you to relax

360
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,720
To me, the most relaxing way
is lying on the bed after work

361
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,240
I have something to tell you

362
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,360
What's that?

363
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,680
This morning...

364
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,520
Tell me. What's that?

365
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,200
I want to tell you...

366
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,160
What's that?

367
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,040
Hit him!

368
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,520
Say what?

369
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:23,720
Say it

370
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,760
Gu Wei Yi

371
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,160
What do you want to say?

372
00:26:59,040 --> 00:26:59,920
One more time

373
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,160
No way

374
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:14,960
Si Tu Mo

375
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,720
What do you want to say? Say it now

376
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,240
It's about this morning...

377
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,520
Prof. Jiang

378
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,600
Gu Wei Yi

379
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,560
The kitten suddenly didn't
move after the vaccination

380
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,400
I couldn't get to Zhou Lei

381
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,000
I'll be right there

382
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,960
I need to rush to the pet clinic

383
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,600
Why?

384
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,520
Professor, what are you doing?

385
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,680
I used to smoke,

386
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,360
but can't change the habit after I quit it

387
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,400
I want to smoke when I'm anxious

388
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,080
Doctor

389
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,440
How is our baby?

390
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:22,720
It's okay

391
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,360
It's having a fever and sleepy

392
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,480
Some cats

393
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,360
have the symptoms after vaccination

394
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,400
No big deal

395
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:32,920
Sweetie

396
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,880
Take a rest

397
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,880
Be gentle, let it rest

398
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,520
We have to bring it home

399
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,280
No

400
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,720
You guys go home first

401
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,120
I'll bring it home when it wakes up

402
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,840
It stays in our house all this while

403
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,840
From today onwards,

404
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,880
I'll bring it home

405
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:54,920
I'll take care of it

406
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,360
But...

407
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,120
It's alright

408
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,280
Professor, this is our kitten

409
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:19,600
I...

410
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,600
You can have it

411
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,600
But I want to hug it first

412
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,040
Be gentle

413
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,040
Watch out, it just got a vaccination

414
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,200
Watch out

415
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,000
Give it to me

416
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,920
Don't be afraid, honey

417
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:50,840
Don't be afraid

418
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,360
Don't be afraid

419
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,640
"Low power, going to power off"

420
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,720
"Low power, going to power off"

421
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,680
Why didn't you save Circle?

422
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,200
It needs to grow up itself

423
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,080
"Charging"

424
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,320
When are you going to take a shower?

425
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,440
I want to clean the sewage

426
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,920
I'll go first

427
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,440
It's done

428
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,880
You can take a bath now

429
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,320
You haven't had your dinner yet

430
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,840
Want to eat Snails Rice Noodle?

431
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,480
You're awake

432
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,080
What smell?

433
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,280
Snails Rice Noodle?

434
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:41,800
Yes

435
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,200
Wait over there

436
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,960
Why suddenly cook the Snails Rice Noodle?

437
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,440
You didn't take your dinner last night

438
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,240
No one will eat this

439
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,600
in the early morning

440
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,360
I'll get some porridge

441
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:10,880
No need

442
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,520
Go on, I'll eat it

443
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,320
I'll wait there

444
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,400
Will be ready soon

445
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,080
Only one? Don't you want to eat?

446
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,760
I have eaten out

447
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,680
Taste it

448
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,840
I'll finish it then

449
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,480
Gu Wei Yi

450
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,600
I feel awkward when you're looking at me

451
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,920
I'm waiting to wash the bowl

452
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,280
Gu Wei Yi

453
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,080
If you hate the smell,
go back to your room

454
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,640
I'll clean it later

455
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,160
It's okay, it's just Snails Rice Noodle

456
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:34,760
Okay

457
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:46,800
Gu Wei Yi

458
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:48,680
I...

459
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,840
Do you like me?

460
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,800
[Here comes the Easter egg...]

461
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,360
So you didn't confess
on the bumper car, huh?

462
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,040
No

463
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,640
I knew it

464
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,120
Why must you confess on a bumper car?

465
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,580
The park is romantic and she
can't run from the bumper car

466
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,580
So he has to hear me out

467
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:34,860
You don't know

468
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,460
there's another place called
the ferris wheel in the park?

469
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,540
You can have the same effect there

470
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,340
It's not important now

471
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,700
I found a score sheet about me

472
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,220
I got -10 marks

473
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:49,660
So, I think...

474
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:51,980
Oh, my goodness

475
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,500
I thought 0 is the lowest, you got -10?

476
00:38:59,100 --> 00:38:59,980
What should I do now?

477
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:03,260
What else? Get more marks
before the next confession

478
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,340
As a studybug

479
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,500
you should know
"fight no war unprepared"?

480
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,500
But, -10

481
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,340
is extremely low

482
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,100
Bye
