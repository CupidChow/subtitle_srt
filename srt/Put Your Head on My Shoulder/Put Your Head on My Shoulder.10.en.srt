00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:53,700
It fell!

5
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,220
Let me see!

6
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,060
Take a selfie

7
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,500
with someone you like

8
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,180
Who?

9
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:20,460
What?

10
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:21,740
A selfie

11
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,140
This is only selfie

12
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,500
What now?

13
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,820
I like myself

14
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,460
So lame

15
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,740
Let's change to another game

16
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:42,740
Ke

17
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,260
Be careful

18
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,500
Can you manage to go back?
What about overnight here?

19
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,300
Forget it, this is far
away from our place

20
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,740
We have schedules for tomorrow

21
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,900
-Are you alright?
-Don't worry

22
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:57,860
Hurry up!

23
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,540
-The Fatty is heavy
-Bye

24
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:00,620
Be careful

25
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,700
Let me know once you're home

26
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,700
-Okay
-Bye

27
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,940
Take care of your room-mate

28
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,260
Gu Wei Yi!

29
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:00,780
Gu Wei Yi!

30
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,300
Go back to your room

31
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,700
Gosh!

32
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,940
You're so heavy

33
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,860
Alright, I won't bother you

34
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,620
Gu Wei Yi!

35
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,300
Gu Wei Yi!

36
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,020
Gu Wei Yi!

37
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:18,900
Gu Wei Yi!

38
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,540
Gu Wei Yi!

39
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:25,860
I...

40
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,220
I...

41
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,170
I should just let you freeze

42
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:41,380
Rascal!

43
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,180
Let's take breakfast

44
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:30,740
Thank you

45
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,980
Last night...

46
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,060
Did I trouble you?

47
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,100
Sorry

48
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,700
I shouldn't do that

49
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,620
without your permission

50
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,660
Actually,

51
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,540
I've liked you

52
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,980
since long time ago

53
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:57,940
Me too

54
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,780
What the crap!

55
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,220
Me too?

56
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:51,900
Let's take breakfast

57
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:01,900
Thank you

58
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,820
Last night...

59
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,780
Did I trouble you?

60
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,660
Sorry

61
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,300
I shouldn't

62
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,820
let you clean it up alone

63
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,660
I have cleaned up the balloons

64
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:29,620
What's wrong?

65
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,380
You forgot it?

66
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,020
Don't you remember anything else?

67
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,940
What's that?

68
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:45,820
What's that?

69
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,180
Alright, I don't want to eat,
I'm going to be late

70
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,860
You'll be alright after
finishing past year's papers

71
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,340
I have done many papers
and you told me the same

72
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,540
You have been in so many relationships
but still saying the same words

73
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,340
Wang Shan

74
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,300
Yes

75
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,660
You say it easily as you never
have a boyfriend right?

76
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,180
So what? Will I get fined?

77
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,260
Only those who have never
loved will say it easily

78
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,940
You have a lot of experiences,
give me a demo

79
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,100
Sure, I'm worried that you can't hold it

80
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,420
Says who?

81
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,500
You really think you are a love expert?

82
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,860
3 steps in dating

83
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,740
Go out for a meal, for a walk and a movie

84
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,300
I'll show you one by one, let's see

85
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:26,700
Let's go

86
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:28,500
Please

87
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:42,820
Lu Lu!

88
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,020
Lu Lu, get up

89
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,380
Lu Lu

90
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,540
Quickly get up, it's urgent!

91
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,380
Help!

92
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,500
What's wrong?

93
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,820
Are you pregnant?

94
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:06,760
[Sorry, I really don't want to lose you]

95
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,580
[Sorry, I don't want
to lose a friend like you]

96
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,100
Why are you so quiet?

97
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,220
You make me feel awkward

98
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,220
So pretty, you should do this earlier

99
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:39,780
Let's go

100
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,140
It's so cold

101
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,860
Cold wave is coming soon

102
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,420
I brought some warming tea,
do you want it?

103
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,100
Only for Gu Wei Yi?

104
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,180
For everyone here

105
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,540
Why did you only ask him?

106
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:02,820
Cut the crap!

107
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,020
Professor, do you want some tea?

108
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,420
You're young,

109
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,340
but weak

110
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,220
Look at me

111
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,620
Cold waves

112
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,900
don't affect me

113
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,740
I don't need any warming tea

114
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:18,740
Come on

115
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,900
Take a rest

116
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,740
Drink the ginger tea

117
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,460
I don't want it

118
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,460
What?

119
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,780
I have worked so hard for it

120
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,460
Drink it

121
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,020
No food or drink are allowed in the lab

122
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,220
I'll drink it at home

123
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,820
That's crap!

124
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,260
You're busy with the experiments
and only reach home in late night

125
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,700
Finish it and stop making crap

126
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,140
Finish it, cut the crap!

127
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,420
Three of you, come and drink it

128
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,460
The weather is so cold

129
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,300
Come on

130
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,620
It's enough, I have taken 2 bowls of it

131
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,060
This is ginger tea, not medicine

132
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,660
Don't show me that face, hurry

133
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,220
Xiao Gu, take some

134
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,540
Why did you give it to him?
I still have it here

135
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,460
Enough

136
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,020
Hurry up

137
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,660
All your proposals

138
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,420
were rejected by the art director

139
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:42,140
and the project was
assigned to the 3rd group

140
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,260
We couldn't fight even among ourselves,

141
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,260
let alone

142
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,240
the others companies

143
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,860
You know what the art director said?

144
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,260
Old-fashioned,

145
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,420
boring

146
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,940
He said, only the idea of Mo Mo
and Jie Er can be accepted

147
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,420
But their proposal

148
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,780
is not professional at all

149
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,300
How could your people

150
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,940
not as competent as the interns?

151
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,130
Sorry

152
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,090
Well,

153
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,420
we have no project now

154
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,020
Just take a rest

155
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,900
Miss Sha Sha, we received an email

156
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,370
We got a project of fruit juice

157
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,580
I'll leave it to you

158
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:19,460
I don't care

159
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,300
What now?

160
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:28,500
-We're not as good as the interns?
-Yeah

161
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,020
I spent several days for it

162
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,420
Stop grumbling

163
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,420
We'll discuss the juice project later

164
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,620
I don't want to be criticized
as not professional again

165
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:37,780
Okay

166
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,260
Get back to your work
and prepare the proposal

167
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,540
They're criticized by the art director

168
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,980
and only ours was accepted

169
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,460
How dare she scold us?

170
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,180
Do you want to buy anything?

171
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,100
Just look around

172
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,620
Since we want to experience a date,
we should be holding hands

173
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,660
There's a milk tea house

174
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,140
Let's go for it

175
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:57,100
Besides...You're the first girl
who paid in a date

176
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,100
Only two cups of milk tea
I still can afford it

177
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,300
Let's go play games

178
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,380
Let's go

179
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,020
Are you ready?

180
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,780
Sure!

181
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,620
Come on!

182
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,420
I'm faster than you

183
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:32,180
-You're left behind now Wait!
-I'll overtake you

184
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,660
You can't beat me

185
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,540
I'm a super racer

186
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:36,660
Gosh...

187
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,740
You're speedy

188
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:40,860
I got you

189
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,060
No!

190
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,180
You're cheating

191
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,220
What a speed!

192
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:57,660
Stop!

193
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,420
Let's play this

194
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,180
Can you catch it?

195
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,180
Don't look down on me,
I'll get one for you

196
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,580
I think I can break the record

197
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,100
Don't just stand here, help me, Mo Mo

198
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,100
You didn't break the record

199
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,980
It's alright, play again

200
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,220
I suddenly recall that
I have an online class tonight

201
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,540
So sorry

202
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,580
We didn't go for a meal or a movie

203
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,820
-Let's do it next time
-I'll tell you after I pick a movie

204
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,660
Why are you here?

205
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:26,460
We...

206
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,300
You guys went to buy
birthday gifts for Mo Mo?

207
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,100
I bought a humidifier in Doraemon shape

208
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,700
Luckily we didn't buy the same one

209
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,900
No, we got it from the crane machine

210
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,580
Mo Mo's gift is on the way

211
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,740
I go back first

212
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:42,740
Bye

213
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,780
I actually didn't think so much

214
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,180
-I thought all the girls like it
-It's okay

215
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,580
It's not a real date anyway

216
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:57,620
But,

217
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,700
I hope you bear in mind

218
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,980
I don't like spicy food

219
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,700
horror films

220
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,620
or Doraemon

221
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,500
These are all Mo Mo's favourite

222
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,500
Not mine

223
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,740
I'm going to the class

224
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:24,420
Can we complete the process
of a date next time?

225
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,100
Sure

226
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,660
See you

227
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,180
The toys...

228
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,940
I'll keep them just to make you guilty

229
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,900
You're so mean

230
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:39,540
Bye

231
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,060
Just go ahead if you want to

232
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,540
text her or even meet her

233
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,820
Don't hesitate

234
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:19,780
I'll be late for experiment
and won't be back tonight

235
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,700
How could you forget the kiss? Rascal!

236
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,020
Thank you

237
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,060
Gu Wei Yi, you caught a cold?

238
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,580
Don't come near to me

239
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:50,540
Mask

240
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,620
I'll find you a mask

241
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:52,700
Forget it

242
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:53,940
Xiao Gu

243
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,060
It doesn't matter

244
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:58,620
The experiment is not urgent
You may go back and take a rest

245
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,220
"Don't come back"

246
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,140
"I'll watch the ghost movie myself"

247
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,620
To avoid the infection,

248
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:06,740
I'm off

249
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,500
Alright

250
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,540
You did it very well

251
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,900
I wouldn't be able to do it

252
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:30,300
Fu Pei, waiting for Si Tu Mo?

253
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,820
I'm rushing home, see you

254
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,820
Quarrel?

255
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,180
-Let's go for hot pot together
-Alright

256
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,660
I'll pass, I want to go home

257
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,580
Let's go, the bill is on me

258
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,260
To thank for your
helping on the proposal

259
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,060
I'll pass

260
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:53,740
Let's go

261
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,740
-I'll pass
-Let's go

262
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,220
I'll pass...

263
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,460
Hey, our office is here

264
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,060
People might think
we're fighting for a man

265
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,060
We did it indeed

266
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,940
Only spicy?

267
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,620
You guys didn't care

268
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:15,700
about me

269
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,780
Let's dig in and go home

270
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,540
Frankly, I never bless you guys

271
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,900
But I really wonder

272
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,580
what is happening now

273
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:33,860
Quarrel

274
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,220
or dishonesty?

275
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,660
It's my problem

276
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,100
I...

277
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,100
Sorry

278
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,500
Your problem?

279
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,100
It's most likely dishonesty

280
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,660
No, we're not the kind of relationship

281
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,100
Just normal friends

282
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,300
Alright, as long as you
treat me as a friend

283
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,260
It seems I should

284
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,740
use the bathroom

285
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,260
to give you guys some space

286
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:14,380
Mo Mo, sorry about it

287
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,060
I wanted to say "that's alright",

288
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,500
but I can't do it

289
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,420
I'm still angry

290
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:25,180
Could you please don't turn up again?

291
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,220
And

292
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,100
I hope you don't treat Shan Shan

293
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,340
the way you treated me

294
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,460
I'm off. See you no more

295
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,380
You said you won't be back tonight

296
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,100
Where did you go? Smell like hot pot

297
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,060
I just had a hot pot

298
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,740
-With whom?
-Fu Pei

299
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,060
You said you rejected him

300
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:27,100
He suddenly turned up
and he knows my colleague

301
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,780
Not my concern

302
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,460
Waiting for the bus?

303
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,060
Going back to the new campus?

304
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,260
So cold

305
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,660
What a waste!

306
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:12,020
We don't have radiators in the house

307
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,620
and it's not snowing

308
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,260
The weather is so cold

309
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,340
I...I wish to see snow

310
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,660
I've never made a snowman

311
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:21,900
I'm from the North

312
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,780
-So you're not afraid of cold
-We have heaters

313
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,860
Since it's so cold,

314
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,540
let's have a hot pot tonight

315
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,260
You had it last night, didn't you?

316
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,700
We can still have it tonight

317
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,740
Hot pots are for cold weather

318
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:41,860
So lame

319
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,500
Here you are

320
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,260
Gu Wei Yi

321
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,860
What a smart boy!

322
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:08,660
Just in time when we
have adjusted the equipment

323
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:11,860
Turn it back then

324
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:12,620
I...

325
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,020
Gu Wei Yi, come on

326
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,260
Your senior is on a sick leave,
so you do it for her

327
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:27,980
Okay

328
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,140
Prof. Jiang, why did you ask him
to do 2 experiments instead of me?

329
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:32,620
This...

330
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:34,580
Take it

331
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,300
Please do it

332
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,380
Xiao Gu

333
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,060
It seems you're in a bad mood

334
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,980
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay

335
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,300
Really?

336
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:06,980
Yes

337
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:09,700
Gu Wei Yi

338
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:10,660
I told you I'm fine

339
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,940
I just want to ask about
the experiment record

340
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,580
Are you sure you're alright?

341
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,100
He just said it! Cut the crap!

342
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:20,740
Do your work

343
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,220
Hurry up!

344
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:34,660
That's right

345
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,900
I told you before

346
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:40,420
I really can't live with her anymore

347
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:41,740
I'm pissed off

348
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,340
She's really bad-tempered recently

349
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,300
It's hard to live with her

350
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,980
Like I owe her money

351
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,460
Always showing me her long face

352
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,980
I wanted to buy her a treat

353
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,300
as she's unhappy

354
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,460
But she told me to get on diet

355
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:01,660
Too bad

356
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,540
Who knows?

357
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,020
I guess she's in love

358
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,540
People who are in love are insane

359
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,500
You meant,

360
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,300
the girl you like

361
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,020
met her ex-boyfriend?

362
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,460
The girl who pleaded for you

363
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:23,980
was not your girlfriend?

364
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,580
No interrupt please

365
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,660
You're worried she may leave you

366
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,340
but don't know what to do

367
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,140
And you are mad now, right?

368
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:42,340
Yes

369
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,380
It's so easy

370
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,220
The problem came from her ex-boyfriend

371
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,180
-Is he our school mate?
-Yes

372
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,220
Beat him up

373
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,020
No way, you can't do that

374
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,580
And you can't bring him down

375
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,140
Well,

376
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,900
you may request his counselor

377
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,620
to have a talk with him

378
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,420
Prof. Jiang

379
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,460
Look at his face

380
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:06,540
What a snobby look!

381
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,820
Did I say it wrong?

382
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,260
How dare he doubt me!

383
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,780
Has he been in love before?

384
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,860
Enough! Carry on your experiment

385
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,060
Don't think too much

386
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,220
Do your work

387
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,660
Stay for a while after this

388
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,180
I'll give you something

389
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:34,380
It helped me to get my wife before

390
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:38,700
What are you talking about?

391
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:40,740
Nothing

392
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,860
I want him to clean the lab after this

I'm alright. Are you getting better?

I'll wait for you to come back

So handsome!

The hair style is extremely nice! So handsome!

400
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,220

401

410
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,380
I use a warming patch for stomach ache

411
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,460
I take you to the hospital

It's okay

It's okay

415

I have my menstruation

416
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,260
Is it painful?

417
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,060
Alright, I can stand it

418
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,180
You are strong

419
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:47,980
You folded the clothes nicely

420
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,260
Smooth and straight

421
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:56,380
Thank you

422
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,380
You're welcome

423
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:15,180
Most of the boys misunderstand that

424

all the girls feel scared
to talk about sex

425
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:21,460
When an energetic girl
stays with the boy she likes,

426
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:25,180
talking about sex in
a simple and natural manner

427
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,500
will make her think you're interesting

428
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,180
Animal's World?

429
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:52,180
Do you know why the
Bombus Affinis goes extinct?

430
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,340
What's that?

431
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:58,260
Bombus Affinis. Because they
can't get mating and breeding

432
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:00,860
Why?

433
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,220
They're infected by a parasite

434
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,100
called Nosema bombi

435
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,020
The parasite causes an edema
so that they can't breed

436
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:13,900
The edema swells up between
the soft tissues of its organ

437
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,380
So the drone is overweight

438
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,740
and can't bend to mate with the queen

439
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,860
The queen produces
male offspring by itself

440
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,620
But needs fertilization
to get female offspring

441
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:25,380
Could you explain it
in a straightaway language?

442
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:29,180
Overweight will cause
a failure in the sexual activity

443
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:42,260
What's wrong?

444

447
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:51,700
Exactly

448
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:52,820
You're right

449
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,220

450
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,580

First, hair

Among the girls whom I've interviewed,

460
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,100
hair style is their main concern

461
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,740
Mind your hair style

462
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,420
It is not only
