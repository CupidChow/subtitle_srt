[Preview]

3
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,560
What is your feeling with Si Tu Mo?

4
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,880
Not your concern

5
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,800
But it's very important to me

6
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,160
[Episode 8]

7
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,160
With the sea in my heart,

8
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,520
everywhere can be Maldives

9
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,280
I had a cat before

10
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,880
It liked to catch cockroaches

11
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,680
One day, after I woke up from a nap,

12
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,800
it put more than 10
cockroaches in front of me

13
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,520
and walked away proudly

14
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,680
Mine too

15
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,840
It gave me dead rats

16
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,560
Look similar?

17
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,400
Exactly

18
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,600
So beautiful

19
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,400
Meng Lu, your boyfriend is so charming

20
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,200
"I wish to give you all my good"

21
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,160
"Do you know?"

22
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,760
"You are very important to me"

23
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:59,160
"I appreciate every
moment we're together"

24
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:05,080
"Together we wait for the sunrise"

25
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,840
"Your breath became my heartbeat"

26
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,720
"I want to build a castle"

27
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,040
"with the smell of the ocean"

28
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,120
"Running barefoot at the beach with you"

29
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,320
I want to ask you something

30
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,000
Alright

31
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,160
What is your relationship
with Wang Shan?

32
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,200
Mo Mo wants you to ask me?

33
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,760
No

34
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,120
Why did you ask?

35
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,000
I want to know your feeling with Si Tu Mo

36
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,120
Not your concern

37
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,000
But it's very important to me

38
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,200
Why?

39
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,320
She is not the type

40
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,320
you nerds like

41
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,560
You're not going to

42
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,040
fall out with me for her, are you?

43
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,800
You should be thankful with these food

44
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,240
Quickly dig in

45
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,200
Who stole my sausage?

46
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,600
-Who?
-Don't know

47
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,200
Meng Lu

48
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,720
Mo Mo

49
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,160
Is it you?

50
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,600
I'll give you two back

51
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,160
No way

52
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:31,680
Three

53
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,160
Fine

54
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,000
Okay, three

55
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,320
Is it worthy you do that
for a girl who stole the sausage?

56
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,920
It's worthy

57
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,840
Are you okay?

58
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm okay, I'll wash it with cold water

59
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,120
Go

60
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,960
Take a look at him

61
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,160
"Get myself in trouble"

62
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,600
"The spine at your mouth"

63
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,480
"Know well of your own shadow"

64
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,800
Are you alright?

65
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,560
I'm okay

66
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,200
Apply the medicine

67
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,600
You can't just
leave the wound behind

68
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,600
It's so serious

69
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,560
If there's a blister,
we should see how big it is

70
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,720
If it's big, you should poke it, squeeze
the water before applying the medicine

71
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,880
If it's small, it will recover itself

72
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,040
When we're at Gu Wei Yi's house...

73
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,920
I knew you were drunk and
mistook me for someone else

74
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,760
I'm so sorry

75
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,280
Buy me a meal as an apology

76
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,920
Are you falling in love with...

77
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,400
Are you dreaming?

78
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,520
I heard it from Mo Mo that
you always treat her luxury meals

79
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,160
So I want to steal a meal from you

80
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,400
Forget it

81
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,240
If you really feel sorry to me,

82
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,960
you should pass the CET-4

83
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,560
I don't want to see you anymore

84
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,040
Alright

85
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,000
I will buy you a luxury meal

86
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,400
Promise?

87
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,400
I'll keep my promise

88
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,840
If you're into someone for a long time,

89
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,560
but you didn't tell her because

90
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,040
you're afraid of losing her

91
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,000
Now, you will really lose her

92
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,640
if you keep hiding your feeling

93
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,760
What will you do?

94
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,360
If it were me,

95
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,990
I would let her know

96
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,750
What if you lose her after that?

97
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,520
Then I'll end it smartly

98
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,680
and start a new relationship

99
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,440
I have never thought
you are so experienced

100
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,600
Why should we move the tents?

101
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,520
The tents are too close to the sea

102
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,520
It's windy and the tide will be in

103
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,920
Moreover, we didn't drop any anchor

104
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,440
It's unsafe for lack of grip

105
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,280
What about here?

106
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,120
Okay

107
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,400
-I will set it here
-Alright

108
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,480
Si Tu Mo

109
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,920
Pull it

110
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,400
Slowly! What if I fall down?

111
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,120
Get up again

112
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,040
Are you finished?

113
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,160
Drop the anchor

114
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,640
How? Do we have a hammer?

115
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,280
Use your internal strength

116
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,160
It's not funny

117
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,600
I know who has it, wait for a while

118
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,000
How did you know I brought the heels?

119
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,560
Didn't you change it

120
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,080
in the car for selfie?

121
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,840
Hit it lightly, it's very expensive

122
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,720
What's wrong?

123
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,960
I couldn't sleep and came out for a walk

124
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,040
What are you holding?

125
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,160
A selfie stick

126
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,800
Just trying it

127
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,600
What's wrong?

128
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,440
Aren't you taking a photo?

129
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,000
Come on

130
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:16,840
Gu Wei Yi

131
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,080
What?

132
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,720
Are you hungry?

133
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,320
I'm starving

134
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,920
Any left over foods?

135
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,560
I guess no

136
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,400
I'm hungry

137
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,160
Let's go

138
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:43,840
Where to?

139
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,280
To get you some food

140
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,160
Can you catch it?

141
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,360
Sure

142
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,280
My god, you caught it!

143
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,720
A living crab

144
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,120
Let me see

145
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,840
My goodness

146
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,640
Let me try

147
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,800
Can I?

148
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,160
What's that?

149
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,360
Quickly catch it

150
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,720
What was that?

151
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,040
A mantis prawn

152
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,040
You are so annoying

153
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,920
The prawn is alive too

154
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,600
How to grill this with no fire?

155
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,520
I wanted to try drilling wood for fire for so long

156
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,400
Are you serious?

157
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,760
You tell me

158
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,320
So how to grill it?

159
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,520
As a nerd

160
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,360
what idea can you think of?

161
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,680
What a good smell!

162
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,240
Any salt with you?

163
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,360
It will be delicious with some salt

164
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,520
What's this?

165
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,680
Sea water

166
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,760
Are you crazy? Is that edible?

167
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,800
The salt inside the
sea water was about 3.5%

168
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,040
It means

169
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,920
there's 35g of salt

170
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,680
out of 1000g sea water

171
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,520
Moreover,

172
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,080
the temperature of
an open fire is 700 degrees

173
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,720
So,

174
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,280
nothing can stay alive

175
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,000
Thanks to a scientist like you

176
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,960
You granted whatever I requested
You are my Doraemon

177
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,600
Let's eat

178
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,840
It's hot, be careful

179
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,000
Have some

180
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,520
What a nicely grilled prawn!

181
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,680
Nice smell

182
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,320
But we have only one

183
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,120
Take it

184
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,080
Take it, I don't like it

185
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,640
Why?

186
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,480
Allergy

187
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,040
and it looked like a giant cockroach

188
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,480
It sounds like sour grapes

189
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,760
I'll throw it away then

190
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,640
I want it

191
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,360
Take this

192
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,280
Mo Mo, we'll leave first

193
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,040
Bye

194
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,000
Drive safe

195
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,800
Bye

196
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,720
Drive safe

197
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,440
You hand was hurt, we don't want
to risk our life with you

198
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,080
It doesn't matter

199
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,720
Gu Wei Yi, you drive the car

200
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,240
-You'll be my navigator
-Okay

201
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,440
Girls are weak in sense
of direction, let me help you

202
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,840
What did you say?

203
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:07,880
Say it again

204
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:11,480
Nothing

205
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,200
I'm weak in sense of direction

206
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,960
Turn left at the junction in front

207
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,600
No junction in front

208
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,560
Really?

209
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,720
Did I get it wrong?

210
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,800
Impossible

211
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,400
You are right, we're not there yet

212
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,960
Don't get nervous

213
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,240
Alright

214
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,080
-Do you want water?
-No

215
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,560
"Arrived the destination"

216
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,240
Si Tu Mo

217
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,000
-Someone is waiting for you
-Is my mother here?

218
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,480
Him

219
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,680
Get back to work

220
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,520
Why don't you give it a name
and take it for a walk everyday?

221
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,200
Giving it a name is a good idea

222
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,400
Then give it a name

223
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:43,960
I got it

224
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,360
What?

225
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,720
Circle

226
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,800
Circle fits its look, doesn't it?

227
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,640
Alright, bye

228
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,200
Hello

229
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:23,760
Hello

230
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,320
I'm a new intern to report for duty

231
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,800
Please follow me

232
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,680
Come in

233
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,800
Director Sha Sha

234
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,880
I'm the new intern, Si Tu Mo

235
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,760
The HR Dept. told me to report to you

236
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,920
Hello, welcome to our department

237
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,120
Thank you

238
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,600
Li Na, come in for a while

239
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,800
Director

240
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,400
Li Na is our Creative Executive Director

241
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,880
Hello, I'm the new intern, Si Tu Mo

242
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,680
Hello, I'm Li Na, come with me

243
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,640
Alright

244
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,720
This is your seat

245
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,560
He is the Art Editor, Ain

246
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,600
New comer, Mo Mo

247
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,280
Hello

248
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,280
Hello

249
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,840
I have done the introduction

250
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,840
Report to the HR and get a sample
of roll-up banner downstairs

251
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,760
Alright

252
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,120
What a...

253
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,440
So sorry

254
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,240
Be careful

255
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,520
Will you get together with Fu Pei

256
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,520
after graduation?

257
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,680
Xu Jie Er

258
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,640
It's you!

259
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,560
-Why are you carrying things here?
-I'm an intern here

260
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,240
So am I

261
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,840
Which department are you in?

262
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,720
Creative Department No.4

263
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,880
Me too

264
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,360
-Lead me the way
-Sure

265
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,720
Let's go

266
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,320
I'll help you

267
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,320
When did you report?

268
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,360
I just arrived

269
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,760
So did I

270
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,200
Is it heavy?

271
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,000
It's okay

272
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,560
Come in

273
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,040
Director,she is the new intern, Xu Jie Er

274
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,920
You are Jie Er?

275
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,440
Welcome

276
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,720
Mo Mo, you may leave now

277
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,520
How has Mr. Xu been?
I haven't seen him for a long time

278
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,440
He is fine

279
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,520
Let's go

280
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,440
Dear all

281
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,480
From today onward,

282
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,760
we're back to the new campus

283
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,480
Clear with the duty
I have just given to you?

284
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,680
Yes

285
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,520
Professor, you didn't give me any duty

286
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,200
You should focus on your
thesis of your Master Degree

287
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,880
But I want to join the experiment

288
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,480
The most important thing is
to select the topic of thesis

289
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,000
You will run out of time

290
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,680
It has no conflict between
the thesis and the experiment

291
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,440
Have you done the calculation

292
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,120
that I gave you the other day?

293
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,920
Not yet

294
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,240
Xie Yu Yin

295
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,040
Human has his limited energy

296
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,200
Now

297
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,320
you should focus on the thesis

298
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,320
But I really want to join the experiment

299
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,400
I have been doing it

300
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,720
since undergraduate

301
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,160
I can't accept that

302
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,360
you want me to stop

303
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,880
I don't mean to stop you, but afraid
you may slow down the experiment

304
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,360
Can I join it once I have
done the calculation?

305
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,000
Alright

306
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,120
Pass up the calculation by tomorrow

307
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,520
Tomorrow?

308
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,840
Even the professor can't do it himself

309
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,520
No problem

310
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:57,960
Listen

311
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,840
I want a calculation without any error

312
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,040
Professor Jiang, I want to ask something

313
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,280
The experiment...

314
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,080
How far have you done?

315
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,480
-Don't you need to pass up by tomorrow?
-I just said it in anger

316
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,680
It's impossible

317
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,760
Let's work together

318
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,560
Do you know how to do it?

319
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,760
Of course

320
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,280
Hello

321
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,760
Hello, we have put your parcel in the mail box

322
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,880
It's fresh food, please get it
as soon as possible

323
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:02,680
Okay

324
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,800
Mo Mo

325
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,040
Why are you here?

326
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:08,960
To pick you up

327
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,880
Are you crazy?

328
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,720
Let me buy you dinner

329
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,440
No, thanks, I'm busy

330
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,240
Are you still angry with me?

331
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,280
It was just a misunderstanding

332
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,720
It has nothing to do with me

333
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,880
I want to go back now

334
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,080
Mo Mo

335
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,040
Fu Pei

336
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,760
It's been a long time

337
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,200
How are you?

338
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,280
You two still together?

339
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,400
No

340
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,960
You two work together?

341
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,560
Why didn't you tell me?

342
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,160
We didn't know until today

343
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,320
Right?

344
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,680
I leave first

345
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,280
Fu Pei

346
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,160
Which way are you going?

347
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,560
That way

348
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,000
So am I. Let's go together

349
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:05,680
Alright

350
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,560
Let's go

351
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:19,680
Dad

352
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,720
I'll be there tomorrow
Let's lunch together

353
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,560
I don't have time

354
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,760
The signal is poor here, I'll hang up

355
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,160
Your dad?

356
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,920
I still remember what he had done
although it's been so many years

357
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,280
He made us so scared

358
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,120
that we broke up the next day

359
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,000
Let's go

360
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,440
Hello

361
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,280
Hello, mom

362
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,000
What did you send to me?

363
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,400
I have made you

364
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,600
some sauced beef

365
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,640
You and Xiao Gu may have it with rice

366
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,640
What rice?

367
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,040
We don't know how to cook

368
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,640
I knew it

369
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,640
That's why I made you the sauced beef

370
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,240
Xiao Gu can have it with beer

371
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,640
So troublesome

372
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,240
No trouble at all

373
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,680
Why should I take care of him?
I'm tired too

374
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,360
Alright

375
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,880
Are you really my mum?

376
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,520
Hello

377
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,120
Why aren't you back yet?

378
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,360
-I'll stay at the lab tonight
-You should tell me earlier

379
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,520
Okay, I will tell you next time

380
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,840
That's all, bye

381
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,240
It's not my concern

382
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,240
Shall we take a rest and grab a bite?

383
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,720
It's okay, let's hurry up finish it

384
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,400
Circle

385
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,800
Your dad is not coming back,
don't you care?

386
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,440
"Low power"

387
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,160
"Turning off"

388
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,480
"Low power"

389
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:24,840
"Turning off"

390
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:47,960
Thank you

391
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,800
I take a nap first

392
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,480
She made it

393
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,360
It's impossible

394
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,720
I think so too

395
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,920
Can I take part in the experiment?

396
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,080
Wait

397
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,040
Did you simply make up the data

398
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,960
to fool me?

399
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,000
Professor!

400
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,000
Let me pick a few and
do the calculation myself

401
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,080
Gu Wei Yi, Zhou Lei, help me do it

402
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,320
Alright

403
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,440
Gu Wei Yi

404
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,920
You're disrespectful recently

405
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,960
Your senior has done such
difficult calculation in a night

406
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:17,960
How about you?

407
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,320
You're sleeping here

408
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,320
Professor, Gu Wei Yi...

409
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,080
See, she is trying to protect you

410
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,480
Don't you feel ashamed?

411
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,160
No, he doesn't

412
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,240
Because he did two thirds of these

413
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,880
What?

414
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,840
Yes, I did it, is the result wrong?

415
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,320
Impossible

416
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,160
An undergraduate can't do this

417
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,600
Professor, Xia Yu Yin is telling lies

418
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,840
just to protect him

419
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,600
It might be possible

420
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,960
if it was Gu Wei Yi

421
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:55,760
Then...

422
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:59,480
Professor, can you ask him
to do it in front of me?

423
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,480
Zhou Lei will only agrees after
gets stricken down by Gu Wei Yi

424
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,960
The fighting of two geniuses

425
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,040
I feel pity for Zhou Lei
to get hurt every time

426
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,080
Professor

427
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,280
Can I take part in the experiment?

428
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,600
Forget about it

429
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,200
It was done by Gu Wei Yi

430
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,600
Not you

431
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,560
You said you wanted accurate results,
never specify who to calculate it

432
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,960
Can you really carry on?

433
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:50,960
Yes

434
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,920
Professor, can I stop here?
I want to go back to sleep

435
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,600
Ask if Zhou Lei agrees

436
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,360
Why isn't he back yet?

437
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,400
That's all

438
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,400
Alright

439
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,120
Just a moment

440
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,720
The food here is delicious

441
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,600
Michelin 3 Stars, a famous restaurant

442
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,880
Thanks, Director Fu

443
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,880
Not Director Fu

444
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,840
You should call me Boss

445
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,520
You are so funny

446
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:45,600
Dad

447
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,440
Here you come

448
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,800
Sit down

449
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,440
Why didn't you pick up my call?

450
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,840
It's in silent mode

451
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,680
My son, Fu Pei

452
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,280
A student of Management
in Southern University

453
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,800
Southern University?

454
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,800
Must be a top student

455
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,000
Of course

456
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:09,080
Son, this is my new assistant

457
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,520
You may call her Aunt Ling Ling

458
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,120
Why are you here? Where is mom?

459
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,680
I came here on business

460
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,040
Why would I bring her?

461
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,560
She can't help me in business

462
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,480
Is that so?

463
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,560
Mind your attitude

464
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,480
What major are you taking?

465
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,440
Are you about to graduate?

466
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,400
This year

467
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,840
An elder is asking you,
answer it properly

468
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,080
How did I teach you?

469
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,000
It doesn't matter

470
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,960
She's not my elder

471
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,880
She is about my age

472
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,680
But you call her my elder

473
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,080
How could you say it?

474
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,000
Director Fu

475
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,520
My schoolmate knew that
I'm here on business

476
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,840
and she wants to meet me

477
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,160
Perhaps, I shall leave first

478
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,880
Enjoy the meal

479
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,160
Come with me

480
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,080
Now you've grown up

481
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,760
Is this what you've learnt

482
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,160
from the university?

483
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,480
Do you think no one can bother you

484
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,680
after you get into the university?

485
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,120
Stop dreaming!

486
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,160
You have to listen to me

487
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,160
as long as you are my son

488
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,600
You're just like your mother!
You two are ungrateful

489
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,320
-Don't mention my mom
-Why not?

490
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,600
Your mother is not a good person

491
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,000
She left you alone

492
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,560
when you're small

493
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,960
It's because you were messing about

494
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,040
So what?

495
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,200
She was the one who left you

496
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,200
Do you think she
came back for your sake?

497
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,480
You are wrong

498
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,640
All she wants is my money

499
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,920
I have plenty of money

500
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,120
If you don't have money,
no one will stay by your side

501
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,960
No one will care about you

502
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,400
I tell you

503
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,960
No one

504
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:41,760
What's that look?

505
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,240
How dare you?

506
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,520
There will be!

507
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,280
Gu Wei Yi

508
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:04,960
Gu Wei Yi

509
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,280
Gu Wei Yi

510
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,000
Gu Wei Yi

511
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,120
Is he dead?

512
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,040
What are you doing?

513
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,280
I'm calling you to eat the sauced beef

514
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,800
Come on

515
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,320
Has the ghost come out?

516
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,800
Has it come out?

517
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,560
Huh?

518
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,920
Why did you watch it
since you're scared?

519
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,760
Why did you watch it since
you're not scared?

520
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,320
Finished

521
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,920
I sliced the meat, so you wash the plate

522
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,640
You finished so fast

523
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,640
Get it in the fridge

524
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,080
Who is it?

525
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,720
Who will come during mid night?

526
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,520
What are you doing?

527
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,840
Let me open it

528
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,920
Just to open the door

529
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,040
Why do you bring the knife?

530
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,120
A girl shouldn't open
the door at night

531
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:40,940
Here comes the Easter egg

532
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,800
Si Tu Mo

533
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:39,760
What's wrong?

534
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,480
I know the password of your phone

535
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,680
How do you know?

536
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,720
You drew it many times in front of me

537
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,120
Change it to a more complicated one

538
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,600
Alright

539
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,680
By the way, send me the photos
we took at the beach

540
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:57,880
Alright
