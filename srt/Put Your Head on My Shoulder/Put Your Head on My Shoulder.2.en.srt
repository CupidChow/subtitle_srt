Gu Wei Yi

00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:33,840
What's up?

5
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,640
Do you think Mo Mo is pretty?

6
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,320
Hey!

7
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,480
Hey!

8
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,640
Hello

9
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,840

[Episode 2]

12
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,720
At the critical moment,

13
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,520
the black-face knight came
down from the heaven

14
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,640
Handsome?

15
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,440
Not bad

16
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,640
Let me continue.

17
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,720
Riding on a motorbike

18
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,720
With the sound of vroom and black fume

19
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,800
The engine does not go-green.
Call the Department of Environment

20
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,759
Don't interrupt

21
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,760
Just ignore them, continue your story

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,640
The black-face knight...

23
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,480
I can't describe it

24
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,600
He saved me and sent me to the hospital

25
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,560
I should not waste my time to hear it

26
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,880
Such a bad ending

27
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,920
I want to sleep

28
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,000
Shut up!

29
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,560
I'm full

30
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,560
I want to sleep

31
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,880
Niu Niu, throw the meal box

32
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,920
It will get stink

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,320
Mo Mo, please throw it for me

34
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,560
Hello

35
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,080
Mo Mo.

36
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,160
Eaten your meal?

37
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,240
Yes

38
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,560
That's good

39
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,960
I forgot to send you meal
as I was busy in the cyber cafe

40
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,960
I never put hope on you

41
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,600
Don't be angry with me

42
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,920
We go for dinner later.

43
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,360
I'll pass

44
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,040
Let's go together

45
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:23,800
Please

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,120
No

47
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,240
Mo Mo, slow down your voice

48
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,480
They are sleeping

49
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,480
I'll put down the phone first

50
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,200
So early you come back from your lunch

51
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,680
Sir

52
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,720
I'm not going to meet Prof. Jiang

53
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,880
Don't come again

54
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,840
I just came here to chat with you

55
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,640
I'd like to interact with you

56
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,480
I want to take care

57
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,160
of your study life as
you are our top student

58
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,680
I'm going to do an experiment

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,560
But there's only one goggle

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,960
You...

61
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,360
Take your time

62
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,680
Think about it

63
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,480
I'll come again

64
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,920
Awesome

65
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,840
Mo Mo

66
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,040
Why do you go back so early?

67
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,320
-Don't you want to see my game?
-I still have assignments to do

68
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,640
I want to talk to you

69
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,760
What's that?

70
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,400
I think

71
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,360
we're quite suitable

72
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,120
Let's get together

73
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,960
after we finish the studies

74
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,360
I knew

75
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,240
today is April's Fool

76
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,400
What say you?

77
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,560
If you say yes, it means
I'm serious, otherwise,

78
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,320
just take it as April's Fool

79
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,760
What say you?

80
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,680
I'll to hit you with
the ball if you say no

81
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,840
Mo Mo

82
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,800
What's wrong with you?

83
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,720
Nothing

84
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,040
Nothing

85
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,560
Where are you going?

86
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,160
Your leg is injured

87
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,440
Don't act recklessly

88
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,200
My leg is almost healed and
I have an interview this afternoon

89
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,880
Interview?

90
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,600
The interview on that day?

91
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,560
That's right

92
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,440
You're really bold, huh?

93
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,360
I will scare if I have no job

94
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,760
I'll go with you

95
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,280
Oh, no

96
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,400
I'll be busy in the afternoon

97
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,040
I can go by myself

98
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,480
No

99
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,320
I can't let you go alone

100
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,640
Wait me at the bus station

101
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,480
I won't wait for you

102
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,920
You will wait for me

103
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,080
Waiting for the bus?

104
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,680
Fu Pei asked me to come

105
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,720
Hello

106
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,200
Gu Wei Yi, I need your favour

107
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,960
Accompany Mo Mo to her interview

108
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,000
No way

109
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,600
Please

110
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,040
That place is quite isolated

111
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,760
-She is a girl...
-Why don't you go yourself?

112
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,680
I have a match with
the media school in the afternoon

113
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,040
No way, you look for someone else

114
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,760
Do you really refuse to go?

115
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,040
I won't go

116
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,400
There will be one more video
on the school forum later

117
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,880
What video?

118
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,280
What say you?

119
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,560
The military training

120
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,280
I have deleted it

121
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,840
I have backed-up a copy

122
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,120
If you go,

123
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,600
I'll delete the video

124
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,120
You don't want me to go with you, right?

125
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,240
Tell him yourself

126
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,680
That place is quite isolated
let's hurry up

127
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:15,520
You...

128
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,440
Gu Wei Yi

129
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,880
What's your final decision

130
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,600
after you thought thoroughly?

131
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,240
Sir

132
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,680
I'm in a relationship

133
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,160
So, I'll leave it behind first

134
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,640
In a relationship?

135
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,840
With me?

136
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,320
That's right

137
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,240
Any problem?

138
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,920
Yeah, we're in a relationship

139
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,400
Hello

140
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,560
I'm Gu Wei Yi's lecturer

141
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,800
My name is Si Tu Mo

142
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,760
I agreed with your relationship

143
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,080
Especially when Gu's in a relationship

144
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,360
Thank you

145
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,360
But,

146
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,000
we have an important

147
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,480
selection examination two days before

148
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,520
He couldn't sit for it
as he forgot his student card.

149
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,560
I didn't understand

150
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,720
why would he

151
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,320
make the mistake

152
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,080
Now I fully understood it

153
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,960
when I see you today

154
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,920
Everyone may make mistakes

155
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,800
when they're in a relationship

156
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,640
Was his student card with you?

157
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,000
Sir

158
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,680
Please don't disturb us

159
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,760
Last one

160
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,880
We have arranged it
to give him the last chance

161
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,120
But he claimed

162
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,680
it's unfair to the others

163
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,720
and refused to meet Prof. Jiang

164
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,680
So, I...

165
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,040
Last one, right?

166
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,200
No point you talk to her

167
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,520
I'm the decision maker

168
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,880
Says who?

169
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,120
I'm the decision maker too

170
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,440
Station of West Road of South

171
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,400
To get down, please use the back exit

172
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,040
Try to convince him

173
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,040
Advise him

174
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,880
I'll leave now, please advise him

175

00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,960
How could you know him?

349
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,840
He always competes
with me for the scholarship

350
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:56,920
You're wrong.

351
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,560
He's holding Grade 1
and you're holding Grade 3

352
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,040
Don't brag

353
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,960
Okay, fine

354
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,640
I think,

355
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,560
he is a low-profile handsome guy

356
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,560
Good-looking and low-profile

357
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,320
What a nice guy!

358
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,880
How come I don't know him
since he's so famous?

359
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,640
You didn't focus on it

360
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,240
You only watch dramas and

361
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,040
follow the guy.

362
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,000
That's why you don't know him

363
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,400
It's a pity

364
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,480
Why?

365
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,800
He is now the negative example

366
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,880
in every graduation meeting

367
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,680
I heard he forgot his pass for
an important selection examination

368
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,120
Some people said his talent

369
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,600
makes him arrogant

370
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,440
Hey!

371
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,880
Hey!

372
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,000
Hello!

373
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,040
Hello!

374
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,680
Do you know Mr. Xu?

375
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,800
Which Mr. Xu?

376
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,640
The lecturer of Physics 1

377
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,080
Gabble Xu? I'm looking
for him too, let's go.

378
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,040
Thank you

379
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:05,880
Come in

380
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,000
Mr. Xu

381
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,040
Prof. Jiang asked me to bring
the paper and result to you

382
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,080
How?

383
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,440
None of our students were selected?

384
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,680
Mathematics School got the highest mark

385
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,160
Put it here

386
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,200
Thank you

387
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,480
I'm leaving

388
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,680
Okay

389
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,080
You are...

390
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,520
Good day, I'm Si Tu Mo

391
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,240
We met on the bus

392
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,000
Gu Wei Yi's girlfriend

393
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,320
How is it?

394
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,600
Any good news for me?

395
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,280
I wanted to know

396
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,760
how can you help

397
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,600
Gu Wei Yi

398
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,400
Please come in

399
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,160
Prof. Jiang

400
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,640
Why are you here again?

401
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,920
Come on

402
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,280
I guess you will gabble around

403
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,880
Help me clean the white board

404
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:04,920
Okay

405
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:06,920
Professor

406
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,720
Do you still remember my student,

407
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,040
Gu Wei Yi?

408
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,360
The fact is you missed the exam

409
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,640
No point even if you're grumbling here

410
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,200
You?

411
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,360
Me?

412
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,320
At the beginning,

413
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,400
I told the school that

414
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,800
I want the top student,

415
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,720
but they want to follow the procedure

416
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:29,600
At the end,

417
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,440
the student of Mathematics
got the highest mark

418
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,080
Now they tell me...

419
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:36,720
Professor

420
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,120
She is not Gu Wei Yi

421
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,880
She is Gu Wei Yi's girlfriend

422
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,760
What are you

423
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,720
doing here?

424
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,600
Tell your boyfriend

425
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,960
No matter who plead with me,

426
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,440
he must show me his ability
to take part in my project

427
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,680
Prof. Jiang, you meant
you only believe the ability?

428
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,480
That's right

429
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,520
You never see

430
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,800
my boyfriend's ability

431
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,240
How could you know
if he is the top student?

432
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,160
He is number 1 in Physics school

433
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,440
Don't you feel regret
if you don't test him？

434
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,480
That's right

435
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,600
He is the top student of Physics
school for continuous 3 years

436
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,120
If he is taken away
by other professor...

437
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,120
Well

438
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,360
I have a set of papers
of graduation examination

439
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,320
Let him do the test

440
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,880
I want to see

441
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,040
his level

442
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:23,960
Thank you

443
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,120
Okay

444
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:25,760
Mr. Xu, I'm off

445
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:26,800
See you

446
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,240
Mo Mo

447
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,800
You're here for me?

448
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,280
What a lucky day!

449
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,680
I need your favour

450
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,200
What's it?

451
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,800
I will do anything for you

452
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,760
Help me look for Gu Wei Yi

453
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,480
What is it about?

454
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,400
I wrongly took his bag that day

455
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,960
That's right

456
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,400
He forgot his student card
and gave up on the selection

457
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,960
You knew it?

458
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,560
Yeah, what's wrong?

459
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,400
I feel guilty

460
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,800
as it is related to me

461
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,120
You're so kind

462
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,080
It's only an accident.
Don't take it to heart

463
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,480
I got a set of papers from Prof. Jiang

464
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,360
for him.

465
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,920
He might have a chance

466
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,000
You don't know him

467
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,520
I'm sure he will talk about

468
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,400
fair and square

469
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,840
I can't convince him

470
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:30,800
Look for him

471
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,200
and I can convince him

472
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,280
Don't you believe me?

473
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,880
You'll know it later

474
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,640
I knew where is he now

475
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,360
Let's look for him

476
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,920
Mo Mo

477
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,600
What's wrong?

478
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,080
Do you think Gu Wei Yi

479
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,080
is handsome?

480
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:54,880
Forget it

481
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,280
Forget it, hurry.

482
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,560
Does he look like Cyclops

483
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,120
of The X-men?

484
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,440
Cut the crap

485
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,920
Slowly

486
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,800
Why are you here?

487
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,000
I have a set of papers of
Physics graduation exam

488
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,880
How did  you get it?

489
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,280
I met Prof. Jiang today

490
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,240
Prof. Jiang gave me the paper

491
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,760
None of your business

492
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,680
Stop doing the useless things!
Not your concern!

493
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,880
Prof. Jiang said,

494
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,800
he doesn't care about
the student like you

495
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,320
He said,

496
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,880
there is a top student
of Physics in every year

497
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,720
The first place is just nothing

498
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,360
Not many people can follow the
path of scientific research because

499
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,200
it needs the sharpest brain

500
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,800
and calmest heart

501
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,160
To him,

502
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,720
you're not qualified

503
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,800
I think Gu Wei Yi can...

504
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,880
I told him the same

505
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,080
So,

506
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,360
Prof. Jiang gave me the paper

507
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,080
The paper was prepared
for the graduation examination

508
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,440
It's high level and tough

509
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,600
He wanted to test your level

510
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,800
I said no! Gu Wei Yi is only
an undergraduate student

511
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,040
How can he do the graduation exam?

512
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,080
That's right

513
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,840
Prof. Jiang is trying to trouble you

514
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:55,880
That's right

515
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,000
Prof. Jiang never expected you

516
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,040
to complete the examination

517
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,440
Thank you

518
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,360
I haven't finished

519
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,840
What? You haven't finished?

520
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,640
So sorry

521
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,600
Done?

522
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,320
This is the first time I see you smile

523
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,160
Calculation makes me happy

524
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,520
Fu Pei

525
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,200
I don't want to eat that

526
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,720
He's done, let's go

527
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,880
-Let's go
-No...

528
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,200
Let's go

529
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,200
Done?

530
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,120
Let's eat something

531
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,520
Let's go for a steamboat

532
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,120
Let's go

533
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,440
Xuan Xuan

534
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,040
Will you come tomorrow?

535
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,480
I'm telling you in advanced

536
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,520
Didn't you say your buddy is strong?

537
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,760
Bring him along.

538
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,440
Let's have a match

539
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,520
Beauty

540
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,560
Will you come for the match tomorrow?

541
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,800
Fairy

542
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,320
Will you come tomorrow?

543
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,600
Let's play together again

544
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,160
For the dual fight

545
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,800
Look You're quiet when I
talk about basket ball

546
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,200
Are you afraid to lose?

547
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:06,880
Thank you

548
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,520
Thank you

549
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,040
Welcome

550
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,600
-Your drinks
-Thank you

551
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,360
Your girlfriend drinks beer?

552
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,199
She's not my girlfriend

553
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,159
She'll pass

554
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,120
I want beer

555
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,280
Mo Mo

556
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,640
Eat something, stop drinking the beer

557
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,840
Don't you know why I drink so much?

558
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,360
I don't know, that's why I asked you

559
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,600
You really like to act

560
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,240
Fu Pei

561
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,360
What kind of girls you like?

562
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:37,880
Why?

563
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,880
Want to get one for me?

564
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,400
There are many girls in
your school, get one for me

565
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:44,880
Okay

566
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,960
I will get a silly girl for you

567
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,760
Are you Gu Wei Yi?

568
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,560
Are you on a date with Si Tu?

569
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,480
That's right

570
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,000
Okay, carry on

571
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,320
I'm okay

572
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,720
You can't even walk properly

573
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,560
Fu Pei

574
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,120
What's wrong?

575
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,560
You're so ugly

576
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,720
Since you're so ugly,
I want to stop my crush on you

577
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,240
You're drunk

578
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,360
Bull shit

579
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,080
What's the relationship
between you and Mo Mo?

580
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,720
You asked me to accompany
Si Tu Mo to an interview

581
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,320
and we met Mr. Xu on the way

582
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,680
He wanted me to meet Prof. Jiang

583
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,720
So I lied that I was having a date with
Si Tu Mo just to chase him away

584
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
You have done the paper

585
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,840
Why did you lie again?

586
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,680
To give you a lesson

587
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,520
What do you mean?

588
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,240
You are trying to
avoid Si Tu Mo's feeling

589
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,560
We're just friends

590
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,400
Is it?

591
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,120
Then what makes you question me now?

592
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,360
Well

593
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,040
Stay away from Mo Mo

594
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,560
I'm alright

595
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,280
You should ask yourself

596
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,880
Can you control me?

597
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,560
Don't be sad

598
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,360
That's right

599
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,640
He's a scum

600
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,920
Alright, cheer up

601
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,680
Don't cry

602
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,240
Enough

603
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,920
No

604
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,680
Will you get together with
Fu Pei after the graduation?

605
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,920
We will not be together

606
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,800
Mo Mo

607
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,880
Mo Mo, I didn't mean it

608
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,160
I just want to cut the crap

609
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,920
We're going to graduate soon anyway

610
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,640
Are you afraid?

611
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,000
I don't have to

612
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,000
I'm not afraid

613
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,720
Mo Mo

614
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,440
Forget it

615
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,600
Just forget it

616
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,440
I said it merely as a joke

617
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,280
The girl grabbed Fu Pei

618
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,000
Here is she

619
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,800
Don't be angry

620
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,080
I knew you aren't serious
and it's merely a joke

621
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,120
But I thought I could make you changed

622
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,040
Sorry

623
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,600
I was too cocky

624
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,040
Not that serious

625
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,560
Forget our promise then

626
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,800
I just simply promised it

627
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,840
Simply promised it

628
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,360
Okay

629
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:39,920
I simply asked it too

630
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,480
Now we reach a consensus

631
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,120
So we're just friends later

632
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,160
Do you really lack of friends?

633
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,800
-Where are you going?
-Not your concern!

634
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,240
Mo Mo

635
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,080
Don't you want to go?

636
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,320
No way

637
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,200
There will be one more video
on the school forum later

638
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,280
What video?

639
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,880
What say you?

640
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,400
The military training

641
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:31,480
Attention!

642
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:33,960
Stand at ease

643
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,640
Sir

644
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,600
I want to be your student

645
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,840
Why?

646
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,600
Because you are one of

647
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,520
the greatest physicians in the world

648
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,800
Your effort in the human development

649
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,800
made the decisive catalyst effect

650
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,040
Since you admire me so much,

651
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,000
do you know my name?

652
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,120
The greatest

653
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,200
Albert Einstein
