Gu Wei Yi

7
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,620
You bring a conch?

8
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,060
I'm late!

9
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:23,540
I...

10
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:35,340
Go away

11
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:37,620
What are you doing?

12
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,580
Going to work,
I'm going to be late

13
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,140
I took a day off for you

14
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,220
Really?

15
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,020
Yeah

16
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,500
I'm going back to bed now

17
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,540
What's on your neck?

18
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,340
Rash, I have an allergy to alcoholic

19
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,660
Then why did you drink so much?

20
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:07,140
I didn't drink it on purpose

21
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,980
You're drunk without me, huh?

22
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,540
What's your mind?

23
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,060
It's part of my work

24
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,340
I promise I'll never drink it again

25
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,540
Even if they kill me or fire me

26
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,980
Your face looks like an
answer sheet and smell of booze

27
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,180
Is it?

28
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,460
Don't ever attend the occasion again

29
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,660
Don't mix up with the guy

30
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:29,700
Remember?

31
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,420
Go take a shower

32
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:34,820
I'm going to buy breakfast

33
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,660
I want the deep-fried
bread stick from the first shop

34
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,020
and the peanut soy milk

35
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,140
of the third shop

36
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,260
Not soybean soy milk

37
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:42,860
Take a shower

38
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,100
Yes, sir

39
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:08,940
You're back?

40
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,580
You bought the peanut soy milk?

41
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:12,940
Yeah

42
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,900
Let's dig in

43
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:17,940
Wait a minute

44
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:24,620
What are you washing?

45
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,660
Take your breakfast, I'll help you

46
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:30,860
What's wrong?

47
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:34,660
This is...

48
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,020
This is my...

49
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:37,620
Yes, I know

50
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,660
It dropped, so I wash it again

51
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,380
No need

52
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,300
It's okay

53
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,660
You have washed it before, right?

54
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,700
It's not dirty

55
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,300
Alright

56
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,300
Let's dig in

57
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:18,900
Do you want it?

58
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,020
No

59
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,060
Soy milk?

60
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,260
No

61
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,940
I have a younger brother

62
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,580
I used to hang all the clothes
in my home, I'm used to it

63
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,740
So, you don't have to be shy

64
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,180
I have no evil thought

65
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,300
We slept on a same bed before

66
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,540
Nothing happened, right?

67
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,860
There's no difference
between you and my brother

Gu Wei Yi

74
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,420
Master!

75
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,940
Madam is calling you

76
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,700

Circle

79
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,340
Stop it

80
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:59,860
Yes, sir

81
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:14,940
Circle...

82
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,100
How can Circle talk?

83
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,620
I modified it

Gu Wei Yi...

86
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:34,980
What are you doing?

87
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,700
I'm having Hypoglycemia

88
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,580
You are too weak

89
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:11,740
You fainted due to Hypoglycemia, huh?

90
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,940
And you don't even like to exercise

91
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,700
No difference between you and my brother

92
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,740
I didn't say anything

93
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,060
I'm warning you

94
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,820
Don't say that again

95
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,060
There's a difference

96
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,660
Must be a difference

97
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,620
What's the difference?

98
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,660
You...

99
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,020
You...

100
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,180
You managed to modify the robot

101
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,420
My brother can't

102
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,440
What's up?

103
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,280
What do you want to eat?

104
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,800
Let's go out and talk

105
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,160
Why not you wait in your room?

106
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,560
I'll call you when the noodle is ready

107
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,000
I want to see you cooking

108
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,720
It takes some time to boil the water

109
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,480
Why not...

110
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,080
I'll wait right here

111
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:05,760
Okay

112
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,680

00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,560
Reading the thesis

117
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,400
You should watch it in the kitchen

118
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,960
It's not boiling yet, I'm watching it

119
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,840
How did you watch it in the room?

120
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,560
Come and take a look

121
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,800
Never mind, I'll go to the kitchen

122

What do you want?

123
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:24,960
Take it

124
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:39,920
It is boiling

When is my oral defense?

136
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:30,760
Are you asking me?

137
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,280
I'm talking to myself

138
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,960
I'm wondering if you could

139
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,120
have your graduation

140
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,240

How's it going on?

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,600
What did they ask?

145
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,080
The lecturer said, "Since you
have changed to another field,

146
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,160
I won't embarrass you then"

147
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,240
He only asked several questions

148
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,360
Can I change to another field now?

149
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,280
It's too late

I'll see Gu Wei Yi's oral defense

We are poor

Who cares?

159
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:18,760
No way

160
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,520
I don't care

161
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,080
How do you prove the relation

162
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,840
between the viscosity and the
molecular weight by experiment?

163
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,360

"Like the sunny day we just met"

176
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,560
"The little time of aromatic"

177
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:17,280
"Growing naturally in noise"

178
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,760
"Greeting you in happiness"

179
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:26,240
"It's worth to keeping it forever"

180
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:27,960
Now

181
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,040
Why did you choose the physical direction
of high polymer as your research topics?

182
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,840
Because my lecturer spoil

183
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,840
the Ubbelohde viscometer in the class

184
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,320
So I tried to improve it

185
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,520
Gu Wei Yi

186
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,000
Do you see any deficiency in your thesis?

187
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,840
Was it too simple?

188
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,840
Since it's an unpopular topic,

189
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,400
you'd better don't ask

190
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,600
Alright

191
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,880
Do you guys

192
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,080
has any question

193
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,000
about the thesis of Gu Wei Yi?

194
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,320
Please bring it out

195
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,360
I...

196
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,080
Your oral defense ends here

197
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,800
Alright, thank you

198
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,400
Whom are you calling?

199
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:44,960
Is it fun?

200
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,080
Yeah

201
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,320
Let's go for lunch

202
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,600
Shan Shan wants you to buy them a meal

203
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,640
Can I just pay the bill?

204
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,040
What do you think?

205
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,560
Can

206
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,600
No way

207
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,080
Let's go

208
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,000
Are all the dishes served?

209
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:06,680
Not yet

210
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,360
What?

211
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:08,640
Just a minute

212
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,680
It's too much

213
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,200
It's expensive, do you
have enough money?

214
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,080
Enough

215
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,360
I've figured it out

216
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,640
What?

217
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,400
Mo Mo

218
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,840
Meng Lu

219
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,720
It seems

220
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,960
Gu Wei Yi is richer than Fu Pei
who's a child of a rich family

221
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,360
Don't just stand here

222
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:34,920
Sit down

223
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,360
Mo Mo

224
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,200
You know me well

225
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,680
Gu Wei Yi

226
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,640
All the foods here

227
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,200
made my day

228
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,080
We can't finish all the food here

229
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,360
Young people

230
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,280
never say no to the delicious food

231
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,360
Moreover, we can take it
away if we can't finish it

232
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,040
Niu Niu, I thought you're on diet

233
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,400
Didn't you hear it before?

234
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,360
Eat and drink properly

235
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,720
could deceive your body

236
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,440
that you're still the fatty

237
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,480
So, it will give you
the same metabolic rate

238
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,160
Or the metabolic rate will drop

239
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,240
Alright, stop talking

240
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:20,720
Dig in

241
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:21,760
Let's dig in

242
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,160
Eat more

243
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,240
Come here when you're done over there

244
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,150
"Okay"

245
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,760
Don't be surprised, dig in

246
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,880
Have you come here before?

247
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:58,480
No

248
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,920
The environment is good

249
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,240
It's comfortable

250
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,600
Hey, stop playing with your phone

251
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,680
This is your school mate,

252
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,760
Lu Jian Shi

253
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,600
Xiao Lu is the pillar of the country

254
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,720
She studied abroad

255
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,000
Specializing in the
study of Mechanic Quantum

256
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,120
It's Quantum Mechanic

257
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,680
Let's order first

258
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:25,800
Let's order

259
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,440
Waitress

260
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,480
What's the most expensive food here?

261
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,600
I have a VIP guest today

262
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,320
Fish

263
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,680
How can fish be the most expensive?
Are you sure?

264
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,160
Call your manager

265
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:41,840
Sir

266
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,680
All of our fish

267
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,760
are imported from Canada

268
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,680
I don't care where it came from

269
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,280
I want the most expensive dish

270
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,680
RMB3,800 for every 50 g

271
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,520
It's too expensive

272
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:58,880
Thank you

273
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,160
Give us 500g of the fish

274
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,160
Jian Shi

275
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,400
Are you okay with the fish?

276
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,720
Okay

277
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,880
Then we should order

278
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,600
the fish today

279
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,720
It can express my father's love to you

280
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,000
Am I right?

281
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,680
Give me a fish of 500 g

282
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:28,920
Bill please

283
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:29,800
Wait a minute

284
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,400
The total is RMB3,453

285
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,560
Sorry?

286
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,520
RMB3,453

287
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,440
Why is it so expensive?

288
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,560
Are you cheating us?

289
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:41,560
Miss

290
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,320
Do you want to check the bill?

291
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:43,800
No need

292
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,760
Why not?

293
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,960
Must be something's wrong

294
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,440
Red wine, RMB899

295
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,040
Snowflake beef, RMB298

296
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,280
Grenadier Anchovy, RMB1,100

297
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,040
This...

298
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,040
What fish is that?

299
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,280
Grenadier Anchovy

300
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,360
The sweet sour fish

301
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,040
which is all pineapple
mixed with 4-5 pieces of fish?

302
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,400
RMB7,800 per 500 g?

303
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,320
Gu Wei Yi

304
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,120
Are you crazy?

305
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,040
RMB7,800 per 500 g?

306
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:16,880
Miss

307
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,440
It is not so expensive

308
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,160
The restaurant next to us is
selling the fish at RM3,800 per 50 g

309
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,320
which is imported from Canada

310
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,080
I don't want to make you feel
that I'm stingy to your friends

311
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,240
And it's not the most costly one

312
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,120
If you did it, I'll demolish
Circle when I'm home

313
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,560
Sir

314
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:39,520
Miss

315
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,240
Can you pay the bill now?

316
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,840
Still want to check the bill?

317
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:44,880
No need

318
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,320
Do you have enough money?
I have some money here

319
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,080
Enough

320
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,120
I have figured it out

321
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,560
-Can I use WeChat Pay?
-Sure

322
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,280
You have made a payment of
RMB3,453 with the card

323
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,080
ends with 071 at 8 pm, 8th June

324
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,680
The balance of credit is RMB0.12

325
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,120
You calculation is just nice

326
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,440
We're busy eating the fish

327
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,040
and I didn't even introduce

328
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,080
my son to you

329
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,760
He's studying Management in
the same university with you

330
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,160
His result is good and
plays well in basketball too

331
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,000
But I have a girlfriend

332
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,360
And she's prettier than you

333
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,680
She is more beautiful

334
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,080
Hello, uncle

335
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:41,880
Hello

336
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,040
Let me introduce her to you

337
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,800
My girlfriend

338
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:55,720
Wang Shan

339
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,040
Nonsense!

340
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,320
I disagree with it

341
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,400
Not your concern

342
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:05,560
Didn't the education of China
teach you how to respect each other?

343
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,120
Respect to each other?

344
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,760
Miss Lu, I couldn't believe my ears

345
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,880
Did you think of respect
when you ate the costly fish?

346
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,520
It seems the respect
you learn abroad is worthless

347
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,840
It was a nice meal

348
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:21,680
Luxury

349
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,400
I'm satisfied too

350
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,440
My girlfriend and I will leave first

351
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,520
Stop!

352
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,600
How dare you

353
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,800
walk out from here?

354
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,960
How dare you!

355
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,400
Are you okay?

356
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:48,720
I'm okay

357
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,320
Look at yourself

358
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,320
Where is your manhood?

359
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,320
Why do I have a useless son like you?

360
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,480
Uncle

361
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,160
You are in bad mood today

362
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,560
So I won't introduce myself first

363
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,800
We'll visit you next time

364
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,360
Let's go

365
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,200
Fu Pei

366
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,800
Fu Pei

367
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:30,760
What's wrong?

368
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:33,840
Nothing

369
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,600
I just feel funny

370
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,040
Didn't you see my dad's face?

371
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,640
He's pissed off

372
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,920
Did I just go too far?

373
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,680
When I saw your dad's attitude...

374
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,440
I...

375
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,560
It's okay

376
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,680
Very good

377
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,400
Let's go

378
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,320
I'm hungry

379
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,240
Drink it

380
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,000
I don't want to drink it

381
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,520
I can't drink it anymore

382
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,240
I think we're going to die,
if we go on like this

383
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,080
Eat the instant noodle then

384
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,000
How dare you!

385
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,520
You spent all your monthly
allowance just for a meal

386
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,400
That is our last noodle

387
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,840
I'll get the scholarship
before graduation

388
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,600
Can't you just spend my money?

389
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,040
No way

390
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,040
Well, what are we going to eat

391
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,880
before you get the scholarship?

392
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,320
I'll figure it out

393
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:28,080
If we don't eat that noodle,
we can't hold until the photo shooting

394
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,120
Alright

395
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,840
It smells good.

396
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,160
There is a surprise too

397
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,240
Where did you get it?

398
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,480
I found it stuck in the seam of the
fridge when I was taking the noodle

399
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,640
So I cooked it

400
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,360
For you

401
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,520
For you

402
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,040
For you

403
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,280
Only one, you take it

404
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,560
You eat, I'm not hungry

405
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,000
Take...

406
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,920
Don't waste it

407
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,120
Let's dig in

408
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,280
Eat the vegetable

409
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,040
Eat more

410
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,160
Delicious

411
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:04,800
Tasty?

412
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,400
Where's the egg?

413
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,080
Where's the egg?

414
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,320
Where's the egg?

415
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,720
Eat the noodle

416
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:27,760
Eat more

417
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,400
Drink more soup to fill your stomach

418
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,040
Delicious

419
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,960
-Can you wear a tie?
-Em...

420
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,840
I was thinking to ask you too

421
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,640
The technique in the video is almost
same with wearing the red scarf

422
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,040
Should be like this

423
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,360
Isn't that right?

424
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,600
It goes around like this again

425
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,560
Like this

426
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,440
Like this

427
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,120
Just tie it up, it's going to be late

428
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,640
Don't rush me, I can do it

429
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,040
It looks like a tie shape

430
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,080
Alright

431
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,160
Alright

432
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,400
Yes, I made it

433
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,720
-Let me wear it for you
-I will ask Lu Lu to help me

434
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,400
Let's go

435
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,880
[Welcome to the Graduate of 2018]

436
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:20,240
[Study hard even after the graduation]

437
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:26,220
[Don't eat too much in the future]

438
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,690
[Goodbye and good luck in everything]

439
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,840
Don't always stay up late

440
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,130
[Sleep early even no one switch
off the light for you in the future]

441
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,960
Lu Lu, are you looking forward

442
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,720
to see Ke in the bachelor's robe?

443
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,320
He showed me his selfie

444
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,760
I'm looking forward

445
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,440
to see Gu Wei Yi and Fu Pei
in the bachelor's robe

446
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,600
Two of them

447
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,480
are handsome and tall

448
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,000
Must be good-looking

449
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,080
Look at Mo Mo's man,
don't look at mine

450
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:54,960
I want to look at him

451
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,280
-Me too
-I want to see both of them

452
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,200
Shan Shan

453
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,280
Fu Pei

454
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,000
Shan Shan

455
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,440
Is this the hottest man in the campus?

456
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,680
He looks like a stupid

457
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:11,360
-Who looks like a stupid?
-You

458
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:11,760
Gosh!

459
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,360
Gosh!

460
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,200
Gosh!

461
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:13,880
Gosh!

462
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,160
-I have something for you
-What's that?

463
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:21,600
Surprise?

464
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:23,240
Does it hurt your chest?

465
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,080
Yes

466
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:25,160
But I can hold it

467
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,760
You're annoying

468
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:28,040
-As long as you're happy
-Does it hurt?

469
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:29,120
Lu Lu

470
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:30,990
Lu Lu, help me to wear the tie

471
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,430
Hold it for me

472
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,120
Can you do it?

473
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:36,040
Sure

474
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,470
Why are you all in
the bachelor's robe?

475
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:39,800
I have taken for you

476
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,880
-I'll change it
Let's take picture in the lab

477
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,160
Okay

478
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,200
See you there

479
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:50,990
-Can you do it?
-Sure

480
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,040
I'm going to the lab first

481
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,200
See you later

482
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:53,640
Okay

483
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:55,760
Wait

484
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,760
I have a graduation photo program here

485
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,400
So we won't miss
every memory of the scenery

486
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,960
I found that you have
a better planning nowadays

487
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,520
Of course

488
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,280
You teach me well

489
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:09,640
Let me see

490
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,520
I made an electronic version,
I'll send it to all of you later

491
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,640
Zhou Lei kept pushing me, I'm off

492
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,200
Okay

493
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,320
See you

494
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:16,920
Bye

495
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,160
Why is your boyfriend leaving?

496
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,680
Did he hide a girl in the lab?

497
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,600
You're right

498
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,440
I heard there's

499
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,080
a pretty senior in their lab

500
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,440
Lu Lu

501
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,720
What kind of pretty girl in the lab?

502
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,320
I swear

503
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,480
I'm just curious about it

504
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,720
She seems

505
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,000
to like Gu Wei Yi very much

506
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,520
It's not what you think

507
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:43,520
Mo Mo

508
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,320
You're so sensible now

509
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,120
Gu Wei Yi didn't
even give you a flower

510
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,080
That's right

511
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,200
Look at Fu Pei

512
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,320
He's willing to get hurt
because of Wang Shan

513
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,480
He just didn't think about it

514
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,120
You have no flower too

515
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,920
I have it inside my heart

516
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,160
-In the heart
-In the heart?

517
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,440
Alright, let's go

518
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,400
Let's go

519
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,520
Let's take photo!

520
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,040
-Shan Shan
-Let's go for photos

521
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,440
Sit tight

522
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,120
Okay

523
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:08,920
You are so heavy

524
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,470
[Here comes the Easter egg...]

525
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:36,900
It's really full

526
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,940
We'll take the graduation photo soon

527
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,420
If you keep eating, I won't
help you to edit the photo

528
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,940
I'll let Mo Mo to help me then

529
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,180
Sorry to make you spent
so much on the meal

530
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:50,700
We just asked for the barbecue

531
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,500
We've never thought you're so generous

532
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:55,940
Since you're so generous to us,
we should tell you something

533
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:57,820
Help!

534
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,980
-Shan Shan, hands off!
-Si Tu Mo's ear

535
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,260
are very sensitive

536
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,780
It's worthy to buy us meal

537
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,100
-What did you say?
-Nothing

538
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,100
I leave first

539
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,260
Thank you for the meal

540
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:11,700
Be careful

541
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,460
Okay

542
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,660
What they said?

543
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,020
Nothing

544
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,180
Nothing?

545
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,620
What did they tell you?

546
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:20,940
Nothing

547
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,500
I don't believe it

548
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:24,740
Stop asking

549
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,340
What makes you blush then?

550
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:32,300
From the physiologically,
the secretion of adrenaline will cause

551
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,980
blood flow into
the capillaries of skin

552
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,580
The dilated capillaries...

553
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,820
All right, stop it
