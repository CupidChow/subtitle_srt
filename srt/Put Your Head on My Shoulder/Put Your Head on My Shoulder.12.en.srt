00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,660
Hello, Mo Mo

9
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:02,820
Hello, Shan Shan

10
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,260
What should I cook for a person

11
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,140
who has a fever?

12
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,700
Porridge

13
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:09,860
Who has a fever?

14
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,340
Gu Wei Yi

15
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,300
My mom used to cook this way

16
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,580
First, wash the rice

17
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,300
Put little oil and salt

18
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,420
into the rice

19
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,020
Put dried tangerine peel
in cold water and boil it

20
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,820
Put the rice in after it's boiled

21
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,660
When the water bubbled up again,

22
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,140
turn it to medium or low heat

23
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,860
Make sure it doesn't stick to the pot

24
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,700
When it's almost done,
take out the peel

25
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,860
Forget it, let him starve to death

26
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,220
He doesn't need the porridge anyway

27
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,820
It sounds complicated

28
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,380
In fact, it's simple

29
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,700
Come and help me

30
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,020
Okay

31
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,380
See you soon

32
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:55,860
Don't pretend sleeping

33
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:57,940
Gu Wei Yi is sick

34
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,180
Not my concern

35
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,300
Don't you want to visit him
or go to his house?

36
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,220
Mo Mo doesn't want to see me

37
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:12,900
I went to see her a few days ago,
he told me not to turn up again

38
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,420
That's why you're
getting mad in the court

39
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,700
Have you guys made it clear?

40
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,340
She didn't give me the chance

41
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,460
Alright, I'll bring you there

42
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:39,900
Sleeping?

43
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:43,820
No

44
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,860
You want some water, right?

45
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,020
Check your temperature

46
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:13,980
Where are you going?

47
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,250
Remind me when it's done

48
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,050
I'll check it out in 10 minutes

49
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,460
How is it?

50
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:15,820
We must go to the hospital

51
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,300
No way

52
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,740
You're having a high fever

53
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,100
-I've taken the pills
-No way, let's go to the hospital

54
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,340
No way

55

Gu Wei Yi

56
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,220
Gu Wei Yi

57
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,580
-Why do you bring him along?
-I need a helper

58
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,540
You bought the dried tangerine peel?

59
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,740
You told me you'll bring it

60
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,220
That's right, I'll go and get it now

61
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,380
Shan Shan

62
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,940
Cut it out

63
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,580
You two go and buy it

64
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,740
I'll wash the rice first

65
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,420
It's okay, I'll go myself

66
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,220
Hurry up

67
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:33,620
Hello

68
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,540
Hello, Aunt Xu

69

Si Tu

70
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:37,500
What's up?

71
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,460
Am I disturbing you?

72
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,220
No

73
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:41,740
Alright

74
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,340
I just want to tell you

75
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,260
Xiao Yi

76
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,580
gets sick easily when
the weather changes

77
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,620
How has he been recently?

78
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,180
He is in a fever,
but refused to go to hospital

79
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,340
What's the temperature?

80
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:54,660
Is it high?

81
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,860
38.3 Celsius

82
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,420
Over 38 Celsius

83
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,660
It's alright

84
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,700
He used to have a fever at 39 Celsius

85
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,820
Give him medicine and let him take a rest

86
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,420
Can you advise him to go to hospital?

87
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,380
Xiao Yi scares of injection

88
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:10,820
Scares of injection?

89
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,820
So he never goes to any hospital

90
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,100
It's better check it out in the hospital

91
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,380
I'm not going to convince him

92
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,260
He's terrible

93
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,700
when he gets mad

94
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,340
Don't make him angry

95
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,220
Alright

96
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,220
Don't worry

97
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,860
Thank you

98
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,340
Alright

99
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:29,780
Bye

100
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,060
Nothing to be scared
when Gu Wei Yi gets mad

101
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,540
He just looks unfriendly

102
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:39,780
That's right

103
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,900
Gu Wei Yi never gets mad

104
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,140
Gu Wei Yi scares of injection

105
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,180
How did he get injections before?

106
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,500
Do you remember?

107
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:56,940
When we got injection in high school,
a fat guy stood in front of you

108
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,660
He suddenly fainted and fell on you

109
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,500
In fact, you stood in front of me

110
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,060
You ran away when he fainted

111
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,500
That's why he fell on me

112
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,260
Think so

113
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,380
-But I did help to bring him up
-That's crap!

114
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,540
You're laughing out loud there

115
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:15,940
Was I?

116
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,820
Fu Pei, I have stopped my feeling on you

117
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,100
I know

118
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,420
It's good that you knew it

119
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,260
Of course I knew,
you treated me like a ghost

120
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,380
I'd rather see a ghost than you

121

Si Tu Mo

122
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,100
Can we go back to the past?

123
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,460
Why do you want to do so?

124
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,700
Did we have any good memory in the past?

125

128
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,460
You should go to hell!

129
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,220
Why do you come out? Getting better?

130
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,660
-Where is Fu Pei?-
Just left

131
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:35,020
-Where is Shan Shan?
-Just left

132
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:36,740
So fast

133
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,020
I was hoping to talk to her

134
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,220
About what?

135
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,540
Nothing

136
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:42,980
I bought the dried tangerine peel

137
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,100
Let me boil some porridge

No need

139
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,980

after the medicine

Are you awake?

145
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:49,860
Anything?

146
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,540
Are you getting better?

147
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:55,580
Yes

148
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,860
Check the temperature again

No need

150
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,580
I cooked some porridge,
do you want to have some?

151
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,900
Or I bring it here?

00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,340

No

I'm off today

159
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,940
What do you want for lunch? Let's cook

No need, I'll call the food delivery

Why are you here?

I'm worried that someone
might let me down

174
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,740
I have taught you so hard

175
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,020
If you skip the exam,

176
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,060
you'll let me down

177
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:43,700
Wang Shan

178
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,100
-I...
-Room 602

179
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,940
Go straight and turn left

180
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,420
I have checked it out for you

181
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,900
All the tools you need are in the bag

182
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,620
We need to talk after the exam

183
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:08,020
Please enter the room
as soon as possible!

184
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,660
Go ahead

185
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,020
Recheck it thoroughly

186
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,420
Don't pass up before time's up

187
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,780
I'll wait outside

188
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,140
You're like my mother

189
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:19,820
Go

190
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,220
Fu Pei

191
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:33,900
Good luck!

192
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,740
Crazy

193
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,060
Recheck it thoroughly

194
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,820
Don't pass up before time's up

195
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,180
I'll wait outside

196
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,980
He really called the food delivery

197
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,540
Senior

198
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,140
My team members asked me
to come and visit Gu Wei Yi

199
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,020
And I bring over his shipment too

200
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,620
Please come in

201
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,460
Wait a moment

202
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:07,980
Gu Wei Yi

203
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,500
Your senior is here

204
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,140
-Why are you here?
-You have a shipment in the lab

205
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,820
And Zhou Lei asked me
to check your condition

206
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,340
and he'll consider to
let you back to the lab

207
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,860
Are you getting better today?

208
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:39,660
I'm alright

209
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,740
I'll clean the table

210
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,180
Let me help you

211
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,260
Thank you

212
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,700
Are you doing an experiment?

213
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,660
My company has an
ads project of orange juice

214
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,420
So I tried to look into
the others brands

215
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,500
Do I disturb you?

216
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,660
It's alright

217
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,500
-What's this?
-What's this?

218
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,180
Microscope

219
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,060
I know, what is it for?

220
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,380
Polarized?

221
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,460
-Can it connect to computer?
-Yes

222
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,020
Two-way synchronous
magnification calibration function

223
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:18,980
Let me see

224
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:20,700
Take a look

225
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,340
What is the greatest zoom?

226
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,500
2540 times

227
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,500
So clear

228
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:38,060
You want to use it to see the
sphaero crystal of Polypropylene?

229
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,580
Why don't you use the one in the lab?

230
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,460
In fact, Prof. Jiang asked me
to order it for the lab

231
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:46,580
But you brought it over

232
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,380
I shouldn't have brought it over

233
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,780
It's quite heavy

234
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,500
I'll bring it to the lab tomorrow

235
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,300
What about other functions?

236
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,980
It's more advanced than the one in lab

237
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,260
Senior, where is Gu Wei Yi?

238
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,540
He go get changed

239
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,460
We're going out for a meal
Do you want to join us?

240
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,380
Let's go

241
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,020
I'm asking Si Tu Mo to join us

242
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:45,900
Want to join?

243
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,500
I'll pass, enjoy yourselves

244
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,580
I'm so hungry

245
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,780
I just finished a pot of porridge

246
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,740
So happy

247
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,420
Sir, enjoy your food

248
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,260
I thought you don't like
spicy food, all these...

249
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,780
Si Tu Mo always ordered these
when we're here, I'm used to it

250
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,860
Moreover, it's not spicy

251
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,380
Dig in

252
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,380
Fatty has no future

253
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,700
No food, no future

254
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,420
I thought Gu Wei Yi's sick
Why did you finish the porridge?

255
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,780
Still chatting, huh?

256
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,420
Your thesis was rejected

257
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,700
Quickly come back, we need to talk

258
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,220
Senior

259
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,820
I have to go first

260
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:03,940
Take your time

261
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,020
It's on me, thanks for
bringing me the shipment

262
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,100
So fast? You guys should chat more

263
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,820
-Where are you going?
-Dump

264
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,580
Tear off the consignment note

265
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,300
-There's personal information
-Okay

266
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,580
This is a shipment to the lab

267
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,700
in the new campus?

268
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,100
Aren't you working in the old campus?

269
00:22:59,060 --> 00:22:59,780
Hello, senior

270
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:15,420
Okay

271
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,460
It is handled by Zhou Lei

272
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:35,620
Senior

273
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,300
I don't know about it

274
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:46,860
Say it

275
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,180
What?

276
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:54,100
You said you wanted to talk to me

277
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,260
I don't know how to put it

278
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,660
Fu Pei, I don't want to carry on it

279
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,900
Because I really like you

280
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,140
Don't interrupt

281
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,180
I say nothing

282
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,420
But the more I like you,

283
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,060
the more I feel humbled

284
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,620
I thought I could

285
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,100
replace Mo Mo

286
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,420
in your heart

287
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,820
Or

288
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:37,740
I could stand by your side
even if you miss her

289
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:38,580
No...

290
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,860
But I found it's tiring

291
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,500
I don't want to continue it

292
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:45,660
Si Tu Mo and I

293
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,300
are just normal friends

294
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,700
But you still like her

295
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,140
No

296
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,180
How could you say it easily?

297
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,420
You're such a fickle guy

298
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,220
I didn't mean it

299
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,420
What do you mean?

300
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,340
I knew what's in my mind

301
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:04,860
But I don't know

302
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,860
how to tell you

303
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:06,980
when I see you

304
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,980
I just feel I should tell you

305
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,860
the shitty things I've been
through in the past 20 years

306
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,660
before becoming who I am now

307
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:39,780
So, you might feel sympathy
to me and forgive me

308
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,060
I want to hold you by my side forever

309
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:53,820
But, I don't know
what to say when I see you

310
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,220
Because you know everything

311
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,500
Be it the English words
I couldn't memorize

312
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,540
or the relationship
between Si Tu Mo and me

313
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,820
You always have a
clearer picture than I do

314
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,340
I feel that I'm full of flaws

315
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,380
by your side,

316
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,020
but you never reveal it

317
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,740
You even mend it secretly

318
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,260
When you said you like me

319
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,500
When you applied the medicine for me

320
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,740
When you helped me with the revision

321
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,620
Even when you asked
me to look for Si Tu Mo

322
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,300
I felt...

323
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:45,940
How could a girl

324
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,300
be so strong like you?

325
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,700
Until I was scolded by Si Tu Mo

326
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,300
that I realized

327
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,780
that I've been making the same mistake

328
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,300
over the years

329
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,620
By assuming you don't like me

330
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,700
I gave myself a chance to escape

331
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,300
I pretended I didn't like you either

332
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,780
so that I could accept the fact
that you didn't like me

333
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,860
Now I want to stop it

334
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,340
Because I like you

335
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,940
I really like you very much

336
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,180
It doesn't matter if
you don't accept me now

337
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,540
I will keep bugging you

338
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,140
The sense of self-respect
and pride are nothing

339
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,980
When you accept me,

340
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,060
you'll surely

341
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,900
mend it and give me back

342
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,980
the pride that I lose

343
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,820
like you always do

344
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,580
Why are you looking at me like that?

345
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,220
Are you serious?

346
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,260
Sure

347
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,700
Say something

348
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,140
What?

349
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,460
Be with me

350
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:37,380
will you?

351
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:54,900
I'll hit myself if you reject me

352
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:16,940
Crazy

353
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,220
Insane

354
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:42,780
Circle

355
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,700
You concern about me?

356
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,020
What happened?

357
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,980
I broke the mug

358
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,100
Let me clean it

359
00:29:59,260 --> 00:29:59,780
No need

360
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,300
What are you doing?

361
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,940
Check if it is clean

362
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,700
I can't beat your senior

363
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,180
She could clean it very well

364
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,020
I meant...

365
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:27,420
She does clean the lab perfectly

366
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,660
But, how did you know?

367
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,020
Go away!

368
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,300
You're disturbing me now!

369
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:43,980
Circle is injured

370
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:45,780
So?

371
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,620
Do you want to take my life?

372
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,380
A girl suddenly gets mad

373
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,660
Collectomania for mugs

374
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,260
Gu Wei Yi

375
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,100
Why do you come empty-handed?

376
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,220
Where's the microscope?

377
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,300
I forgot it

378
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:02,420
What?

379
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:03,860
Forgot it?

380
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,780
How could it be?

381
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,500
How can you forget it?

382
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,780
What's wrong with you?

383
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:09,700
-What's up?
-He...

384
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:10,740
Professor

385
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,820
Gu Wei Yi forgot the microscope

386
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,380
I bet he wanted to steal it

387
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:17,860
Xiao Gu

388
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,340
You seldom forget this kind
of things. What's wrong?

389
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,900
Did the girl see her ex-boyfriend again?

390
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,420
Any updates?

391
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,940
Look like bad news

392
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,100
Think so

393
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,540
Prof. Jiang, what are you
doing? I haven't done it

394
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,300
Look at it

395
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,620
The distance should be calculated from here,

396
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,180
Like this

397
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,340
What's wrong with it?

398
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,140
What were you guys talking about?

399
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,260
Senior

400
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,340
Gu Wei Yi forgot to bring the microscope

401
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,820
It's on your side table
How can you forget it?

402
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,460
You went to his house?

403
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,100
I...

404
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:16,260
Zhou Lei

405
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:18,980
He said Gu Wei Yi was still sick

406
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,500
and didn't allow him to come back, so...

407
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,780
Stop explaining

408
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,980
I knew why you

409
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,500
went to his house

410
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,460
Apparently, you guys
are trying to boycott me

411
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,340
from the scientific research

412
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,650
This is not new

413
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:50,980
It's too bad

414
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,940
That's right

415
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:53,380
You...

416
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:56,300
Xie Yu Yin

417
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,500
Tell me! Why did you boycott me?

418
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,020
Why did you boycott me? What now?

419
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:01,900
What's wrong?

420
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,220
Why?

421
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:03,980
Xiao Gu

422
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,940
Xie Yu Yin went to your house?

423
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,220
Did the girl know about it?

424
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,820
No wonder you can't get her

425
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,780
She's jealous, got it?

426
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:19,740
Jealous?

427
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:26,220
-What are you talking about?
-Nothing, about the data

428
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:27,740
What's that?

429
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,220
Come on

430
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,540
Let me tell you

431
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:33,780
Check the data

432
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,940
Hurry up do the calculation

433
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:37,540
Hurry up

434
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,140
Farther please

435
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,020
That's right

436
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:51,420
Scan here

437
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:51,900
Okay

438
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:52,860
Look thinner

439
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:53,740
Si Tu Mo

440
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,060
Senior

441
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,740
You want to top-up too?

442
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,100
Yes

443
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:01,820
Mo Mo, hurry

444
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:02,540
It's our turn

445
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:10,780
Senior, you go first

446
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,020
It's okay, go ahead

447
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,460
I want to top up RMB100

448
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,740
I'll get the food first, hurry

449
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:16,860
RMB100 please

450
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,100
Take it

451
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:21,980
Thank you

452
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,820
Senior, see you

453
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,580
RMB50, thank you

454
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,980
Who is the girl?

455
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,340
She's quite pretty

456
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,220
Gu Wei Yi's senior,
they are in the same lab

457
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:43,180
So, Gu Wei Yi stays with her every day

458
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:46,780
Aren't you worried?

459
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:49,780
Cut the crap!

460
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:50,940
Worry?

461
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:51,900
Why should I?

462
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,540
You trust him so much, huh?

463
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:56,540
I...

464
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:58,980
Trust him?

465
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,580
Not my concern

466
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,420
Alright then

467
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,620
If I were you,

468
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,180
I'd surely be worried

469
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,340
After all, Gu Wei Yi is good-looking

470
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:13,500
Even if he doesn't fall for her,
she might have a crush on him

471
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,500
I don't like him anyway

472
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:16,940
Not my concern

473
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,540
You can't run from it

474
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,340
You'll be the first to be splashed
by acid as you're staying with Gu Wei Yi

475
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,620
You're so terrible

476
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,380
I'm a bad woman

477
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,300
Men

478
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,940
like bad women

479
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,900
I'm going to buy a meal for Ke

480
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,820
I'll be right back,keep a watch on my phone

481
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,500
I'll be right back

482
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:48,820
Be careful

483
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,140
The bad woman is here

484
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,100
What a coincidence! We meet again

485
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:15,740
Yeah

486
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,580
There's something I'd like to ask

487
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,380
[Here comes the Easter egg...]

488
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,500
Feeling better?

489
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,660
You might think that you're great

490
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:11,140
But I don't admire
your spirit of self-sacrifice

491
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:15,300
And your self-sacrifice affected me

492
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,460
I hope you leave now
