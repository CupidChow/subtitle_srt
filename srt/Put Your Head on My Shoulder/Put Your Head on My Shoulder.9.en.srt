3
00:01:32,195 --> 00:01:32,984
Surprise!

4
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,000
Happy birthday!

5
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,200
It's falling!

6
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,160
Let me see!

7
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,760
Take a selfie with someone you like

[Episode 9]

9
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,760
I'm coming

10
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,280
Who will come during mid night?

11
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,040
What are you doing?

12
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,280
Let me open it

13
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,320
Why do you bring the knife?

14
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,640
A girl shouldn't open
the door during mid night

15
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,360
Who is that?

16
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,560
I'm looking for Mo Mo

17
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,800
Fu Pei

18
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,200
Are you okay?

19
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,040
Shall we talk?

20
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,880
I have something to tell you

21
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,600
Okay

22
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,280
Let's go

23
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,560
Mo Mo

24
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,160
Fu Pei, let me go

25
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,320
Mo Mo, give me one more chance

26
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,880
Get off me

27
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,360
What are you doing?

28
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,680
Take your time

29
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,600
Carry on

30
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,480
I'll leave first

31
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,400
Thank you

32
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,840
Why did Fu Pei look for you?

33
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,440
You're straight to the point, huh?

34
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,240
So?

35
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,920
Why did he look for you?

36
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,440
Gu Wei Yi

37
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,760
You've never been a busybody before

38
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,880
Your mother asked me to look after you

39
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,240
Did she pay you?

40
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,240
Yes

41
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,640
The rental

42
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,680
What were you guys doing out there?

43
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,800
Don't you want to talk to me?

44
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,880
I want to be with you

45
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,320
What?

46
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,280
Let's get together

47
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,400
Forget it, we're not suitable

48
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,960
Why?

49
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,080
Are you falling into Gu...

50
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,440
Someone else?

51
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,360
No

52
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,520
I just stopped loving you

53
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,040
In your heart,

54
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,920
I'm nothing

55
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,920
and you can give up anytime, right?

56
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,280
Why did you stick on me and pretend

57
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,360
that you won't leave me forever?

58
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,320
Did I beg you?

59
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,360
No, I did not

60
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,040
I didn't mean

61
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,000
to stop loving you suddenly

62
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,520
When you told Xu Jie Er

63
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,560
that we're not a couple,

64
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,960
I told myself,

65
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,760
you're protecting me

66
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,480
When you let go of my hand
on the bridge in the school,

67
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,040
I told myself,

68
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,360
you're afraid

69
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,680
Anyone can feel afraid

70
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,560
Every time you promised me

71
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,360
but didn't turn up,

72
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,920
I told myself,

73
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,680
you're too crazy in games

74
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,800
and forgot it

75
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,200
When you smiled

76
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,600
and asked me to get
a girlfriend for you,

77
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,320
I just couldn't convince myself

78
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,480
When I saw you running

79
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,280
out from Gu Wei Yi's house,

80
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,000
I was upset with myself

81
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,960
That day, when I saw
you and Wang Shan...

82
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,080
I suddenly found that

83
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,960
I was not sad anymore

84
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,840
No, I should say

85
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,080
that I no longer feel sad because of you

86
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,160
I felt sad because I found

87
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,320
I stopped loving you finally

88
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,560
I didn't mean to stop it suddenly

89
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,560
It's because you always ran out

90
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,520
and left me alone at the place

91
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,760
Then?

92
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,360
I'll buy some medicine for you

93
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,360
-Fu Pei, let me go
-Mo Mo

94
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,160
-Fu Pei!
-Mo Mo

95
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:20,720
Get off me

96
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,880
Mo Mo, give me one more chance

97
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,120
Get off me

98
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,080
Give me one more chance

99
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,960
Last chance

100
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,480
I'll never do that again

101
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,080
Calm down

102
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,960
Get off me

103
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,600
Let me go

104
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,040
I really no longer like you

105
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,640
He confessed to me

106
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,640
Then?

107
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,280
We had a fight

108
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,800
I'm tired, I'm going to bed

109
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,840
He hit you?

110
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,360
No, I hit him

111
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,600
I hit him

112
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,880
Really?

113
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,400
Really

114
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,200
Really?

115
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,360
Really

116
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,960
Why did you hit him?

117
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,640
As I rejected him

118
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,400
but he's still mumbling

119
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,120
You rejected him?

120
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,600
I'm going to bed

121
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,000
As I rejected him

122
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,360
Fu Pei

123
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,200
Why not pick up the call?

124
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,680
I have been calling you
the whole night

125
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,720
Have you registered for CET 4...

126
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,720
What's wrong with you??

127
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,680
Come with me

128
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,520
It seemed I always apply
medicine for you recently

129
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,560
I confessed to Mo Mo

130
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,280
and she rejected me

131
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,360
I guessed it

132
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,380
She hit you?

133
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,300
No

134
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,920
My father hit me

135
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,960
Your father?

136
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,640
It's alright

137
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,760
He used to hit me when I was small

138
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,920
This is just a small hurt

139
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,600
Maybe I've been annoying since I was small

140
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,760
Now Mo Mo doesn't like me too

141
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,600
What if I say I like you?

142
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,760
Give me a chance to stay by your side

143
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,040
I know you still like Mo Mo

144
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,000
I can wait

145
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,280
Don't

146
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,000
That's my decision

147
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,840
Wang Shan

148
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,760
Even though I'm tall and strong,

149
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,840
but I'm actually timid

150
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,520
When I face something awkward,

151
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,600
I will run away immediately

152
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,160
I don't know how to say no to girls

153
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,120
So, everyone thought I was fickle

154
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,200
Now I don't even know what to do

155
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,160
with my relationship with Mo Mo

156
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,200
I don't deserve you

157
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,960
It's my call

158
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,720
Fu Pei

159
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,480
I didn't feel you're timid

160
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,600
as you saved me at the stall that day

161
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,920
I didn't feel you're fickle

162
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,120
as I knew that

163
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,000
you only love Mo Mo all the time

164
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,960
Mo Mo

165
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,480
doesn't like you anymore

166
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,920
I think...

167
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,760
The most important thing is...

168
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,720
Although I'm not as tall as you,

169
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,920
I'm not tiny

170
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,480
We're matched perfectly

171
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,800
Are you here to comfort me?

172
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,720
Well,

173
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,320
don't keep my words

174
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,280
in your heart

175
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,040
I will keep bugging you after this

176
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,440
No one can stop me

177
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,360
Come on

178
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,320
Li Na, brief the introduction

179
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,440
There is an insurance company

180
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,960
coming from their HQ in USA

181
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,240
They want to enter China's market

182
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,400
and their main request is creativeness

183
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,960
Let's share your views

184
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,184
[Done your thesis?]

185
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,640
The local marketing
should base on families

186
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,240
Most of the advertisements
are family-style

187
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,800
It's not creative

188
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,760
I saw several similar ads
on my way to the office

189
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,640
Agreed

190
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,480
Throw out the outdated
and bring up the creative

191
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,600
They come from the HQ in USA

192
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,200
They must emphasize on creativity

193
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,880
China's market is
approaching to family-style

194
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,680
Don't you have any new idea?

195
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,120
Mo Mo

196
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,920
Mo Mo

197
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,520
What's your view?

198
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,800
You don't have to get up

199
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,440
So sorry

200
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,480
Can we just frighten the consumers?

201
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,640
For example,

202
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,160
any uncertain accident could happen

203
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,240
When you're enjoying
the fossil exhibition,

204
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,240
you might get hurt

205
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,280
by a bone of dinosaur
which falls suddenly

206
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,440
In term of parents love

207
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,440
When something happens on you,

208
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,680
your children might
be displaced out there

209
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,040
In term of insurance benefits,

210
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,280
consumers are earning no
matter there's an accident or not

211
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,920
You have a lot of ideas

212
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,760
Okay, Li Na

213
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,080
Try to get three proposals

214
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,760
by next Monday

215
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,560
Okay

216
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,360
Dismiss

217
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,040
Hello, Shan Shan

218
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,120
Why did you call me
back to the university?

219
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,840
The counselor got mad today

220
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,760
According to him,

221
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,600
we have the least submission of thesis

222
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,040
Quickly pass it up if you're free

223
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,480
It might affect our graduation

224
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,120
I have something to tell you

225
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,560
What is it so mysterious?

226
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,000
Let's talk when we meet

227
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,720
Okay, I'll try to apply for a leave later

228
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,080
Bye

229
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,680
Miss Li Na, your note book?

230
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,720
Thank you

231
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,360
Complete a proposal together with Jie Er

232
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,120
Miss Li Na

233
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,960
I'd like to leave in the
afternoon to submit my thesis

234
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:04,920
Okay

235
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,880
But, don't take leave too often

236
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,360
Jie Er and you are both interns

237
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:09,790
But she seldom applies leave

238
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,720
Okay, thank you

239
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,360
It's crowded

240
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,280
Oh yeah

241
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,200
What did you

242
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,800
want to tell me?

243
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,880
I'll tell you later

244
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,120
Alright

245
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,200
I think the format of my thesis

246
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,280
should be no problem

247
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,240
You should

248
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,440
worry about the content

249
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,080
Can't you stop teasing me?

250
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,640
You off today?

251
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,040
I'm here to print my thesis

252
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,520
What about you?

253
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,640
I thought you have your
experiment in the old campus

254
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,600
I have something here

255
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,440
Oh yeah

256
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,880
She is my senior, Xie Yu Yin

257
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,320
I know her, we have met before

258
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,280
Right?

259
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,160
Your girlfriend?

260
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,360
Girlfriend?

261
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,600
How did you know?

262
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,440
That's crap!

263
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,640
Your words are confusing

264
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,040
It will cause misunderstanding

265
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,280
Misunderstanding?

266
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,200
How should I explain it?

267
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,000
After you took me to the counselor,

268
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,600
I bluffed him as I wanted to help

269
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,640
Gu Wei Yi

270
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,280
to join Professor Jiang's experiment

271
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,040
So, you are not a couple?

272
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,200
No, we're not

273
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:24,920
Your turn

274
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,320
Print your thesis

275
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,280
Okay

276
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,120
Shan Shan

277
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,040
Thank you

278
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,640
How much?

279
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:41,960
Scan and pay there

280
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:42,960
50 cents per piece

281
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,000
Let me pay for you

282
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,680
Thank you

283
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,280
It's paid

284
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,280
Okay

285
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,600
Gu...

286
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,600
Did you see any error here?

287
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,160
Here

288
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,360
I have calculated it

289
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,640
Should be no problem

290
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,920
Alright

291
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,240
It's not working

292
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,000
Slowly, let me do it

293
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,320
We'll leave first

294
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,040
See you

295
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,040
Bye

296
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,400
Let's go

297
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,400
Okay

298
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,840
I thought

299
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,080
Zhou Lei is finalising the
experiment in the old campus

300
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:41,920
What's wrong?

301
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,520
It's okay

302
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,040
What makes you so dull?

303
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,520
Nothing

304
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,040
Alright, forget it

305
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:58,840
You said

306
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,800
you have something to tell me

307
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,120
Why did you hum and haw?

308
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,040
I have confessed to Fu Pei

309
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,640
What did he say?

310
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,000
He said he didn't know how to say no

311
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,440
and he rejected me

312
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,480
But I won't give up

313
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,840
Are you angry?

314
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,880
No

315
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,120
Your look creeps me out

316
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,520
Frankly,

317
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,640
he confessed to me the other day

318
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,360
It's okay

319
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,160
I knew

320
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,920
Really?

321
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,360
Alright

322
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,240
I'm innocent

323
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,240
Bull shit

324
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,240
I don't know why,

325
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,400
but I feel sympathy to you now

326
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,840
Fu Pei is such a scum

327
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,480
You'll know it someday

328
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,000
Same as you

329
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,520
It was just ended and
now you're setting it up

330
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,920
What do you mean?

331
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,440
-I won't tell you
-What do you mean?

332
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,480
Make it clear

333
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,960
What's wrong with you?

334
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,440
I'm doing my thesis

335
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,320
My god!

336
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,240
Gosh!

337
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,200
How long you didn't wash your hair?

338
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,560
Since we cane back from the beach

339
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,520
Mo Mo

340
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,520
Can you buy me lunch?

341
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,120
Cut it out!

342
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,880
I haven't received my salary yet

343
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,680
Even the rental was paid by my mom

344
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,320
Gu Wei Yi asked for the rental?

345
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,040
What a stingy guy!

346
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,400
I must lecture him

347
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,000
What about

348
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,920
you bring me for dinner at your house?

349
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,560
I'll give him a lesson

350
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,640
Why do you always
want to go to my house?

351
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,080
I want to run out from here

352
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:00,960
No way

353
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,120
You are not welcomed

354
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,840
I must go there one day

355
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,440
Hello

356
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,040
Are you going home?

357
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,040
I'm going home

358
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,720
So early

359
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,080
My mother is coming

360
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:22,800
Who?

361
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:23,840
My mother

362
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,800
She wanted to treat you to dinner

363
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,440
I'm not hungry

364
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,240
I'll tell her then

365
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,480
Dont!

366
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,400
Why did she want to treat me?

367
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,800
I have no idea

368
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,200
I'll ask her

369
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,480
Dont!

370
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,000
I'll go with you

371
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,760
I'll wait for you downstairs

372
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:40,960
Okay

373
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,440
What's wrong?

374
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,080
Gu Wei Yi's mother is coming

375
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,520
She wanted to treat me to dinner

376
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,040
Go ahead

377
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,160
Why do you

378
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,720
look so sad like meeting
your mother in law?

379
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:01,360
Perhaps, I have a phobia
to meet the elderly

380
00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:11,992
[Who created the printer?]

381
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,200
Why are you searching this?

382
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,520
Let's go

383
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:33,920
Are you sure?

384
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,080
Why not?

385
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,000
When will your mother get here?

386
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:46,960
Very soon

387
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,840
Is she fierce?

388
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,600
Like your mother

389
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,640
Do we need to wait for her outside?

390
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,200
How about a red carpet?

391
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,920
Forget it, I just need to calm down

392
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,120
Here is she

393
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,480
Hi, aunt

394
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,040
I'm Si Tu Mo

395
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,960
You are Wen Jun's daughter?

396
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,040
So pretty

397
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:18,960
Just like your mom

398
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,960
Thank you

399
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,320
Mom

400
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,200
Why are you standing here?

401
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,760
Let's sit down

402
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,760
Hurry up

403
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,560
This way please

404
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,040
Have you ordered the food?

405
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,400
Not yet

406
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,560
Waiter

407
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,480
Give me a braised meat platter

408
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,440
Do you eat seafood?

409
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,200
Yes

410
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,040
Okay

411
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,440
Mantis prawn

412
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,240
Your favourite

413
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,080
I thought you're allergic

414
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,760
She got it wrong

415
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,240
What's wrong?

416
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,360
I'm allergic to mantis prawn

417
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,520
No

418
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,320
Yes

419
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,480
When you're small,
I brought you to grandma's...

420
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,760
You're busy when I was small

421
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,160
I might've got it wrong

422
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,800
What a bad memory!

423
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,840
Do you eat fish?

424
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,160
Yes

425
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:20,920
Okay

426
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:21,880
Let's get a fish

427
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,200
Thank you for the meal

428
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,520
How was the food?

429
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,400
So good

430
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,520
That's good

431
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,080
Thank you and please come again

432
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,400
So sorry

433
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,160
to ask you out for dinner suddenly

434
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,440
In fact, I feel scared

435
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,880
to stay with him alone

436
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:44,880
Xiao Yi

437
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,360
We had our dinner quite early

438
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,280
Let's have some tea in the house

439
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,800
I have booked a cab for you

440
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,000
Can't you just cancel it?

441
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,280
You said you'll get insomnia after tea

442
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,680
Actually, it's alright

443
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,000
I think...

444
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,320
The cab is here

445
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,080
I've sent you the plate number

446
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,400
Call me when you're home

447
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,840
Let's go

448
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,600
See you, aunt

449
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,120
Be careful

450
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,080
Have something to tell?

451
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,880
I don't mean to pry into

452
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,480
your family affair

453
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,160
But the communication
between you and your mother...

454
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,400
When I was small, she was busy

455
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,200
and have no time for me

456
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:32,920
Can you teach me?

457
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,120
How did you make your mother

458
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,480
so docile?

459
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,960
I want to make my mother...

460
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,400
You know, my mother is talkative

461
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,760
and

462
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,280
excited in front of you

463
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,080
Don't you feel annoyed?

464
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,040
Am I right?

465
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,280
I saw the way you treated your mother

466
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,480
Hello, Jie Er

467
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,560
Do you have any idea

468
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,720
about the proposal?

469
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,560
Are you asking me

470
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,720
to figure it out on a Friday night?

471
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,120
But we need to submit it on Monday

472
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
You do it first

473
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,280
Let's discuss after this

474
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,400
But...

475
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,920
Alright, bye

476
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,120
Well...

477
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,200
Ready?

478
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,440
Add in cart?

479
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,200
Yes

480
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,240
Grab it at 12am

481
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,360
Alright

482
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,920
Many people are trying to get it

483
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,080
The Internet will be slow

484
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,280
Let's find a hotel outside

485
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,440
Find a hotel?

486
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,800
Do we need to do that?

487
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,400
It's only sales

488
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,560
That's crap!

489
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,520
Do you know how long it took me

490
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,040
to choose, compare the
prices and grab the coupons?

491
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,680
Don't make the crap if you don't know

492
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,200
how hard I worked for it!

493
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:43,960
Alright

494
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,560
Don't worry, I promise I'll get it

495
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,720
I'll go to a cyber cafe

496
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,440
Oh yeah

497
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,880
Double 11 Carnival

498
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,560
I forgot it

499
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,800
How can you forget it?

500
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,720
Don't wait?

501
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,080
Go shopping

502
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,480
We don't have to buy so much

503
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,760
It's trouble to move it after graduation

504
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,400
I just remembered that

505
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,800
Mo Mo's birthday is coming soon

506
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,160
I almost forget it

507
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,160
It's alright

508
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,480
I'll pick a gift for her

509
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,120
Me too

510
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,320
Today is Saturday

511
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,360
I'm surprised you
got up before noon

512
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,440
Don't mention it

513
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,840
Meng Lu called me in the morning

514
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,080
They wanted to come here

515
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,040
Don't worry

516
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,480
I have rejected them

517
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,280
Dig in

518
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,520
I bought yours too

519
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,280
I know that you hate crowds

520
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,280
Who comes so early?

521
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,720
I'll open it

522
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,560
Surprise!

523
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,040
Happy birthday!

524
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,320
Where is Mo Mo?

525
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,840
We decided to celebrate
outside, right?

526
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:22,840
Let's go

527
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,120
Why should we go out?

528
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:24,920
Ke said

529
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,040
they always have hot pots

530
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,360
and watch soccer games here

531
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,880
Your room-mates are here too

532
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,240
No way

533
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,080
Gu Wei Yi hates dirty

534
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,520
Let's go

535
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,880
Come in

536
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,280
You don't know
their destructive power

537
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,560
You'll regret it

538
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,000
Treat it as your birthday gift

539
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,640
Fatty, hurry up!

540
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,440
Don't urge me!

541
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,200
I'm in the toilet

542
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,080
Fu Pei

543
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,680
You don't want to go?

544
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,960
It's Si Tu Mo's birthday

545
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,000
I'll pass

546
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,800
Enjoy yourselves

547
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,280
Fatty

548
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,000
Stop urging me!

549
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:21,840
Hurry up!

550
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:22,880
Let's go

551
00:31:33,834 --> 00:31:35,567
[Happy birthday, sorry...]

552
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,200
I don't care

553
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,680
It will leave marks on the wall

554
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,560
It's hard to remove

555
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,360
I have bought it, don't waste it

556
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:57,760
No way

557
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,920
Who's gonna clean it then?

558
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,080
It's nice for taking photos

559
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,920
It's nicer on the floor

560
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,240
You're studying advertising

561
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,240
Can you be more artistic?

562
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:09,800
Don't...

563
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,160
I'll go and help Niu Niu and Shan Shan

564
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,800
I don't care, I want
to stick balloons on the wall

565
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,960
Don't worry

566
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,280
I'll protect our wall no matter what

567
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,800
Let me help you

568
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,480
Hurry up!

569
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,880
I'll massage your scalp then

570
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,880
Happy birthday to you!

571
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:37,080
Happy birthday to you!

572
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,560
Happy birthday to Mo Mo!

573
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,880
Happy birthday to you!

574
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,680
You're one year older now

575
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,000
Make a wish!

576
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,280
It's time to make a wish!

577
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,280
I'll make a wish now

578
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,760
I wish peace to the world

579
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,400
and I get slim without any exercise

580
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,720
Dream on

581
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,720
I wish peace to the world

582
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,840
I always have money and slim body

583
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,280
Impossible!

584
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,000
Wait!

585
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,080
Let's take a photo

586
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:11,320
Hurry up!

587
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:11,880
Take a photo

588
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,040
Make my face smaller

589
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:13,920
Come on

590
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,800
1, 2, 3

591
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,280
Cheese! Happy birthday!

592
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,840
I'm one year younger!

593
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,840
Happy birthday!

594
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,280
Cut the cake!

595
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:32,400
Alright

596
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:33,280
Fatty

597
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:33,920
For you

598
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,880
Thank you, Mo Mo

599
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,670
What are you doing? This is mine

600
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,760
I want to be the first

601
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:38,560
Shan Shan

602
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:38,840
Thank you

603
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:42,880
Serve yourselves

604
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,080
Let's toast

605
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,720
Come on! Cheers

606
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,150
Happy birthday, Mo Mo!

607
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:47,840
Happy birthday

608
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,240
Happy birthday

609
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,280
Where is my birthday gift?

610
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:52,880
Birthday gift!

611
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,360
It's shaking

612
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,520
Shaking!

613
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,600
The centre of the 3rd row

614
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,520
You help her again

615
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,320
Yeah, you did it again

616
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,880
Let her draw

617
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,520
on your face with a lipstick

618
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,800
I'll open my eyes

619
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,360
Closer

620
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:26,720
Closer

621
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,320
Who did it?

622
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,160
Him!

623
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,800
Gu Wei Yi did it

624
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,840
Which one?

625
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:37,960
3rd row...

626
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:38,600
No way!

627
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,920
Don't help her again

628
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,120
That's right

629
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,080
Falling

630
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,560
It's falling down

631
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,320
Let me see

632
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,880
Please find a person who
wears the same colour

633
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,520
and look at each other for 20 seconds

634
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,280
Nobody wears the same colour with me

635
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,800
Gu Wei Yi is wearing a yellow top

636
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,600
Yellowish brown

637
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,440
It's the same

638
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,120
It's yellow too

639
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:17,560
Look at each other!

640
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,320
Look at each other!

641
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,280
Look at each other!

642
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,880
Mo Mo, you bet, you pay!

643
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:25,720
Hurry up!

644
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,600
That's right

645
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,640
The timer is ready

646
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,040
Mo Mo

647
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,720
Are you feeling shy?

648
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,400
What for?

649
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,720
Gu Wei Yi, don't be shy

650
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,560
I'm never scared of it

651
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,840
Come on

652
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,680
Start

653
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,520
17

654
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,280
16

655
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,840
15

656
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,280
14

657
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,600
13

658
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,400
12

659
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,720
11

660
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,080
10

661
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,360
9

662
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,880
-Mo Mo!
-Mo Mo!

663
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,480
You're falling into his eyes

664
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,120
Alright, let's continue

665
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,680
Carry on

666
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:00,880
Your turn

667
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:01,800
Hurry up!

668
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:02,800
Hurry up!

669
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,000
-It fell!
-Let me see

670
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,880
Take a selfie with someone you like

671
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:18,280
with your mobile phone

672
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,480
Who?

673
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,120
[Here comes the Easter egg]

674
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,480
I go out for a while

675
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,640
Let's go
