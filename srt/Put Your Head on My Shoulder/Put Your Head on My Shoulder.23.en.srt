[Episode 23]

5
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,790
Did you tell your parents?

6
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:51,790
I did

7
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:53,950
No

8
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:55,350
You

9
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,550
I won't tell if it's not confirmed

10
00:01:58,790 --> 00:01:59,470
Moreover, I always

11
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,950
make my own decisions

12
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,790
I'll make the decision and tell them

13
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,270
What about your girlfriend?

14
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,470
You didn't tell her too?

15
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,030
No

16
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:09,740
Alright then

17
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:13,710
You'd better

18
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,510
watch out

19
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,710
Is there something you want to ask me?

20
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,230
If you were Si Tu Mo,

21
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,630
will you get mad if I didn't

22
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:35,710
tell you about the trip?

23
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,310
You should ask her

24
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,870
Okay, I remember

25
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,350
I'll see you in a minute

26
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,790
Bye

27
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,390
I left something

28
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,030
in Professor Jiang's office

29
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,630
I'll go back and get it

30
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,990
Come on, I'll take you to the lab

31
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:11,390
Let's go

32
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,750
Where are the others?

33
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,830
I don't know, they're here just now

34
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,590
You used to do experiments

35
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,230
in the new lab

36
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,670
Why did you suddenly
go back to the old lab?

37
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,270
The new project needs to be done here

38
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,870
And the old lab

39
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,510
is more in line with the
experimental environment

40
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:43,390
Take it off

41
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,390
Take off your white coat

42
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,110
I want to wear it for a long time

43
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,510
Nice looking?

44
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:16,950
Xiao Gu

45
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,220
Get the nitroglycerin for me

46
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,270
The nitroglycerin is explosive

47
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,950
But I can only
think of "Nitroglycerin",

48
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,270
which seems

49
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,190
a very professional word

50
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,630
What are these?

51
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,390
I have something to tell you

52
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:42,230
What's the matter?

53
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,390
In the last exam,

54
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,230
I did better than Zhou Lei

55
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,870
Congratulations!

56
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,310
So,

57
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,830
I'm qualified to join the
Heidelberg University exchange

58
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,590
in Germany with
Professor Jiang and my seniors

59
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,430
Congratulations!

60
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:08,590
What?

61
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,070
Germany?

62
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:18,350
How long?

63
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,950
More than 6 months

64
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:22,790
When?

65
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,830
The school is now
speeding up the visa for us

66
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,790
It may take two weeks if it's fast

67
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:29,870
The university

68
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,190
sent the invitation
at the end of last year

69
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,670
So a lot of the process is done

70
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:35,790
You knew it last year

71
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,430
and you're just telling me now

72
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,670
As I was not sure
that I'll be qualified

73
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,310
Maybe Zhou Lei can do
better than me in the exam

74
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,070
After all, he's been serious

75
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,230
And I'm busy falling in love with you

76
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:52,630
Do you mean

77
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,230
I disturb your studies?

78
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,190
I didn't mean it

79
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,030
Who else is going with you?

80
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,150
Professor Jiang,
Lu Jian Shi and Xie Yu Yin

81
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:12,510
Don't follow me

82
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:30,910
It takes so long

83
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,190
It's normal,

84
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,190
girls always slow

85
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,030
Must be Meng Lu busy with make up

86
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:36,030
She makes them late

87
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,590
Meng Lu is pretty by nature

88
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:38,270
She doesn't need to make up

89
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,670
Only Meng Lu likes to make up

90
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,830
Must be Wang Shan makes up for so long

91
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,510
Wang Shan is simple

92
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:45,670
Here they are

93
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:47,350
-Come on!
-Hurry up!

94
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,990
What makes you late?

95
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,510
We need to make up

96
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,630
Get up, why did you take my seat?

97
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:58,990
Go away

98
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,750
Fatty, why are you laughing?

99
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:06,950
You shouldn't laugh

100
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:08,950
Order my favorite food

101
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:09,710
Beef

102
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,150
Crayfish

103
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,510
Clean it for me

104
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,070
Alright

105
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:15,870
You're so beautiful today

106
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,190
Still angry?

107
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,990
All the best for our bright future!

108
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,110
Fatty, I tell you

109
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,910
Stop playing online games again

110
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,430
Battlegrounds, huh?

111
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,630
Stop playing it again

112
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,190
Watch out

113
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,150
I'm better than you

114
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:28,910
Stop it

115
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,300
I can swim faster than you

116
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,300
Cut it out!

117
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:33,910
You swim

118
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:34,420
Swimming

119
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,060
Swimming

120
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:38,510
Swimming

121
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:41,030
Hurry up!

122
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:42,670
Fu Pei

123
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,470
I told you not to drink so much

124
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,910
Alright, get up

125
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:51,870
Honey

126
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,710
Don't be angry

127
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:58,790
You shouldn't scold me
as I can drink so much

128
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,630
Don't do this again

129
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:13,070
Let's go, walk properly

130
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,070
Let's go

131
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,470
What are you doing?

132
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,630
I'm drunk and can't stand

133
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,510
Really?

134
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,390
But you were just fine

135
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,590
It just kicked in

136
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,510
It's just beer, not strong alcohol

137
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:49,750
Gu Wei Yi

138
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:50,990
Stand up

139
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,950
I don't know if you're really drunk

140
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,070
I'm really drunk

141
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,990
That's crap

142
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:03,430
Watch out

143
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:05,950
Sit down

144
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,310
Sit down

145
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:11,870
I'll bring you a glass of water

146
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,230
I'm not thirsty

147
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,670
Are you sure you're drunk?

148
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,870
Yeah

149
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,310
I'll ask you for one last time

150
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,790
Are you really sure you're drunk?

151
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,110
No

152
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:39,710
Say it

153
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:43,550
What?

154
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,790
Why didn't you tell me

155
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:47,950
that you're going to Germany

156
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,270
with Xie Yu Yin?

157
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,350
I told you

158
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,150
I know it's my fault

159
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,710
I didn't tell you in the first place

160
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,750
I've never thought about it before

161
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:27,030
Because I made all the decisions
myself since I was small

162
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,910
I just need to inform them
after making the decision

163
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:32,830
This is the most efficient way

164
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,070
that I communicate with them

165
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,950
Because they didn't have time for you?

166
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:41,030
Because they didn't understand
what I'm going to do

167
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:47,590
But,

168
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:48,990
if you don't like it that way,

169
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,990
I'll change my style for you, okay?

170
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,470
You have such a good attitude

171
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,710
I shouldn't lose my temper with you

172
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,030
Do you want me to go to Germany?

173
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,830
Will you retreat
if I don't let you go?

174
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,830
Just do it as your planned

175

I'll wait for you

176
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,470
You should take the blood first

177
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:00,590
I'll get the vaccine number

178
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,190
for you

179
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:04,830
No rushing

180
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:06,870
Just do the checkup today

181
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,550
and do the vaccine next time

No way

Is it not easy for me to
accompany you to the hospital?

185

Your turn, let's go

What's wrong?

187
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:26,950
Why are you wearing sunglasses?

188
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,790
I don't want to see the color of blood

Pull the needle, but don't pull it out

No

It's almost there

223

"A little strong"

227
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,470
Mo Mo will be a bit different

228
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,750
when she feels reluctant

229
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,750
So you mustn't be angry with her

230
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,910
She will be always picking
about something with you

231
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,510
and make you annoyed

232

Don't move

233
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,670

"I want to go further with you"

236
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:44,270
Then, she'll start to be cold

237
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:47,070
and pretend that you
do not exist in this world

to stick with you

00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:20,910
And

347
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,790
When are you going
to hire an accountant?

348
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:24,270
You can't wait for me to come back

349
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:25,390
and help you during my break

350
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,710
I'll be back to school soon

351
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,110
Why not?

352
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,590
You're my girlfriend

353
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,550
You're the lady boss here, why not?

354
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,710
It will cause a bad debt if
you leave the account behind

355
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,550
It's not conducive to
the company's development

356
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:39,590
Forget it

357
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:41,950
I used to rush you every day

358
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,790
I don't feel like your girlfriend

359
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:44,830
But look like your mom

360
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,030
Now you know, huh?

361
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:04,470
You're back

362
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:14,070
What are you taking from the company?

363
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:21,110
I just resigned

364
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:25,150
Resign?

365
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,630
It's my belonging in the company

366
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:28,590
I got it back today

367
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:30,670
I thought you did a good job

368
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:31,990
Why did you resign?

369
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,550
You will not understand
even if I tell you

370
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,270
Can't I understand Chinese?

371
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:37,870
Or you're not talking in Chinese?

372
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,190
Why do you always say

373
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,830
I don't understand?

374
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:41,590
I got a headache

375
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,150
I'm going to bed for a while

376
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:45,910
You...

377
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:04,430
Your mom's here

378
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,270
Yes

379
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:09,190
Didn't you call her
to take care of me?

380
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,150
She's cleaning in the living room

381
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,630
She wants to sterilize it

382
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,470
She should bring you
to the hospital first

383
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:19,870
I just have a cold

384
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,790
I just need to take a break

385
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:24,910
Wear more cloth at home

386
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,510
Si Tu Mo

387
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:27,750
What's wrong?

388
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:28,790
Okay

389
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,910
My mom is calling me,
I have to go out for a while

390
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,990
Mom, I don't drink Chinese medicine

391
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:44,830
It's not Chinese medicine

392
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,950
I cooked the walnut soup for you

393
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,190
Your grandmother said,

394
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:50,630
it's effective to heal a cold

395
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:54,710
I couldn't find the mug

396
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:55,790
you often use just now

397
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:56,910
So I took a bowl

398
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,030
Drink it while it's still hot

399
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,070
You'll be recovered after this

400
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:12,270
Finished, I'll go and
clean up my things

401
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:13,830
Wait

402
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:14,550
Well

403
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:16,430
I need to talk to you

404
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,190
Well

405
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:19,550
Mo Mo

406
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:22,150
How's your German visa going?

407
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:22,990
It's passed

408
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:25,070
They rejected me before
as they suspected

409
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,190
I'm going to migrate

410
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:27,390
Then, Gu Wei Yi planned

411
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:28,630
an itinerary of Germany trip for me

412
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,110
And the application is passed

413
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:33,270
Xiao Gu is really awesome

414
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:35,590
I've never thought a scientist
could in charge of a visa too

415
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:36,070
Mom

416
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:37,830
What are you trying to say?

417
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,710
I just want to ask you

418
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:43,390
When are you two going to marry?

419
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,310
Why are you asking me again?

420
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:47,550
Wait

421
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,390
What do you mean by asking again?

422
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,030
It's been more than 6 months
Xiao Gu went to Germany

423
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:56,310
I can understand that you're not able

424
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,230
to get your visa to Germany

425
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,110
But it's been such a long time

426
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,230
Did he ever think

427
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,670
want to come back and see you?

428
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,190
Don't you feel panic?

429
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:04,870
We keep in touch every day

430
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,270
Why should I panic for?

431
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,630
Don't pretend

432
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,550
I don't want to talk,
I have a headache

433
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:15,110
I don't want to talk to you either

434
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:18,230
You're back

435
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:22,830
What are you doing?

436
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:24,830
Finding clothes and going out

437
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:26,390
Si Tu Mo

438
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:30,870
What's wrong?

439
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:32,910
Your mother said anything to you?

440
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,310
Nothing

441
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:48,230
I just don't know which dress to wear

442
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:50,950
Alright then

443
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:05,350
Now

444
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:08,670
Do you believe that
I have a girlfriend?

445
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,350
I don't care

446
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:11,710
She's in China

447
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,550
I can be your girlfriend here

448
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:14,830
I won't tell her

449
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:16,510
Stop bothering me

450
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:27,390
Anna

451
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,230
Did you turn her down again?

452
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,110
You're so cool, aren't you?

453
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:46,910
She's the professor's daughter

454
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,270
You didn't give any face to her

455
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:50,030
Why are you so anxious?

456
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,070
It's not your daughter

457
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,150
To get a daughter,

458
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:57,550
I surely need time and space

459
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:00,550
I don't want to go out today

460
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:01,990
Why?

461
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,590
My girlfriend's sick

462
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,550
She might contact me at anytime

463
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:06,430
You may go out

464
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:07,750
and find a place to sit down

465
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:08,870
and drink a cup of coffee
while waiting for her

466
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,590
I just bought a flight
ticket to go back

467
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:12,750
I'm broke

468
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:16,590
That's why you don't eat

469
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:18,190
It's up to you

470
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,350
You will be awkward anyway

471
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,190
Who knows?

472
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:25,470
What are you guys talking about?

473
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,350
I love you

474
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,790
I love you very much

475
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:30,270
You're so sweet

476
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:35,990
You're the most beautiful girl
I've ever seen in my life

477
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,110
Really?

478
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,230
Are you kidding me?

479
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:40,830
No, I'm sure

480
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,190
Please have a seat

481
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:58,070
Director Sha Sha will
come down in a minute

482
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,150
You sit here for a while

483
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:06,470
I'm going out to answer a call

484
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:10,190
Wei Wei

485
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:10,830
Ye Tian

486
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,830
Did you hear that
Si Tu Mo has resigned?

487
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,510
Of course, it's all spread

488
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,750
But the reason of her
resignation is interesting

489
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:18,710
If I were Sha Sha,

490
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,550
I'll apply leave too

491
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,230
Shame on her! How could she do that?

492
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:24,230
She took the winning
design of her staff

493
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:25,710
and put it under her name

494
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:28,390
And the resignation letter

495
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,030
directly kept her mouth shut

496
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:32,630
I really want to upload
the letter to the Internet

497
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:33,710
Stop talking about her

498
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,310
Let's go to the photocopy room

499
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:36,190
Come on

500
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:56,910
What are you doing?

501
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:58,750
Circle is out of battery

502
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:00,270
I want to recharge it

503
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,310
I'm bringing you a glass of water

504
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,190
Why are you sitting on the floor?

505
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,150
It's cold

506
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,190
You just caught a cold

507
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:07,630
Quickly get up

508
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:08,710
Get up

509
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:20,270
What is this?

510
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:21,430
I don't know

511
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:28,910
Well

512
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:32,030
Only the people like your father

513
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,630
who always hide private money

514
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:34,590
could think of that place

515
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:35,870
I couldn't think of it

516
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,310
Not you?

517
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:40,910
That's...

518
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:43,190
-Gu Wei Yi
-Xiao Gu

519
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:49,230
The scientist's brain is so strange

520
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:12,670
I'm done

521
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,670
The abnormality of the
scientist influenced you, huh?

522
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:44,590
You...

523
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,110
What are you doing?

524
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:55,630
Why are you packing up the thing?

525
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:56,750
I'll go to Gu Wei Yi

526
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:57,390
Gu Wei...

527
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:00,430
He's in Germany

528
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:01,950
You're still sick

529
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,590
Don't be crazy

530
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,310
You may go there when you're recovered

531
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:08,790
I'm going to force him to marry me

532
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:20,550
Go away

533
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:21,230
Go away

534
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:30,750
Stop packing it

535
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,550
I'm going to Germany instead of outing

536
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:33,670
You can eat it later

537
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:34,420
Bring it along

538
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:35,790
Alright

539
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:38,990
Let's go

540
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:43,030
Shall we

541
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:43,900
give him a call?

542
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:44,940
You can't suddenly go there

543
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:46,270
Why do you want to call him?

544
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,070
What if he runs away

545
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,070
from me after that?

546
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:49,630
It's impossible

547
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:50,830
He's a scientist

548
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:52,510
He does everything thoroughly

549
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:53,310
with plans

550
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:55,270
What about beyond the plan?

551
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:56,860
Let's go

552
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:02,510
Attack him

553
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,710
when he's unprepared

554
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:05,510
Go!

555
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,030
Come on

556
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:27,470
Fu Pei, I'm Gu Wei Yi

557
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:29,150
Hey bro

558
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,670
Before you introduce yourself,

559
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:32,670
can you check out the current time

560
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,390
of Beijing first?

561
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:33,750
I couldn't

562
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:34,830
contact Si Tu Mo for almost one day

563
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,470
Have you and Wang Shan been
in touch with her these few days?

564
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:39,470
Yes, she said she was busy

565
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,590
Her mother is taking
care of her, right?

566
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:43,470
Her mum didn't pick up my call

567
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,110
Of course

568
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:48,070
It's 2 am in Beijing right now

569
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:50,590
I'm tired, bye

570
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,510
Hey scientist, what's going on?

571
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:13,710
I'm playing games

572
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:15,990
Your girlfriend is sleeping on my bed

573
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:18,830
That's your girlfriend

574
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:19,870
I'm going to play games

575
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:20,550
Don't disturb me

576
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,150
My girlfriend?

577
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:57,590
Si Tu Mo

578
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:06,630
"The difficulties in the
books aren't a problem"

579
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:11,470
"All the puzzles come with axiom"

580
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:17,670
"I thought I have the perfect logic"

581
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:21,150
"Now I find no solution"

582
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:28,950
"That's how you came into my heart"

583
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:33,590
"Sweet and childish"

584
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:39,830
"Nothing can describe your smile"

585
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:43,510
"You bring me courage"

586
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:49,230
"Put your head on my shoulder"

587
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:54,750
"You are my unknown world"

588
00:37:55,790 --> 00:38:00,630
"Untie the knot of silence for you"

589
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:06,670
"You'll never be timid"

590
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:08,870
Si Tu Mo

591
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:13,030
How are you?

592
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:18,350
Fine, thank you. And you?

593
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:23,070
"The youth marks my
heartbeat and feeling"

594
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:28,030
"Our love is passionate"

595
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:31,710
"Never fade"

596
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:42,390
Xiao Yi

597
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:44,430
Well

598
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:45,550
I'm just asking

599
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:47,630
if you see Si Tu Mo

600
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:49,870
She's with me now

601
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:51,630
She's with you?

602
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:54,230
Are you guys alright?

603
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:57,350
I just want to ask

604
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:00,270
When are you guys

605
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:02,990
going to settle down?

606
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,710
I'm planning it

607
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:06,710
Planning it?

608
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:10,710
Are you saying

609
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:13,030
that you're getting married soon?

610
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:14,990
I'll hang up first

611
00:39:15,581 --> 00:39:19,448
"To my daughter: Good luck
and come back with a wedding!"

612
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:38,030
Si Tu Mo

613
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:41,070
Si Tu Mo

614
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:44,710
Are you here for a wedding?

615
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:47,870
Yeah

616
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:50,590
really

617
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:54,230
Mom, let me sleep for a while

618
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,590
But I've already bought my ticket

619
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:03,510
to marry you there

620
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:51,990
But I love you

621
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:56,550
I love someone else, please leave

622
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,270
I want to see your girlfriend

623
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:00,790
It's none of your business

624
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:06,630
I'm his girlfriend

625
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:10,580
[Here comes the Easter egg...]

626
00:41:31,573 --> 00:41:32,110
Gu Wei Yi

627
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:35,950
Cool man

628
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:37,950
Why are you wearing sunglasses?

629
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:40,630
You...
