Is the book useful?

13
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,660

174
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:19,460
I saw it for the first time
when I was in the kindergarten

175
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,660
What a pity it melts when
it falls onto the ground

176
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,340
I wish to make a snowman

177
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,940
Gu Wei Yi, you came from the North

178
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,500
Have you made a snowman before?

179
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,300
Yeah

180
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,260
I have never seen a real snowman

181
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,980
If only I had a chance

182
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,860
to see a snowman in real

183
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,980
It seems you make a big
money during the snowy days

184
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,020
Yeah

185
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,780
My hot chestnuts

186
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,020
are made for such cold weather

187
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,700
Alright, I'll pack for you

188
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,540
-Don't take so much, I can't finish it
-Sure you can

189
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,500
Your are wearing too little

190
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,220
Take more and

191
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,500
hold it in your hands to make you warm

192
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,660
Thank you

193
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:10,780
You're welcome

194
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,420
It's okay, I'm not cold

195
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,300
RMB 20

196
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:23,620
Take it

197
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,060
Here

198
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:25,460
Okay

199
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,340
Thank you

200
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:27,820
Take it

201
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:28,820
Wait a moment

202
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:54,660
Thank you

203
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,140
So cold

204
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:12,980
It's so cold

205
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,380
What is that?

206
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,020
When did you buy them?

207
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,300
So smart

208
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,180
I saw the notice

209
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,860
on my way out this morning
but forgot to tell you

210
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,620
Warming patch with Doraemon

211
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,980
I have never seen it

212
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,460
Well, I simply bought it

213
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,740
You like Doraemon too?

214
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:50,980
I saw you draw one

215
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,180
on your note

216
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,540
Light up the candles

217
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,100
Have you successfully confessed?

218
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:15,780
No

219
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:17,740
Why?

220
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,380
Why

221
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,420
She doesn't get it

222
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,200
[Prof. Jiang]

223
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,220
Gu Wei Yi, how come she doesn't get it?

224
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,500
It's so simple

225
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:52,780
That's right

226
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,580
Schrodinger Equation is about the particles

227
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,900
Particles stand for the
structure of everything

228
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:01,140
You are telling her she is
the structure of your everything

229
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:04,330
And it will be a complete wave function
when you multiply by times

230
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,570
It means

231
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,700
she makes your life more complete

232
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,140
It's so simple and romantic

233
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,220
How can't she get it?

234
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,290
Did she pretend it?

235
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:15,620
-Why are you staying together?
-We're doing an experiment

236
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,570
I'm not like you

237
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:19,180
Xiao Gu, what field is she studying?

238
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,700
Xiao Gu, what field is she studying?

239
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:47,740
Accounting

240
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,500
What about you write it in Math?

241
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:51,580
Well...

242
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,260
She will understand it

243
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:57,980
Si Tu Mo

244
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,140
-Have you learned Further Math?
-Yes

245
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,500
-What is this?
-Solve it

246
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,340
-Did I annoy you today?
-What's wrong?

247
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,060
Why did you keep

248
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,220
insulting my IQ?

249
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,860
Don't trouble me with science again

250
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:37,900
Did she solve it?

251
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,900
Unexpectedly, you're so romantic

252
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,660
I would say yes if I were a girl

253
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,060
She didn't solve it but got mad

254
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,980
I think she doesn't like you

255
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,180
Better forget it

256
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,780
Don't listen to Zhou Lei

257
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,700
I guess this is indirect for her

258
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,020
Learn it from me

259
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,460
Lower your level to match up with her

260
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,180
Use the poem I wrote to my wife

261
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,060
Wind of Autumn, blooming of flowers

262
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,780
As if we meet each other again

263
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,780
Straight to the point

264
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:27,740
Si Tu Mo

265
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,020
What?

266
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:35,140
Wind of Autumn, blooming of flowers

267
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,820
As if we meet each other again

268
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:38,740
How?

269
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,100
Wind of Autumn, blooming of flowers

270
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,820
As if we meet each other again

271
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,820
I've only heard of this

272
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,460
Wind of Autumn

273
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,780
Yummy crabs

274
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,100
It is nicer when you add chillies

275
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,060
Forget it, I go to bed now

276
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,980
I'm the one who should be angry

277
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:09,820
Rascal!

278
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,900
I think she doesn't like you

279
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:39,980
Better forget it

280
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:41,140
"The difficulties in the books"

281
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,780
"are not a problem"

282
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:48,740
"All the puzzles come with axiom"

283
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:54,820
"I thought I have the perfect logic"

284
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,140
"Now I find no solution"

285
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,020
"That's how"

286
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,020
"you came into my heart"

287
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:10,700
"Sweet and childish"

288
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:17,100
"Nothing can describe your smile"

289
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:20,580
"You bring me courage"

290
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:26,700
"Put your head on my shoulder"

291
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:32,220
"Pass over the seasons hand-in-hand"

292
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:38,020
"The youth marks my
heartbeat and feeling"

293
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:43,060
"Our love is passionate"

294
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:49,100
"Never fade"

295
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:11,580
"Put your head on my shoulder"

296
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:16,900
"Pass over the seasons hand-in-hand"

297
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:22,820
"The youth marks my
heartbeat and feeling"

298
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:27,780
"Our love is passionate"

299
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:31,540
"Never fade"

300
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,060
Gu Wei Yi

301
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,340
How was it? You didn't
reply our message

302
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,100
You made it?

303
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,420
How was it?

304
00:24:59,300 --> 00:24:59,620
Wait

305
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,660
Did you use the direct way
which I have told you?

306
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,420
Yes, I did

307
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,500
Wind of Autumn

308
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,380
She said, yummy crabs

309
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,420
Yummy crabs?

310
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,660
Impossible

311
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,860
Was she playing dumb?

312
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,220
Prof. Jiang

313
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,340
The girl doesn't like him

314
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,180
Impossible

315
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,180
Professor

316
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,220
Here you are

317
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,900
Feeling better?

318
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:34,940
I'm alright

319
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:35,740
Good

320
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,420
You're not fully recovered

321
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,740
Stay away from me,
I don't want to be infected

322
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,260
I won't go near to you

323
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,180
It's too bad

324
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,420
You shouldn't come as you're sick

325
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,540
Do you want everybody to get infected?

326
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,740
Never care about other's feeling

327
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,460
Don't worry

328
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,900
Human flu

329
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,740
can't infect you

330
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,380
Xie Yu Yin

331
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,540
Why are you fighting

332
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,780
in the early morning?

333
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:04,900
Do your work

334
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,180
What's wrong with you?
You are responsible to check

335
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,180
the mailbox this week

336
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,420
I have checked it out and
forwarded it to Miss Sha Sha

337
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,460
But she didn't read it

338
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,860
Why didn't you send
a copy to Miss Li Na?

339
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,580
I thought Miss Sha Sha
would read it

340
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,420
Forget it, we've taken the blame

341
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,700
No point to argue anymore

342
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,100
I'll check the mailbox from today on

343
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:44,500
Come on. I'll be more careful in the future

344
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,100
I'm hungry, let's eat something

345
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,220
I haven't done it

346
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,220
I knew

347
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,380
Let's go for a meal first

348
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:55,860
Alright

349
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,860
-Let's go for a hot pot
-We don't have time

350
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,260
Where did you learn the unfriendly tone?

351
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,180
From my room-mate

352
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,060
Which room-mate?

353
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:13,980
It's almost lunch time

354
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,620
Take a rest and continue after lunch

355
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:17,380
Okay

356
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,340
Which canteen? 1st or 2nd?

357
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,780
2nd, they are selling claypot rice there

358
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,420
I like it the most

359
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:27,900
Gu Wei Yi?

360
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,220
I'll pass, enjoy yourselves

361
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,060
What's wrong?

362
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,100
Nothing

363
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,580
Are you having a fever?

364
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,580
So hot

365
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:43,860
He's burning

366
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,540
He's burning!

367
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,620
Oh, my god!

368
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,180
Let's go to the hospital

369
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,700
I'm okay

370
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:51,940
No, you must go

371
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,620
I'm off, otherwise, the
claypot rice will be out of stock

372
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,460
I just need to take a rest

373
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,140
Gu Wei Yi

374
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,060
Gu Wei Yi

375
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:31,940
Gu Wei Yi

376
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:35,900
Gu Wei Yi, get up

377
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:40,460
Finish it, you'll get
hypoglycemia without food

378
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,180
Here you are

379
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,780
-No food allowed in the lab
-I don't care

380
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,740
I bought it for you

381
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,460
Quickly dig in

382
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,820
Don't move

383
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,460
I've applied for leave for you

384
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,300
Quickly go home after lunch

385
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:09,180
I said I have applied for leave for you

386
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,980
-Go home after lunch
-I'm not that serious

387
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,900
I want to chase senior out too

388
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,300
You two are mobile virus

389
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:15,780
I...

390
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,220
Don't move! Stay away from me

391
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:26,700
Getting better?

392
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:28,580
Much better

393
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,060
I bring some medicine for you

394
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:31,700
Thank you

395
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,420
-I just met Zhou Lei
-Radiation protection suit?

396
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,380
He has a sharp tongue, but kind

397
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,900
He even give you the last claypot rice

398
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,340
and applied leave for me

399
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,380
He urged me to go home

400
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:47,940
For me too

401
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,100
Go! Go!

402
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,060
Hurry up!

403
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:00,940
How did you play?

404
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,580
Sorry, bro

405
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,820
He's in a bad mood

406
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:04,540
Forget it

407
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,420
Calm down

408
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,740
Wang Shan is watching

409
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:15,620
Don't scare her

410
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,340
Didn't you see he hit my hand?

411
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,260
This is normal in games, right?

412
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:23,380
You used to be pushed before,
but you didn't get mad

413
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,820
I was timid before

414
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:25,700
Okay?

415
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,580
So you have the nerve now, huh?

416
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,020
What's wrong?

417
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:38,300
He's strange recently and
I don't know who's eating him

418
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,620
He refused to tell

419
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,820
Please comfort him

420
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,540
Go for a date!

421
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,220
Let's go

422
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:44,900
Okay

423
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:45,420
Come on

424
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,540
Forget it

425
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,020
Let's go

426
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,140
Miss Li Na

427
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:12,100
Why are we buying so much juice?

428
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,900
This is my personal habit

429
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,620
I'll compare the product of
our project to the other brands

430
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:20,140
It doesn't help much,
but could inspire your mind

431
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:23,100
Shall we bring it back to the office
and taste it with the others?

432
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:26,940
You live nearby?

433
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:27,660
Yes

434
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,180
Bring the info and juice to your home

435
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:35,340
Make a report after
analysis as soon as possible

436
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,260
I drink it all alone?

437
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,180
Any problem?

438
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:40,460
No

439
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:42,380
Pay then

440
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,100
Okay

441
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,460
My god!

442
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,260
I...

443
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,540
Did I leave the key in the office?

444
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,700
-Hello
-What's wrong with your voice?

445
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,100
Fever

446
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,300
How come? Taken any medicine?

447
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,660
Seen a doctor? Where are you?

448
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,580
Neither see any doctor
nor take medicine

449
00:33:59,220 --> 00:33:59,780
At home

450
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,620
Do you have medicine at home?

451
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,100
No

452
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,540
Wait a moment, I'll be right there

453
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:09,210
Okay

454
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:45,940
Why are you here?

455
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:48,540
Zhou Lei chased me out of the lab

456
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,500
I saw your unfinished report

457
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:53,260
So I bring it to you
and see your condition

458
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:57,460
-How did you know my address?
-Zhou Lei told me

459
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:03,060
Why? You don't want to see me?

460
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,180
Come in

461
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,740
-Shall I change my shoes?
-It's alright

462
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,380
Have a seat, I get you some water

463
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,420
Let me do it, you're sick

464
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,220
Have a seat

465
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,420
Let me open the door

466
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,420
It's heavy

467
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,100
I...

468
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,100
Have some water

469
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,100
Thank you

470
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,020
Take the medicine

471
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:17,740
Have some water first

472
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,780
I gave you the medicine in the morning

473
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,680
Will it harm you if you take it again?

474
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,460
I forgot to bring it back

475
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,140
Take the medicine

476
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,340
Later

477
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:45,100
Gu Wei Yi, take the medicine

478
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:09,220
So, are you staying together
because of your parents?

479
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,060
My mother and his mother were classmates

480
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,340
What a coincidence!

481
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,500
Done

482
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:20,860
So fast

483
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,620
I shall go back

484
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:28,900
I'll walk you out

485
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:45,820
Gu Wei Yi

486
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,500
Are you sick because get infected by me?

487
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,860
If so, you'd better go to the hospital

488
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,340
because my condition was quite serious

489
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,420
It's alright

490
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,340
I'm leaving first

491
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:58,740
Bye

492
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,060
Take care

493
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,100
See you

494
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,380
Why did you buy so much juice?

495
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,220
Testing

496
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,340
Leave it to me and go to rest

497
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:13,460
Where to put it?

498
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,300
In the fridge

499
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,060
Do it yourself

500
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,540
So strange

501
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,700
Open it for me

502
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,020
Open it yourself

503
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:41,500
What's wrong?

504
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,820
-Put it in the freezer
-It will be frozen

505
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,260
The cooler's full

506
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,700
What's this?

507
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:54,940
Branch?

508
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,460
I don't know, I go to bed first

509
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,300
Branch, wolfberries and a leaf

510
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,300
What's this?

511
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:09,700
I bought it?

512
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:11,820
Can't remember

513
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,380
Hello, Mo Mo

Hello, Shan Shan

515
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:35,100
What should I cook for
a person who has a fever?

516
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:36,340
Porridge

517
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,540
Who has a fever?

518
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:39,660
Gu Wei Yi

519
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,020
My mom used to cook in this way

520
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,580
First, wash the rice

521
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:44,740
Put little oil

522
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,180
and salt into the rice

523
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,940
Then, boil the water

524
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,300
Put dried tangerine peel
in cold water and boil it

525
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,740
Put in the rice when it's boiled

526
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,580
When the water bubbled up again,

527
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,260
turn it to medium or low heat

528
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,060
Make sure it doesn't stick to the pot

529
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:58,740
When it's almost done,

530
00:39:58,900 --> 00:39:59,780
take out the peel

531
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,060
Forget it, let him starve to death

532
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:05,260
He doesn't need the porridge anyway

533
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,940
It sounds complicated

534
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,540
In fact, it's simple

535
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:13,020
Come and help me

536
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,140
Okay

537
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:19,500
See you in a bit

538
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:27,780
Don't pretend sleeping. Gu Wei Yi is sick

539
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:31,980
Not my concern

540
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:36,060
Don't you want to visit him
or go to his house?

541
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:37,900
Mo Mo doesn't want to see me

542
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:42,700
I went to see her a few days ago,
she told me not to turn up again

543
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,260
That's why you're
getting mad in the court?

544
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,420
Have you guys made it clear?

545
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,100
She didn't give me a chance

546
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,260
Alright, I'll bring you there

547
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,680
[Here comes the Easter egg...]

548
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,180
In girl's view, what should

549
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,740
a sexy boy look like?

550
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:21,020
The answer might surprise you

551
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:22,660
First, hair

552
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,540
Among the girls whom I've interviewed,

553
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,460
hair style is their main concern

554
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,140
Mind your hair style

555
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,820
Hair style is not only

556
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:32,940
important for actors

557
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:34,740
Look like a toilet lid

558
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:39,140
Handsome!

559
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,660
Which hair style do you like?

560
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,300
This one?

561
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,420
This is not suitable for you

562
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:53,660
I want it exactly the same

563
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,260
You need to have a perm

564
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,060
A perm?

565
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:57,660
Yes

566
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:01,140
-Direct Current or Alternating Current?
-Of course Alternating Current

567
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,340
Otherwise, I can't do it

568
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:02,900
Right?

569
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,180
It's really not suitable for you

570
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:09,620
I'm okay

571
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:11,420
Okay

572
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:30,340
Thank you

573
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:34,580
Let me make you another hair style

574
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:35,660
It's alright

575
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,060
Get another one

576
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,540
You'll spoil my reputation with this

577
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,900
You'll break my name

578
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,220
It's alright

579
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:45,380
Don't! Let me make you another one

580
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:46,780
Come on

581
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,340
Very fast

582
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,660
I'll make a new hair style
