00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,320
Let's go out and exercise

00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,040
Don't tell me you can't play ping-pong

00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,320

[Episode 17]

7
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,240
What are you doing?

8
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,320
What are you doing?

9
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,960
What's wrong with your neck?

10
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,560
It's a little cold

11
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,680
-I'll close the balcony door
-No need

12
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,360
Not because of the wind

13
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,160
I'll close it

14
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,360
I just stood in front
of the fridge too long

15
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,120
The sound of closing door
will make Shan Shan awake

16
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,600
Will she go back to
the campus tomorrow?

17
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,040
Will she leave tomorrow?

18
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,120
I don't know

19
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,000
She fights with Fu Pei

20
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,760
I'll get Fu Pei to pick her up

21
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,960
Wouldn't it be nice for us to do this?

22
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,000
Hello

23
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,200
I'm Gu Wei Yi

24
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,040
I'm Si Tu Mo

25
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,280
Are you two sick?

26
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,480
Why are you calling me
in the night? Cross talk?

27
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,080
Shan Shan is here

28
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,400
What's she doing there?

29
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,880
It's so far, I thought she...

30
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,960
Pick her up now

31
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:13,800
Gosh!

32
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,440
Don't listen to him

33
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,880
Shan Shan's asleep

34
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,320
I just want to tell you,
Shan Shan looks upset

35
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,960
-You...
-Pick her up in the early morning

36
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,000
Can't you just be a little tactful?

37
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,160
I was tactful

38
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,320
Is that called tactful?

39
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,640
Of course

40
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,480
What about with no tact?

41
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,600
Your girlfriend is at my house

42
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,760
It's annoying

43
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,160
Admission ticket, student card

44
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,960
Identity card

45
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,200
Pencil, eraser

46
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,560
Why are you so early?

47
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,760
Sleep for a while, it's still early

48
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,240
It's okay, I'm awake

49
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,240
Take your breakfast

50
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,440
I bought breakfast

51
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,680
Let's don't wake him up

52
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,000
He's probably still asleep

53
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,280
I saw him drinking water
when I went out in the morning

54
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,760
So I bought for 3 persons

55
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,680
He'll come out and eat

56
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,000
when he feels hungry

57
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,680
Breakfast?

58
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:33,640
Let's go

59
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,840
I bought everything in the shop

60
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,000
Choose as you like

61
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,440
Use chopsticks, it's oily

62
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:03,840
Use your hands

63
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,880
Do you guys have any plan for today?

64
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,560
No

65
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,720
Shan Shan

66
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,560
I mean...

67
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,720
Meng Lu will go shopping
today, will you go?

68
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,280
I'll pass

69
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,280
Are you going to the library today?

70
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,360
What are you trying to say?

71
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,040
Nothing

72
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,880
I just wanted to say

73
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,960
If you don't go out today,

74
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,920
we may watch movie together

75
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,320
Crap! Of course I'm going out
I have the graduation exam today

76
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,320
Really?

77
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,880
The graduation exam?

78
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,720
Why are you so happy?

79
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,360
I was thinking,

80
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,560
you'll be a graduate from now on

81
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,720
I'm so happy for you

82
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,200
Crazy

83
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,600
I don't know if I'll pass

84
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,040
You'll definitely pass it

85
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,760
You will make it

86
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,760
Alright, I'm going to
pack up my thing first

87
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,040
Don't be nervous in the exam

88
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,000
I never nervous in any exam

89
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,280
Is the traffic going to jam here?

90
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,760
It's hard to say

91
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,440
But don't worry

92
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,520
I'm sure you have time

93
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,480
I'm leaving

94
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,160
Good luck!

95
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,240
I'm leaving, bye

96
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,440
Good luck!

97

Task completed

98
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,400
Wang Shan is walking downstairs

99
00:10:59,600 --> 00:10:59,960
Shan Shan

100
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,240
Why are you here?

101
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,000
Let me send you

102
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,960
It's a traffic jam now

103
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,080
-Let's go, or you'll be late
-I have called the cab

104
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:14,520
Shan Shan

105
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,800
My motorcycle is faster than a cab

106
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:17,840
Shan Shan

107
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,480
It's faster than a cab

108
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,400
Wait...

109
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,360
It's faster

110
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:23,720
Shan Shan

111
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,040
It is faster

112
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,720
It is faster

113
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,960
Such a long queue

114
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:24,680
Mister

115
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,400
How long will it take?

116
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,840
It's going to be fast after this jam

117
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,840
-Maybe there's an accident ahead
-Okay

118
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:49,880
Come on

119
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,440
You'll be late, hurry!

120
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,520
Keep the change

121
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,080
Do you still want to
sit for the exam? Hurry!

122
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,080
Put it on

123
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,640
I don't...

124
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,040
I'll never come to you again
if you push me away

125
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:20,440
Good

126
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,040
Come on

127
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,160
Sit still

128
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,240
Here we are

129
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,040
So fast

130
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,920
It's near, why are you
taking me on a motorcycle?

131
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,280
I managed to borrow a motorcycle

132
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,760
What a pity if I didn't carry you!

133
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,240
Why did you borrow it?

134
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,120
I'm trying to be macho
so that you'll forgive me soon

135
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,360
But I'm the one who did wrong

136
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:12,760
Yeah

137
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,680
I forgive you then

138
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,360
I'm a gentleman anyway

139
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,640
Thank you

140
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:18,840
Alright

141
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,000
Go to the exam!

142
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,800
You're going to be late

143
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,200
Hurry!

144
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:23,920
See you

145
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:25,760
Good luck!

146
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,440
Bye

147
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,640
Try your best!

148
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,000
Alright

149
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,000
What are we going to do now?

150
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,080
Watch another movie

151
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,200
But we've watched two movies

152
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,080
Let's go shopping

153
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,760
We did it yesterday

154
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,400
Let's go for a meal

155
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,600
I'm full

156
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,480
Let's go out and exercise

157
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,920
I don't exercise

158
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,240
Walking is an exercise too

159
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,760
Don't tell me you can't play ping-pong

160
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,080
I can

161
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,680
Let's start

162
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:46,880
I'll serve

163
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,520
Here we go

164
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,840
Here it is

165
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,080
I'll really serve

166
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,520
Watch it!

167
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,080
I'm not ready yet

168
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,120
You serve

169
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,600
Come on

170
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,320
Come on

171
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,440
The table in the park
is not a standard one

172
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:38,680
Length problem

173
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:40,920
Get the ball

174
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,240
Who?

175
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,360
You should get it as you missed it

176
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,240
I'm not going

177
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:50,960
Hurry up!

178
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,880
It's a problem of the
elastic coefficient of the racket

179
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,520
Something's wrong with your skill

180
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,800
You have a problem

181
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,040
That...

182
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,680
The boy in the school
uniform is so handsome

183
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,840
Of course you're the most handsome

184
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,000
He is an awesome skateboarder

185
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,400
Hello

186
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:00,720
Hello

187
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,160
Gu Wei Yi

188
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,640
Can I have a try?

189
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:05,920
Sure

190
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,160
But, be careful

191
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,720
Can you play this?

192
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,280
It looks hard and dangerous

193
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,200
Don't play it

194
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,440
Yes, it's hard

195
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,040
Physically,

196
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,840
he stepped on his tail

197
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,400
as the axis point of the torque

198
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,800
The moment equals to
force times force arm

199
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,880
He made a distance with his feet
and skateboard to form a moment

200
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,280
He used the explosive
effort to complete it

201
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,960
In this action, the static moment that
maintains the pivot point is almost zero

202
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,080
The tail press down,
the gravity pushes the board

203
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:52,920
Watch out!

204
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,200
Are you okay?

205
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,000
Theory and practice

206
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,920
allow the existence of gap

207
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,200
Is your waist okay?

208
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:38,720
It's okay

209
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,760
It's late

210
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,600
I have to work tomorrow

211
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,280
I go back to my room first

212
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,520
Have a good rest

213
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,520
Good night

214
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:02,920
Good night

215
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:18,640
Good night

216
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,640
Good night

217
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,000
I don't think it's late

218
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,320
You're right

219
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,400
Sleepy?

220
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,440
No

221
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,280
The ad is very interesting

222
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,320
-Are you sleepy?
-No

223
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,440
I'm learning now

224
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,960
The ad is really good

225
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:13,960
I'll change it

226
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,000
"A little feeling"

227
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,720
"A little strong"

228
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:52,440
"Make the ordinary life different"

229
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,120
"Like surrounded by the warmth"

230
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,840
"The story was shaking the destiny"

231
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:09,160
"Take up the courage
to make a promise"

232
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,880
"I want to be with you
for the longer journey"

233
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,920
"The sky of glowing starlight"

234
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,840
"Slowly melt me into your eyes"

235
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,760
"I want to be with you
for the longer journey"

236
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,720
"It's all I miss"

237
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,720
"Shoulder to shoulder
with the touching moment"

238
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,480
"I want to be with you
for the longer journey"

239
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,520
"Despite the changing of world"

240
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:34,560
"Still holding each others hand"

241
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,000
"Let the time of a love song"

242
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:41,040
"witness our love forever“

243
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,080
Why do I close my eyes?

244
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,800
When should I open my eyes
so that I won't be awkward?

245
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,880
I should pretend from the beginning

246
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,360
I guess my head is heavy

247
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,520
Si Tu Mo

248
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,280
Stop pretending

249
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,360
Does your neck hurt?

250
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,840
I'm going to work

251
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,000
You need the patch?

252
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,360
No need

253
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:44,880
Help me then

254
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:49,440
I...

255
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,840
I'm going to work

256
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,320
I'll send you

257
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,960
-Are you going to campus today?
-Later

258
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,080
The stool is cold

259
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:07,720
Morning!

260
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,880
Did you check the OA?

261
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,000
What's that?

262
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,120
I thought you laughed after checking it

263
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,760
What did it send?

264
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,280
Let me see

265
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,480
No need

266
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,600
Only two things

267
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,680
First, the company's notice

268
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,280
4 creative departments
must submit at least one artwork

269
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,360
for the Golden Pin
Advertisement Design Competition

270
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,120
It has nothing to do with us

271
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,720
The permanent staffs
are lazy to join it

272
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,720
They think they are not going
to win and it's a waste of time

273
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,720
So they let the trainee to join it

274
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,520
I have a lot of things to do

275
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,480
The second news is related to us

276
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,280
Trainees can leave for
winter holiday this year

277
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,200
Wow!

278
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,360
Really?

279
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,320
Of course

280
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,520
I heard,

281
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,360
last year, there's a trainee saying

282
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,720
the winter holiday is an
official holiday for graduates

283
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,000
He requested for 3 times of pay
and brought it to the HR Bureau

284
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,520
Then?

285
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:04,960
He was fired

286
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,040
What a sad ending!

287
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,520
Winter holiday

288
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,200
The photo edit is a little overdone

289
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,800
The face is too thin

290
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,760
I'll adjust it

291
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,640
Have you checked the OA?

292
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,600
-Yeah
-Yes

293
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,480
Do it during the winter holiday

294
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,000
Give me 2 proposals for
each person after the holiday

295
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:30,880
Okay

296
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:42,640
Senior

297
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,240
How's the data?

298
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,280
It's done

299
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,720
I'll compile it
and leave it to Gu Wei Yi

300
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,040
Gu Wei Yi?

301
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,960
I can calculate too

302
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,080
I'm from the math school, okay?

303
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,400
Why do you always

304
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,280
prefer Gu Wei Yi than me?

305
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,400
He can do it faster

306
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:00,920
Gu Wei Yi

307
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,960
Xie Yu Yin wants you
to make it done in 10 minutes

308
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,760
When did I say it?

309
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,760
You said he can do it faster

310
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,360
You can't say that anyway

311
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,360
It's okay for me

312
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,160
Class

313
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,840
Look who's back

314
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,600
Senior

315
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,680
-It's been a long time
-When did you back here?

316
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,080
Come on

317
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:45,680
Gu Wei Yi

318
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,560
Come on

319
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,040
Is it?

320
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,560
You don't know her, do you?
Let me introduce

321
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,680
She is your senior, Lu Jian Shi

322
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,600
The student who went to
Heidelberg in German

323
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,240
The legendary God of Physics,

324
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,440
Senior Lu

325
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,000
Hello, I'm Zhou Lei

326
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:00,440
Hi

327
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:00,960
Hi

328
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,440
Are you Gu Wei Yi?

329
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,440
Hello

330
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,520
I have heard of you
before I went abroad

331
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,440
I hope we could go to Germany together

332
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,080
Professor

333
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,600
Is that cut and dried?

334
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,640
How could you do that?

335
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,120
No, I didn't

336
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,960
That's what she said

337
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:21,680
Don't lie

338
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,360
I told you

339
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,880
Now your senior is back

340
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,560
because the Heidelberg

341
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,520
authorized her to
watch you two with me

342
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,200
After the winter holiday,
I'll give you the exam

343
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,320
Listen

344
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,520
The result of the exam is a part of it

345
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,600
as well as the usual
experimental performance

346
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,000
There's no cut and dried

347
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,800
Look! Do you look like a scientist?

348
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,440
Okay then

349
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,960
Let me calculate it, take your rest

350
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,040
Do your work

351
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,440
Awesome

352
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,920
Pause, I'll take off my coat

353
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,480
I've never expected you're so great

354
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,040
I knew you're hot

355
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,040
Don't give me that!

356
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,400
When will Gu Wei Yi come?

357
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,400
Don't bother, let's play

358
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,720
Are you okay?

359
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,200
I'm okay, just hit by the racket

360
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,040
Be careful, don't hurt yourself

361
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,800
You'll take care of me anyway

362
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,800
-Who?
-The one who feels heartache

363
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:39,880
I'm alright

364
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,480
Here I am

365
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,400
Go and teach him

366
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:55,160
You have to let me know your level,
so I can teach in line with your ability

367
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:56,920
No level

368
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,120
No level?

369
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,640
I knew how to train you systematically

370
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,160
It's not easy

371
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,080
When will you let him play?

372
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:26,680
Him?

373
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,120
Let him master the skill first

374
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,560
What time you'll off?

375
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,160
I can leave at 6 pm if no overtime

376
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,400
Are you coming to pick me up?

377
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,080
Rushing to off?

378
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,040
No, I'm just cleaning up the things

379
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,360
Come with me

380
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,080
-You've been waiting for so long
-Not at all

381
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,360
Before Si Tu comes,

382
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,000
we have gone through

383
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,760
the execution program and plan

384
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,120
I asked you to bring her

385
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,320
because I want to say hi to her

386
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,760
Zhi Cun needs your help in the future

387
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,920
It's all from

388
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,840
our effort together, right?

389
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,840
Otherwise, the company and
brand won't put us together again

390
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,600
and requested for the original crew

391
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,640
That's because you're good enough

392
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,360
Even she's a trainee,

393
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,880
Zhi Cun always praised

394
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,240
her excellent ability

395
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,400
He wants me to work with
er in the next program

396
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,320
Thanks for the compliments

397
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,320
Zhi Cun came right after work

398
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,280
and didn't clean his make up yet

399
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,560
You may go back and rest

400
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,160
Okay

401
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,840
I have a stomach-ache and
I want to go washroom

402
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,480
I'd like to visit the company

403
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,920
Miss Sha Sha is busy

404
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,440
I don't need Miss Sha Sha,
she can help me

405
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:31,600
Mo Mo

406
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,720
Bring them around the company

407
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,960
This is the 4th creative department

408
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,240
Nothing interesting in the office

409
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,520
An actor has to experience life

410
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,680
I'll go to the washroom
nd we will leave after this

411
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,000
You have a job tomorrow morning

412
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,040
Don't you have a stomachache?

413
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,400
Linda went to the washroom
Why didn't you go with her?

414
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,800
Come on, I'll show you around

415
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,040
I don't want to go

416
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,080
You may off now

417
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,120
Why?

418
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,920
I'm big-headed

419
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,260
(Gu Wei Yi: When will you get off work?)
(6 PM if not working overtime. Coming to pick me up?)

420
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,600
Don't wait, he is not
coming to pick you up

421
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,440
No reply means not coming

422
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,920
I'm a man, I know it

423
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,280
I let you off early

424
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,880
You shouldn't do that to me!

425
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,800
Didn't you say you're big-headed?

426
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,680
I just wanted to try

427
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,800
to be big-headed
to make Linda piss off

428
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,440
You're too childish

429
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,560
My fans used to
call it "lovely contrast"

430
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,480
Stop looking at it

431
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,520
I told you, he is
not coming to pick you up

432
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,160
He's not like you

433
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,520
Why?

434
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
He's not childish?

435
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,200
Childish?

436
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,560
Go back to your work

437
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,760
That's lovely contrast

438
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,880
Is the car arrived? We're almost there

439
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,560
Gu Wei Yi

440
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,820
[Here comes the Easter Eggs...]

441
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:44,420
Si Tu Mo

442
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,500
Keep the clothes in the living room

443
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,380
Did you pay me for
keeping the clothes?

444
00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:00,260
Do you have money? My bus card is
running out of credit, give me RMB2

445
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,820
The wallet is in my pocket,
take it yourself

446
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,580
Gu Wei Yi!

447
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,340
What's wrong?

448
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:15,940
Where did you get it?

449
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,260
I printed it in front
of the restaurant

450
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,820
Where did you get it?

451
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,340
I don't know

452
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:24,940
-I...
-RMB5

453
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,780
Gu Wei Yi, say it clearly

454
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,020
Gu Wei Yi

455
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,300
Gu Wei Yi
