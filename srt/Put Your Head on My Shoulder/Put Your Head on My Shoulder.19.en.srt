00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,550
So when are you going to get married?

4
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,070
It's not our plan at the moment

[Episode 19]

6
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,070
Si Tu Mo, wake up

7
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,110
I did call you

8
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,990
"The difficulties in the books"

9
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,390
"Not a problem"

10
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:37,390
"All the puzzles come with axiom"

11
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:43,550
"I thought I have the perfect logic"

12
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:47,070
"Now I find no solution"

13
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:54,310
"That's how you came into my heart"

14
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:59,750
"Sweet and childish"

15
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:05,710
"Nothing can describe your smile"

16
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:09,710
"You bring me courage"

17
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:15,590
"Put your head on my shoulder"

18
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:21,070
"You are my unknown world"

19
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:26,750
"Untie the knot of silence for you"

20
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:32,710
"You'll never be timid"

21
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:37,390
"Put your head on my shoulder"

22
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:43,470
"Pass over the seasons hand-in-hand"

23
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:49,150
"The youth marks my
heartbeat and feeling"

24
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,230
"Our love is passionate"

25
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:57,630
"Never fade"

26
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:15,830
Mo Mo

27
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,380
Your mom?

28
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,190
They've gone out?

29
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,390
Your mom?

30
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,550
They shouldn't have gone out so early

31
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,270
Your mom?

32
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,350
The doors are closed

33
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,550
I guess they're asleep

34
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,430
My dad!

35
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,390
The sun is rising in the east

36
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,630
Sleep is a waste of time

37
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:43,590
My dad!

38
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,710
Young people shouldn't sleep
too much, I must wake him up

39
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,190
Where are you going?

40
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:54,470
Gu Wei Yi

41
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,510
Dad, mom

42
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,870
Dad, mom

43
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,030
-Uncle, aunt, morning
-Uncle, aunt, morning

44
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,270
You two...

45
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,910
Why did you change your rooms?

46
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:41,950
Mr. Si Tu

47
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:42,950
Mrs. Si Tu

48
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,590
I'm supposed to be blamed

49
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,190
as I spoil my child

50
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,950
and made this happened

51
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:50,550
But don't worry

52
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,990
We will certainly give you
a satisfactory answer

53
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,590
Gosh! Don't take it too formal

54
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:57,510
They're just

55
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,950
in love, it's not a bad thing

56
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,470
You're so serious

57
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,350
My goodness!

58
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,390
Wen Jun

59
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,830
We're here today

60
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,150
to talk about

61
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,630
their relationship

62
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,110
Unexpectedly, they're

63
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,750
so close now

64
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,310
Do you remember?

65
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,190
When Xiao Gu was small,

66
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,710
I taught you how to change his diaper

67
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:21,590
Yeah

68
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,430
So,

69
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,670
they're destined to meet

70
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:27,270
We should have arranged
the betrothal for them

71
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:27,870
Yeah

72
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,350
Well

73
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:30,110
Let's talk about their marriage

74
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,710
They're going to graduate anyway

75
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,390
What say you?

76
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,830
Then, we'll be a family

77
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,150
and always meet

78
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,310
That's right

79
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,950
Let's decide it today

80
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:40,910
Let's find a lucky day

81
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:44,390
to arrange their engagement

82
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,030
-What do you think?
-No need

83
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,350
We can check the calender
using a mobile phone

84
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:48,870
Is it?

85
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:49,830
-Let me see
-Look

86
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:50,830
Wen Jun

87
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:51,790
Look

88
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:53,350
Their wedding room is ready

89
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:56,310
If you have no objection,
just let them stay here

90
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,630
The house is pretty good

91
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,630
We could save the money

92
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,550
to buy a car for them

93
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:04,510
It's a good idea

94
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:05,630
-That's right
-Yeah

95
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,390
Look at here

96
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:07,790
Mom!

97
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,710
The date...

98
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:10,470
What's wrong?

99
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,630
We're discussing, don't interrupt

100
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:17,190
Good for marriage, it's a good date

101
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,030
We are too excited for it

102
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,310
Shall we ask for their opinion?

103
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,270
Xiao Yi, what's your opinion?

104
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:26,830
Just say it

105
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:28,190
Yeah

106
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,270
We're adults

107
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,630
We can make a good plan for ourselves

108
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,070
So,

109
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,870
what do you mean?

110
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,190
No renovation

111
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:43,430
No car

112
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:44,790
And no date

113
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,310
Well...

114
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,350
So when are you going to get married?

115
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,390
It's not our plan at the moment

116
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,750
I think they're too young now

117
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,630
We have to take a long view about it

118
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:09,510
Alright

119
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,870
It's about time

120
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,350
Get back to your study

121
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:13,630
as well as your work

122
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,630
Are we going to get married?

123
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,230
Why not?

124
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,990
I'm just asking, you said...

125
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,310
Don't think too much

126
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,750
What's wrong with you?

127
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,670
We took a long journey

128
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:17,150
to meet them here

129
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:20,070
We haven't said anything yet
and you walked away

130
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,470
I don't know what's in your mind

131
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,790
Xiao Gu is excellent

132
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,470
Mo Mo can't afford to miss him

133
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:32,030
He is excellent, but
our daughter is good too

134
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,110
Why should we please him?

135
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:37,310
What are you talking about?

136
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,750
Didn't you see

137
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,550
they're so close?

138
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,510
Moreover, your daughter

139
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,430
always wears the dirty shirt for
several days without washing it

140
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,870
That's called go-green

141
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,630
You should send your
brain to recycle bin

142
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,230
Didn't you hear what Xiao Gu said?

143
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,870
That's not in his plan

144
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,350
It means he doesn't want
to marry our daughter

145
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:02,230
While you're busy planning for them

146
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,030
You're trying to please him

147
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,950
He didn't mean it

148
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,470
You don't understand
a scientist's mind

149
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,430
He said, it's not his plan at the moment

150
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,550
He referred to the current stage

151
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,270
and the current month

152
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:20,590
I tell you

153
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,830
He does everything accurately

154
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,830
He's different with you
who has no sense of time

155
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:26,870
Okay then

156
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,070
I can't communicate with you

157
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,110
I don't want to
communicate with you either

158
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,670
What a pig-headed!

159
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,150
Come on

160
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,870
No point you're anxious now

161
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,790
Sit down, have some tea

162
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:48,710
and take a rest

163
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:51,150
We have to catch a plane later

164
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:52,670
Come on

165
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:53,830
How could I sit down?

166
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,510
Didn't you see Wen Jun's
husband's face just now?

167
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,070
He must be pissed off with Xiao Yi

168
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:01,190
You're the one who spoils him

169
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,310
Xiao Yi's wilful act

170
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,790
is exactly like you

171
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:05,470
Well

172
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,950
I'll call Mr. Si Tu to say sorry

173
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:10,710
No! Don't mess with it

174
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,030
You're really annoying

175
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:15,230
Well I'll call Wen Jun
to explain to her after this

176
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,630
It's all my fault

177
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,510
I'm too stubborn

178
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,550
I saw only the surface,

179
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,430
never see its nature

180
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:27,670
I can tell that

181
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,670
our son likes that girl

182
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:32,630
Because I found

183
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,750
the way

184
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,670
he looked at the girl

185
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,750
is same with

186
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,510
how he looked at a fine porcelain

187
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:45,270
Dear Mr. Gu

188
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:46,830
You're awesome

189
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:48,790
Let me ask you then

190
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,190
Why did Xiao Yi say

191
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,790
the marriage wasn't in his plan?

192
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,470
You shouldn't ask me

193
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,710
You should ask our son

194
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:29,910
What's the time now?

195
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:32,670
Why are you sleeping here?

196
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,710
They switched off the
lights too early last night

197
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,510
It's hard to read in the dorm

198
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,630
So I sleep in the lab

199
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,910
You have exam in
your faculty recently?

200
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:48,110
You forgot it? We have an exam
for the Germany exchange

201
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:51,310
I'm working cross-professional,
so I must work harder

202
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,950
That's why you asked me for the notes

203
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:57,710
Yeah

204
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,710
Did you give me all the notes?
Did you hide part of it?

205
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,750
The coming exam is about

206
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:05,630
quantum mechanics

207
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:07,710
I'll give you a more detailed note

208
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,390
That's great

209
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,670
Give me enough time

210
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:12,870
and I must beat you down

211
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:14,910
Okay

212
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,110
What's kind of your attitude?

213
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,350
Let's see, I must beat you down

214
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,630
Don't make prediction
without scientific basis

215
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,070
It's raining

216
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:33,470
Get down

217
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,670
Are you crazy?

218
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:37,990
Wang Shan will be here soon

219
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,030
Pack your things up

220
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,190
This is too much

221
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,150
You guys bring your girlfriend
to the dorm and chase me out

222
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:44,710
I'm neither pig nor goat

223
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:45,550
Don't chase me out

224
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,030
Come down and cut the crap

225
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,270
Hurry!

226
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,310
I'm so nervous

227
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,230
Me too

228
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,270
What should we do now?

229
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:15,510
What about

230
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,150
forget it?

231
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,350
Next time

232
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,270
No way

233
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:24,430
I've been waiting you for so long

234
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,470
Well, I didn't do it purposely

235
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:34,830
Come on

236
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,190
Shan Shan

237
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,230
What's wrong? Don't scare me

238
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:05,430
31 marks more than
the marking line of last year

239
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,110
I was busy in love with you,
but still make it

240
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,310
I'm really a studybug

241
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,430
Prof. Jiang took the
kitten to the pet clinic today

242
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,750
You just have to finish
what you haven't done yet

243
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:07,990
and no need to
come in the afternoon

244
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,750
I have a lot of questions
to ask Prof. Jiang

245
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,350
But he's not here,
what should I do now?

246
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,990
Senior, are you free today?

247
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:18,870
No, I'm not

248
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:20,870
Okay

249
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,270
Gu Wei Yi, stay with me

250
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,070
Aren't you going to
sort out the notes for me?

251
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:27,270
So you can explain it to me
while sorting it out

252
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,590
I'm not learning from you

253
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:31,550
We are exploring and
making progress together

254
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,030
I'm not free

255
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,910
You have no lectures anymore, right?

256
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:38,190
-What makes you busy?
-I'm going to fetch Si Tu Mo

257
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,590
Xie Yu Yin, what about you?

258
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:44,590
I'm not free either

259
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,270
I'm busy with the postgraduate thesis

260
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:47,350
Zhou Lei

261
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,750
Have you done your work?

262
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,630
I still have several observation data

263
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:54,990
Hurry up then

264
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,350
Alright

265
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,540
You're not nervous at all, huh?

266
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,470
My girlfriend is a whiz-kid

267
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:29,270
We should have a similarity

268
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:45,510
Look at it

269
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:46,590
432 points

270
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:47,470
You passed it

271
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:48,230
You passed it

272
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:49,910
You passed it!

273
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:50,470
Look at it

274
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,190
I told you

275
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,350
Don't be kidding

276
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:06,870
What?

277
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:08,710
Where's my reward?

278
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,670
I'll buy you a meal

279
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:13,790
No way

280
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,670
I want the reward right now

281
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:16,870
Now?

282
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,950
I have nothing...

283
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:26,550
What are you doing?

284
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,190
Redeeming the reward

285
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:01,990
Senior

286
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,230
I read this book too

287
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,230
Gu Wei Yi

288
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,790
I hope you'll be selected

289
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:16,830
Thank you

290
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:19,990
There are many questions
of calculation in the exam

291
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,790
It's not fair to you

292
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:35,590
Gu Wei Yi

293
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,430
I knew you're in the library

294
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:40,670
Is it raining?

295
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:45,630
I just went to the shower

296
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,030
to avoid the peak

297
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,230
I have been studying
in the lab recently

298
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:52,310
-So I went to the shower first
-Anything I can help you?

299
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,070
That's right

300
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:56,590
You promised to sort out
the notes and explain it to me

301
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,470
When did I promise you?

302
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,030
Hey you!

303
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:03,830
You promised me before

304
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,270
Did you forget it?

305
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,950
This is a library

306
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:10,990
I'm so sorry

307
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,030
Senior Lu

308
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,510
Why are you two together?

309
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:20,110
She didn't give me tips

310
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,510
We just happened to meet here

311
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:25,830
Okay

312
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,070
I believe you

313
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,830
Anyway, I think  Senior Lu

314
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:29,830
won't do that

315
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:32,790
Gu Wei Yi

316
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:36,550
I've marked all the questions

317
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,910
I don't understand it, please explain

318
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:40,750
I'll write it for you

319
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:42,670
No, explain to me directly

320
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,710
It's more convenient and clearer

321
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:50,470
The experiment shows microscopic
particles have wave-particle duality

322
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,510
The momentum conservation
of collision energy

323
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:02,550
Should be like this

324
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,030
A shape like this

325
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,510
A circle on the front

326
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,070
Gu Wei Yi

327
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:21,710
You're really amazing

328
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,830
So sorry

329
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,270
It's about time

330
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:32,990
I'm going to fetch Si Tu Mo

331
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,510
I still have so many questions

332
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,430
You don't have to pick her up

333
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:37,670
Doesn't she have legs?

334
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:40,790
Okay

335
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:41,990
She has legs

336
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,110
I'll sort out the notes tonight

337
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,070
Call me if you have any questions

338
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:55,070
Dates before mates, huh?
How could you leave me alone?

339
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:56,390
I don't care

340
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:06,310
Hello

341
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:08,150
What are you doing?

342
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:09,350
I'm going to pick you up

343
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,430
I will be busy for
a whole day in the studio

344
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,790
Si Tu Mo! Mr. Lin is calling you

345
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:15,390
Coming

346
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:18,510
-I'll get back to my work first
-Okay

347
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,150
Tell me when you finish it

348
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:21,790
-I'll pick you up
-Okay

349
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:22,550
Bye

350
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:27,230
Look! She doesn't even
need you to pick her up

351
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:28,150
Come on

352
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:31,510
Let's continue to enjoy
the ocean of knowledge

353
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,310
Hey sis!

354
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,830
Are you the crew who
works with Xiao Lin today?

355
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:36,990
No, I'm not

356
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:39,710
Wait

357
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,950
You're wearing the staff ID card

358
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:46,350
Can you do me a favor?

359
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,350
No, I must get back to my work

360
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:51,390
Could you help me to record
his moaning on the bed?

361
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:54,510
Oops, no!

362
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:55,990
What makes you blush?

363
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:58,710
I mean the wake-up
ring tone of Xiao Lin's voice

364
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,110
Please

365
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:02,750
I can't help on this

366
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:03,550
Sis

367
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,430
I'm going to sit for the
university entrance exam soon

368
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:08,590
My parents stopped me from joining
the fans club and surfing Internet

369
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:09,590
But Xiao Lin

370
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,030
is my motivation to learn

371
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:13,590
They removed all the pictures

372
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,470
and posters in my room

373
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,710
I have nothing left now

374
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,110
Please help me

375
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,230
I can't help you

376
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,070
I'll see you next time

377
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,110
You must help me

378
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:28,030
The kids nowadays
are all blinded with stars

379
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,150
I'm so sorry, Miss Xue Yu

380
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,870
Can't you just walk properly?

381
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,470
What a careless girl!

382
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,590
What's up?

383
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,670
Zhao Xue Yu is too big-headed

384
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:51,590
She's ordering all the people here

385
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,430
I don't know anyone here,
so I could only look for you

386
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:58,070
I told you, she doesn't like you

387
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:01,870
The shooting has started for 2 hours
and she fooled you for 1.5 hours

388
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,030
I knew

389
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:06,110
So I tried so hard to put up
with her after the "fake accident"

390
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,310
You're trying so hard

391
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,070
Maybe she will spare you for 2 minutes

392
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,350
I should thank her then

393
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,390
Why are you using an old phone?

394
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,030
Your fan gave it to me

395
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:15,790
She wants to have your
voice as her wake-up ring tone

396
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:16,630
That's so easy

397
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:17,910
I'll help you

398
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,350
You may say no either

399
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:21,550
I'm afraid if you leave your job
behind and act like a boss

400
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,950
I'm not you

401
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,390
I'm going to record the moaning

402
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:34,350
Lin Zhi...

403
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,750
Okay, next pose

404
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:48,670
Okay

405
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,550
Take a rest first

406
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:56,070
Buy me a drink

407
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:57,390
Okay

408
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,470
Miss Xue Yu, your green tea

409
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,070
Is this potable?

410
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:10,310
Coffee

411
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,070
Miss Xue Yu, your coffee

412
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,750
So hot!

413
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:20,630
Lemonade

414
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:21,990
Okay

415
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:25,190
Miss Xue Yu, your lemonade

416
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:27,870
So cold

417
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:28,910
Don't you know girls

418
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:30,070
can't drink cold drinks?

419
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:37,430
So sorry, you should ask your
assistant to buy it for you

420
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:38,870
I think she should know you

421
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:39,710
better than I do

422
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:41,350
She's busy

423
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,350
I don't think so

424
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,830
Behave yourself

425
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,550
Do you know who I am?

426
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:48,670
Of course I know

427
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,190
I have checked it on Baidu last night

428
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,110
Si Tu

429
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:52,630
Have you checked about me?

430
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,270
Yes, you have 2 pages
of news more than her

431
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:57,390
-You...
-I'm going to buy you drinks

432
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,950
I think she wants
to quit from this field

433
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,590
What if tomorrow's headline

434
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,470
shows "Zhao Xue Yu

435
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:12,470
is a big-headed and tortured the crew"?

436
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:19,710
What picture do you think
they should use to match

437
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,670
the fake news?

438
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:25,830
Now you're working with a pop star

439
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:29,310
Be prepared to get stalked
by the paparazzi for 24 hours

440
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,590
You've tried so hard to be popular

441
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,550
Don't go too far then

442
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:36,070
Don't make me expose your affair

443
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,630
Where's your picture then?

444
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:38,270
You...

445
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,070
Let's wait and see

446
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:49,110
You're mugged

447
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,190
Cut it out! I'm going to get fired

448
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,710
Don't worry, I've nailed it

449
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:54,150
Really?

450
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,270
Of course

451
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:55,910
Don't worry

452
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,550
That's great

453
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,870
My legs gave way when
I was walking out after the fight

454
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:03,390
Silly girl!

455
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,510
How dare you find her then?

456
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:09,790
The company looks for her her as
you two are popular and famous

457
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:14,390
She's bad-tempered

458
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:17,350
For you

459
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:19,270
Thank you

460
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:31,870
-Do you really want to buy me a meal?
-Of course

461
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,710
It's a reward for you to pass CET 4

462
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:35,950
But I have redeemed it

463
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:38,950
Shut up!

464
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:44,390
Your phone is ringing

465
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:52,630
Hello

466
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,190
I'm going to your place
for business trip in two days

467
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:58,750
Remember Aunt Lin Lin
whom you met last time?

468
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,190
What's up?

469
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,710
She'll introduce her classmate to you

470
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:02,750
She's from a literary family

471
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,070
and has a master degree abroad

472
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:04,950
She is courteous

473
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,510
and our families are well-matched

474
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:09,350
You're a parvenu and
she's a master degree

475
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:10,950
Behave yourself

476
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,310
Mind your words!

477
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:14,350
I have a girlfriend

478
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:16,710
Your own girlfriend

479
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:18,710
must be indecent

480
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:21,030
A blind date, huh? Alright

481
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:22,430
I'll go

482
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:25,510
But don't regret it

483
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:32,990
It's my father

484
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,190
Let's order

485
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:46,790
Alright, let's call it a day

486
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:47,990
Thank you

487
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:48,750
Thank you

488
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,230
Thanks for your hard work

489
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:52,390
Don't go first

490
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,630
I'll buy you dinner today!

491
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,390
Thank you!

492
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:58,630
Si Tu

493
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:00,230
Miss Xue Yu

494
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,790
Let's go for dinner

495
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,910
Let me apologize to you

496
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:05,590
Thank you, I'll pass

497
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,790
-My boyfriend will pick me up later
-Come on

498
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,630
You must go with us

499
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:11,510
Or you don't give me face

500
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:23,390
Gu Wei Yi, I'm done

501
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,630
The crew asked me
to go to dinner together

502
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,470
Why don't you pick me up after an hour?

503
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:30,830
-I'll send you the address
-Okay, wait for me

504
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:32,590
Bye

505
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,750
Thanks for your hard work

506
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:48,390
I'm very happy to work with you

507
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:51,390
I hope we could work
together again in the future

508
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:53,390
Cheers!

509
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,310
Come on

510
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:57,790
Thank you, Miss Xue Yu

511
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:59,150
Thank you, Miss Xue Yu

512
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:00,910
-Thanks, Miss Xue Yu
-Thank you!

513
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,030
Have a seat

514
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,310
Why is he taking so long?

515
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:23,710
Si Tu

516
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:26,110
You have worked hard today

517
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,310
Not at all

518
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:29,030
Thank you for your tolerance

519
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,550
In term of tolerance,

520
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,750
I can't do better than Zhi Cun

521
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,830
Did I say something wrong?

522
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:37,510
It's okay

523
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:38,190
Have a seat

524
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:42,870
If you really want to thank me,
bottoms up then

525
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,950
Look at that

526
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:53,230
Zhi Cun

527
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,750
It seems Si Tu gets drunk

528
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:56,950
You send her home

529
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:59,070
Where's Si Tu's house? Let me send her

530
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,830
You should ask Zhi Cun

531
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,470
I want to go home

532
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:22,750
Who are you?

533
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:26,430
Her boyfriend

534
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:28,630
Lovely contrast

535
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,670
But you have to prove it to them

536
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:39,630
Si Tu Mo

537
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:41,350
I'm not drunk

538
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:43,590
Who's Circle's dad?

539
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:46,270
You

540
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:48,030
Who's Circle's mom?

541
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:49,190
Me

542
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,230
You two...

543
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,350
Who's Circle?

544
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:56,990
She has a child at such a young age

545
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:58,510
I can't see it

546
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,510
I'm throwing up

547
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:17,150
I'm throwing up

548
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,870
I can't

549
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:37,870
I can't spit it out, help me

550
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:42,150
I can't spit it out, help me

551
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:43,790
I can't help you

552
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:45,950
Let Circle wait for a while

553
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:48,070
I'll try to spit it out

554
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:49,390
Circle is not here

555
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:50,430
What?

556
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:52,270
Where's Circle?

557
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:54,110
Call him!

558
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,110
You're drunk

559
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:13,070
I was throwing up when you hit me

560
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:15,870
Please hit me

561
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:19,430
Let's go home
