3
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,580
Do you think I'm cute?

4
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,140
Cute

5
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:43,580
So cute

[Episode 13]

7
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,140
We meet again. What a coincidence!

8
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:11,740
Yes

9
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,380
There's something that I'd like to ask

10
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:36,140
Do you think there's a pure friendship
between a man and a woman?

11
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,540
You're staying with Gu Wei Yi,

12
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,500
but you two are not a couple

13
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,780
So I'm wondering about it

14
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,540
Or you guys...

15
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,260
No

16
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,980
We're just friends

17
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:58,060
But when a man stays
with a woman, they might...

18
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:58,940
Absolutely no

19
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:14,980
Senior

20
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,780
Why did you ask? Are you into Gu Wei Yi?

21
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,460
Yeah

22
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:24,540
Oh yeah

23
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,700
He said he'll lunch with me.
Why didn't he come?

24
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,860
I thought he's in the old campus

25
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,340
We moved here long time
ago, didn't he tell you?

26
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:34,500
No

27
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,020
Maybe he thinks I'm not important...

28
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,660
He thinks it's not important,
so he doesn't need to tell me

29
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,700
Yeah, as you're not
doing the experiments

30
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:48,500
Gu Wei Yi

31
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:50,980
I'll go get him

32
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,060
You're so slow, don't eat

33
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:05,780
You...

34
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,340
I haven't taken my lunch yet

35
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,940
I'll buy you a treat

36
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,490
Where's Si Tu Mo?

37
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,060
Let's dig in

38
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,020
-What's wrong?
-Let's go out

39
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,900
-Didn't you want to go out?
-What's happened?

40
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,100
The food at the canteen sucks

41
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,100
You look like trying to run away

42
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,180
It's on me. Want to go?

43
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:52,820
Sure

44
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:53,700
Let's go

45
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:54,820
Wait

46
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,380
I need to send the meal box to Ke

47
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,940
-Let me call him to get it himself
-What?

48
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,380
My mobile phone

49
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,060
I left it at the canteen

50
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,260
As well as my meal card

51
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,460
I'll kill you if my phone's gone

52
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,820
I'll kill myself

53
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,540
Your phone is with you, huh?

54
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,220
Hello

55
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,020
Your friend's phone and
your meal card are with me

56
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,500
I'll go get them now

57
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,740
I'm back to the lab for something,
see you in the lab

58
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:25,580
Okay

59
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,100
Gu Wei Yi is keeping it
and he's back to the lab

60
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,300
Let's see him after lunch

61
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,180
I've promised Ke to go for a movie

62
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,780
Help me put it in the dorm

63
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,660
Okay, let's go for lunch

64
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,220
I must have something expensive

65
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,020
No way

66
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:39,620
No way

67
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,660
I have no money

68
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,060
Gu...

69
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,580
How? Is it cute?

70
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,020
It's so cute

71
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,780
How could you let
Prof. Jiang chase it out?

72
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,020
Don't bring me into this

73
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,900
Do you think I'm cute?

74
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,260
I'll come to you if you don't respond

75
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:28,660
Okay

76
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:30,940
Cute

77
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,180
Are you Gu Wei Yi's friend?

78
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:42,940
Prof. Jiang

79
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,420
Looking for Gu?

80
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,900
-I want to get something from him
-Where's he?

81
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,300
-I don't know
-I'm here

82
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,180
What are you doing there?

83
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,460
Thinking

84
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,300
Thinking?

85
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:01,820
Alright

86
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,580
Take your time

87
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,700
-Waited for so long?
Just a while

88
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,420
There you go

89
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,420
Thank you, I'm off

90
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,300
Where to?

91
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,220
Dorm

92
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,180
-What time will you go home?
-I don't know

93
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,100
-Let's go back together
-I don't want to disturb you

94
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,420
It's alright

95
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,540
-I...
-I'm not alright

96
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,500
What's wrong again?

97
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:39,900
Jealous again?

98
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,020
I didn't do anything

99
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,220
Class

100
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,140
Let's call it a day

101
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,540
It's about time

102
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,100
Okay

103
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,340
Professor, I'm off

104
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:13,820
Okay

105
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,020
See you

106
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,260
Zhou Lei, wait a moment

107
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,180
Stay here

108
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,500
Clean the lab

109
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,140
thoroughly

110
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,660
Prof. Jiang

111
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,100
Why me?

112
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,740
How dare you ask?

113
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,060
Your kitten messed the whole lab up

114
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:30,980
Can't you see it?

115
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,860
-You must clean it up
-I...

116
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,420
Let me do it

117
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,740
Prof. Jiang, he wants to clean it

118
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,890
Aren't you ashamed?

119
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,740
Look at Gu Wei Yi and look at yourself

120
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:42,500
Oh, no!

121
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,300
Are you going to give
him an extra lesson?

122
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,620
Stay here for the extra lesson then

123
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:52,700
Take your time

124
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,620
What's your trick?

125
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,700
-I'm waiting for someone
-Who?

126
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,140
I got it

127
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,140
Clean it then

128
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,260
I'm off

129
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,100
Take your time

130
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,940
Love can make one do everything

131
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,700
I'm leaving, take your time!

132
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:23,860
Bye

133
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:08,940
Xiao Gu

134
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,500
-Why are you here?
-Waiting for someone

135
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:14,700
Waiting for someone?

136
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,580
Call her and ask her to come down

137
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,220
She didn't pick up

138
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,980
Whom are you looking for?

139
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,460
Let me bring her

140
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:23,980
It's alright

141
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,780
I'll wait for a while

142
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,980
Now you're here, don't be ashamed

143
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,700
Are you waiting for her?

144
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,100
Is she the girl you
mentioned that day?

145
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,020
No

146
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,580
You scared me

147
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,420
They are a lovely couple

148
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,940
You can't make them apart

149
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:46,940
They're a couple?

150
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,540
You know them?

151
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,140
The guy waits for her everyday

152
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,300
They'd bring many books along

153
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,060
when they went out

154
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,860
They study even when dating

155
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,460
I think they're going to make it

156
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,300
Stop!

157
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,340
What are you doing in girls' dorm?

158
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,220
I left something here

159
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,060
Call her to bring it down

160
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,180
That's crap!

161
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,340
Miss me!

162
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,700
Gu Wei Yi, what brings you here?

163
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:19,940
Waiting for Si Tu Mo

164
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,020
Sorry for that day

165
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,540
That day?

166
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,140
What did he do to you?

167
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,700
We went to Mo Mo's house

168
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,900
and cooked porridge for him

169
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,540
Don't be afraid

170
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,060
You helped him, didn't you?

171
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,820
He thought I helped you to get
Mo Mo and he's angry with me

172
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,260
You were trying to bring us together

173
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,460
It's all my fault, sorry

174
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,260
I accept your apology

175
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:48,620
Fu Pei

176
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,340
Let's talk

177
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,260
We should've gone for a fight
for what happened before

178
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,220
Did you tell Si Tu Mo
about you and Wang Shan?

179
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,620
We have made it clear

180
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,660
You meant...

181
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,220
Gu Wei Yi

182
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,660
I seldom see you like this

183
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,060
We've been living together
in the dorm for 4 years

184
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,780
You only look human today

185
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,060
Answer it

186
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,460
We have made it clear

187
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,900
She doesn't like me and
I don't like her either

188
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,260
We're apart

189
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:18,580
She could

190
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:25,140
fall for someone else

191
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,300
I could be with Wang Shan too

192
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:28,780
We can't stop each other

193
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,220
Really?

194
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,300
Of course

195
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,180
Who do you think I am?

196
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:47,580
I was hurt by Mo Mo and
it left a shadow in my heart

197
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,180
Why are you laughing?

198
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,300
You snatched my girlfriend

199
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,900
You're such a scum

200
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,460
Was she your girlfriend at that time?

201
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,220
Almost

202
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,140
I feel like giving you a whack

203
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,220
Let's fight then

204
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,420
Don't call her Mo Mo again if you lose

205
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,620
Are you crazy today?

206
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:48,940
You called me?

207
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,540
Why didn't you pick up?

208
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,700
I was taking a shower and
my phone was in the living room

209
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,060
Are you home?

210
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,740
-Why didn't you tell me?
-Why should I?

211
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,100
Alright, bye

212
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:08,860
She hung up on you?

213
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,780
Mo Mo is not easy to handle

214
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,420
Alright

215
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,860
Si Tu Mo

216
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:30,300
Si Tu Mo, I won't call her Mo Mo again

217
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,540
Insane

218
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,680
Do you think I'm cute?

219
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:10,600
Cute

220
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:11,840
So cute

221
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,170
"Cute my ass"

222
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,800
You have the keys

223
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,160
Can't you tell it's a song?

224
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,080
No

225
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,520
Listen

226
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,400
"If I had a wand"

227
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,400
"I can be big, small or pretty"

228
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,520
"I want to get a house"

229
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,830
"full of comics and chocolates"

230
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,030
"If I had a machine cat"

231
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,000
"I'll call it Doraemon"

232
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:22,120
"A hopter and time tunnel
can bring us to everywhere"

233
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:22,760
Stop it

234
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,040
Is the juice nice?

235
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,240
Try to drink more than 10 bottles

236
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,320
Drink it with a mug?

237
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,680
I did use a mug

238
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,240
Si Tu Mo

239
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,600
What's wrong?

240
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,800
Aren't you working in
an adverstising company?

241
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,640
Why did you only look into the flavour?

242
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,520
What are you looking at?

243
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,040
Show you something magic

244
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:06,920
No, thanks

245
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,560
Take a look

246
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:31,960
Come on

247
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,000
The orange juice under zoom 2000X

248
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,720
What is this? Why is it moving?

249
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,600
Microorganism?

250
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,600
Let me see

251
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,680
Not microorganism

252
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,800
It's tiny particles in Brownian motion

253
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,600
Your cutie suddenly appears

254
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,200
Do you think I'm cute?

255
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,000
I'll come to you

256
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,560
if you don't respond

257
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,120
Get back to your room! You are disturbing me!

258
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,280
For you

259
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,400
What's this?

260
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,400
Take a look

261
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,080
I don't want it

262
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,360
I thought it was sold out.
Where did he get it?

263
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,520
I love it

264
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,480
Gu Wei Yi

265
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,680
Finally, you bring it back

266
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:41,760
Let me try it

267
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:42,600
Let me see

268
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,320
Gu Wei Yi

269
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,720
You're living outside

270
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,320
So?

271
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,760
You are the only one

272
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,440
who lives outside among us

273
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,000
Now we have an honorable task for you

274
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,400
Not interested

275
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,120
Prof. Jiang stops me
to keep the kitten in the lab

276
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,520
He's extremely strict these few days

277
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,320
Are you willing to
see the kitten homeless?

278
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,240
Yes, I am

279
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,640
What an emotionless killer!

280
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,920
We received the client's message yesterday

281
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,000
They have changed their
spokesman to a new artist

282
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,240
His name is...

283
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,320
Lin Zhi Cun

284
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,400
Yes, Lin Zhi Cun

285
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:41,960
Jie Er

286
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,200
Find out his information and sort it out

287
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:44,840
Okay

288
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,240
So, we should change

289
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,800
our thinking as well

290
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,160
Don't think he's famous
like super star Zhao Xue Yu

291
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,240
Don't think about
the difficulty of shooting

292
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,880
Focus on the creativity

293
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,160
Li Na

294
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,760
Get several proposals
done in these few days

295
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:00,800
Okay

296
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,840
One more thing

297
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,200
There's graphic design competition

298
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,920
We have distributed the message in OA

299
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,320
You may have a look if you're interested

300
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:24,840
Gu Wei Yi

301
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,160
Why are you here?

302
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,120
Buying books

303
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,200
The perspective of advertising?

304
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,520
Are you sitting for advertising?

305
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:35,720
Just for fun

306
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,600
For fun?

307
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,400
I don't think so

308
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,720
Let me think

309
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,520
Who works in an advertising company?

310
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,440
I know

311
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:46,880
I'm off

312
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,200
Don't go

313
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,240
-I haven't finished
-Take your time, I'll go there

314
00:23:59,200 --> 00:23:59,960
Why did you buy the book?

315
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,480
She always gets mad
without reason recently

316
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,880
I'm wondering if it's related to her job

317
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,160
What's wrong with you?
You said you stopped...

318
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,800
I feel happy for you

319
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,360
Finally, you're growing up and
know how to take your initiative

320
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,640
But do you think you can

321
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,520
find the answer from the book?

322
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,240
Why not?

323
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,320
Only several conditions
will make a girl mad

324
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,400
Can't eat or sleep well

325
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,480
and the menstruation pain

326
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,800
I don't think so

327
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:36,440
Well...

328
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,360
Tell me what happened recently

329
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,560
Lin Zhi Cun is quite handsome

330
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,360
Really?

331
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,320
Send me the picture

332
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,760
-I'll send it to the chat group
-Okay

333
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,440
Look! Is he good-looking?

334
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,680
Look at it

335
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,200
-Is he good-looking?
-Not bad

336
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,640
Look at his mouth

337
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,000
Do you want to kiss him?

338
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,120
No

339
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,560
You're loyal to Fu Pei

340
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,640
We are not...

341
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,440
What?

342
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,800
-We're not a couple
-Who is your boyfriend then?

343
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,960
Look at your face

344
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,160
Tell me!

345
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,320
-Go back to your seat
-No way

346
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,240
See ya

347
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,440
Are you in love?

348
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,480
No

349
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,400
Liar

350
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,560
Your face told me that you're in love

351
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,480
Or you met

352
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,080
a flirt?

353
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,240
Cute

354
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,400
So cute

355
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,800
This is what happened recently

356
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,120
That means Si Tu Mo was angry

357
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,160
because of your senior

358
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,200
It's easy

359
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,360
She gets jealous

360
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,720
Prof. Jiang told me the same too

361
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,360
But she's angry outside the lab that day

362
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,720
My senior wasn't there

363
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,240
Are you sure?

364
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:25,960
Think again

365
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:26,880
Was she there?

366
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:32,760
She was!

367
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,880
She's playing with
a kitten in the stairwell

368
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,760
She was jealous with our conversation

369
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,560
What a smart boy!

370
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,800
I know Si Tu Mo very well

371
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,320
Come to me if you have any problem

372
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,360
I'll be your counselor

373
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,160
So, you'll get Si Tu Mo easily

374
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,840
But you didn't get her, right?

375
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,000
You guys still chatting?

376
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,320
Just finished

377
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:04,960
Let's go

378
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,520
Let's go for a movie

379
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,960
Don't bother the single man

380
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,280
See you

381
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:16,960
Senior

382
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,520
Don't count on Gu Wei Yi

383
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,720
He refused to help

384
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,160
Cold-blooded

385
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,520
-Gu Wei Yi, can't you really...
-Senior

386
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,640
Don't beg him

387
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,520
No need

388
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,120
When he finds his conscience back,

389
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,240
he'll be in tears and regret it

390
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,560
-Give it to me, I'll take care of it
-No way

391
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,160
Cut it out! He just agreed

392
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,320
Give the kitten to him

393
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,040
He refused to take care of it before

394
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,960
Why should I give it to him?

395
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,080
I tell you

396
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,040
Even if the kitten and I are homeless

397
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,320
or starve to death,

398
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,960
we won't beg him

399
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,920
What if I put the kitten

400
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,800
at the animal shelter

401
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,720
and bring it back in 2 days?

402
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,760
Will they allow it?

403
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,480
Call and ask them

404
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:13,720
Okay

405
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:19,680
Zhou Lei

406
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:21,880
Give it to me

407
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,320
I really want it

408
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,440
No way

409
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,440
What do you want me to do?

410
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,360
Beg me

411
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,080
I beg you

412
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,480
Gu Wei Yi

413
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,240
You begged me readily

414
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,640
I don't feel satisfied at all

415
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,240
Put it in a bag later

416
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:54,720
Look

417
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,760
It's funny

418
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,520
Let me with chat him

419
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,600
That's right

420
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,160
The guy is handsome

421
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,240
Really

422
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,040
He's carrying a kitten

423
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,520
He must be a kind man

424
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,920
Go chat with him

425
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,440
-It's not appropriate
-Go!

426
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,160
Go ahead

427
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,360
Okay

428
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,120
Hello

429
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,640
The kitten is cute

430
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,120
I always want one

431
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,400
Mew...

432
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,240
It's not mine

433
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,480
Where did you buy the bag?

434
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,320
I don't know

435
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,480
Could I add you in WeChat?

436
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:41,560
Look

437
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,560
Where did you get it?

438
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,400
I'll tell you later. Let's go

439
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,120
All smart guys have a girlfriend

440
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,680
Where did you get it?
You want to raise a kitten?

441
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,920
Zhou Lei asked me to keep it for a while

442
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:07,800
Cute?

443
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,520
Not bad

444
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,000
My senior said, this is
the cutest stage of a kitten

445
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,360
Really?

446
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,360
It will faint if we walk too fast

447
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:47,920
Alright

448
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,600
I'll give you a knack
Si Tu Mo taught me

449
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,240
A girl can't stop a sticker

450
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,440
Stick on her

451
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,600
Follow wherever she goes

452
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,440
What's wrong?

453
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,400
I don't know what to do with it

454
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,400
Why did you

455
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,720
bring it back then?

456
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,760
Zhou Lei said he couldn't keep it

457
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,600
in the dorm

458
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,960
My senior lives in the dorm too

459
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,080
Take care of it

460
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,720
Why should I?

461
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,400
I don't like cats

462
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,360
Why did you bring it back then?

463
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,960
Because someone got it wrong

464
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,720
When we were in the stairwell,

465
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,680
I meant the kitten was cute,
not my senior

466
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,600
Actually...

467
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,520
Why suddenly want to see a movie ?

468
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,720
I bought the tickets long time ago

469
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,160
We made a deal before

470
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,440
We'd have a date including
dinner, shopping and movie

471
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,120
I've been hoping to take you to a movie

472
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,040
I won't let you out

473
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,480
I'm allergic to cats

474
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,080
Stop mewing

475
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,280
I won't fall for that

476
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,680
Come out yourself

477
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,390
What's wrong?

478
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,240
I have an allergy

479
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:25,840
Really?

480
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,600
Even mantis prawn and kitten

481
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,160
You're really too much

482
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:30,800
I'm serious

483
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:34,040
I'll bring it into my room

484
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,350
So cute

485
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,440
"Arrived at the destination"

486
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:07,880
Come on!

487
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,160
I want to kiss you

488
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,200
Good

489
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,800
I like you the most

490
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,360
Si Tu Ding Dang is so cute

491
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,160
Like your name?

492
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,200
Ding Dang

493
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,480
I'm calling you Si Tu Ding Dang, okay?

494
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,480
So good

495
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:40,520
Hello

496
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,520
Si Tu Mo is staying in the room

497
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,480
I can't stick on her

498
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,680
What?

499
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,960
Go to her room

500
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,880
-She has a cat there
-Cat?

501
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,880
Lure her out then

502
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,880
I'm watching a movie, bye!

503
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,320
-What's wrong?
-It's okay

504
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,280
Let's go out and let it stay in the room

505
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,440
You may go out,
we don't have to go with you

506
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,800
I want to play with it

507
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,840
Close the door when you go out

508
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,240
Don't let it out

509
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,920
Have some water

510
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,200
Si Tu Mo

511
00:36:59,040 --> 00:36:59,840
Anything?

512
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,760
-Come out for a while
-I'm playing with Si Tu Ding Dang

513
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,000
It will go out if I open the door

514
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:05,680
Who?

515
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,240
Si Tu Ding Dang

516
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,320
I gave it the name

517
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,280
What is it?

518
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,320
Let's clean the house

519
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,800
It's night time now

520
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,280
-The house is full of cat fur
-Let Circle clean it

521
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,640
Circle is tired and needs a rest

522
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,920
I'm tired too

523
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,440
I need a rest

524
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,280
"A cat likes to bath
will have healthy skin"

525
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,240
"Stay away from fleas
and so much bubble"

526
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,440
"Si Tu Ding Dang is pretty"

527
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,480
Don't be afraid, I'll give you a bath

528
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,720
Don't be afraid of water

529
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,120
Good boy

530
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:06,760
Did it hurt you?

531
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,720
No, it's afraid of water

532
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,320
So it screamed when
I put it into the water

533
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,720
What's this?

534
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,880
Mosquito bite, I scratched it myself

535
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,560
Aren't you allergic to cats?

536
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:40,640
Sit down

537
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,680
Step back

538
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,520
Don't be angry

539
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,520
It didn't hurt you purposely

540
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,720
I'll come to you if you're angry

541
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,160
I'm not angry

542
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,000
Don't come near

543
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:55,960
I'm not angry

544
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,560
Ding Dang wants to eat dried fish

545
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,640
I have only cat food

546
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,920
No, dried fish

547
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,520
Okay, I'll buy for you

548
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,360
Ding Dang wants to thank you

549
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,160
It wants to give you a kiss

550
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,400
What are you doing?

551
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,360
Come on

552
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:18,880
Come on

553
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:19,960
Come on

554
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,480
I suggest you step back

555
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,080
What if I don't?

556
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,080
What will you do? Huh?

557
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,600
-I'll kiss you then
-You did it before

558
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,760
When you're drunk...

559
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,760
I'm just kidding

560
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,400
Don't be serious

561
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,080
