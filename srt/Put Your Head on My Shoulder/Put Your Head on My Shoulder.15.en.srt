Did you peek

at my form?

17
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:23,640
Forget it

18
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,400
It was a coincidence

19
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,440
Yes

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,520
does it mean he's a playboy?

80
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,200
Tell me who's the guy first

81
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,520
You're still in an allergy, huh?

82
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,600
Prof. Jiang, are you looking for me?

Zhou Lei

Why is he here too?

Take a rest

91
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,720
Stay here for a while

92
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,640
Just a moment

93
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,920
You don't know

94
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:57,920
The kitten

95
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,080
creeped me out yesterday

96
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,360
But I found

97
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,320
it's a big eater

98
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,480
It could finish a fish in a meal

99
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,240
Prof. Jiang

100
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,360
Are you asking me to
pay for its expenses?

101
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,040
No

102
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,200
Gu Wei Yi

103
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,760
How are you and Si Tu Mo

104
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,440
recently?

105
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,040
By the way, did you manage
to confess at the playground?

106
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,280
Fail again, huh?

107
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,080
I made it in this morning

108
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,040
Can't you just finish your words?

109
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,200
Finally, we have

110
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,160
someone in love in the lab now

111
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,440
Prof. Jiang, I've been in love too

112
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,800
You only help girls to do their
homework, that's not in love

113
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,350
Why not?

114
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,680
Did you hold their hands?

115
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,400
Did you hug them?

116
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,040
Did you kiss them?

117
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,560
You...

118
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,600
Do you know what's love?

119
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,520
Why are you laughing?
You know about it?

120
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,840
Look at him

121
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,760
He has no idea too

122
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,000
Gu Wei Yi

123
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:57,960
Tell him

124
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,320
after you confessed your love to her

125
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,400
Tell me

126
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,400
Gu Wei Yi

127
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:36,760
I'm going to work

128
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,440
Did she put on make up today?

129
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,120
She looks pretty

130
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,560
Si Tu Mo

131
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,160
You're going to be late

132
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,560
Come back earlier

133
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,680
Gu Wei Yi

134
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,400
Gu Wei Yi

135
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,840
What happened after you
confessed your love?

136
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,920
It's only a short time

137
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,680
Did you hold her hands? Hug her?

138
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,520
Did you kiss her?

139
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,680
No

140
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,000
Look

141
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,760
I knew he did nothing

142
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,000
I kissed her

143
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,400
I knew

144
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,680
When you're drunk

145
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,240
Okay

146
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,480
So you should learn from Gu Wei Yi

147
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,280
No matter in scientific research

148
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,400
or affection, you...

149
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,160
Prof. Jiang

150
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,360
Why did you want to see us?

151
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,520
Well...

152
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,560
Our experiment about
the Quantum Hall effect

153
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,800
was always been concerned
in the country and abroad

154
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,600
Before, my PhD student, Lu Jian Shi

155
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,240
went to a seminar in Germany

156
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,880
because of this experiment too

157
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,240
We didn't let the whole team to go there

158
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,800
due to the budget issue

159
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:33,600
Secondly,

160
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,760
our project was still immature

161
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,400
Prof. Jiang

162
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,160
What are you trying to say?

163
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:40,800
Now,

164
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,200
the Heidelberg University in Germany

165
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,240
sent us the invitation

166
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,200
Is that he Heidelberg
University of Born,

167
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,120
the quantum mechanics founder?

168
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,480
I want to go!

169
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,160
The Heidelberg University

170
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,600
gave us 2 seats

171
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,880
You should know

172
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,680
One of the seats

173
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,840
will be reserved for your Xie Yu Yin

174
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,080
She has been joining me

175
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,320
during her post-graduation

176
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,560
The another seat will be given to

177
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,480
either one of you

178
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,720
Why don't we let the exam decide it?

179
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,200
The top scorer can go for it

180
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,720
Take it easy

181
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,800
I'll try my best to figure it out

182
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,560
Even if I can't figure it out,

183
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:23,240
I'll decide it through
a comprehensive assessment

184
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,080
Okay?

185
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,600
Let's make a date

186
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,560
We're in a date now

187
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,640
You're forcing yourself
to study together with me

188
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,040
There are people around

189
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,120
You want dating, right? This is a dating

190
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,360
I'll take a nap

191
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,680
This is my book

192
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,280
Read my book first

193
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,720
Don't disturb my dating

194
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,920
Don't disturb my dating

195
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,200
Admission ticket?

196
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,360
Post-graduate admission ticket

197
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,960
Where is mine? Let me see

198
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,320
Did it connect together?

199
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,000
The registration's over

200
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,720
when you wanted to register it

201
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,600
Do you really want to sit for the exam?

202
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,080
Of course

203
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
But you didn't even
check the registration date

204
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:35,880
I...

205
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,560
Fu Pei

206
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,560
What do you like?

207
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,160
What do you want to be?

208
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,880
If you know the answers,

209
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,760
I hope you carry on it happily

210
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,520
Don't be trapped by my future

211
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,560
Since we get together,

212
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,000
you seldom touch your basket ball
and go out with your buddies

213
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,880
You only accompany me to study

214
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,520
Although you said you like it and happy,

215
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,800
but I know that you're forcing yourself

216
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,920
As you're worried that I'll feel
unsafe and think too much

217
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,520
But I don't want you to do that

218
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,600
One day, you'll be tired

219
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,960
in our relationship

220
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,440
I'm not tired

221
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,720
I feel tired

222
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,600
I'm worried if you're tired

223
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,320
I told you I'm not tired

224
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,480
I was the one who confessed
my love to you first

225
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,640
Although you said you like me,

226
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,600
but I don't know how long it will last

227
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,840
In the conclusion, you never
believe my love on you

228
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,360
from the beginning

229
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,280
No

230
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:56,760
Alright

231
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,360
Stop talking

232
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,320
Fu Pei

233
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,840
Now, we're here

234
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,080
because the shooting
of the orange juice ads

235
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,080
will start tomorrow

236
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,080
You know

237
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,920
They changed to a new spokesman
and cut the budget into half

238
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,560
But, we have adjusted

239
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,560
the relevant changes of the shooting

240
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,040
and I'll leave the
operational task to you

241
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,200
Tell me if you have any idea

242
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,320
I suggest myself to bring

243
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,000
Mo Mo and Jie Er to the shooting

244
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,040
The shooting is simple and they
never join any shooting scene,

245
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,000
they can learn there

246
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,600
We only need a few staffs
as the shooting is simple

247
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,920
Mo Mo, you go

248
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,360
They're not using a super star

249
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,160
Call me if you

250
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,200
have any problem

251
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:52,840
Okay

252
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,840
Miss Sha Sha

253
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,200
Can I go with her?

254
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,680
We'll have a meal with
Director Chen tomorrow

255
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,280
Okay

256
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,400
That's it

257
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,240
Li Na

258
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,240
Brief Mo Mo about the process

259
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,190
Okay

260
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,480
Miss Sha Sha

261
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,390
Jie Er

262
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,520
We'll have a meal with
Director Chen tomorrow

263
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,150
He is your father's old friend

264
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,840
We'll talk about

265
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,720
the ads of the coming season

266
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:21,880
Okay

267
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:26,800
Miss Sha Sha

268
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,400
Help me to look into the handsome guy

269
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,200
Yes, madam

270
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,080
I'll print out his pictures,
help me get his autograph

271
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,240
No way, it will spoil my professionality

272
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,760
I don't care, what if
he becomes famous?

273
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,000
No way!

274
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,000
I don't care, see you

275
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,760
You'd better don't text me forever

276
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:07,600
"On the way home"

277
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,160
"Want to watch TV together?"

278
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,440
Prof. Jiang, Gu Wei Yi
is playing with his phone

279
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,240
Prof. Jiang

280
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,640
I never play phone in the lab

281
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,600
To me, this is how
a scientist should behave

282
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,560
Especially those who will go to
a rigorous country like Germany

283
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,760
I saw you playing with a phone before

284
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,160
No, I didn't

285
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,440
Stop quarreling

286
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,280
I mentioned it before

287
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,320
During the recess,

288
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,880
you can do whatever you want to

289
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,400
But I'm still studying

290
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,600
during the recess

291
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,400
Xiao Gu is in love

292
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,600
and you are not

293
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,120
Who's in love?

294
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,600
It's him

295
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,680
He is busy in love and doing nothing

296
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,240
Who's your girlfriend?

297
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,360
Si Tu Mo

298
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,680
Don't ask, you don't know her

299
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,600
I know her

300
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:20,680
Me too

301
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,760
How did you know his girlfriend?

302
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,120
Why didn't I know her?

303
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:26,840
Gu Wei Yi

304
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,600
I want to know your girlfriend

305
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:30,840
You're dreaming

306
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,400
What are you waiting for?

307
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,080
He didn't even text you,
he won't come and pick you up

308
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,520
No fragrant of flowers

309
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,680
Not tall as a tree

310
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:13,200
I'm a nobody

311
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,080
Why are you here?

312
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:24,920
To pick you up

313
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,000
It's crowded

314
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,320
The bus is coming soon

315
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,360
It's coming

316
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:56,680
Let's go

317
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,360
Come on

318
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,400
Have a seat

319
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:36,640
Sit down

320
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,280
It's okay, I'll sit there

321
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,240
I'll sit there

322
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,640
I'll sit here

323
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,320
Hey girl! Mind your head!

324
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:48,760
Let me do it

325
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,120
You...

326
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:34,800
You...

327
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,400
You wear the wrong shoes

328
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,760
Let me help you

329
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,360
I'll do it myself

330
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,240
Sorry

331
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:38,600
What's up?

332
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,680
Want to ask you something

333
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:41,680
Okay

334
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,560
We're together now

335
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,200
Trying to show off?

336
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:47,840
I want to ask you

337
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,560
How should I arrange for our first meal?

338
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,040
Asking me? If you asked me before,

339
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,600
I'll tell you to get

340
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,240
a romantic candle-light dinner

341
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,280
Cut the steak

342
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,080
Then feed each other

343
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:02,560
I tell you

344
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,320
I see a girl's true colour now

345
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,840
The more you care of her, the
more she doubts your love on her

346
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,680
I knew it

347
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:09,920
See you

348
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,280
Pissed off!

349
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:31,600
Si Tu Mo

350
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:40,960
What's up?

351
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,440
Let's go for a steak tonight

352
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,080
I want to take bath

353
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,640
Let's eat at home, I have to
wake up in the early morning

354
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,080
It's weekend

355
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,240
I have to go to the shooting scene

356
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,720
-I'll call the food delivery then
-Okay

357
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,560
Blackout?

358
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,880
No, the washroom is bright

359
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,960
We have the power supply

360
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,240
I'm so sorry

361
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,360
Continue it

362
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,120
Let's switch on the light

363
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,520
What's so funny?

364
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,120
Nothing

365
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,960
What are we going to eat?

366
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:02,880
Delivery

367
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,760
-Sir, this is your food
-Thank you

368
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,520
What did you order?

369
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:31,800
Beefsteak

370
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,080
I think we're not suitable

371
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,240
with the exquisite life

372
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:58,920
So am I

373
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,040
Wait

374
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,320
Take this

375
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,400
Treat it like a pork chop

376
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,320
Look at me

377
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,480
Actually,

378
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,520
I think we could slice it

379
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,120
Dig in

380
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:26,760
Tasty

381
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,600
Want to watch a movie?

382
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:41,880
What movie?

383
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,240
"Shutter"

384
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,000
Sure

385
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,800
-I'll switch off the light
-No! Don't switch it off!

386
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,800
Do you want some beers?

387
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,040
What do you want to do?

388
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,640
There is something we
can do even without beers

389
00:31:59,080 --> 00:31:59,840
Whose phone?

390
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,480
Hello, Shan Shan

391
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,160
What's wrong?

392
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,320
I had a fight with Fu Pei

393
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,880
He bullied you?

394
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,400
You never register the exam for him

395
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,320
I think...

396
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,080
Well done!

397
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,880
Fu Pei deserves it

398
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,640
But

399
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,520
I feel like I didn't respect him

400
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,160
It's okay, he doesn't need it

401
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,560
He felt that I never believe
him from the beginning

402
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,160
It's alright, he doesn't deserve it

403
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,560
Gosh!

404
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,320
You're scolding my boyfriend

405
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,800
Do you want to scold my boyfriend?

406
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,600
Since when you two get together?

407
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:48,680
Yesterday

408
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,160
My god!

409
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,560
Besides Niu Niu, everyone
of us has a boyfriend now

410
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,560
Oh, no...

411
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,360
I might become single soon

412
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,640
Don't think too much

413
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,400
Fu Pei will come to you after few days

414
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:07,430
"How to occupy your girlfriend's heart?"

415
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,100
[How to make your girlfriend hang up fast?]

416
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,920
Why don't you study at
my house on the weekend?

417
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:17,840
Don't think too much

418
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,120
You'll be sitting an exam soon

419
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,520
You must do your revision

420
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,360
I can't do that

421
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,640
You two just started the relationship,
I can't be the spotlight there

422
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,880
I feel scared

423
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,720
when I see Wei Yi

424
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,320
Actually,

425
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,040
he is nice

426
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:36,370
"What should I do when my
girlfriend is hanging on the phone?"

427
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,160
-What's up?
-It's cold here

428
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,280
I'll go back to my room, you chat here

429
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,200
Are you listening?

430
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,480
Yes, just say it

431
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:28,880
Si Tu Mo

432
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:49,920
"Have you taken your breakfast?"

433
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,500
[May I go and have lunch with you at noon?]

434
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,180
[What are you doing?]

435
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,400
Hello

436
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,960
I'm Si Tu Mo, the in-charge
of the shooting

437
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,800
Miss Si Tu

438
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,200
We don't have to stand here

439
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,520
for your self-introduction

440
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,880
This way please

441
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,200
Thank you

442
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,480
This way please

443
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,320
Hi, director

444
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,320
Hello

445
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,480
This is his first job
in such a big shooting

446
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,160
Tell me if you have any problem

447
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,360
Don't hesitate

448
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,400
You're too humble

449
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,160
Young artists should
work hard for their future

450
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,040
Director

451
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,560
Can we put the table here?

452
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,080
Take it away

453
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:17,640
Xiao Lin

454
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,560
Say hi to the director

455
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,480
Let him take care of you

456
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,000
so that you can take a good shot

457
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:25,720
Hi, director

458
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:28,680
Hi

459
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,760
Ying Zi, come with me

460
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,560
So sorry, director

461
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,600
You should greet in a proper way

462
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,040
Make up yourself

463
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,240
I don't want to bother you

464
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,080
Miss Si Tu

465
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,400
Please bring Lin Zhi Cun for make-up

466
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,760
-I need to talk to the director
-Okay

467
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,080
This way please

468
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,320
Mr. Lin

469
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:53,760
Mr. Lin

470
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,560
Mr. Lin, shall we start?

471
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,760
I'm missing Gu Wei Yi

472
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:06,960
Handsome?

473
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:09,720
I mean

474
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,600
Never seen such a handsome guy like me?

475
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,080
Someone is more handsome than you

476
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,600
Are you a trainee?

477
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,800
How did you know?

478
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:22,960
You never greet my agent and
didn't even know how to be a flatter

479
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,320
Apparently, you're a rookie

480
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,720
I'm so sorry

481
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,440
to trouble you

482
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,000
Hi all, please go out for a while

483
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,480
I need to talk to Xiao Lin

484
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,280
Okay

485
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,840
Do you think you're a super star?

486
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,400
How did you greet the Director?

487
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,440
People might think
you're the famous super star

488
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:53,920
Lin Zhi Cun

489
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,560
If you're really smart,

490
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,720
you should know

491
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,000
the girl is a trainee of
the advertising company

492
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,880
She is just a trainee

493
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:05,080
If you're a super star, they won't
send a trainee to deal with you

494
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,520
Think about it yourself

495
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,920
What's wrong with a trainee?

496
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,140
[Here comes the Easter egg...]

497
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,440
Circle

498
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:31,640
"Hello"

499
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,320
The voice test starts now

500
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,360
"Voice command please"

501
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,120
Move forward

502
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:42,920
Go back

503
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,160
Stop

504
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,520
Who is Gu Wei Yi?

505
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,120
"My Master"

506
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,400
Who is Si Tu Mo?

507
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,000
"My Lady"
