[Put Your Head On My Shoulder]

2
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,260
Let's make a contract

3
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:33,900
What contract?

4
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,500
Contract of "Never Move Out"

00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,700
[Episode 6]

6
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,820
Two of you are matched

7
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,460
People might think

8
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,220
you've been
living together for years

9
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:15,900
Mom

10
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,540
Please stop talking nonsense

11
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,460
What did I say?

12
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,420
You think too much

13
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,300
When are you leaving?

14
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,620
This is your second night here

15
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:27,820
Alright

16
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:28,820
I knew

17
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,020
Xiao Gu never asks me to leave

18
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,980
How can you ask me to leave?

19
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:34,780
Am I right?

20
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:37,620
Yes

21
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,500
This is nice

22
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,340
Morning

23
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:04,500
Morning

24
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,380
Let's dig in

25
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,620
Take a bun

26
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,220
Come on

27
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,980
Look like you are not rushing today

28
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,620
I'm going back to school
to discuss my thesis

29
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,460
I'm going too

30
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,300
Are you going together?

31
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:38,700
What's wrong?

32
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:39,740
Nothing

33
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,980
You answered it without a hitch

34
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,140
Why are you going back?
What about the experiment?

35
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,980
Prof. Jiang is at the new campus today

36
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,140
I'm looking for him

37
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:18,740
I see

38
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:22,900
Do you want the cross talk?

39
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,020
The cross talk.

40
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,700
I'm busy recently and forgot
to download the new show

41
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:40,820
I got it.

42
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:45,620
Thank you

43
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,260
Surprise!

Mo Mo

45
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,660
-It creeps me out
-I'm freaked out

46
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,900
Why do you look guilty?

47
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,020
The staff will check on
high power consumption today

48
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,420
Put it at the place we used to hide

49
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,660
The small room at the end
of the corridor was found by her

50
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:54,860
What now?

51
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,020
I plan to hide the boiler
inside the dirty clothes basket

52
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,980
She will never touch the basket

53
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,380
Then I'll be safe

54
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,380
How long you didn't wash the socks?

55
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,340
Meng Lu took it from his boyfriend

56
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,860
Her boyfriend then took it
from his room mates

57
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,140
What are you doing?

58
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,380
Cleaning the room

59
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,460
Hiding your boiler?

60
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,740
No

61
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,540
We collect the dirty clothes and
plan to wash them together

62
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,540
What is this?

63
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,740
Dirty clothes

64
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:35,740
Hands off

65
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,820
Dirty! We didn't wash it for two weeks

66
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:43,940
Well

67
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,300
The room hygiene is part of

68
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,340
the spot-check

69
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,420
Are you really hungry?

70
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,820
You cook the socks as well?

71
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,380
Get it after your graduation

72
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:06,860
I...

73
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,700
Aunt...

74
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,940
It creeps me out

75
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:29,740
Aunt...

76
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:30,820
Aunt...

77
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:31,620
Hello

78
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,100
I'm not interested in fitness
nor health care products

79
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,100
No

80
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,420
I'm Fu Pei, Si Tu Mo's friend

81
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,340
Remember me?

82
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,820
Maybe I'm getting older,

83
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,100
I can't remember you

84
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,580
I sent the report card to Mo Mo and

85
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,140
you treated me with walnuts

86
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,500
It's such a waste

87
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,100
What did you say?

88
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,180
Nothing

89
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,780
I need to cook, see you

90
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,500
Mom, with whom you're chatting with?

91
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,460
You're back

92
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:08,940
You're back

93
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,860
Let's go, I'll make you soup

94
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,380
Hurry

95
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:12,860
Aunt

96
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,500
We have to

97
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,780
go back for dinner

98
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,340
You shall go back too

99
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:17,980
Let's go

100
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:18,580
Aunt

101
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,340
Fu Pei again?

102
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:40,260
There's once during
your secondary school,

103
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,620
you locked yourself inside the room
and cried for a whole night

104
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:48,060
Your diary was full
with the words of "Fui Pei"

105
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,780
Mom, how could you read my diary?

106
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,500
Because you cried for a night

107
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,580
Your father and I couldn't
sleep for the whole night

108
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,260
It is too exaggerated

109
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,300
I thought you have broken up with him

110
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,140
I hope so

111
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:05,460
Mo Mo

112
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:09,580
You are more sensible than
your siblings since you're small

113
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:13,420
You don't usually cry and
do everything independently

114
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,020
But at that time,

115
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,540
you were depressed

116
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,940
for quite some time because of him

117
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,580
However, you pretended
like nothing happened

118
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,260
We dare not ask you

119
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,500
Did you know how sad we were?

120
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,020
My little Mo

121
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,020
Actually, your father and I

122
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,900
never put any expectation

123
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,820
or hope on three of you

124
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,220
We never expect you
to make any big achievement

125
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,820
We just want you

126
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,420
to live happily

127
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,300
I knew

128
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,300
about Fu Pei

129
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,980
He wasn't a bad boy,

130
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,700
but only fickle

131
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,620
If you really get together with him,

132
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,100
I bet you will always

133
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,140
keep everything in your heart

134
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,060
and get things settled in tears

135
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,380
Mo Mo

136
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,980
Don't stoop to reach a compromise

137
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,780
You can't do so

138
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,980
That's not the right way

139
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,340
Mom

140
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,260
Alright, stop talking about him

141
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,940
Let me tell you some good news

142
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,420
What good news?

143
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,940
I'll go home tomorrow

144
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,100
I have packed everything up

145
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,500
You always want me to go back

146
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,260
Like I'm forcing

147
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,740
you and Xiao Gu to do something

148
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,260
Mom

149
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,020
I'm not driving you away, I'm...

150
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:37,780
Alright

151
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,980
I know you very well

152
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,980
Okay, I won't interfere
your business again

153
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,740
Mind your business

154
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,260
by your own in the future

155
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:02,500
He is so stupid, don't find
a boyfriend like him

156
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,540
Okay

157
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,820
This girl is so stupid too

158
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,380
You must not act like her

159
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,140
Understand?

160
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,140
Okay

161
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,180
So stupid

162
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:20,860
I'm home

163
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:21,820
Hey

164
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:22,820
Come and sit here

165
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,260
Taken your dinner?

166
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:26,860
Yeah

167
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,340
I'm thinking

168
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,700
to tell you something

169
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,740
I'll go back to my home tomorrow

170
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:42,340
I hope you'll take a good care of Mo Mo

171
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,380
Okay, you are always welcome

172
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:46,580
Alright

173
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,100
Just a moment

174
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,180
I'll bring you some oranges

175
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,140
Gu Wei Yi

176
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,740
You are smart, right?

177
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,300
Why don't you help me
on my graduation thesis?

178
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,740
Forget it

179
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,100
We are not in the same subject

180
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,780
What is your topic?

181
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,340
It will creep you out

182
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,580
I'm ready for it

183
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,900
To informationize the SME Accounting

184
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,340
by cloud computing model research

185
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,540
Is that making you confused?

186
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,900
What is your topic?

187
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,020
The law of Viscosity of Polyvinyl

188
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,780
The improvement of viscosity-
average molecular weight

189
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,620
Forget it then

190
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,580
How is your thesis?

191
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,860
I was scolded by the lecturer

192
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,180
as it doesn't show my own view
and the points are unclear

193
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,700
He didn't see any of my view
on the future of accounting

194
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,180
How would I know?

195
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,460
Just like I don't know
if I'll be an accountant

196
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,100
What do you want to be?

197
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:11,700
Advertising designer

198
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,740
It's good to be an accountant

199
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,620
Don't think too much other than that

200
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,580
Am I right? Xiao Gu

201
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,260
It's more important that
we can do a job we love

202
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,260
I'll wash my hand first

203
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:36,700
Okay

204
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,860
Do you want me to send you?

205
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,300
It's okay

206
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,820
You need go back to the office

207
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,100
I don't want to trouble you

208
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,260
Be careful

209
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,100
Okay

210
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,660
Let's make a contract

211
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,220
What contract?

212
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,460
Contract of "Never Move Out"

213
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,820
You said you won't force me

214
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,140
and let me make my own decision

215
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,860
After thinking twice of it,
I think I can't let you go

216
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,960
[Contract]

217
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,460
When did you prepare this?

218
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:20,860
Not your concern

219
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:21,980
Sign it

220
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:23,540
No

221
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:25,460
No?

222
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,140
No

223
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,300
Really?

224
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,260
I will not sign it

225
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,340
Fine

226
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,540
I won't go back then

227
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,220
I feel hard to leave Xiao Gu too

228
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,620
Mom

229
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,580
I sign it

230
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,340
That's what I want

231
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,140
Take it

232
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:40,780
and sign it

233
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,220
Alright

234
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,060
I'll take my leave now

235
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,180
Take care

236
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,380
Give me a kiss

237
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:10,780
Come

238
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:12,820
Okay

239
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:13,900
I leave first

240
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:14,420
Alright

241
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,340
Bye

242
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,060
Don't let me go?

243
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,580
I'll go now

244
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,740
Gu Wei Yi

245
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,420
My mom left and I'll move back to dorm

246
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,140
Sorry to trouble you
for the past few days

247
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,540
I'll buy you a meal when I'm free

248
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:46,820
I'm so sorry

249
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:37,540
I'm craving for Liuzhou
River Snails Rice Noodle

250
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:01,860
Delicious

251
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,140
Hurry up dig in

252
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:06,860
Fragrant?

253
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,700
Eat more

254
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:26,980
What are you doing?

255
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,260
Open the walnuts

256
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,500
You can't do it in this way

257
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,420
Don't press too hard, let me show you

258
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,540
It's okay, it will be
cooked in paste anyway

259
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,720
[Girl's Dorm]

260
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,700
Aunt

261
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,700
Aunt, please open the door

262
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,580
Aunt

263
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,140
You again, huh?

264
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,100
Sorry to trouble you again

265
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,580
Then, you shouldn't come back so late

266
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,940
I told you before

267
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:56,940
I worked overtime

268
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,380
This is the typical excuse for
those who came back late

269
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,780
Register your name

270
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,420
Thank you

271
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:09,540
Take it

272
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,140
Thank you

273
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,020
You have registered 4 times in this week

274
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,620
If you really work overtime,

275
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,700
I shall

276
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,260
call you boss then

277
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,060
That's the truth, believe it or not

278
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,460
I'm done, thanks

279
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,660
I'll go back to the room

280
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,500
You should stay outside
if you come back late so often

281
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,100
So you won't trouble me

282
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,180
You ruined the rules of the dorm

283
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,100
Alright, there are
many houses out there.

284
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,340
We've ben learning for quite some time

285
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,380
Try to do the mock test

286
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,300
Any award?

287
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,820
Want to go to Mo Mo's house?

288
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,980
Why don't you just date her out
instead of bringing me together?

289
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,220
There will be no surprise then

290
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:11,740
If I suddenly show up
when you meet her at her house,

291
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,580
she'll be surprised

292
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,540
I don't know what's on your mind

293
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,300
What?

294
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,020
I said alright

295
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,940
If you manage to pass the test,

296
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,620
I'll talk to Mo Mo

297
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,500
Keep the promise

298
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,380
Alright

299
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:54,580

301
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,380
Help

302
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,140
What's up?

303
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,340
The graduation fair is coming soon

304
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,540
My poster has been rejected
and need to redo it

305
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,140
Help me to do it

306
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,860
You should look for your course mates

307
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:05,980
I'm too busy with

308
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,900
the thesis and practical training

309
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,780
I thought you keen on advertising

310
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,820
It's better to do it together with you

311
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,820
Nevermind, I will look for others

312
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,100
if you can't make it

313
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,740
It's more important we do a job we love

314
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,620
I'll go for it

315
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:24,940
Really?

316
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,260
That's great

317
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,300
Have some water

318
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,220
Are you serious?

319
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,420
Have you done your thesis

320
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,780
and practical training?

321
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:45,780
Why are you doing this?

322
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,580
I must squeeze the time out for it

323
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,020
Mo Mo

324
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,620
You must know the priority
and importance of it

325
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,220
What about your practical training?

326
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,260
I'm thinking to resign

327
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,580
I know you're having
a hard time recently

328
00:23:59,340 --> 00:23:59,980
But I think

329
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,020
you will regret if you give up

330
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,260
because of the hardship

331
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,780
I'm giving up because of that

332
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,140
I just think that's

333
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,740
more important to do a job I love

334
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:16,140
"Love is the sweet transformed by rain"

335
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,660
"Dropping one by one"

336
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,540
"The eyes full with sunshine"

337
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,540
"Warm the memories"

338
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,460
"Can't speak out most of the plots"

339
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,220
"Just keep it warm inside the heart"

340
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:35,620
"The little time of aromatic"

341
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:39,380
"Growing naturally in noise"

342
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,700
"Looking and greeting you in happiness"

343
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:48,620
"It's worth to keeping it forever"

344
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,300
Sis Qing

345
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,860
I have done the report

346
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,580
Thank you

347
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,300
How is your thesis?

348
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,020
When will you be my permanent staff?

349
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,580
I'm thinking to tell you about this

350
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,580
I want to resign

351
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,420
Resign?

352
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,740
You're doing well, aren't you?

353
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,100
I'm thinking to turn you
as a permanent staff

354
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,380
Thank you, Sis Qing

355
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,860
I have thought about it for so long

356
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,380
I prefer to be an advertising designer

357
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,180
Advertising?

358
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,780
How could Ori Advertising steal my staff?

359
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,420
Oh, no! I don't get any job yet

360
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:38,260
I personally like advertising
and wish to be an ad designer

361
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,700
Means you don't like finance

362
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,100
Many people might feel
bored with finance

363
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,860
Sometimes, it brings lots of fun

364
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:51,340
You can even use your professional
knowledge to save a company

365
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,300
Really?

366
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,100
Of course

367
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,300
How?

368
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:58,460
Why should I tell you
since you don't like the job?

369
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,060
Forget it

370
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,900
If you don't like it,
I won't force you then

371
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,660
I hope you get a job that you love

372
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,060
Thank you

373
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,140
I'm going out first

374
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:12,820
Okay

375
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,540
Wish you a good future

376
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,380
Thank you

377
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,260
Is it clear?

378
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,100
Okay

379
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:41,860
Good

380
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:48,980
Morning, Prof. Jiang

381
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:49,740
-Professor
-Busy?

382
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,460
Hi, carry on your job

383
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,900
Gu Wei Yi, what are you doing?

384
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,500
Writing the thesis

385
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,060
Thesis?

386
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,860
How can you do something
not related in the lab?

387
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:04,500
I told you to be serious
and respect all the experiment

388
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,860
Don't you remember it?

389
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,260
Writing a thesis?

390
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,580
Have you done the experiment?

391
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,100
I have completed it

392
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,460
Done?

393
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:25,940
You should help them then

394
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,020
"Si Tu"

395
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,140
Are you really writing the thesis?

396
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,300
I'm checking the origin of the surname

397
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,220
Redo the experiment

398
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,540
and focus on your duty

399
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,300
Okay

400
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,380
Gu Wei Yi

401
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,260
Why are you here?

402
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,700
I'm lost

403
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,900
I'm unfamiliar with it as
it has been too long since I left

404
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,820
Where do you want to go?

405
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,860
-Where are you going?
-To an interview

406
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,420
Let's go together then

407
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,580
How do you know
I got an interview at Ori?

408
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,460
I heard it from someone

409
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:36,900
It spreads so fast

410
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,140
Let's go

411
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:53,780
Here it is

412
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,580
Is the place you want
to go far from here?

413
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,460
Not far, just around here

414
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,380
Then I go in first, bye

415
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,260
Bye

416
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:34,140
(How long does a job interview usually last?)

417
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,180
(The longer the interview duration is,
the higher the pass rate is?)

418
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,420
(How to comfort someone who failed the interview?)

419
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,700
How come you are still here?

420
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,100
How's it?

421
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,660
Should be okay, they asked me
when I can start working

422
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:14,380
Let's go

423
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,100
Let's go

424
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,540
I'll go back first

425
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:24,380
Okay

426
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,500
Go ahead

427
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:26,260
Okay

428
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,740
(Girls' Dormitory)

429
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:04,820
(Si Tu Mo)
(I have something of yours, what about...)

430
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,860
Do you want to get in
to sell your products?

431
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:22,980
I'm not a salesman

432
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,580
Are you sure?

433
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:27,180
You are standing here with
the flyer for quite some time

434
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,660
Are you new in sales?

435
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:31,060
I've been working here over the years

436
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,180
I know what you are trying to do

437
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:34,540
Off you go!

438
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,180
I'm not a salesman

439
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:38,620
Pei Lan

440
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:42,500
Wait a moment

441
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:43,900
I'm catching a salesman

442
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:45,500
Where?

443
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,860
Here

444
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,020
He is my student,

445
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,940
not a salesman

446
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,420
Your student?

447
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,260
Yes

448
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:55,620
He is holding the...

449
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,100
Draft papers?

450
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,260
Draft papers

451
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,220
Another bookworm

452
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,460
I really don't understand
what is on your mind

453
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,660
Are you trying to tease me?

454
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,940
Off you go!

455
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,660
You have been standing
at the girl's dorm for so long

456
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,900
That's why I treated you as a salesman

457
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:15,980
Fine

458
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,020
It's alright

459
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:19,780
Pei Lan

460
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:20,620
What about we...

461
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:24,020
What? Do you realize your mistake?

462
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:28,860
Yeah

463
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:29,740
Say it loudly

464
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,100
It's my fault

465
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,300
Will you smoke behind me again?

466
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:36,980
No, I won't

467
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,540
-You're not sincere at all
-Give me the key

468
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,460
I need to take some files from home

469
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:46,660
I'm leaving

470
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,180
Xiao Gu, go back

471
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,260
Aunt

472
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,140
You and Prof. Jiang...

473
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,060
He is my husband

474
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,900
Finally, I have done the thesis

475
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,060
Can I make a curse?

476
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,700
Congratulations!

477
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:33,900
At this moment,

478
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:37,740
I want to dedicate the thesis to...

479
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:39,820
Gu Wei Yi

480
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:41,700
Hello

481
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:42,820
Si Tu Mo

482
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:43,900
Come home now

483
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,380
Whose home?

484
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,460
My home

485
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:47,900
Why?

486
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,100
Your mom's coming

487
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,260
What?

488
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,060
Did you tell her that I moved out?

489
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,020
No

490
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,340
Okay, hold on a while

491
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,140
I'll be back soon

492
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,220
Hurry up! I'll try my best

493
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,300
Okay, bye

494
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:08,540
My god

495
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,210
What's wrong?

496
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:16,690
I told you my mom wished to
make me a match with Gu Wei Yi

497
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,100
and forced me to share rent with him

498
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,780
Gu Wei Yi just told me
that my mom is coming

499
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,900
I need to rush back and
pretend I never move out

500
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:25,620
Why don't

501
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:27,300
I go with you?

502
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,170
I'm just curious

503
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,900
how the house of
the Physics genius looks like?

504
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:36,210
You said it looked
like mortuary, right?

505
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:40,020
Moreover, your mom will believe

506
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,140
you didn't move out
if you bring a friend home

507
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:45,060
Perhaps, she will never do
the spot check again

508
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:46,820
That's right

509
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,340
Hurry up, pack the things up

510
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:39,580
Hi

511
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,460
I'm Wang Shan, Mo Mo's roommate

512
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:42,860
My friend, Wang Shan

513
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:45,700
Hi

514
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:46,780
Where's my mom?

515
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:48,940
She's not coming

516
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:50,740
Why?

517
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,100
She's playing mahjong with someone

518
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,140
Really? She tricked me again

519
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,780
You can call and ask her

520
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,140
Never mind

521
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,700
So, we will leave first

522
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,180
Wait a moment

523
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,620
Someone is coming

524
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:08,780
Who?

525
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,740
You will know later

526
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,340
Open the door

527
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,700
Let's celebrate for Mo Mo
for the completion of thesis

528
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:33,900
We shall celebrate

529
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:34,740
for Mo Mo today

530
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,300
Don't mind if we mess your house

531
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,980
What if I say I mind?

532
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,620
Then you are a niggard

533
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,900
Any drink you want? We have beer,

534
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,460
juice and soft drinks

535
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:51,860
Give me beer

536
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,220
Mo Mo should not drink beer

537
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,460
What's he doing here?

538
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,020
You have so many films here

539
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,060
All horror movies

540
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,380
Let's watch a movie

541
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,660
The old man wasn't a human

542
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,100
Has he gone away?

543
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,300
Yes

544
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,340
He eats the candle

545
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,820
Stop it

546
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,660
Why did you stop talking?

547
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:12,940
You asked me to stop

548
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,340
You shall say

549
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:15,820
Shall I say or not?

550
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:16,820
I don't know

551
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,740
No tomato flavor?

552
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,580
It has been sold out

553
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:34,660
-I go and...
-No need

554
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,180
I just merely said it

555
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:55,380
You were forced to stay together
because of your mother, right?

556
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,540
Yes, what's wrong?

557
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,140
-Why didn't you tell me?
-Why should I?

558
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,260
You are not my boyfriend

559
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:02,500
Where are you going?

560
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:05,340
I remember we have
tomato flavour chips in the house

561
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:31,700
Fu Pei

562
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:32,580
Fu Pei

563
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:33,780
Fu Pei

564
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,100
I'm okay

565
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:40,580
I'm okay

566
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:44,460
I'll bring him water

567
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:56,580
Si Tu Mo

568
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:57,900
Come and get the honey

569
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:19,540
Fu Pei

570
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:20,460
Fu Pei

571
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:21,620
Are you okay?

572
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,260
Let's go back

573
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,100
Mo Mo

574
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:40,340
Fu Pei

575
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,620
Fu Pei, you are drunk

576
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,760
[Here comes the Easter egg.]

577
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:16,900
Hello

578
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,260
Xiao Gu

579
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,060
Is Mo Mo okay there?

580
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,100
She's good

581
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,020
I sent you something
several days ago

582
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,260
Should be arriving today

583
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:26,740
Please check it

584
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:27,620
Okay

585
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,420
You must tell me if Mo Mo bullies you

586
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:31,540
I'll scold her

587
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:32,500
Okay

588
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:52,060
Si Tu Mo, come home now
