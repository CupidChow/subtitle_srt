[Episode 16]

00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,560
Do you think you are the super star?

8
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,320
How did you greet the Director?

9
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,720
People might think

10
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,720
you're the famous super star

11
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,080
Lin Zhi Cun

12
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,400
If you're really smart,

13
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,600
you should know

14
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,640
the girl is a trainee

15
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,200
of the advertising company

16
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,000
She is just a trainee

17
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,040
If you're a super star, they won't
send a trainee to deal with you

18
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,720
Think about it yourself

19
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,080
What's wrong with a trainee?

20
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,960
This is our script, have you read it?

21
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,600
-Yes
-Okay

22
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,920
We will do the shooting accordingly

23
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,400
Alright

24
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,600
The shooting time will take longer

25
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,160
Deal with the artist

26
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:33,920
No problem

27
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,280
Alright

28
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:34,840
Don't worry

29
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,080
The actor is ready

30

Director

31
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,600
So handsome

33
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,000
Print the script and give it to him

34
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,840
Alright

35
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,040
Let me explain

36
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,960
our next shooting details

37
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,640
First, you have to act

38
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,440
as a famous hacker

39
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,040
You're busy hacking everyday

40
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,000
The heavy work load makes you tired

41
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,520
Hence, you are out of condition

42
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,200
However,

43
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,120
after you drink

44
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,480
the orange juice,

45
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,320
you're full of energy

46
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,520
and manage to hack

47
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,800
the alien's computer

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,160
You stop the war

49
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,400
in the earth from the aliens
and save all the human

50
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:41,200
I'm bored

51
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,160
I'm bored

52
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,280
"Arrived the destination"

53
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,600
Don't throw rubbish
everywhere! Keep clean!

54
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,080
Alright

55
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,120
Don't sit here

56
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,480
Sorry

57
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,000
Alright, there's a jacket

58
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,720
Why can't I sit here?

59
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,600
You can't sit on the equipment box

60
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,880
That is our rule

61
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,760
Don't do that again

62
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Don't do that and let every body
knows that you're a trainee

63
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,600
This is my first job here

64
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,720
I don't know about it

65
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,920
Sit here and eat

66
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,320
Or sit on the floor, nobody will care

67
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,840
Thank you

68
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,320
Why don't you eat in the rest room?

69
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,360
I don't want to meet the witch

70
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,440
I'm on diet

71
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,960
You? Even the wind can blow you away

72
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,600
My face is different with yours,
it has to show on screen

73
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,560
and watched by the people

74
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,200
all around the world

75
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,240
What you meant?

76
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,040
Are you laughing at me?

77
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,360
It's just a big burp

78
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,480
3, 2, 1

79

The supplement of your day

Whose phone is that?

Director

84
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,640
Excuse me, it's mine

85
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,120
So sorry, Director

86
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,440

89
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,960
Working

90
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,800
What about you?

91
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,280
I'm thinking of you

92
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,920
Is it disgusting?

93
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,560
I'm thinking if you need
my help in your work

94
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,400
What you can help me?

95
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,440
This is too indirect

96
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,440
You left anything at home?

97
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,720
I can send it to you

98
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,200
Anything I can ask him to send here?

99
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,080
There is an envelope on my desk,
please send it to me

100
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,480
"Get autograph from my future
husband, from Lin Zhi Cun's wife"

101
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,640
I'm at the entrance

102
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,040
Wait a moment.
We will rest after the shoot

103
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,800
Take it easy

104
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,360
Hi, I'm Linda, the artist agent director

105
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,640
of S.Jie Ideas Media

106
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,920
Are you interested to be an artist?

107
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,680
No

108
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,800
Never mind, think about it first

109
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,840
You can logon the web
and check our company

110
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,240
before you reply me

111
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,280
No need

112
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,600
Si Tu Mo

113
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,480
-Have you been waiting long?
-No

114
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,400
No one is looking for me

115
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,880
I'll continue to take a rest then

116
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,800
I woke up too early in the morning

117
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,800
What's wrong with your shoulder?

118
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,360
A bit aching

119
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,200
I massage for you

120
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,280
Here

121
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,320
Sleep for 10 minutes

00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,000

"Make the ordinary life different"

125
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,000
"Like surrounded by the warmth"

126
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,040
"The story was shaking the destiny"

127
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,720
"Take up the courage to make a promise"

128
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,680
"I want to be with you
for the longer journey"

129
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,680
This is all in my mind

130
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,480
"Shoulder to shoulder
with the touching moment"

131
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,640
"I want to be with you
for the longer journey"

132
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,520
"Despite the changing of world"

133
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,200

"witness our love forever“

136
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,600
Hello, Miss Linda

137
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,000
-Where are you? Come to rest room
-Alright

138
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,560
They look for me

139
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,400
Take care on the road, bye

140
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,140
What happened?

141
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,980
The shirt is too small, he can't wear it

142
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,020
We prepared it as what you requested

143
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,020
Look at here

144
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,540
No any other patterns

145
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,660
Can you alter it?

146
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,820
We're running out of time

147
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,700
Can we borrow the coat from the crew?

148
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,900
Their coats are old-fashioned

149
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,180
It can't fit him

150
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,260
Alright, wait a second

151
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,660
I forgot this

152
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,900
This is not important,
take off your coat now

153
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,860
Take off the coat

154
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,980
This is too plain

155
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,140
It is out of sense of design

156
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,660
Gu Wei Yi is good-looking in it

157
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,380
Are you okay with it?

158
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,620
I think...

159
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,540
I'm okay with it

160
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,380
Let's take a good shot
and go home, okay?

161
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,620
I'm going to washroom

162
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,220
Please order me a coffee

163
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,020
Cappuccino

164
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:50,580
Okay

165
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,740
It is damn cold

166
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,460
Excuse me...

167
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,180
Can I borrow your jacket？

168
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:02,980
Take it

169
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,740
Thank you

170
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,700
Mr. Lin, everything is ready

171
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,820
Are you feeling cold? Put it on

172
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,060
I'm going to make money, be a good boy

173
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,140
Don't fight with other kids

174
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,460
Bye

175
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,980
3, 2, 1

176
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:54,860
Action!

177
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,100
Chao Wei Orange Juice,

178
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,540
All the vitamins just in a bottle

179
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,500
Cut

180
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,340
Good take

181
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,860
Replay it

182
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,660
What is inside your pocket?

183
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,060
Director

184
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,180
One more take?

185
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,500
One more take

186
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:25,660
One more take

187
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,220
One more take

188
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,820
Move it, mark the time

189
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:29,700
Action

190
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,780
Chao Wei Orange Juice,
the supplement of your day

191
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,180
All the vitamins just in a bottle

192
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:35,940
Cut

193
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,380
Okay! Let's call it a day

194
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,460
Thank you everybody!

195
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,660
Thank you

196
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,100
Director, thanks

197
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,980
Thank you

198
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,060
Copy all the material to me

199
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:47,780
Okay

200
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,420
Thank you

201
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,780
Wait a moment, I'll bring your jacket

202
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,620
Get autograph
from my future husband

203
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,420
From Lin Zhi Cun's wife

204
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:06,020
My colleague was kidding with me

205
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,340
Don't care about it

206
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,900
The photos are so-so

207
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,700
Do I look better in person?

208
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,540
-Give it to me
-What?

209
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,940
You want my autograph

210
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:17,980
No need

211
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,940
My colleague was...

212
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,940
She was kidding

213
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,020
I tell you

214
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,140
Don't be touched

215
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,220
I'm almost in tears

216
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,460
Mr. Lin

217
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,420
Get a change

218
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,140
Okay

219
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,340
Give it to me

220
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,820
Wait a moment

221
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,820
I used your coat for the shooting

222
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,820
Put it on and give me the jacket

223
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,580
I'll return it to him

224
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,460
Wait a moment

225
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,700
Your jacket

226
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,460
-Thank you
-You have worked hard too

227
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,740
Although you're a trainee,
but you're capable

228
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,700
Thank you

229
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,260
We have to work together
in the future, get ready

230
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,540
Don't sit on the equipment box again

231
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,340
Okay

232
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,140
Sorry

233
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,300
-Let me add you in my WeChat
-Alright

234
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:10,940
Scan my ID

235
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,940
Super Handsome is my ID

236
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,380
Okay, I'm off

237
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,460
Thank you, bye

238
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,420
Let's go

239
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,340
What's wrong? Shall we go?

240
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:26,740
Let's go

241
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,180
Where to?

242
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:29,900
Dating

243
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,420
Dating?

244
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,820
Why do you bring me here?
For a shopping?

245
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,620
I checked it online,
it is a place for dating, right?

246
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:44,460
Yeah

247
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,420
I thought you bring me to a library

248
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,300
or science and technology centre

249
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,540
You want to go?

250
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,580
What do you think?

251
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,380
Let's go

252
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,580
We didn't go for a shopping for so long

253
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,220
Come on!

254
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,460
Come on!

255
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,100

257
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,700

"The sweetness is just nice"

267
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,220
"Finish it in a bite"

268
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,420
Delicious?

269
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,660
Yours is nicer than mine

270
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,740
Really?

271
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,140
-Taste mine
-Give me yours

272
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,420
Almost same

273
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,660
Yours is nicer than mine

274
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,140
Let me taste yours

275
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,300
-The mixture is super nice
-Let me taste it

276
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,340
Delicious?

277
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,340
Delicious?

278
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,060
So delicious

279
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,260
Delicious?

280
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:13,780
Hold it

281
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,340
Try it on

282
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,340
Get into the room

283
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,700
Go

284
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,180
Hurry up!

285
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,300
So nice

286
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,540
The coat is nice

287
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:32,540
"No one can replace it"

288
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,300
"Hand in hand and"

"Feel it the love is

291
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:47,860
"I'm lucky to meet you,
smile in the dreams"

292
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,820
Is it nice?

293
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,900
Nice?

294
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:54,980
It exposed your shoulder

295
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,540
What about this?

296
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,940
It exposed one side of your shoulder

297
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,620
The pants are too short

298
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,220
The top is sleeveless

299
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:17,860
This is nice

300
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,260
Have some fun?

301
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,540
Yeah

302
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,980
Give me a ball

303
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,060
Give me a ball

304
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,140
Come on!

305
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:41,780
Want to play?

306
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,860
I'm just curious as I never enter it

307
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,220
Let's go

308
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,020
How?

309
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,060
We're neither kids nor parents

310
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,620
Wait a minute

311
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,100
One more

312
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,060
Thank you

313
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,700
Come on!

314
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,940
This is your child

315
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,100
Where did you get the child?

316
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,220
Let's go

317
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,380
I...

318
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,140
Take it! Thank you

319
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:16,900
Gu Wei Yi

320
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,900
You can't kidnap a child!

321
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,460
What's your name?

322
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,380
Xiao Jie

323
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,860
Tell me

324
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,620
Do you know him?

325
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,460
I know him

326
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,380
Really?

327
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,380
Tell me

328
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,900
How did you know him?

329
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:33,900
Tell me

330
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,020
Let's go

331
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,900
Go! Enjoy yourself!

332
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,460
Be careful

333
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,500
-Where do you want to stick it on?
-On my back

334
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,340
Okay?

335
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:47,980
Okay

336
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,940
Let me help you

337
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,660
Where?

338
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,260
Stick on your face

339
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,660
Stick...

340
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,740
Hey parents

341
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,060
Your child is inside there

342
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:09,180
Daddy, let's go

343
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,700
Hello, Lu Lu

344
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,620
Where are you?

345
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,980
Ke and I are lining up for food

346
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,060
What's wrong?

347
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,220
Let's have a meal together

348
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,300
You should go to Fu Pei, it's
a chance to bring you two together

349
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,340
I wanted to talk about him...

350
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,900
It's our turn

351
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:31,740
Let's go

352
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,140
Enjoy yourselves

353
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,700
Niu Niu

354
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,460
What's wrong?

355
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,180
Please talk to me

356
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,260
No way, it's my final round

357
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,140
Fatty!

358
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,540
Yeah, there's ambush
at 60 degrees from East

359
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,700
Tree Stick!

360
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,300
Go! Go!

361
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,820
Go! That side

362
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,260
(Fu Pei: Nice to sweat in this weather.)

363
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:17,970
"Calling Si Tu Mo"

364
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,420
Can we have a chat?

365
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,740
I'm here in the hottest day

366
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,980
just to share my status online

367
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:08,700
What a hard-hearted! How can
you ignore me for so long?

368
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,420
You should make an apology first

369
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:13,740
(Si Tu Mo)
(Hu Niu: I want to go too!)

370
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,180
I'm coming down!

371
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,060
Let's go

372
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,740
You should take care of Xiao Jie

373
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,420
All the kids made it themselves

374
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,940
Me too

375
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,060
Really fun

376
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:38,860
Let's go for it

377
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,700
Let's go

Let's go

379

Come down, don't be afraid

380
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,980
Gu Wei Yi, come down

381
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:49,740
Gu Wei Yi

382
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,100
Don't be afraid! It's fun!

383
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,260
Come on, don't be afraid

384
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,260
Come on

385
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,460
Did you have some fun?

386
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,460
Fun?

387
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,780
Gu Wei Yi!

388
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,180
Gu Wei Yi!

389
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,820
You are a liar!

390
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,140
Have some fun?

391
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,300
There's something better

392
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,180
Hey kids, let's bury him

393
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:45,940
Where's the girl?

394
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,540
I didn't see her

395
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,100
Let's go

396
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:51,980
Let's go

397
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:02,860
She's there

398
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,660
Go!

399
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,340
Gu Wei Yi!

400
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:17,620
Gu Wei Yi!

401
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,940
(I'm still working.)
(Are you tired? Can I go and chat with you?)

402
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,980
-What are you looking at?
-Printing photos for free

403
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,540
What photo you want to print?

404
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,340
You'll know it

405
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,580
It's done

406
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:45,940
Look

407
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:46,860
Cute?

408
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,700
Cute?

409
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,620
Not really

410
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,420
What a bad taste!

411
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,660
Si Tu Ding Dang is so cute

412
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,700
Let's print a photo of two of us

413
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,260
Did we take

414
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,740
a photo together?

415
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,700
No

416
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,780
No, we don't have it

417
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:11,740
Check your phone

418
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:12,740
Do I have it?

419
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:20,660
Look

420
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:21,780
I don't have it

421
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:22,500
Look

422
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:24,740
We don't have it

423
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,380
Can we have a chat?

424
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:38,220
Sure, what's wrong?

425
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:49,340
Yeah! We took it at the beach

426
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,860
Yeah

427
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,100
Give it to me and you print it again

428
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,540
No way

429
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,940
Cool man

430
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,860
You can print it for free

431
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,180
Si Tu Ding Dang

00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,820
Keep it in my purse

435
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,220
We have many side dishes

436
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,780
You'll feel squeezed if you sit here

437
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,100
It's alright

438
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,100
Okay

Let's guess

466
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,340
You bet, you pay

467
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,380
Eat the chilli

468
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,100

00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,300
Are you sure?

475
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,420
Will you cheat again

476
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,420
and ask for more round?

477
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,500

I knew

485
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,820
I can't take spicy food

486
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:41,980
Okay

487
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,780
Show me a coquettish look

488
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,180
I have no idea on it

489
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,220
Eat the chilli then

490

Come on

491
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,420
Wait

492
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,350
"How do you coax a woman?"

493
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,660
I don't want to eat

494
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:37,780
I'm done

495
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,940
You're not sincere

496
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:50,620
I don't want to eat

497
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:57,260
Almost there

498
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15,740
I don't want to eat

499
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,140
Gu Wei Yi

500
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,540
You...

501
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,500
The meat is going to burn

502
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,260
So cold

503
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:53,820
What about this?

504
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,420
Still cold?

505
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,660
Not really

506
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,220
What's wrong?

507
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,380
I feel warm now

508
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,500
Hurry up!

509
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,540
-Let's go home
-What do you want to do?

510
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,500
Get a blanket and watch a horror film

511
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:26,900
Blanket?

512
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,780
Why?

513
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,580
Let's have some beers

514
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,940
I'm not going to drink it,
enjoy yourself

515
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,100
I shall drink it

516
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,300
No point you drink it

517
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,580
Why not?

518
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,020
What do you mean?

519
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,420
Why do I drink for nothing?

520
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,900
It's so cold, let's go home

521
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,780
What do you mean? Say it clearly

522
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,060
What do you mean?

523
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,300
Say it clearly

524
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,340
Let's take the blanket
to the living room

525
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,900
You can do that

526
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,660
But you can't have beers

527
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,140
Shan Shan

528
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,330
Why are you here?

529
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:28,810
Have some water

530
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:44,100
Am I disturbing you?

531
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,540
No

532
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,540
Let's chat in my room

533
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,540
Come on

534
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,140
When will she leave?

535
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,700
Mo Mo

536
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,660
I'll let Fu Pei come and fetch her

537
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,300
What's the matter?

538
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:33,940
Want some water?

539
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,420
No need, thanks

540
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,300
I think we'll break up soon

541
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,020
if we still carry on it

542
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:41,940
Fu Pei used to be

543
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,500
casual and offhand,

544
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:47,740
but he didn't bother me
when we had a fight

545
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,020
I'm a girl

546
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,260
I can't go to him first

547
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:05,940
What should I do now? Give me an idea

548
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,660
-Do you want to bathe?
-I...

549
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,260
I bathed in the dorm before

550
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,540
We're so tired
-Mo Mo

551
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,780
We must bath again

552
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:23,340
What?

553
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,260
Nothing

554
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,740
Continue your talk

555
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,140
What should I do?

556
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:29,260
I passed by the court today

557
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,020
I thought it was him

558
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,780
But it's my illusion

559
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,420
No...

560
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,590
[Here comes the Easter egg...]

561
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,820
Give me a ball

562
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,980
Come on!

563
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,700
Throw it!

564
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,140
Want to play?

565
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,660
I'm just curious as I never enter it

566
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,340
Let's go

567
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,020
How?

568
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,140
We're neither kids nor parents

569
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:19,780
Wait a minute

570
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,820
Let's go together

571
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,140
I have money

572
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,020
Let me bring him

573
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,700
My girlfriend wanted to get in
but we don't have a child

574
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,980
-Where is your girlfriend?
-Look at there

575
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,300
Many people are there.
Which one is your girlfriend?

576
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,180
She has the most charming smile

577
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,820
Why should I believe you?

578
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,380
I'm still single

579
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:09,940
Aunt

580
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,340
This is my wallet

581
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,820
I have all my identity cards here
Can you believe me?

582
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,820
Xiao Jie, do you want to go?

583
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,180
Go

584
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,180
Thank you

585
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,740
Enjoy yourself

586
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,180
What do you want to play?
