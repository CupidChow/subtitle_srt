as they thought it's easier
to get a job in Accounting

89
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,360
But after I studied in the university,

much prefer advertising

Such as Ogilvy's creatives

94
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,480
I also audited advertising's
class in the university

suitable to learn advertising

00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,080
I hope you will give me a chance

This is mine

Si Tu Mo whom I always
mention in the dorm

154
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,400
Call her Mo Mo

155
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,400
Now, both of the new and
old school are combined

156
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,640
It gives us chance to
meet up and know each other

157
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,400
He is the top student in our dorm,

158

Gu Wei Yi

159
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,240
He always gets good results

160
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,520
I used to protect him

161
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,360
Else, he couldn't stay in the dorm

162
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,240
Let's straight to the point

163
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,600

What's wrong?

00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,240
Do you think Mo Mo
will steal your belonging?

167
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,040
You'd better check it out

168
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,880
I wanted to check it

169
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,680
So strange, I just bought it yesterday

170
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,080
What? Anything was missing?

171

I don't think so

172

You don't need it

173
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,880
What's that?

Menstruation pad

175
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,000

176
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,120
Forget it, just take it as a gift

177
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,720
I don't need it

178
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,440
Give it to me then

179
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,480
Bye

180
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,400
Look for me if you have anything

181
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,040
I'm wearing a pair of torn shoes

182
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,760
I'm wearing a torn hat

183
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,920
I'm wearing a torn robe

184
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,960
You're back

185
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,000
You're so happy

186
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,120
Did you make it in the interview?

187
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,880
No, I did not

188
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,400
What's the name of the student

189
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,520
in the old school?

190
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,000
Fu Pei

191
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,520
Fu Pei made a confession to you?

192
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,400
No

193
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,120
Mo Mo, what's wrong with your dress?

194
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,280
How could it get torn?

195
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,640
Nothing, I was just unlucky today

196
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,720
What happened?

197
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,720
Nothing, don't worry

198
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,360
I just fell down from the bike

199
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,280
and failed in the interview

200
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,200
That's all

201
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,960
You refused to attend
the interviews of Accounting jobs,,

202
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,560
but looking for Advertising

203
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,080
You need an Advertising background

204
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,760
Moreover,

205
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,480
even if you make it in the interview,

206
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,640
when you start

207
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,320
to work in the advertising company,

208
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,120
you will find that

209
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,040
you can't fight with those
graduated from Advertising

210
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,200
Then, you will need
to start it all over again

211
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,040
So, you'd better...

212
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,080
I knew

213
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,840
Stop gabbling

214
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,000
So, don't act on impulse

215
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,680
You must plan for it

216
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,440
I planned it

217
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,400
Look

218
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,440
This is my proposal

219
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,400
I forced you to do this

220
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,880
when we were freshmen

221
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,640
I knew that I would not do this

222
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,320
Did you complete it?

223
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,680
Meng Lu

224
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,240
Niu Niu

225
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,640
Niu Niu

226
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,040
Where's my thing?

227
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,040
Don't act

228
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,400
I have planned nothing

229
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,080
I want to get married now

230
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,080
I decided to get married once I get the

231
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,040
graduation certificate

232
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,640
I have a target

233
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,280
My life of game

234
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,920
is going to start soon

235
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,720
I want to be a
government staff, that's all

236
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,640
Look

237
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,280
We are all having our own plan

238
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,920
I must complete the form
before the graduation

239
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,880
Stop bragging

240
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,720
Don't ruin the on-campus
recruitment on tomorrow

241
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,360
I must accomplish the mission

242
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,680
It must match our major

243
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,360
It must match our major

244
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,080
It must match our major

245
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:36,920
Understand?

246
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,640
Alright

247
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,400
Mo Mo

248
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:45,880
Why were you so happy

249
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,320
when you entered the room?

250
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,880
I can explain

251
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,960
Forget it, just take it as a gift

252
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,840
I don't need it

253
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,440
Give it to me then

254
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,000
Someone was funny

255
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,520
when I was on my way back

256
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,480
The talent concept of our company

257
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,480
is very attractive

258
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,560
Besides

259
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,680
competitive remuneration,

260
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:17,520
we also provide
regular professional training

261
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,110
Our working environment

262
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,880
is very good

263
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,760
Look at it

264
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,240
Our office building

265
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:26,000
Working area

266
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,880
Rest area

267
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,080
And...

268
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,160
What's wrong? It's still

269
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,840
Hurry up call the university

270
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,320
Let them send someone from computer base

271
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,480
Okay

272
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,120
Dear all

273
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,600
Let's do a Q&A session

274
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,120
If you have any question

275
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,800
about our company,

276
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,680
please do not hesitate

277
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,520
Question

278
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,840
I don't want to go

279
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,760
So handsome

280
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,680
Gu Wei Yi

281
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,080
So fast

282
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,240
Come with me

283
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,240
A computer base student

284
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,560
needs to wear a white coat?

285
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,680
Is this important?

286
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,800
The important thing is,
he's such a handsome guy

287
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,040
What's wrong?

288
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,160
It hanged in a sudden

289
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,040
Now I can't even shut it down

290
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:35,800
What's wrong with you?

291
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,680
Who will be responsible
if it breaks down?

292
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,320
The technician is here

293
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,520
He is...

294
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,720
You're not technician, stop doing this

295
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,880
It will be alright very soon

296
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,800
It's okay now

297
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,800
It's okay

298
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,680
Si Tu Mo

299
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,400
What's wrong?

300
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,560
Please take the keys

301
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,840
from the drawer on your right

302
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,200
Thank you

303
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,160
I've got the keys

304
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,000
I won't help you again

305
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,720
Ke, Fatty and I have something to do

306
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,520
It's near your lab

307
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,600
I'll buy you a meal after this

308
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,880
Okay

309
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,240
Mr. Xu

310
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,160
Why didn't you sit
for the exam yesterday?

311
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,480
There's some reason and

312
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,920
I didn't bring my student card

313
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,280
Many students of other university

314
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,760
tried hard to take part
in Professor Jiang's project

315
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,480
How could you make the mistake?

316
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,800
It is past

317
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,840
Unless you have a solution for it,

318
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,720
else, we don't have to talk about it

319
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,160
Today, I'm here for this issue

320
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,040
Professor Jiang has the right

321
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,200
to decide the project's participant

322
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,640
I hope you try your best to get it

323
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,160
After all, it is related to our class

324
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,120
and the name of the Faculty of Physics

325
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,360
Are you asking me
to give him some gifts?

326
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,240
Can I claim it from the university?

327
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,320
I don't mean it

328
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,640
At the beginning,

329
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,320
Professor Jiang wanted

330
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,640
to pick top students for his project

331
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,960
But the university insisted
to follow the procedure

332
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,800
So,

333
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,040
we will back up you

334
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,480
and let you meet Professor Jiang

335
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,040
I don't want to do that

336
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,200
It's unfair to others

337
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,000
Gu Wei Yi

338
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,000
You have yet to step into the society

339
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,080
You don't know

340
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,160
Most of the time, many things

341
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,080
could adapt to the circumstances

342
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,720
Sir

343
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,000
I need to pass up the experiment report

344
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,040
Could you please let me
finish the experiment first?

345
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,720
Okay

346
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,360
Would you go if I
reimburse all your expenses?

347
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,080
I'm just kidding

348
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,080
Do you understand
what the lecturer said?

349
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:05,960
Yes, I got it

350
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,000
Shan Shan, want to eat something?

351
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:07,840
I'm going to the canteen

352
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,640
I'll pass

353
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,800
I'm going to the graduate class

354
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,800
You ask two of them

355
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,480
Alright, bye

356
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:17,960
Mo Mo

357
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,680
Please buy us rice with meat

358
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,640
and vegetables when you're back

359
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,720
Scrambled egg with tomato
and shredded meat

360
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:26,880
Hello

361
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:27,800
Mo Mo

362
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,200
Do you want to eat something?

363
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,040
Are you free to entertain me?

364
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,440
I have to take my lunch
no matter how busy I am

365
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,160
Take your time then

366
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,560
I'm on diet

367
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,480
You can look at me

368
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,120
I'm not sick

369
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,560
Here I am

370
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,720
You're really naughty

371
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,600
Surprised?

372
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,400
Let's go for lunch

373
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,760
Don't touch me

374
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,520
Let's go for lunch

375
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,320
What do you want to eat?

376
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,280
You may order anything

377
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,440
I have money to pay the bill

378
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,880
It has been 2 weeks after
the combination of schools,

379
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,680
but I never buy you treat

380
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,800
Let me

381
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,160
buy you 3 meals in a day after this

382
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,600
I'm serious

383
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,800
I didn't take good care of you

384
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,400
when I was studying in the old school

385
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,160
Now, we're staying together

386
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,120
I'll protect you in the future

387
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,000
What's wrong?

388
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,200
There's an interview tomorrow,

389
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,960
but I never see the address

390
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,160
I need to check it out

391
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,440
Let me see

392
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:33,800
I see

393
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,960
Quite far from here, I'll go with you

394
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,400
Forget it

395
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,400
I don't want to hear

396
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,600
any poor excuse again

397
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,800
I promise that I won't do that again

398
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:43,680
Really

399
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:44,760
I'm familiar with the place

400
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,680
It's nearby the old school

401
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:50,720
Alright

402
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,640
While I attend the interview,

403
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,120
you may walk around the old school

404
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,280
See if you need anything

405
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,640
I will find it for you

406
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,120
Hello, I want to change the screen

407
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,720
Wait a moment

408
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,760
I only want to buy a screen

409
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,120
The price of the screen

410
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,680
is same as the repair cost

411
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,680
No problem

412
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,840
But I want to use your
tools to change the screen

413
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,120
Can you do that?

414
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,160
I never try

415
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,600
So I want to try

416
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,080
Okay

417
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,840
Thank you

418
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:07,880
Give me your mobile phone

419
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,120
What's wrong?

420
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,280
I'll change it for you

421
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,640
It's okay

422
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,160
I have successfully changed it

423
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,120
Congratulation!

424
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,640
I will pay for the repair cost for you

425
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,160
I can pay by myself

426
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,720
I want to repair mobile phone

427
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,920
You just did it

428
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,280
I want to try it on others model

429
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,160
You can work for them

430
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,040
I want to repair mobile phone right now

431
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,720
Take my phone

432
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,600
Your phone breaks down too?

433
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,560
No

434
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,680
I really want to repair the
model of your mobile phone

435
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,440

Take your time

438
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:57,760
No

439
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,200
You'll break it

440
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,240
It's alright now

441
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,040
So good

442
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,800
I have transferred the
payment of two screens to you

443
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,800
Okay

444
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:39,960
See you

445
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,880
Thank you

446
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,920
Senior Gu

447
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,560
I don't know that
you're good at mechanic

448
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,160
I'm a freshman of mechanic

449
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,280
Can I have your contact number?

450
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,280
So, we can...

451
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,600
I'm not going to work here

452
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,120
Excellent!

453
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:46,880
Awesome!

454
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,120
I've waiting for you for so long

455
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,320
I will be late if I miss the bus again

456
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,120
I'm leaving, you don't have to come here

457
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:25,920
I...

458
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:26,840
Help!

459
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,640
No!

460
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,680
My bag!

461
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,000
Give it to me!

462
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,440
My bag!

463
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,120
My bag!

464
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,760
Hello

465
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,520
Hello

466
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,720
I'm Si Tu Mo who has
an interview with you today

467
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,440
But I have an urgent accident now

468
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,360
Can we make it on another day?

469
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,080
Okay, we will contact you soon

470
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,840
Okay, thank you

471
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,440
Hello

472
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,680
Fu Pei

473
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,000
I'm Gu Wei Yi

474
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,960
Can you look for Fu Pei?

475
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,200
I don't know where is he

476
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,600
Please help me to inform him

477
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,560
I'm now at the bus station

478
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,440
of Luo He Road nearby the old school

479
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:58,160
My bag was robbed and
I have no money for the fare

480
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,120
My mobile phone is going to die

481
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,680
Please get him to come and look for me

482
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,560
As soon as possible...

483
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,360
Ke

484
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,040
Do you know where is Fu Pei?

485
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,120
I don't know, what's wrong?

486
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,040
I'm waiting for you at the canteen

487
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,200
I'll pass

488
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,760
Gu Wei Yi, why are you here?

489
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,360
I didn't want to come

490
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,080
Where is Fu Pei?

491
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:01,880
I couldn't get him

492
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,560
Come on

493
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,840
I let the driver to wait for a while

494
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,720
It's hard to get a cab here

495
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,760
Please go to the nearest hospital

496
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,880
Okay

497
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,200
It's okay

498
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,760
You have to clean your wound first

499
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,680
See if it is serious

500
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:19,760
Wait a moment

501
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Let me help you

502
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,280
It's not that serious

503
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,920
We don't have to go to the hospital

504
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,880
You'd better go

505
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,440
I'll apply some cream in the dorm

506
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,840
A big wound on the skin surface

507
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,040
will cause bacteria invasion

508
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,160
Bacteria invasion
will cause virus infection

509
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,320
Do you know what is

510
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,480
the most serious subsequent?

511
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,120
What is that?

512
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,190
Amputation

513
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,880
So serious

514
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,600
Please speed up

515
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,960
Okay

516
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,150
Do you have any
document for registration?

517
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,120
All my cards are in the
bag and it was robbed

518
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,840
Wait here for a while

519
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,040
I'll figure it out

520
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:33,880
Okay

521
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:15,960
What are you doing?

522
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,120
You get a wrong person

523
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,880
Come on

524
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,320
Come on

525
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,200
I don't want to sit on a wheelchair

526
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,760
Do you know what is

527
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,320
the most serious subsequent?

528
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:55,760
What's wrong?

529
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:56,800
She fell down and injured

530
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,480
Where does it hurt?

531
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,440
And my leg too

532
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,640
Did you do any scan?

533
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:06,920
Give me the scanning result

534
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,120
The bone is alright

535
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,640
It means your ligament is hurt

536
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,720
Only a small wound

537
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:17,320
So why are you using the wheelchair?

538
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,560
To show your affection?

539
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:23,880
Alright

540
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,560
Sit here as you're injured

541
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,720
Just sit down

542
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,400
What's your name?

543
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,320
-Gu Wei Yi
-Si Tu Mo

544
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,000
I'm asking the patient

545
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,800
Si Tu Mo

546
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,240
Alright, I have cleaned your wound

547
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,400
Take the prescription and get
the medicine at the pharmacy

548
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,520
Don't get water onto your wound

549
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,680
Take light meals

550
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,200
Thank you

551
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,880
Push it away, I don't need it

552
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,520
You don't have to feel shamed

553
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,800
It's a hospital facility

554
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,320
Sometimes, you may take it

555
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,080
to show your affection

556
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,440
and romantic

557
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,080
Let's go, hurry up

558
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,800
It's okay, nobody sees me

559
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,720
-It's okay
-Si Tu Mo

560
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,120
What's wrong with you?

561
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,120
So serious

562
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,480
It's okay, just a small would

563
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,040
How can you say it's a small matter?

564
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,480
You're sitting on a wheelchair

565
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,720
It's just a small would

566
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,200
Thank you for your help

567
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,520
I'll buy you a meal later

568
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,640
Leave it to me

569
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,760
You go back first

570
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,920
Mo Mo, where should we go now?

571
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,440
To get the medicine at the pharmacy

572
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,800
Medicine?

573
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,520
Gu Wei Yi is holding the prescription

574
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,360
Give me the prescription

575
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,760
Thank you

576
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,880
Let me help you

577
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,800
Where's the pharmacy?

578
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,000
Walk straight and turn right

579
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:55,760
Walk straight and turn right?

580
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,320
That's right

581
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,160
Okay, thank you

582
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,000
There

583
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,280
Why do we always have
the different frequency rate?

584
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,640
Maybe I shouldn't expect for it

585
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,120
I didn't cry

586
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,440
Wipe your sweat

587
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,360
For your girlfriend?

588
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,400
No, I lost it

589
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,480
What's her favourite brand?

590
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,720
I don't remember

591
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,800
It's okay, let me recommend to you

592
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:29,960
Look at this

593
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,560
Feel it, it's comfortable

594
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,920
and different from other brand

595
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:35,960
Touch it

596
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,760
It's different from other brand

597
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:38,680
Touch it

598
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,520
It's comfortable

599
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,320
It's okay

600
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,320
It's comfortable

601
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,680
Don't go

602
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,680
Boy

603
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,120
Don't be shamed

604
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,880
It's comfortable
