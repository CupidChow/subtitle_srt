- The rest room?

161
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,100
If you turn left at the corner, it'll be right there.

162
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,099
And the coffee shop is this way.

163
00:14:54,099 --> 00:14:55,599
Oh, thank you.

164
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,999
She's clearly here for a marriage meeting.

165
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,099
Wow, their staff is really well trained!

166
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,800
You're here, CEO Lee?

167
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,099
Piss off.

168

I'm not your friend right now. I'm Seong Hyeon Group legal consultant.

169
00:15:24,599 --> 00:15:27,100
What's this about that you even used a Red Call to contact me?

170
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,199
"How dare he use a Red Call to call us when he's a mere attorney?"

171
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:32,099
Exactly.

172
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:35,699
How dare some lawyer tell me, the CEO, to come and go as he pleases?

173
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,500

176
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,099
This isn't a joke.

177
00:16:11,099 --> 00:16:13,099
I'm not joking around, either.

178
00:16:13,099 --> 00:16:16,500
This is Grandpa's fortune, so he should be free to do with it as he wants.

179
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,699
It's none of my business to butt in.

180
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,000
Fine. But first, take a seat.

181
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,600
Don't you understand what this means?

182
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,400
If you get the Chairman's shares on top of the ones you already have,

183
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,900
you can completely take over Seong Hyeon Group!

184
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,000
But in exchange, I have to marry the woman he wants me to marry.

185
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,729
That's the condition!

186
00:16:43,729 --> 00:16:47,600
I have no intention of doing that.

187
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,600
Aren't you curious about who that woman is, at the very least?

188
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,800
Not in the slightest.

189
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,099
Because I know who it is, even without being told.

190
00:16:53,099 --> 00:16:55,199
This isn't the first time this has happened.

191
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,799
Even when he wrote his first will three years ago...

192
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:01,000
It's not Han Ju Hee.

193
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:08,700
Well, regardless of who it is, I have no interest in any of this.

194
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,899
This has nothing to do with me,

195
00:17:10,899 --> 00:17:12,300
even if he said he'd hand over his entire fortune.

196
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,900
I'm perfectly satisfied with what I have now.

197
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,000
I can get back on my feet under my own power.

198
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:22,399
If Grandpa did this by himself, then so can I.

199
00:17:22,399 --> 00:17:25,200
This woman is someone that neither of us knows.

200
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,699
And I'm sure that other people don't know who she is, either.

201
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:32,200
You may not want the fortune, but that may not be the case with this woman!

202
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,000
So what?

203
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,499
When I said that this has nothing to do with me, I meant it.

204
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:47,200
I thought you made the right decision last time, too.

205
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,199
But not this time.

206
00:17:51,099 --> 00:17:52,899
I don't think this is the right choice.

I don't enjoy losing games either.

Here, let me give you a stamp.

Ms. Kim, I have five "good job" stamps now.

Oh, really?

220
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:16,200
What about me, Teacher? Why aren't you giving me a stamp?

221
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,299
Let's see here.

- Yes, Ms. Kim!

226
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:38,199
I wonder what kind of woman she is that the Chairman loves her so much?

227
00:19:38,199 --> 00:19:40,700
Probably a nine-tailed fox.
(Korean legend: fox that assumes woman's form to prey on men)

228
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,299
There's no other rational explanation as to how this could've happened.

229
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:47,300
Hey, who knows? She might be beautiful, just like Yang Guifei*.
(*- one of the "Four Beauties" of ancient China)

230

Please take a seat.

243

Um, have you heard of a man named Lee Gyu Cheol?

244
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,200
Lee Gyu Cheol... Lee Gyu Cheol?

245
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,199
I don't have a child by that name in my class.

246
00:21:59,199 --> 00:22:01,700
They must be in a different class.

247

We're not here to discuss any of your students today.

248
00:22:08,899 --> 00:22:10,200
Then?

249
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,300
Have you ever heard of Seong Hyeon Group?

250
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,500
Yes, of course!

251
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,499
The Chairman over there is using his name's spellings: Lee, Gyu, Cheol.

252
00:22:17,499 --> 00:22:20,100
Oh, I see.

253
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:23,699
But, um, what brings you here?

254
00:22:23,699 --> 00:22:26,300
I doubt that you came all the way here just to tell me that.

255
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,600
No, of course not. The reason why we came here is—

256
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,000
Because we're curious as to how you wiggled your way into this situation.

257
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
What exactly did you do to our boss?

258
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,999
What kind of seductive maneuvers did you use on him?

00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,300

00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,800
"Oh?"

262
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,900
"Oh?"

263
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:50,400
I have no idea what exactly I did, either.

264
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,000
But I'm certain of one thing.

265
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,600
The reason why you go around with an attorney.

266
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:00,899
I'm sure you get into tons of trouble with that nasty way of talking.

267
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,500
I think it'd be better if you continued speaking instead, Mr. Attorney.

268
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:10,999
- I apologize.
- No, you have nothing to be sorry for.

269
00:23:10,999 --> 00:23:13,800
It seems that the educated people are definitely different from others, though.

270
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,699
After all, one should apologize if they did something wrong.

271
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:29,700
I knew something was up yesterday and the day before yesterday.

272
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,600
And I was wondering why he was out of the office today as well.

273
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,600
So it's because of a woman this time?

274
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,000
And I have to be the one to clean up after his mess?

275
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,800
Why are you doing this to me, sir?

276
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,300
What? I didn't do anything.

277
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,999
I'm retired now.

278
00:23:43,999 --> 00:23:48,700
Then why don't you step down without causing such a commotion?

279
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,600
Do you not know what a nasty temper your grandson has, Chairman?

280
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,900
Of course I do. It's a nasty one.

281
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:58,199
But who knows? That crappy personality might improve if he gets himself a woman.

282
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:03,600
It'll just get worse!

283
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:09,299
All right. Let me get to the main point, first.

284
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:14,399
You'll inherit the fortune of Chairman Lee Gyu Cheol of Seong Hyeon Group.

285
00:24:14,399 --> 00:24:17,700
Oh my! Did he pass away, then?

286
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,999
No!

287
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,700
Sorry to tell you this, but he's still completely fine.

288
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,599
Um, no. That's not it.

289
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:25,300
He has just included you in his will.

290
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,400
In other words, she'll take a large fortune.

291
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,899
Um, I think you've got the wrong person.

292
00:24:40,999 --> 00:24:43,200
You're... saying that it's not you?

293
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,799
Well, I am Kim Da Hyeon, but I think you've found the wrong Kim Da Hyeon.

294
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,100
Um, I don't think so.

295
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,499
If the person that's mentioned in this document is, in fact, you,

296
00:24:55,499 --> 00:24:57,099
you're definitely the one we're looking for.

Oh, this is me.

299
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:13,300
The Chairman would like you to inherit some shares if you meet some conditions.

300
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,999
Of course, this won't take effect until Chairman Lee passes away.

301
00:25:14,999 --> 00:25:16,200
Some shares?

302
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,300
Do you even know the price of Seong Hyeon Group stock right now?

303
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,299
This is why I'm saying she'll be getting herself a nicely large fortune!

304
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:24,700
She seduced a man properly, and now she has tons of money handed to her!

If you're trying to scam me, do it properly!

315
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:09,499
How did you find out my social security number, anyway?

316
00:26:09,499 --> 00:26:11,399
There's no way that you're a real attorney. But even if you were so,

317
00:26:11,399 --> 00:26:14,400
you can't just use other people's personal info as you please!

318
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:16,800
You people aren't satisfied with voice phishing

319
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,999
so you're scamming people in person too, now?

320

What are you doing?

321
00:26:19,899 --> 00:26:21,900
Calling the cops.

322
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,300
You're going to finish all this off for sure by getting on the news?

323
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,100
Why? You scared?

324
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:29,500
Wait, ma'am. I really am a lawyer.

325
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:37,299
Furthermore, Chairman Lee Gyu Cheol, the testator, is the one who provided us with your information.

326
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:39,399
But how does he even know me?

327
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:41,399
That's what I'd like to know!

328
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:44,300
I have no interest in how you seduced Grandpa

329
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:47,499
but I'm very curious to see what kind of trouble you'll cause next!

330
00:26:47,499 --> 00:26:49,200
That's the complete opposite of how I feel, then.

331
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,099
I'm really curious about how I seduced this chairman of yours.

332
00:26:53,099 --> 00:26:56,800
But I have a good idea of what will happen next.

333
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,600
What do you mean by that?

334
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:02,200
I'm putting this out here just in case, but people like you are the absolute worst.

335
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,400
I feel the exact same way!

336

The people around you don't like you very much, do they?

338

Who on earth is that young lady? How did you get to know her?

339
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:29,299
I have a personal debt to repay to her.

340
00:27:29,299 --> 00:27:31,800
A debt, sir? You have a debt?

341
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,099
Oh... that figures.

342
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,300
Her family is well-off, isn't it?

343
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:45,800
Yeah. A household with a lot of liquid assets rather than a struggling company

344
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,700
- is much better—
- No, they probably aren't.

345
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,500
Does she have political ties, then?

346
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,600
There is not even a block leader in her family.

347
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,300
She doesn't have any money or connections?

348
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:57,099
- Then why did you do something so mean—
- Something mean?

349
00:27:57,099 --> 00:27:58,800
Yes, it is.

350
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,200
I bet that the CEO will eat her alive with that personality of his.

351

Oh, I feel so bad for that teacher. She's in a pitiful situation, like me.

352
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:08,200
No, not at all.

353
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:12,799
I bet she's already ground Jae In to dust by now.

354
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,700
Oh, I wish I were there to see it.

355
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:23,800
I don't think you get what I'm saying.

356

I have no relationship to Seong Hyeon Group, whatsoever!

357

And I don't know Mr. Lee Gyu Cheol, either!

358

It's too late to wiggle out of this now!

359
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,199
You said yourself just now that you knew him well!

360

Um, I think you did acknowledge that you know him.

Don't you know the President of Korea?

362

I even know the President of the United States well.

But I don't expect them to recognize me!

364

Then... you've never met him in person, then?

365
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,099
Who? The President of the United States?

366
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:56,500
Well, I've seen him on TV, of course!

367
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,400
I bet you see him on TV sometimes, too!

368
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:02,900
Chairman Lee Gyu Cheol is on TV and on the radio sometimes, right?

369
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:11,000
Why don't you believe me? I'm telling you I have no relationship with him!

All right. Please calm down.

Please take a seat.

373
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,499
Um, this is definitely not a mistake or an error of any kind.

374
00:29:25,499 --> 00:29:29,599
If you just meet these requirements, you will become the owner of this document!

375
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:35,300
You know, those "requirements" have been bothering me for a while. What are they?

376
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,100
Pardon?

377
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,899
Well, um...

the, um, fortune...

379
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:47,899
Is it hard for you to tell me what the condition is?

380
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:55,200
You must get married in order to inherit it.

381
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,200
Pardon? What did you say?

382
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,399
If you get married to someone of Chairman Lee's choosing,

383
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,299
you will have fulfilled the condition to inherit his fortune.

384
00:30:02,299 --> 00:30:04,800
Of course, the details of the proceedings will—

385
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,100
Wait, whoa. Hold up. Who does he want me to marry?

386
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:12,699
Well, um, the man that Chairman Lee has chosen is...

387
00:30:12,699 --> 00:30:14,099
Mr. Lee Jae In.

388
00:30:14,099 --> 00:30:16,199
If you're against that, however, the next person would be Min—

389
00:30:16,199 --> 00:30:18,700
- Stop right there.
- Are you out of your mind?

390
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,899
Oh... my... gosh.

Wait. Are you that... Mr. Lee Jae In, by any chance?

Wow. What a nightmare.

Ditto.

394
00:30:31,299 --> 00:30:35,699
All right. What will you do now?

395
00:30:35,699 --> 00:30:37,599
Mr. Lee Jae In is Chairman Lee's

396
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:40,000
eldest grandson in a direct line.

397
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,499
If he marries you—

398
00:30:41,499 --> 00:30:44,000
- Stop spouting nonsense!
- No way!

399

What was with that sigh just now?

400
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,400
A sigh of relief. At least we've agreed on something important.

401
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,700
I don't even have the slightest intention of marrying you.

- So?
- What do you mean?

403
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,400
What are you planning to do? That's what I'm asking, obviously!

404
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:09,200
You should've taken care of the marriage business when you seduced Grandpa!

405
00:31:13,299 --> 00:31:18,200
By any chance... do you have a problem communicating with people?

406
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,100
What?

407
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:24,900
How many times do I have to tell you? I don't know your grandpa!

408
00:31:32,499 --> 00:31:36,800
I really don't think she knew about this.

409
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,700
You're not falling for her too, are you?

410
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,700
You don't believe everything she says, do you?

411
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,899
Well, I don't know if I believe her completely.

412
00:31:43,899 --> 00:31:49,299
But judging from what she says, it seems like she really doesn't know.

413

00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:17,999
Honey. The woman I chose to be Jae In's wife is a schoolteacher.

471
00:37:17,999 --> 00:37:22,199
I met her last time when I was coming to see you.

472
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:25,700
She's just like you. And she's kind, too.

473
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:40,200
Take this to the subway station. And be sure to go to the hospital tomorrow!

474
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,500
Here you go.

475
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:45,400
Mr. Driver, please take him to a subway station nearby.

476
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,200
You can't just get off halfway! If you do, I'll get mad!

477
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,100
Goodbye, then! Go!

478
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,699
That rotten punk.

479
00:37:59,699 --> 00:38:01,399
Jae In, your favorite, is here.

480
00:38:01,399 --> 00:38:04,800
Take a good look at how I'm educating my grandson from there, okay?

481
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,200
Come in!

482
00:38:16,699 --> 00:38:20,600
We're here, Chairman. You're doing well, right?

483
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:24,299
Yes, I've been fine through the night. Nothing's been going on, really.

484
00:38:25,999 --> 00:38:28,800
You're not even going to greet your grandfather?

485
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,100
Did your grandmother raise you to act that way?

486
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:34,599
To not even greet your elders but just stare a hole through them?

487
00:38:36,399 --> 00:38:37,999
I'm here.

488
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:49,700
I'm not doing so well right now because of Grandpa, Grandma.

489
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,500
I'll distribute my fortune as I wish.

490
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,899
That includes SH Mall, of course.

491
00:39:03,899 --> 00:39:08,300
I don't know about Seong Hyeon Group, but the SH Mall shares belong to my late father.

492
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:12,800
That's right up to now. In the future, it'll be up to how you act.

493
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,500
Don't blackmail me pointlessly.

494
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,199
You're giving your shares to some woman

495
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:18,299
as a way to get me to come back to the company.

496
00:39:18,299 --> 00:39:19,299
What's the meaning of this?

497
00:39:19,299 --> 00:39:22,900
What do you mean, blackmail? How could you say that to your grandpa?

498
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:25,000
If Da Hyeon knew you'd be this uncouth,

499
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,299
I'm sure she'd be quite disappointed.

500
00:39:27,299 --> 00:39:29,200
Why don't you marry her yourself, then?

501
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,800
I know, right? If only I were 30 years younger...

502
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,800
Geez.

503
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,700
You make the decision. I'm not trying to sell you anything, here.

504
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:39,600
No, you're doing exactly that.

505
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,599
Ju Hee from last time was Chairman Han's daughter.

506
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:44,799
It would've been perfect to have their company merge with Seong Hyeon Chemicals.

507
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,399
And yet, you refused!

508
00:39:46,399 --> 00:39:48,599
If you'd just gotten married back then,

509
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:50,899
Seong Hyeon Chemicals would've been much more profitable.

510
00:39:50,899 --> 00:39:54,300
We could've even dominated the bio industry first as well.

511
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,899
It seems like you need to sell your grandson off in marriage

512
00:39:56,899 --> 00:40:01,200
to keep Seong Hyeon Chemicals afloat, but I don't do business like that.

513
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,800
What is it about that teacher that you're investing so much in her?

514
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:10,200
She's a special child. She has something that neither of us has.

515
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:14,600
I don't know what that may be. But what if I refuse?

516
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,099
Jae In.

517
00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:22,399
Well, Seong Hyeon Group will become Tae Ha's. Of course, that includes SH Mall's shares.

518
00:40:22,399 --> 00:40:24,700
There's no reason that you must be my successor, after all.

519
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,700
Actually, I called Tae Ha over. I want to hear what he has to say.

520
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,800
Oh yeah.

521
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,900
These scammers aren't calling me anymore.

522
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,899
It'd be nice if he really was the grandson of Seong Hyeon Group's chairman.

523
00:41:03,899 --> 00:41:08,000
That way, he could make Ji Su their main model and help him out.

524
00:41:12,699 --> 00:41:16,800
Did you call me and Tae Ha over to try and compare us?

525
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,500
Fine. You've managed to find my weakness.

526
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:28,500
But I'm not nice enough to just sit and take your bait.

527
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:32,200
Therefore, let's take this opportunity to negotiate things.

528
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,800
You're really going to marry her?

529
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,400
Hell no!

530
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,400
Like I said, I'm not a nice person.

531
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,199
As if I didn't know that already. So?

532
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:43,900
I'll date her, at the very least.

533
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:47,300
I'll seriously date her for just three months.

534
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,300
And if it doesn't work out, I'll chalk it up to fate.

535
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,199
And you must give up.

536
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:52,600
One year.

537
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,900
Five months.

538
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,600
Six months.

539
00:42:22,799 --> 00:42:25,699
My grandpa wants us to get married.

540
00:42:25,699 --> 00:42:27,300
She wants all three of us to meet up.

541
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,500
And why do I need to agree to that?

542
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,500
Who else would she want to see, then, if not you?

543
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,200
She says that she really doesn't know who you are!

544
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:37,100
Well, you take care of that. That's your mission.

545
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,899
Want me to carry you in?

546
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,300
Do you know what a three-legged race is?

547
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:48,200
My grandpa has tied you and me together.

548
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:51,400
- With what?
- Marriage.

549
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,290
