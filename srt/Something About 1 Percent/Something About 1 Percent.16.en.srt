Why are you so surprised? It's making me feel bad.

11

I didn't know that I would see you here.

You still don't know after I taught you that.

Yes, Teacher.

42

me with another woman...

But I can't let go of those two things no matter how hard I think about it.

62

68

I'm not that confident to marry into a family that doesn't want me. So you get approval from your family.

We're going to live together anyway once we get married.

Who knows what will happen? When we marry, we'll have married.

79

So are you saying you won't marry me?

80
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,160
I will. I said I would.

81
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,950
But after we get both families' approvals.

82
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:56,440

No, but it has to be like that.

His name is Lee Jae In. Sorry but it's impossible for them to get an oriental medicine doctor as their son-in-law.

164
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,000
What is this?

165
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,820
You're laughing?

166
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,590
Marriage? Absolutely not!

167
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:34,450
Of course not. You said this was just business.

168
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:38,820
At first it started with a contract, but not anymore.

169
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,790
I will take good care of her and we will live well together, cherishing each other.

170
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,730
Please allow this marriage.

171
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:50,700
Da Hyeon, I want you to marry an average man.

172
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,710
It doesn't have to be an oriental medicine doctor.

173
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:57,680
Jae In is a good man.

174
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,790
And I like him too.

175
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:04,520
People always like each other in the beginning. That's how they marry.

176
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:08,370
But things are different once they start living together.

177
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:13,180
Especially, when people are totally different, it gets harder and more tiring.

178
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:18,450
I'm sorry but I don't want to see my daughter suffer.

179
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,860
Marriage? It doesn't have to be done so hastily.

180
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:24,840
Meet many other men and marry when you're over 30.

181
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,120
It definitely cannot work with you two.

182
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:43,560
Jin Ju Oriental Medicine Clinic

183
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,220
What do we do?

184
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,380
Yeah...

185
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,250
Do you just want to run away?

186
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,500
We can also try for a baby (before marriage).

187
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,080
Ugh, really.

188
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:01,460
Should we listen to my dad and take it slowly? It's not like we are in a rush.

189
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,750
I'm feeling the rush though.

190
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,420
Jae In.

191
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:09,460
Don't worry. I'm going to get his approval no matter what.

192
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,870
As long as your feelings don't change, everything will be okay.

193
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:40,920
Jinju 2 km

194
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,920
Who is it?

195
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:53,720
Ah yes, this is Lee Jae In who visited you with Da Hyeon last time.

196
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,970
Sorry, please leave.
(speaking formally throughout)

197
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,680
Wait.

198
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,560
You are here again.

199
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:31,350
Yes, Mother. I want to meet you in person today. I have something to tell you.

200
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:34,760
Even if you keep doing this, nothing will change.

201
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,060
I'm sorry.

202
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,650
He's here again, Da Hyeon's man.

203
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,330
Who's Da Hyeon's man?

204
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:04,140
The whole neighborhood already knows.

205
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:07,240
He's so busy, but he keeps on coming over here as if he's our next-door neighbor.

206
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,680
I've lost track of how many times he's been here.

207
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,400
Let him in.

208
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:17,790
I know very well your concerns.

209
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:23,180
However, I don't believe Da Hyeon would be happy with another man.

210
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,090
She would live a more emotionally comfortable life with an average man rather than a chaebol member.

211
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:27,030
There is more to tell you.

212
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:31,590
We broke up before this decision and tried to forget each other but it was very hard.

213
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,300
It didn't make us emotionally comfortable at all.

214
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,020
So you want to fight me?

215
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:39,430
If I beat you in any battle, will you give me Da Hyeon?

216
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,180
Mom, you called him?

217
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,470
Where is Jae In?

218
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,750
Who called who? He came on his own.

219
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:03,110
I never saw you even during school breaks, but look at you flying over here when I said he was here.

220
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:05,190
It's not like that, Mom.

221
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:09,730
Huh? Oh my!

222
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,870
You smell of alcohol!

223
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:17,520
Jae In, are you okay?

224
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,420
Yeah, I'm fine.

225
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:22,320
I got his approval.

226
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,520
Pardon?

227
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,900
I got his approval.

228
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:30,820
Let's get married, Kim Da Hyeon.

229
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:36,830
♫ That you love me and that I'm your only one. If you hug me just like that, ya ya ya ♫

230
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:45,090
♫ Then everything would change, ya ya ya ♫

231
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:50,760
Well done! You guys are so good!

232
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,090
You've worked hard!

233
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:55,080
Thank you, bye!

234
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,990
- Bye!
- Bye!

235
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,920
Let's go.

236
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,120
Whew, I'm really tired.

237
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,750
Huh? Jae In! You're here.

238
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:23,530
An official press announcement will be released soon. It'll be a little noisy. Will you be okay?

239
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:27,750
Well, it's a good thing that school is on break right now. Hopefully the kids won't be so noisy about it.

240
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,500
Who knows?

241
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:33,840
Can you maybe quit and take good care of our future kid—

242
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:39,910
Oh, I just remembered!

243
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:45,590
Aren't we going to do a prenup?

244
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:50,590
Of course we do. I'll even have it notarized by a lawyer for sure.

245
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:53,610
What are you going to lie about this time?

246
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:55,050
No divorce is allowed.

247
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:58,420
Until we get old and die, no matter what. It's for life.

248
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:02,130
Shouldn't we think about that a bit more? Who knows what will happen?

249
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:06,130
This is non-negotiable. I can't yield on this, so you give up.

250
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:12,120
Not that kind of stuff. Should we write in something about giving up money or alimony?

251
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,350
Why do we need such things? I told you there would be no divorce anyway.

252
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,780
So I have a favor to ask.

253
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,440
Please don't abandon me but live with me.

254
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,100
Have a seat here.

255
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:49,200
Teacher Kim Da Hyeon, will you marry me?
(speaking formally)

256
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:02,590
Yes, Lee Jae In.

257
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:17,650
♫ You always call me first and take care of every one of our anniversaries ♫

258
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:26,650
♫ You even smile at me who when I'm stupid enough to forgot your birthday ♫

259
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:33,640
♫ The day when I was shy to introduce you to my friends ♫

260
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,880
Where do you want to go for our honeymoon?

261
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,870
Mauritius, Africa?

262
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:41,430
No, it's too far.

263
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:44,590
How about Hawaii for 29 nights and 30 days?

264
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,130
It sounds good, but too long.

265
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:51,350
But it's our honeymoon...

266
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,330
Should we go to Canada?

267
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:03,960
Can your birth mom come to our wedding?

268
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,870
It'll probably be hard.

269
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,910
Then we should go!

270
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,560
Would that be okay?

271
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,800
Anywhere you are, I'll be there.

272
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:23,220
♫ when I saw you sick and lying down ♫

273
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:27,240
♫ I knew then that I loved you ♫

274
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:32,560
♫ As long as you're okay with it, ♫

275
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:39,900
♫ I can love you forever ♫

276
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:06,020
Kim Da Da...

277
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,760
You're here?

278
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,820
You look really pretty!

279
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:15,100
Wow! It's no joke.

280
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,790
- Do I look good?
- Yeah.

281
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:22,690
Da Da, live really happily!

282
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,580
Oh, man, really.

283
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,770
You couldn't wait to be here?

284
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:50,260
Excuse me! Isn't it time for your entrance?

285
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:53,070
Ah yes, I'm going soon.

286
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:05,380
You're not going to get lost on the way to me, are you?

287
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:09,220
My dad said he would walk me over there.

288
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:12,630
Oh, really.

289
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:18,010
Why are you laughing?

290
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,270
Are you that happy?

291
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:24,800
I wondered who would marry a nasty demon king like you, but it turns out that it's me.

292
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,850
Da Da, your life is now over.

293
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:30,840
What is she saying?

294
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:36,520
With all this celebration, come on... Kiss each other! Kiss, kiss, kiss!

295
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,460
Aww, come on. Hurry, hurry.

296
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:57,540
Congratulations!

297
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,150
Oh, what is this?

298
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:04,610
Oh, is this showing up well?

299
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:09,330
Kim Da Da, you traitor!

300
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:12,920
Do you feel good leaving your unni alone and getting married?

301
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:16,410
Indeed, you did look happy.

302
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:20,290
You were really pretty today.

303
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:22,620
And you looked happier than anybody else in the world.

304
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:29,720
Live well with Jae In by loving each other,

305
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,640
and live happily!

306
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:38,590
If Jae In makes you upset, just let me know. I will not leave him alone!

307
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:44,310
- One day, a Prince Charming like Jae In
will show up for me too, right?
- Huh? Look!

308
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:46,020
Is that Tae Ha?

309
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,390
What is he doing?

310
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:48,490
Why is he over there?

311
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:49,720
Huh?

312
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,330
Tae Ha? What brings you here at this time without calling first?

313
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:54,450
Are they dating?

314
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:57,690
What is that?

315
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:00,080
What's he doing? Why is he acting like that?

316
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,190
Hmm... Excuse me...

317
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:06,180
By chance, do you... have some time?

318
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,600
That is... Hmm...

319
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:16,810
Wow, this is something else.

320
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,570
What is this?

321
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:20,830
Where is my phone?

322
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,120
This is too funny.

323
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:26,380
Okay now, 876+357? You have to add the last numbers first.

324
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,160
Yes.

325
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,750
- 6+7 is?
- 13!

326
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:33,860
And you write 3 here and carry the 1, and 7+5 is?

327
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,370
- 12.
- That's correct!

328
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:39,380
So whatever you think about the topics, money is very important. Okay?

329
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,340
Ah, do you know what this is?

330
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,850
Um... Nickel?

331
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:45,680
- It's worth five cents.
- Five cents.

332
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,600
What about this one?

333
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,280
Hmm... I don't know.

334
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,400
I did it correctly but...

335
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,850
It's done.

336
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:39,580
- All done.
- Thank you.

337
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,180
You look pretty.

338
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:47,430
Oh my! Your hair is all tangled. Let's comb it out.

339
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:52,890
There are hotels, transportation, and leisure sports—

340
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:55,170
For hotels, we'll increase the capital by issuing new stock.

341
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,220
- Let's focus on this.
- Yes.

342
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:00,720
The capital amount is smaller but it's doing well right now.

343
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,260
Okay.

344
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:07,960
Jae In, do you know how to sleep with your eyes open?

345
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:13,200
Ah, it's nothing.

346
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:19,090
I don't know how to do it yet, but why do you ask?

347
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,560
I'm at a music event with mother-in-law.

348
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,630
Try to endure it.

349
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:48,680
If you doze off, my mom will hate you.

350
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:53,680
Chopin is definitely a classic no matter when I hear it.

351
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:57,390
Our daughter-in-law has much passion for music.

352
00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:00,630
What kind of music do you like, Da Hyeon?

353
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,420
Me?

354
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:08,400
I love Ji Su's "Open Your Heart."

355
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:14,000
It's in his first mini-album. Please take a listen.

356
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,740
He's going to be in a music program today so if you vote for him, that'll be even better.

357
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:28,580
How can you listen to idol music?

358
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,760
You're not a kid.

359
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:36,380
If you say something like that as Seong Hyeon Group's person, your level of understanding of music—

360
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:42,300
He sings well.

361
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:47,450
Does it matter if it's classic or pop as long as the music has sincerity?

362
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,780
My daughter-in-law is going to be the next first lady of Seong Hyeon Group.

363
00:31:54,780 --> 00:32:00,550
Seong Hyeon Group does not accept a lady as a daughter-in-law because she knows a little bit of music or art.

Yes, very well.

A little bit.

But you said you would take good care of me when we get older.

374

So I'm just waiting patiently until then.

I wonder if this is enough.

382
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,860
It's okay. It should be enough.

383
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,530
It's the weekend. You should rest a bit in the morning.

384
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:48,660
I can't. I'm going to be volunteering at the orphanage with Ji Su.

385
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:52,660
Then you should drop the bazaar event. It's not as easy as you think.

386
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:55,780
But how can I? Your mom is leading that event.

387
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,790
And I think it'll be fun.

388

You're being too hard on yourself. At this rate, you'll get sick.

00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,800
It's okay.

390
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:07,730
I'm off!

391
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:09,550
Drive carefully.

392
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:21,010
Bye.

393
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,940
What?

394
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,510
Shall I go then?

395
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:29,940
Should we stay together a little longer before you go?

396
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,910
I'm really going to go.

397
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:33,770
What?

398
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:35,800
Maybe I shouldn't let you go.

399
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:41,180
Get in the car.

400
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,960
Bye.

401
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,020
I need to go to work too.

402
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,240
I heard Seong Hyeon Group's little madam is here. Who is she?

403
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,880
We need to make a good impression on her with this opportunity for sure.

404
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,640
I know.

405
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:56,580
That's what I'm saying.

406
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:58,500
This will fit, right?

407
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,740
Does it look big?

408
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,580
- I'll look around and come back.
- Yes.

409
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:02,310
Huh?

410
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:04,770
Oh wait, Managing Director Lee Jae In.

411
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,540
Are you going to sell all these yourself?

412
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:10,620
I'll be done if I sell these. Do you want to buy them for me?

413
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,840
Isn't that cheating?

414
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:16,520
Well, it's for a good cause because the profit is will be donated to Angel Orphanage.

415
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:20,080
Customer, it's not that expensive.

416
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,030
Okay, okay, I will give you at a discount.

417
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:25,360
For all these, ₩50,000 (about $45)!

418
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,820
Here, okay.

419
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:29,500
I'm so generous! I'll take off another ₩1,000 (about 90¢).

420
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,960
And I'll throw this in.

421
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:36,040
There you go.

422
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:39,660
So we can go now?

423
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,980
Yeah, hurry and go.

424
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,410
- Then I'm off.
- Yeah.

425
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:43,820
Okay.

426
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:44,800
- We'll see you.
- Yes.

427
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,850
Good-bye.

428
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:50,320
Two... Then she's the one?

429
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:53,540
- Did you sell a lot?
- Yeah.

430
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:00,020
Stop this! That's why you called me over? To talk about such a thing?

431
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:04,640
Why don't you like me? I need to know the reason.

432
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,740
I don't dislike you.

433
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:06,610
Then why?

434
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:09,800
I said that I didn't dislike you but I didn't say I like you.

435
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:14,140
Also, I don't date just anybody.

436
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,190
Then do you just want to sleep together?

437
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,900
I think that might be better.

438
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,860
Then you have to marry me. Are you okay with that?

439
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,960
No!

440
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:28,550

Managing Director, did you see the news?

443
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,470
What is it? Did they say I'm cheating or something?

444
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:45,500
That's false.

445
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,220
No, that's not it. The little madam...

446
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:51,460

No, here.

00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:04,290
Has her face already been revealed through the video?

00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:05,830
Probably...

453
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:07,690
Ask them to process the face to hide it, right away.

Not really.

483
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:10,460
Let go of me. Ah, really.

484
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:13,680
Do you really like me that much?

485
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,750
I like you.

486
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:16,020
♫ She hugs my arm tightly  ♫

487
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,120
Oh, boy. I'm going crazy.

488
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,120
Okay, fine. Let's date.

489

♫ She is, oh my girl  ♫

490
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:22,650
Are you serious?

491
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:25,790
In return, marriage is not allowed.

492
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:28,130
I have no plan to get married at all.

493
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:30,100
Let's just date.
♫ All of her body is small ♫

494
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,260
I'm going to marry.

495
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,580
♫ Her fingers and feet as well ♫

496
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,020
My damn popularity!

♫ Her small feet that are smaller than my hand, walk very well  ♫

You are so pretty.

502
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,590
I've always been pretty.

503
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:52,950
Really.

504
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,870
Really...

Lee Gyu Cheol SH Love Scholarship Foundation Launch

506
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,980
I'm Lee Gyu Cheol.

507
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:22,800
As embarrassing as this is, I spent eighty years of my life focusing only on making money.

508
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:29,490
That's how I have lived all these years forgetting the people

509
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:32,130
who have made me who I am today, along with this Seong Hyeon Group.

510
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:34,980
But as I took a look around myself,

511
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:39,030
I found that there are so many people

512
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:40,620
who do outrageous acts of kindness and crazy good deeds.

513
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:43,100
Are you all right?

514
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,920
Those who willingly help the weak and the sick,

515
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:51,550
and people in their times of difficulty.

516
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:54,490
Mr. Driver, please take him to a subway station nearby.

517
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:55,460
You can't just get off halfway!

518
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:59,990
Really, there are people who think that doing such good deeds is not so special.

519
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,540
And because of those people,

520
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,400
this world is still livable.

521
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,300
In my eighties,

522
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:10,350
I learned it.

523
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,560
One percent of

524
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:19,550
uniqueness can be another's 99% of fortune.

525
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:22,420
I've only figured that out now.

526
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,750
Look, there's someone with 99 positive qualities.

527
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:34,670
But if he shows just one negative trait,

528
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:39,130
you can't like him at all although he is so good.

529
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:45,150
But there's someone with 99 bad qualities. If you see his one good trait,

530
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:46,960
you can fall for that one good trait.

531
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,460
That's that person's charm!

532
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:52,160
The charm that only you know and felt attracted to,

533
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,680
that's Jae In's charm.

534
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,430
I hope that those special people will grow in number.

535
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:04,700
I also want to become a special person that knows how to give back.

536
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:14,360
Like I found the 1% uniqueness in my life,

537
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:18,940
I hope that you all find

538
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:22,990
1% of something.

539
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:50,690
What are you going to do? You were so close to getting his fortune.

540
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:54,390
Grandpa said he's going to give all of his money away to charity.

541
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:56,460
I don't care.

542
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:59,720
My dream is to form my own conglomerate anyway.

543
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,250
How about you? Any regret for the money lost here?

544
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:08,300
I'm fine because I received the biggest present from Grandpa.

545
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:11,100
What? What did he give you without me?

546
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:15,950
Why did you leave yourself out? He gave me you only as a throw-in.

547
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:21,860
Our chances of meeting were just 1%.

548
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:24,460
But because of that, my life changed.

549
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:27,820
It's 99% destiny.

550
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:31,750
Come to think of it, I already found my 1%.

551
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:39,360
I think it's perfect now.

552
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:42,000
Me too.

553
00:43:52,200 --> 00:44:01,500
Thank you for watching "1% of Something."
