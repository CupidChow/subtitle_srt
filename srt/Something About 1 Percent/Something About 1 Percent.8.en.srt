That way, he could make Ji Su their main model and help him out.

00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,330
CEO.

162
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,010
See me for a moment, Team Leader Gang.

163
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:35,360
W-Why does he want to see me?

164
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,860
Man, I'm so scared.

165
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,130
Me too.

166
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:43,150
Make sure to come back alive.

167
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:53,910
Can you look into this for me, please?

168
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:00,160
I'm sure Grandfather has noticed this as well.

169
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,570
I think we'll have to take some countermeasures.

170
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:05,420
Actually, I've been bothered by many things since the fake bomb threat last time.

171
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,890
Why are you entrusting this to me, sir?

172
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,840
Because you're the only one I can trust.

173
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,950
You'll have to really pick a side and stick to it now.

174
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,780
My grandfather may be strong-willed right now,

175
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:19,560
but I'm planning to be even stronger-willed than him for the next 30 years or so.

176
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:26,260
I-I-I'm with you, sir...

177
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,010
Yes, of course.

178
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,880
You can leave now.

179
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:40,710
I feel like our school has a lot of demo classes.

180
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:43,020
I know, right.

182
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,990
♫ That I love you and you are the only one ♫

183
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:58,540
♫ Hug me sweetly ya, ya, ya ♫

184
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:03,120
♫ Everything will change, ya ya ya ♫

185
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,270
Yes.

186
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,800
I'm sorry, but I don't think I'll be able to see you today.

187
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,460
Are you going to keep doing this to me? You canceled on me last time, too!

188
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,020
That's why we took a walk!

189
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,140
I'm busy too, you know! I have to prepare for my demo classes,

190
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,120
and my girls are competing in a dance contest next month.

191
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,010
So...

192
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:22,500
Are you saying that that's more important than me?

193
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,850
Of course.

194
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:26,240
Let's forget about today and meet up on the weekend instead.

195
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,520
This isn't a favor I'm asking of you, this is a request.

196
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:33,420
Oh, right... Isn't it your turn to come down this time? That makes it fair.

197
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,910
Kick the ball to us!

198
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,370
Yes, then do so.

199
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:07,890
Thank you.

200
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,740
Here you go.

201
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,120
Anyone that doesn't have one?

202
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:31,040
All right, guys. Today, we'll be reading a biography book and writing a book report about it.

203
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,660
I want you to write about what you think, feel, and get impressed, okay?

204
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,810
Yes!

205
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,530
Yes!

206
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:51,980
What are you doing here?

207
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:55,890
I'm here to study. You told me to come. To be fair.

208
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:58,990
Even so, who told you to come in here—

209
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,840
This is a classroom.

210
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,710
I'm visiting a class. The Vice Principal said it would be okay.

211
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,620
You're not a parent.

212
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:09,670
Then tell him I'm not a parent.

213
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:12,480
Goodbye!

214
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,670
Goodbye.

215
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:17,880
Mister, why aren't you leaving? Class is over.

216
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,650
Oh, I'm waiting for your teacher.

217
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:21,900
There she is.

218
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,200
Mister, are you our teacher's boyfriend?

219
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,020
Oh, that's not it, guys!

220
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,890
Yes, I'm her boyfriend.

221
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,640
You shouldn't lie to the kids.

222
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,090
He's teacher's boyfriend.

223
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:37,640
Dong Wu, let's go. You too, Dong In. What did I tell you?

224
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:41,060
I told you to beware of strangers. Don't ever talk to strangers, understand?

225
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,150
- Yes.
- Let's go.

226
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,190
Goodbye.

227
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:45,440
Yes, bye!

228
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,920
What? What's wrong now?

229
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,760
Rumors will go all around the school now! What are you going to do about it?

230
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,820
What do you want me to do? Take responsibility? You don't want to marry me, though.

231
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:05,160
Marriage, yeah right. I'll meet you at the hotel next time.

232
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,850
I'm going to hold a big sign with your name highlighted over there!

233
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:12,360
Try it if you want. The reporters would love that. Would it be okay with you?

234
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,780
Oh, really. How cunning he is!

235
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:37,350
This area is really quiet. I like it.

236
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,370
It's because the kids are all gone.

237
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:43,120
Transportation links might be a little inconvenient, but I think this place is good for the kids.

238
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,030
I'd love to build a resort here.

239
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:49,180
What the...This place is good for the kids. Don't even think about it!

240
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,670
This land belongs to the Department of Education.

241
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,140
Oh, my!

242
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,730
What?

243
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,640
You're not getting on?

244
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,980
You like doing everything kids do.

245
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,750
You've never been on one of these, have you?

246
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,990
I haven't either since I've grown up.

247
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,230
When I was a kid, it was really fun.

248
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:27,280
My dad pushed me so high.

249
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,900
♫ I’ll only whisper to you ♫

250
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,180
Oh, you're so heavy!

251
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,820
You're really heavy.

252
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:42,100
Come here.

253
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,260
I'm sorry! Don't come!

254
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,490
I'm coming up.

255
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:48,700
Do whatever you want. Whether you're coming up— Oh, no!

256
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,850
You're up here. Wait a minute. Oh my!

257
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,920
♫ I’m in love with you ♫

258
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,540
Where are you running away?

259
00:18:55,540 --> 00:19:00,730
♫ Like sunshine early in the morning ♫

260
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:05,670
♫ You spread inside me ♫

261
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:14,140
♫ My heart is filled with the color of you ♫

262
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:35,480
♫ Isn’t it about time to confess ♫

263
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:42,240
♫ I think it's about time for you to be able to say yes ♫

264
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,600
♫ It's not as easy as I thought ♫

265
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:54,250
♫ Looking into your clear eyes, my heart flutters ♫

266
00:19:54,250 --> 00:20:00,530
♫ How should I start over? ♫

267
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:06,340
♫ Whether it would be awkward or not ♫

268
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:10,800
♫ My head is such a mess ♫

269
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,980
You have to come to me next time.

270
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,610
Well...

271
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:26,640
You can also come to the hotel.

272
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:34,260
You didn't lock the door?

273
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,560
Of course I did. What is that?

274
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,990
Stay here.

275
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,210
Oh my!

276
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,630
Thief...

277
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,900
It must have been a thief!

278
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,500
Oh no, how could this be?

279
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:11,330
Are you okay?

280
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,470
It's okay, as long as no one got hurt.

281
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:15,310
There wasn't much to steal here.

282
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,490
Yeah.

283
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:17,960
Let's leave now.

284
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,520
Leave where? I need to clean this place up.

285
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:24,280
Then, you're thinking of sleeping here tonight?

286
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,310
Just pack up some of your clothes.

287
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:44,370
Your house...

288
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,870
What?

289
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:48,080
It's a bit empty.

290
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,550
Ah, I don't like being crowded with things.

291
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:53,080
Do you want to drink anything?

292
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,350
What do you have?

293
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:58,380
Alcohol, water... Do you want it?

294
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,850
Where is the bathroom? I want to wash my hands.

295
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:04,020
Ah, over there...

296
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:10,830
You're safe here, so take it easy and don't worry too much.

297
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:28,670
Something is off.

298
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:31,940
No, it didn't seem like there was anything expensive there.

299
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:35,870
Still, even if it were a petty theft... almost nothing was stolen.

300
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:38,930
Yes, I heard the police came too.

301
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:42,190
But please investigate further separately.

302
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:43,750
Yes.

303
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:59,020
What else is here except Zenga (a game)?

304
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:28,760
Acting all innocent.

305
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,330
What are you up to?

306
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,910
You are not changing?

307
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:40,290
It's a bit big since it's mine, but it should be more comfortable.

308
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:45,990
You are not leaving? I thought you were going to the hotel, since you have a lot of stuff to do.

309
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:50,270
I mean, I don't have to.

310
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:53,490
Wouldn't it be better to stay together

311
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:55,280
than be alone?

312
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,270
You're not going to leave, are you?

313
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:01,710
My house is pretty big and there are no bad guys here.

314
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:03,670
Well, good for you with this big house.

315
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:08,040
But are you sure there are no bad guys here?

316
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:21,320
What?

317
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:25,190
I didn't see it.

318
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,050
Did anyone say anything?

319
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,530
Ah, I really didn't see anything.

320
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,650
You want to sleep together here?

321
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,380
Can't we?

322
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,420
You seem like such a player.

323
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,190
So?

324
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:06,700
Speaking honestly, I'm swaying a little bit...

325
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:15,800
I don't think I can do this.

326
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,640
Why not?

327
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:22,060
Tomorrow morning,

328
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:25,740
one of us might regret it.

329
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:31,920
I don't think I will be the one to regret it.

330
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:36,220
Anyway, fine.

331
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:40,260
You go to bed first. I'm going to work some more and then go to bed.

332
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,520
I'm not going to the hotel now, though.

333
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:49,280
Oh, it's me, Da Da!

334
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:56,350
How has he not moved at all since he got there?

335
00:27:56,350 --> 00:28:00,860
Am I not so attractive? Is this good or bad?

336
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:19,980
You work on your hotel stuff.

337
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:23,430
I'm going to build a hotel.

338
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,190
You are not sleeping?

339
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:36,140
I need to rebuild this hotel. It fell down...

340
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:42,820
Then you should have called me. It's my specialty.

341
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:49,150
Oh, and this is not for building, it's for taking pieces out.

342
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:53,800
How many bottles did you have?

343
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,290
It's against the rules to do this all alone.

344
00:28:57,290 --> 00:29:00,110
What rules?

345
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,740
Do you want a sip?

346
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,730
It's raining outside.

347
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:14,200
I don't think it's quick shower this time.

348
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,040
Yeah, guess not.

349
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:31,300
Don't touch me.

350
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:35,200
Don't even think about "it," either.

351
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,070
I got it.

352
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,270
But really, can't I?

353
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:46,560
A guy who touches a drunk woman

354
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,090
is not even human.

355
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,900
So that's why you drank all this?

356
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,370
No.

357
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:04,210
I was wondering what I'm doing at a man's house.

358
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:09,380
Why did I come here?

359
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,950
What?

360
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:14,950
Because your house got robbed.

361
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,460
That's why I invited you.

362
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:41,160
Perhaps...

363
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,860
I've...

364
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:51,690
fallen for you.

365
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:08,170
I like having kisses with you.

366
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:18,330
Just sleep for today

367
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,960
You can sleep like this

368
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:37,080
after confessing your love to me?

369
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:52,180
♫ Like that, we went a few days without contact ♫

370
00:31:56,830 --> 00:32:03,500
♫ but instead of feeling hurt, I worried more ♫

371
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:11,670
♫ Wondering if you were sick or not ♫

372
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:17,040
♫ Have something bad going on ♫

373
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:27,760
♫ What do I do about this fleeting feeling? ♫

374
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:34,490
♫ Did I make you sad? ♫

375
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:56,680
Tomorrow morning

376
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:00,900
I'll probably be the one to regret.

377
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:58,440
Perhaps...

378
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,170
I've...

379
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:06,090
fallen for you.

380
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:08,050
Ah, what do I do?

381
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:11,310
I like having kisses with you.

382
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:20,240
Alcohol is an enemy! Are you crazy, Kim Da Da?

383
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:51,090
Aigoo.

384
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:05,980
Puppy! Oh! Hey!

385
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,860
Hold on...

386
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,520
Baby... baby!

387
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,400
What is she doing?

388
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:25,260
Hey! Come here!

389
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:31,230
Aigoo, good boy... oh no, I'm in trouble!

390
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,000
Oh, Jae In!

391
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,310
Jae In, are you okay?

392
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:49,830
Jae In? Are you... dead?

393
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:52,140
No, I'm not dead.

394
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:57,810
But what the heck were you doing?

395
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:02,010
Well... thank you.

396
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:04,670
Take care of yourself, not the puppy!

397
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:05,640
Did you see it?

398
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:09,620
Since I saw it, you ended up hurting this much. Why would you dive from up there, being so ignorant?

399
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:12,410
If you're that uncoordinated, you should really at least try to be careful.

400
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:14,480
Who are you calling uncoordinated? I'm quick on my feet.

401
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,420
Yeah, right, I saw how quick on your feet you were. Get up.

402
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:23,660
Oh no! What do I do... are you okay?

403
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:26,540
- Shoes, shoes... - Oh, it hurts.

404
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:28,230
Go inside.

405
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,310
You came early?

406
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:52,310
Yes, something feels off lately.

407
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,330
What?

408
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:57,230
SH Mall stocks have been jumping up too much.

409
00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:00,020
Well, you know how stocks can go up and down.

410
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:03,640
Don't worry. It's good for us anyways.

411
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:08,680
Don't think about that and keep your focus on that school teacher.

412
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,400
Oh, it smarts.

413
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:39,390
I'm fine, but your shoulder... Shouldn't you see a doctor?

414
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:48,350
Just stay put, I'm irritated from lack of sleep last night.

415
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:50,950
Why didn't you sleep well—

416
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:59,260
You're always irritated though.

417
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:08,130
Ouch, ow... it hurts!

418
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:10,430
Of course.

419
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:13,370
Would you be human if you didn't hurt like this after falling?

420
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,040
What?

421
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,070
Nothing.

422
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,250
But Jae In.

423
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:43,800
Don't change all of a sudden.

424
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,390
They say you'll die if you do that. (Korean proverb)

425
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:50,290
Really.

426
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:58,690
Why isn't he reacting?

427
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,940
Oh, it smarts.

428
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:42,400
Knock-knock. Does it hurt a lot?

429
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,150
It's a minor sprain. It'll get better soon.

430
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,460
Oh, no, what should I do?

431
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,910
Come on, let me see.

432
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:59,900
I don't think it's minor. It hurts, right? You can't even raise your arm.

433
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,070
Let's go see a doctor.

434
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:07,040
I don't know how to do this.

435
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,730
You would still be better than me now though.

436
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,760
You might regret this.

437
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:42,260
♫ I'll only shine for you, I'll only whisper to you ♫

438
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:52,080
♫ I will be the smile that spreads on your lips ♫

439
00:40:52,080 --> 00:41:01,790
♫ Oh girl, you're soft, you are so fragrant, my therapy ♫

440
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:09,730
♫  I'm in love with you like sunshine early in the morning ♫

441
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:18,540
♫  You spread inside me  ♫

442
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:26,450
♫  My heart is filled with the color of you, falling in love with you ♫

443
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:29,470
It says that the first opportunity would be given to Jae In.

444
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:32,330
That means if Jae In fails, there will be another alternative plan.

445
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:34,200
That would be you, Tae Ha.

446
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,340
Where is the contract?

447
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:38,950
Some kinds of problems occurred, right?

448
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:41,570
Is that why you were going to sleep at the hotel yesterday?

449
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:43,820
Do you feel like you're going to fall for me?

450
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,720
I think I'll grow attached to you.

451
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,950
Then you can come together. Everyone is curious about you anyway.

452
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:51,850
Jae In!
