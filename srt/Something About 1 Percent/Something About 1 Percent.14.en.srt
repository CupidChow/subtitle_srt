00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,930
would help the child up.

161
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:29,830
Are you okay?

162
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:32,310
Please buy it for me, Mom!

163
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:36,270
One who could buy presents for crying kids and soothe them.

164
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:38,440
Here, kid.

165
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,390
Listen to your mom well, okay?

166
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,240
Thank you!

167
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:48,140
One who's nice to adults and generous to others.

168
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:52,010
So he's a total opposite of me.

169
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:56,500
You noticed?

170
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:02,660
What is this? Are you leaving because you're upset?

171
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,840
Just wait.

172
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,210
So y-you're saying today is the last day?

173
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:19,520
Yes.

174
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:23,970
I can't believe I'm seeing him take a weekend off.

175
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:28,370
One should work hard at a young age. What would they do just playing?

176
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,300
Are you okay?

177
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:38,070
Of course not. I'm 80... My body is showing its age.

178
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:40,540
I can't even drink a cup of tea properly.

179
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,940
You're still the same.

180
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,550
What are you watching so mindlessly?

181
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,570
Just...

182
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:08,770
I was just thinking it looked good outside.

183
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,850
We look good too.

184
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,790
Your birthday gift.

185
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,400
My birthday is in December.

186
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,250
I know.

187
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:25,860
I thought about it, and I never really gave you anything.

188
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,790
Think of it as an early birthday gift.

189
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,430
I thought it would be odd to give you a ring.

190
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:38,900
But still, I chose the most expensive one in the store.

191
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,890
That's your standard? The most expensive one?

192
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,870
Of course.

193
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,650
Well, good for me.

194
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:48,520
♫ The way back to me ♫

195
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,100
♫ You just feel it's just further ♫

196
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,880
Aigoo.

197
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,950
It looks good on you.

198
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,710
It's pretty.

199
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:20,350
Should we stay together today?

200
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:26,340
We'll part today.

201
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,370
That's why.

202
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:33,760
"That's why"? You sound like a bad guy somehow.

203
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,720
I'm probably much worse than you think.

204
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,680
I'm just telling you this in advance. As long as you are okay with it, Da Da, I'm not going to just hold your hand and sleep.

205
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:46,390
Well, if you—

206
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:51,720
Aww, I thought it was too quiet.

207
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,800
Even on the last day.

208
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,090
Your phone is something else—

209
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:59,030
Yes, Mother.

210
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,680
He is?

211
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:08,390
Okay, I'll be there soon.

212
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,380
Did something happen?

213
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,790
No, I think my grandpa is acting again.

214
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,590
Acting?

215
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:20,360
He probably feels like he should do something since it's the last day of our contract.

216
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:24,100
I think he decided to check into the hospital. He isn't helpful to me.

217
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,510
But what if he's really sick?

218
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,560
Let's go quickly.

219
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:05,420
Thanks for everything.

220
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:09,090
Thanks to you, Ji Su is now successful,

221
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:12,390
and people at the orphanage don't have to worry about their operating expenses for a while.

222
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,770
I feel like I really hit the jackpot.

223
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,080
That's all?

224
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,050
I don't think there should be more.

225
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,720
Indeed, between us,

226
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:33,150
that's really all?

227
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:39,810
I do feel a bit down but I'm going to take care of my feelings.

228
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:44,890
We already promised to not fall for each other anyway.

229
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:51,000
So you're saying you didn't fall for me?

230
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,090
Not even this much?

231
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,520
How about you?

232
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,010
Didn't you fall for me?

233
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,500
I was about to.

234
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:10,710
Well, thanks for that.

235
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,760
Are you sure you won't regret this?

236
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:25,400
I don't think you'll ever meet another man like me.

237
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,160
Of course not.

238
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,790
Where can I meet a nasty man like you again?

239
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:03,460
You are a good woman.

240
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,880
I know.

241
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:10,560
You, on the other hand, are not that good a man.

242
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,910
I know.

243
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,820
That's why I'm letting you go now.

244
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:24,390
You need to speak correctly.

245
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:28,670
I'm the one ending the relationship here, not you letting me go.

246
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,990
♫ I received all, ♫

247
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:34,590
Don't behave too nastily.

248
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,200
♫ By just staying next to me ♫

249
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,530
You'll get stabbed one night if you keep doing that.
♫ I could give you ♫

250
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:41,630
That's why I plan to have a lot of security guards around me.

251
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:47,770
♫ To feel you wherever you may be ♫

252
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:53,990
♫ It feels like sunshine ♫

253
00:20:54,750 --> 00:21:01,440
♫  I'm just thankful. This is the last ♫

254
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:08,230
♫ I don't want to lie  ♫

255
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:10,090
Don't

256
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:12,190
♫ I know sadness so well ♫

257
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:14,880
meet such a good woman.

258
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,750
If you do, I'll feel bad for her.

259
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,530
♫ We can’t share ♫

260
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:23,230
Meet a good man.

261
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,410
♫ The same space ♫

262
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:26,870
That way,

263
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:30,640
♫ Don’t let us worry about each other ♫

264
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,080
I will feel less sorry.

265
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:39,670
♫ I know you will know what I meant ♫

266
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:47,390
♫ While I'm alive, I won't be able to see you ♫

267
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:52,930
♫ In the darkness, behind the moonlight ♫

268
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:57,060
♫ Even if I die ♫

269
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,160
Yes.

270
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,320
I'm on my way.

271
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,740
What?

272
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:14,000
CEO.

273
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,050
Here...

274
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:19,290
VIP Room

275
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,400
What happened?

276
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,310
He went out for a walk and collapsed.

277
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,540
Is he... serious?

278
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,920
He will be okay.

279
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,080
Fortunately, he took some medication before fainting.

280
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,660
He was lucky, last time and this time.

281
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,720
Last time?

282
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,810
Yes, we've been prescribing a blood thinner.

283
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:43,600
And the MRI is also still showing a trace.

284
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,910
You didn't know?

285
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,760
Please make sure to keep this very confidential.

286
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,350
If this gets out to the media, it will be hard to handle it tomorrow.

287
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:04,020
Yes, I understand. How about family in America?

288
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:07,870
Don't even inform my aunt yet. Let's say Grandpa is not in Korea right now.

289
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,660
I will take all company updates.

290
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,660
For this, give them some proper excuses like it's for my business training or my becoming the next company CEO.

291
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,210
Yes.

292
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,230
Team Leader Gang.

293
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,730
Please take care of this well.

294
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:29,150
I don't have many people that I can trust.

295
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,250
I'm preparing our legal team just in case.

296
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,370
We need to be prepared for the worst.

297
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:45,100
The last will was edited, right?

298
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,850
Yes.

299
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:52,090
The condition of the contract with Da Hyeon was already reflected in the will.

300
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:57,070
And I just completed that condition.

301
00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:00,580
Then it's over with her?

302
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,720
Yes.

303
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,090
She didn't say anything more?

304
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,410
What do you mean?

305
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:11,420
No, it's nothing.

306
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,370
I'm going to be staying at the company for a while.

307
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:19,220
Okay, don't worry about your grandpa.

308
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,780
I'm going to take care of him.

309
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:26,240
If you keep coming to the hospital, some people will surely notice.

310
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,760
Yes.

311
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:33,360
I'm so thankful that you're back with the company.

312
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:44,020
[Last day of contract!]

313
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,660
Your contract is over, right?

314
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:42,490
You said last week was the final week.

315
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:46,090
Yeah, he went back to work. I won't see him again.

316
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:48,120
Good, good for you.

317
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,630
It's no good to get into a family like that. It's only hard for you.

318
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:55,620
Da Hyeon, your father's friend's son who's an oriental doctor—

319
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:59,690
Later. Later, Mom.

320
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:03,940
I need to take care of my feelings, and school is also keeping me busy...

321
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,130
I'm going to hang up.

322
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:18,980

Thank you.

I thought if it were you, you wouldn't lose Da Hyeon.

330
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:05,940
I thought you would be able to marry her and win.

331
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:11,300
Do you know how many security guards follow me?

332
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:15,350
Da Hyeon would have to live like that.

333
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:21,050
Kidnapped, okay. It's true Ju Hee did something crazy.

334
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:24,290
But there'd be no guarantee that it wouldn't happen again.

335
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:29,350
The public events where you have to be alert at all times and mind your manners,

the couple gatherings... There are several dozen events per year.

337

Da Hyeon likes her job.

338

Everyone would be watching her every move, with reporters ready to jump on her.

339
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,020
She wouldn't be able to endure all that.

340
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:50,390
But still, if you were with her—

I couldn't even do that for her.

345
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:15,050
That means Da Hyeon would be all alone.

Also if she became the wife of Seong Hyeon Group's Lee Jae In,

she would have to attend many events alone.

How can I possibly make her endure all of that alone?
