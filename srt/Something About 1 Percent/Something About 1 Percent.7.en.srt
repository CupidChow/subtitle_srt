Luckily, she found her mom.

164
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,180
I know, right?

165
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:12,390
Bye.

166
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:15,280
Excuse me.

167
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,110
I'm sorry.

168
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,190
- Can I—
- Pardon?

169
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:22,370
If it's okay with you, I would like to take you out to a meal.

170
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:25,220
Just as a thank you.

171
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:29,740
I'm just a worker here at SH Mall.

172
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:33,010
It's nothing really. Thank you for your kind words.

173
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:38,970
Then can I have your number, at least? I would like to thank you later personally.

174
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:44,270
I have a boyfriend.

175
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,130
Excuse me?

176
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:48,630
I'm just letting you know.

177
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,640
Bye.

178
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:09,920
Wow, did a guy just almost take my number?

179
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,920
What an overreaction, Kim Da Hyeon.

180
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:26,020
I left something.

181
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,980
I don't think Hyeon Jin is here.

182
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,880
It's a little early to close the store.

183
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,890
[Happy Birthday, Mr. Jae In]

184
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,600
I rented out this whole place for you, Jae In.

185
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,160
Aren't I amazing?

186
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,700
Let's go.

187
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:57,890
I saw on the contract that it's your birthday today.

188
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,270
Is it not?

189
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:02,790
I think you're right.

190
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:05,310
What do you mean "you think"? If it's right, then it's right.

191
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:07,960
Did you have seaweed soup for breakfast?
(Korean birthday tradition)

192
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:15,180
You should make sure to eat.

193
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:18,820
Did you call your family members?

194
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:22,450
What? To tell them that they should send me gifts because it's my birthday?

195
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:24,470
I don't think that's right.

196
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:28,700
Why would you call people to tell them to send gifts when you're not even a child?

197
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:33,800
You tell them, "Thank you for giving birth to me. Thank you for raising me."

198
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:41,200
Thank you for giving birth to me... for raising me?

199
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,610
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

200
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:51,680

203
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,230
Happy birthday.

204
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:44,760
What are you doing? You have to make a wish and blow out the candles.

205
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,200
You've never blown out candles on a cake?

206
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,020
Oh...

207
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,760
It's been a while.

208
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,850
How long?

209
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:00,610
Uh, about... 23 years?

210
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,150
So you've probably never done things like this before either.

211
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,350
I thought you taught kids not to play with food.

212
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,380
Kids don't listen very well.

213
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,080
But I can understand why they do this.

214
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:22,000
Come on. Smile a little.These will be cherished memories.

215
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,490
One, two, three.

216
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,720
Got it!

217
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,180
Now let's cut the cake.

218
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,570
Wait. Not yet.

219
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:35,480
We have to make memories together.

220
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,970
Stop it. No, no!

221
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:43,540
You said we shouldn't play with food.

222
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:46,900
Just like a kid, I don't listen very well.

223
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:53,380
Smile a little.

224
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,950
One, two, three.

225
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,580
Anyways, you never lose.

226
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,380
Have you been like this since you were little?

227
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,390
I've never done anything like this.

228
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:14,510
Really? Wow. Are all rich people like this?

229
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,600
Don't they throw parties and stuff?

230
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,890
Today's the day my older brother died.

231
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:25,810
Your real brother?

232
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:30,480
He's my real brother legally, and in reality, my older cousin.

233
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,450
I was adopted into my elder uncle's family after he passed.

234
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:37,780
Then your current mother...

235
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:42,090
She's my mom. She's a good person.

236
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:45,340
You don't have to look at me with such pity in your eyes.

237
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:50,720
You're not pitiful at all. You have two great mothers.

238
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,330
Is that so?

239
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:58,400
Someone once told me that I was living someone else's life.

240
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:02,760
That's nonsense.

241
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,390
With your personality, would you be living someone else's life for them?

242
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,650
You're not someone that would do whatever someone else tells you to do anyway.

243
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:11,060
And it's not like you're not stubborn.

244
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:16,660
There's really no one else in the world as narrow, stubborn, and nasty as you.

245
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:21,230
It's my birthday. It feels like you're insulting me.

246
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:25,270
A birthday is a birthday. The truth is still the truth.

247
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:31,290
Where's the knife?

248
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,680
It's my gift to you.

249
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,560
Aren't you going to open it?

250
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:48,850
I'm sorry that it's not a billion-won car or a ₩100 million watch.

251
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:51,160
In return, I don't need you to buy something like that for me, either.

252
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,420
I already have a car and a watch.

253
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,780
Why? Did someone say that I needed something like that?

254
00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:00,420
Hyeon Jin did. Oppa Seon Wu—

255
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:07,630
I mean, Ajusshi Seon Woo... likes those things.

256
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:10,390
Ajusshi... I like that.

257
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,100
Call him that from now on.

258
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,050
Just open this already.

259
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,570
It's something that you really need, Jae In.

260
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:21,750
Something for you to get closer to people.

261
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,850
For age eight and up? You said I was old.

262
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,360
You got one year older.

263
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,260
So I prepared one for adults.

264
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,260
Should I open it?

265
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:42,620
I wanted to get you a tie with it but I didn't buy it because I was afraid you might think I had an ulterior motive.
(a necktie could be interpreted as suggesting marriage)

266
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,600
An ulterior motive?

267
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,950
You don't know?

268
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,870
What do you mean?

269
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:51,190
Well, never mind then...

270
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:55,190
If I don't know, you should explain it to me!

271
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,950
What is it?

272
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,160
"You're mine."

273
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,560
That's what it means when you give a tie.

274
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:23,570
That's what Hyeon Jin told me.

275
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:25,250
Buy me a tie, then.

276
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:28,100
Just take what you're given.

277
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:32,260
To make the best gift, you should buy what a person wants.

278
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:35,390
This is my first birthday gift in 20-some years.

279
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:37,890
You know, accepting whatever is given is good manners.

280
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:41,030
There's one present I really want, though.

281
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:38,950
[Happy Birthday, Mr. Jae In]

282
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:48,610
Get home safely.

283
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:54,220
Oh! Next time, let's meet near my school, okay?

284
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,630
No thanks. I'm busy.

285
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:59,670
I thought you said the issue at the hotel was resolved. I'm busy too, you know.

286
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:01,360
But you have more free time than I do.

287
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,780
That's your opinion, though.

288
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,970
Let's do this fairly, okay?

289
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:07,860
Fairly?

290
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,510
Yes. Fairly.

291
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:13,510
You have to come see me once if I come see you once.

292
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:16,440
And I get to solve one of my problems once you've solved one of yours.

293
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,150
We have to do it this way to be fair.

294
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:20,000
That wasn't in the contract.

295
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,240
Of course it was!

296
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:26,500
"We will respect each other's opinions." It was in article three.

297
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,150
Today is my birthday, though.

298
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:33,520
That's why we will start after today.

299
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,960
Happy birthday.

300
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,120
Even though you only have an hour and a half until it ends.

301
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,110
Thanks.

302
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,000
Good night.

303
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,210
Good night.

304
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,010
Hello, Mother.

305
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:36,490
It seems... today is my birthday.

306
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:45,760
Jae... Jae In.

307
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,200
I'm sorry.

308
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,630
I'm... I'm sorry...

309
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:57,150
Thank you for raising me well.

310
00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:00,330
I don't think I ever thanked you for that.

311
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,640
Thank you.

312
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,830
Thank you, Jae In.

313
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:19,590
Good night, Mother. I'm hanging up now.

314
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:53,170
This is the result of a survey of 1,000 Chinese tourists.

315
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:57,240
The average amount they spend on accommodations in Korea

316
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,360
is ₩80,000 (about $72) per day.

317
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,300
They stay at the cheap residences, guest houses, or motels.

318
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:06,000
Or studio apartments being illegally used for sleepovers.

319
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:10,030
Bye, everyone!

320
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:12,160
Bye!

321
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,080
You're right.

322
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,580
This move that we learned today—

323
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:20,200
Make sure you send me the meeting minutes.

324
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,160
Yes, sir.

325
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:25,210
And we're going to make plans to attract Chinese tourist groups.

326
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,990
Uh... Yes, sir.

327
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,500
[Da Da: Sorry, but I can't keep our date today.]

328
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,790
Sorry, but I can't keep our date today.

329
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:45,380
[What?]

330
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:48,670
Something urgent came up.

331
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:53,010
Consider us even for you not showing up for our date.

332
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:05,380
[What's this urgent matter that came up?]

333
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:09,770
Are you sure our CEO is dating?

334
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:12,790
According to the rumors, he is.

335
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:17,800
I don't know who she is, but her taste is very unique.

336
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,790
What is this woman doing?

337
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:24,690
I see, now she isn't even reading this.

338
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:42,450
Lee Jae In

339
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:46,070
Kim Da Da! Da Da!

340
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:48,810
Mom?

341
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,380
What's up?

342
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:10,250
What do you mean? Why does something need to be up when I go to my daughter's house?

343
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,930
Ah... She isn't answering.

344
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:15,410
Sixth floor. The door is opening.

345
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,260
Going down.

346
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:34,860
I came out of a guest room with a man.

347
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,210
Aren't you curious why?

348
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:39,890
Not much. It's your private life.

349
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,610
First floor.

350
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:50,050
Mr. Liang, please go ahead. I will be right back.

351
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:52,430
I just bumped into my friend.

352
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:55,030
Okay.

353
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:57,130
Please follow me.

354
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:02,940
He's a Gallery VIP customer from Hong Kong. He is staying in this hotel.

355
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:11,070
When I asked to start over, I was serious.

356
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:13,550
I was serious as well.

357
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,900
I have no reason to start over with you.

358
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:20,560
Not me. I thought over it again and realized that there's no other man like you.

359
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,850
Look more.

360
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:25,190
If you look around, there ought to be someone else willing to court you.

361
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:28,650
I'll sign a prenuptial agreement

362
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:30,210
if that's what you want.

363
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:34,240
Do it or not, it's not like you will be marrying me.

364
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,530
Why are you acting like this? It's not like you, Lee Jae In.

365
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:41,520
Think about it realistically. I am an only child.

366
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,790
When we get married, the Han Jo Chemical stock will be helpful.

367
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,930
Let's stop here.

368
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,850
You're still the same.

369
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:58,850
Try to stop me, Lee Jae In.

370
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:02,550
Admit it, you don't come to my house at random.

371
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:06,110
It's because Seon Wu said something weird.

372
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:09,390
He said the man you're seeing is rich.

373
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:11,440
It's not true, is it?

374
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:17,380
Right. He's rich.

375
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:21,290
Kim Da Da! Are you crazy?

376
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:23,900
This nonsense...

377
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:28,730
Don't worry. I'm just getting support.

378
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:32,490
I'm just dating him for Ji Su's sake, for exactly six months.

379
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:35,030
He donated so much money to the orphanage so that's the least that I can do for him.

380
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:39,870
It's not like we're sleeping together, just sharing meals.

381
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:41,720
You brat, watch what you're saying.

382
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,480
Are you sleeping with someone?

383
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,530
I'm not sleeping with anyone.

384
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:47,690
Don't worry. Can't you believe me?

385
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:49,840
Who can you trust these days?

386
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,370
Whether it's my daughter or someone else's son...

387
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:54,250
Quit it.

388
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:58,210
For Ji Su, I'll tell your dad to help.

389
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:02,690
Dad can't do anything with his power. Besides, I already signed the contract.

390
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:04,510
Contract?

391
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:06,760
You kid, kid, kid! You have no fear!

392
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,880
Mom, if I was going to marry him, would I have signed a contract?

393
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:13,090
And he signed it because he doesn't want to get married either.

394
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:16,280
It's just business! Can't I just date him?

395
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:19,140
Business? Are you sure?

396
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,730
Yeah.

397
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:23,990
Yeah!

398
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:38,370
Why are you calling me?

399
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:41,280
How are you going to make up for the date that you broke?

400
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,860
Next time, I'll let you choose two things you want to do.

401
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,930
Well, that's a given.

402
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:48,140
What did your mother say?

403
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,960
What else? She freaked out when she heard that you're rich.

404
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,110
Why did she freak out when she heard I was rich? What did I do?

405
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,980
Having a lot of money is tiring, after all.

406
00:32:55,980 --> 00:33:01,620
My parents want someone who isn't too rich or too poor.

407
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:05,920
What do you think about it then, Da Hyeon?

408
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,300
What's there to even think about?

409
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:14,970
After we break up, when will I ever get to meet another rich guy again?

410
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:16,180
Da Da!

411
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,510
Yeah?

412
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:19,360
I'm hanging up.

413
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,240
Hello?

414
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:27,600
She always hangs up first like this.

415
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:32,200
She's never been the one to call first, either.

416
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:37,780
After I break up with you, when will I ever be able to meet a rich guy again?

417
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:43,240
So she's thinking about us breaking up already, huh?

418
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:51,090
Bring that man over.

419
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:51,810
Mom!

420
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:55,600
I have to see him myself for me to be at ease.

421
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,190
I told you it's strictly business!

422
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:02,730
If you get involved, it'll seem like we're actually dating. Do you want that?

423
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:05,040
No, but...

424
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,480
Then trust your daughter please.

425
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,570
And there's not much more time left either. It'll be over in two months.

426
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:13,020
There's no need to blow this all out of proportion.

427
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:17,400
Two months, are you sure?

428
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,580
Be careful on your way home.

429
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,600
Jae In!

430
00:34:56,120 --> 00:35:00,180
Why are you here? Do you have someone to meet?

431
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:04,200
I'm here to greet your mother.

432
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,860
And I felt that I should be the one to do all the explaining, too.

433
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,280
Stop saying dangerous things.

434
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,670
She didn't even believe me when I told her this is strictly business.

435
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:14,600
My mom would pass out if you suddenly showed up to greet her.

436
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:16,480
Business?

437
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,450
It's not completely wrong, though.

438
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:27,200
I made it clear to my mom that we're not getting married.

439
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:33,120
My mom said that we'd definitely get a divorce within one or two months if we got married.

440
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,460
There's no such thing as divorce in my dictionary.

441
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,820
Well, of course not.

442
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,550
What?

443
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:42,290
Do you want to get married?

444
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:46,810
Well, anyway, the one you'll be marrying won't be me.

445
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,460
But aren't you leaving?

446
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,410
You're not going to take care of today's portion?

447
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:59,910
We should have some tea, or take a walk around the neighborhood, at least.

448
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:02,980
Let's go, then.

449
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,640
What?

450
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,620
Do you like it?

451
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:50,500
Anyways, I'm doing you a big favor today, so write it down and don't forget it.

452
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,430
You stood me up without even a text, though.

453
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:56,690
Also, a favor is a consideration, not a debt.

454
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:59,890
That's why I drove myself crazy trying to make some time for you last time.

455
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:04,330
And yet, I'm the one who came to you, Da Da. Nothing is free in this world.

456
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:05,190
Wow, you're so stingy.

457
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,410
Stingy? I'm just stating the obvious.

458
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:12,050
The most important thing I've learned from Grandfather is never to forget a debt.

459
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:14,990
Whether it's a debt owed or due.

460
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:16,690
You've learned only the good things from him then.

461
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:20,120
But it sounds to me like you're really inconsiderate of others.

462
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,470
That's exactly right.

463
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:24,730
Being considerate is only a hindrance in business.

464
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:30,420
What's with that expression?

465
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:37,640
It must be nice to be so high and mighty like you.

466
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:43,210
Hello, sir.

467
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:46,020
See me for a moment, Team Leader Gang.

468
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:51,250
W-Why does he want to see me?

469
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:52,820
Man, I'm so scared.

470
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,970
Me, too.

471
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:59,090
Make sure to come back alive.

472
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,850
Can you look into this for me, please?

473
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:16,150
I'm sure Grandfather has noticed this as well.

474
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:18,470
I think we'll have to take some countermeasures.

475
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:21,280
Actually, I've been bothered by many things since the fake bomb threat last time.

476
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,730
Why are you entrusting this to me, sir?

477
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:26,940
Because you're the only one I can trust.

478
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,900
You'll have to really pick a side and stick to it now.

479
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,970
My grandfather may be strong-willed right now,

480
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:35,620
but I'm planning to be even stronger-willed than him for the next 30 years or so.

481
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:42,410
I-I-I'm with you, sir...

482
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:43,920
Of course.

You can leave now.

484
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:56,710
I feel like our school has a lot of demo classes.

485
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,950

Yes?

492
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:23,680
I'm sorry, but I don't think I'll be able to see you today.

493
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,560
Are you going to keep doing this to me? You canceled on me last time, too!

494
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,920
That's why we took a walk.

495
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,810
I'm busy too, you know! I have to prepare for my demo classes

496
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:35,140
and my girls are competing in a dance competition next month.

497
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:38,450
So are you saying that that's more important than me?

498
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:39,760
Of course.

499
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,210
Let's forget about today and meet up on the weekend instead.

This isn't a favor I'm asking of you. This is a request.

Are you sure our CEO is dating?

According to the rumors, he is.

506
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,600
When I asked to start over, I was serious.

507
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,940
It's because Seon Wu said something weird. He said that the person you are seeing is rich.

508
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:17,920
Can't you trust me?

You little brat, stop it!

00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:20,990
Why did she freak out when she heard I was rich?

511
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:23,320
I thought over it again and realized that there's no other man like you.

512
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,840
I told you it's strictly business!

Business?

514
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,980
I made it clear to Mom that we're not getting married.

515
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,990
I think we'll have to take some countermeasures.

516

Ajusshi, are you our teacher's lover?

517
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:36,750
Rumors will go all around the school now! What are you going to do about it?
