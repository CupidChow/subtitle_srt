Are you sure you only have alcohol and soft drinks?

12

I'm going to get rid of the alcohol.

I need to hear your confession with a sober mind.

14
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,770
I think I might have done something strange due being drunk last night but it was a mistake. A mistake!

15
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:53,420
You don't remember you clung to me and told me how much you liked me and tried to jump on me?

That's why you said you would sleep at the hotel?

What nonsense!

137
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,680
She must be staying at the hotel too.

138
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,830
That's really not it! Ju Hee is—

139
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:00,060
Ah, so her name is Ju Hee.

140
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:05,030
She's just someone I know. We're not that close.

141
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:08,420
She's a member at the fitness center and I just ran into her on the way out.

142
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,400
You're not that close, but you hug each other?

143
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,990
It's not like that!

144
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:15,690
I just happened to get a cosmetic stain on my suit.

145
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:24,710
Should I make more excuses?

146
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:27,520
It's really not like that.

147
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,680
Also, now that we're talking about this,

148
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,300
if I really intended to do what you're thinking,

149
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,000
I would never let you catch me. Do I look that clumsy to you?

150
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,890
Nope.

151
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,720
I just tried acting like a crazily jealous girlfriend.

152
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,880
Just drive! ... You thought I would say that, right?

153
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,050
Drive. Just kidding. Kidding.

154
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:55,940
I'm not kidding... Ha ha, joking, joking.

155
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,700
What should we buy?

156
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,590
Do you want to eat ramen?

157
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,830
Nope.

158
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:22,290
But if you cajole me into eating it, I'll be willing to.

159
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,910
Anyway...

160
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,960
Wait!

161
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,780

Why is your shoulder perfectly fine?

165
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:43,500
You couldn't even put on your clothes properly this morning.

166
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:49,440
I told you it would get better later.

167
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,100
Anyway, you're so mean.

168
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,690
Guess your shoulder is just fine.

169
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,530
What are you cooking?

170
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,870
What do you like?

171
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,130
No way.

172
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:16,560
Eat later.

173
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,200
Here.

174
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,830
Stay here for awhile.

175
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:32,400
How can I? I need to go home.

176
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,530
Why can't you?

177
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:34,750
This is your home.

178
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,130
But nothing happened last night.

179
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:40,380
Well, that's not the problem. What if someone sees us?

180
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,940
A lot of people are watching you already.

181
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,750
Is it okay for a woman to keep coming in and out of the house?

182
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,700
What are you worrying about?

183
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:52,550
Are you worried about me or about being in a rumor with me?

184
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,580
Both.

185
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:58,290
We shouldn't be doing this.

186
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:02,450
We can't create further complications.

187
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:09,030
I also can't fall for you.

188
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:13,430
Do you think you will fall for me?

189
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,200
I think I might grow attached to you.

190
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:23,270
But I shouldn't do that.

191
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,180
We...

192
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:28,720
only have few months left.

193
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:34,210
Fine. I see your point too.

194
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:37,500
But stay here until tomorrow.

195
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,240
Just until your home gets fixed up.

196
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,800
♫ When you ask me why ♫

197
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,070
♫ When your ♫

198
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:51,460
♫ Sad face ♫

199
00:15:51,460 --> 00:16:02,020
♫ And eyes look away from me as if you feel sorry ♫

200
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:07,400
♫ Have you fallen for someone else? ♫

201
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,590
♫ Can't you change your heart again? ♫

202
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:12,490
I...

203
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:14,520
♫ Everyone ♫

204
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,700
think I like you.
♫ And everything ♫

205
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,520
♫ Are they ending now? ♫

206
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,480
We...

207
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,210
only have few months left.

208
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:34,390
♫ If you feel even just a bit of love, if you still feel the same as I do ♫

209
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:43,460
Saturday, Sept. 24th: Contract Termination
♫ Then please smile at me like you did before ♫

210
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:01,970
Did you report it to the chairman?

211
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:06,010
Team Leader Gang probably told him already. But there's no evidence.

212
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:09,090
Both money and stock must've been transferred.

213
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:12,980
- There's no trace of it.
- I know.

214
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,390
Gathering today at 3 p.m. at our hangout to welcome Seon Yeong home to Korea. Hope everyone attends.

215
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:19,370
You're going to attend today's gathering, aren't you?

216
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:21,640
You haven't contacted them in three months already. Do you know that?

217
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,800
I don't have time. I'm meeting up with Da Da— Da Hyeon.

218
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,160
Then you can both attend. They're all curious about her anyway.

219
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,710
No way. I don't know what you guys will do to Da Hyeon.

220
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:35,450
Hey, we won't be able to do anything to her because we're all scared of you.

221
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,900
June Rain Flower Shop

222
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:34,370
It's safe in my home.

223
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:38,070
You can put that down.

224
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:41,550
I really must've been shocked.

225
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,590
It's okay.

226
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,540
But how come you're here so early?

227
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:04,320
You don't usually get out of work this early.

228
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,210
I wanted to check up on you to see if you're okay.

229
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:10,550
And I want to eat some food, even though I don't know if it will still be good today.

230
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,800
I didn't prepare yours.

231
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,690
So heartless. I'm even lending you a place to stay.

232
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,200
Are you getting off work?

233
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,220
No, I'm going to look around and then leave.

234
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,760
Then let's get lunch.

235
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,490
What is this?

236
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:34,600
The reason that Jae In is dating that woman.

237
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,340
This is your grandfather's will.

238
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,990
How did you...

239
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:43,820
You don't need to know.

240
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,980
That woman... you try getting with her.

241
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,830
Pardon?

242
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,790
Father, what are you talking about?

243
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:55,000
I don't think Jae In is actually serious about her.

244
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,730
Seriously or not, my cousin is seeing her already.

245
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,770
Stupid kid.

246
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:04,600
Can't you see something off about this will?

247
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,560
Your grandfather is giving Jae In the first opportunity.

248
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:17,580
So if Jae In fails, there is another opportunity.

249
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:21,290
That could be you, Tae Ha.

250
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:32,040
I didn't see this before.

251
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:36,040
It's a present since I showed up empty-handed yesterday.

252
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:40,030
Even though it's not as pretty as I am.

253
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:43,400
Don't let it dry up and die. Make sure to water it properly.

254
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,760
If you're that worried, you can come often and water it.

255
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,950
Can I eat?

256
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,800
Ah, do you need anything for your home while it's under construction?

257
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,800
Might as well fix other things too.

258
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,530
Construction? Why do you even do construction when you're just adding one more lock?

259
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:05,330
We're adding a new security system and doing an interior update.

260
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:08,430
Why do you even do an interior update when it's a monthly rental rooftop apartment?

261
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:11,280
And why a new security system when it's someone else's home?

262
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,590
I bought that house.

263
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,790
Y-You did what? Bought the house?

264
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:23,130
When I told the owner I would install a new security system, he asked me to buy the house from him.

265
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:26,840
Even so, how could you just buy it like that? It's not like it costs only a dollar or two.

266
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,540
You said you weren't a chaebol owner yet.

267
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:31,630
When I looked at the borough office development plan, I saw a park would be built nearby.

268
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:34,310
There are a lot of colleges around there and the house is located near the subway.

269
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:37,850
If I remodel it and resell it later, I think I can make a profit.

270
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,990
So I bought it thinking it would be a good investment.

271
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:42,520
You must be so happy that you have a lot of money.

272
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:47,120
Oh, and I can't pay any more rent than I do now. I have a two-year lease.

273
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:52,930
Nope, since you signed the lease last year... you have 14 months left.

274
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:54,550
I hate you. Don't eat!

275
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:58,250
- I only had one bite!
- Don't eat!

276
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:04,900
I hate you. I hate you.

277
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,600
Where are you going?

278
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:13,060
Ji Su has a busking today on College Road. It's at 4:30 and I think I can make it.

279
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:16,550
Nope, I don't think so. It's my turn to pick what we do today.

280
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:20,130
Oh, really! You don't even forget that kind of stuff.

281
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,800
Where are we going?

282
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:25,480
♫ I believe ♫

283
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,080
♫ Even though you are not with me ♫

284
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,520
Oh, it's been a while, Da Hyeon.

285
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,170
Hello!

286
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:34,760
Your last outfit was way better. It gave some kind of a good and strong impression.

287
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,590
Ah, I think so too.

288
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,270
Shut up.

289
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,550
Hey, let's move over there.

290
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:40,130
This way, please.

291
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:44,640
♫ The way to me ♫

292
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,840
♫ Is just a little ♫

293
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,250
♫ too far ♫

294
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,640
Jae In!
(casual form)

295
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,960
♫ All gone ♫

296
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,500
She said Jae In casually?

297
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:02,200
Who is she? She doesn't look familiar.

298
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,820
You don't need to know her.

299
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:09,400
That makes me more curious to know. I'm Han Ju Hee.

300
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,910
I'm Kim Da Hyeon.

301
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:15,020
I, um, do you want something to drink?

302
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,120
No, I'm fine. I have to drive.

303
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,310
How about you?

304
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:20,980
This has a very nice taste but it's very strong.

305
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,630
Would you like something else?

306
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:25,220
Oh, no, that's okay. I'm good with alcohol.

307
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,420
No, I will just have some water please.

308
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:32,500
I don't think I should get drunk tonight.

309
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,190
Hyeon Jin, could I see you for a moment?

310
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:46,890
Have some.

311
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:52,510
It's all right if you want to confess again like you did on that rainy day.

312
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:56,950
Who confessed? I don't remember a thing.

313
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,960
That woman, who is she?

314
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,940
Jae In's girlfriend.

315
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:08,650
They're actually serious, so don't think about sabotaging them.

316
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,410
They're really serious?

317
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:16,290
I wonder why he's dating that kind of woman.

318
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:18,630
Maybe because he loves her.

319
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,320
You are not drinking?

320
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:27,480
Nope, I'm fine. Who's going to take you home when you get drunk?

321
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,390
I didn't even drink a sip yet.

322
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:31,850
I'm just... smelling it.

323
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:36,000
♫ I like you who are like this ♫

324
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,910
Don't drink the whole bottle. You can get drunk only with me.

325
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:42,380
Of course I'm not going to. I'm going to just drink water.

326
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,460
Ah, really.

327
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:46,600
I'll be back after I take this call.

328
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:51,000
♫ Nothing would be awkward between us ♫

329
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:58,020
♫ I know when I look into your eyes ♫

330
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:01,440
♫ I don't need any words. ♫

331
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,860
The culprit got caught?

332
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:10,070
But the thing is... the problem is... he didn't rob Da Hyeon's home though.

333
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:13,290
And he didn't get caught on the security camera nearby either.

334
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:15,110
I thought so.

335
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:19,670
For now, there is nothing missing from Da Hyeon's home.

336
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:21,760
Then we're back to square one.

337
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,020
Team Leader Gang.

338
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,220
Yes?

339
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:28,150
Please find out when the next SH Mall shareholders meeting will be.

340
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:31,320
Ah, yes, understood.

341
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:42,360
Are you dating Jae In?

342
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,190
Jae In is not easy.

343
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:48,010
He's not the type to take good care of his woman.

344
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:51,160
He's generous with money and he's handsome.

345
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,630
And he comes from a good family.

346
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:56,260
It's true that he's the type that ordinary women are attracted to.

347
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,730
But still, don't get too confused.

348
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:02,420
Because it's not his true intention.

349
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:09,160
Please say what you want to say clearly,

350
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,560
so that I can easily understand you.

351
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:15,160
I guess you're not that smart.

352
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,190
I'm telling you to not fall into this one-sided love.

353
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,800
Anyway,

354
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:25,740
I guess Jae In's taste in women has gotten very tacky while I was away.

355
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:36,550
He likes this tacky style fashion!

356
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:40,940
Gah! Why didn't I say that to her face? Like a fool!

357
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:46,040
He told me she was just someone he knows.

358
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:55,120
I want to have artist Gang Nam Ho's show at your hotel.

359
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,560
Then talk to my marketing department, not me.

360
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:02,810
Lee Jae In, I wanted to have it there because of you.

361
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:07,260
Thank you, but our hotel is just fine without your help.

362
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:11,230
And stop this crap.

363
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:20,830
It looks like you're in the middle of a conversation. Should I come back a little later?

364
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,040
No, it's fine.

365
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,110
- Then can we leave?
- Yeah.

366
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:47,200
What's wrong?

367
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:59,580
What?

368
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,880
Ah, what is it?

369
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:31,840
Tell me.

370
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,830
Say what?

371
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:36,620
Tell me why you're so pissed off.

372
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,180
Why are you smiling...?

373
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:53,260
Jae In-ah... Lee Jae In...
(cutesy, flirty voice)

374
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,590
What?

375
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,480
Tell that woman to stop calling you like that.

376
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,290
What woman?

377
00:28:57,290 --> 00:29:00,320
That woman who was next to Hyeon Jin. Named Ju Hee or something?

378
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,330
The woman you meet every morning.

379
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:03,920
I do not meet her every morning!

380
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,380
Isn't she the owner of that fragrance?

381
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:12,390
I call Oppa Seon Wu "ajusshi" (middle-aged man) because you wanted me to.

382
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:14,490
I can't even call Ji Su "oppa."

383
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:18,680
So to be fair, tell her to stop calling you Jae In-ah.
(casual/intimate form)

384
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,350
So that's why you're angry at me?

385
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,770
We have to be fair.

386
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:26,520
Does it matter if she's someone you have known for a long time or a short time?

387
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:30,160
Are you, perhaps... jealous?

388
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,210
Well, I... maybe?

389
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:41,760
Maybe...

390
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,680
Ugh, I feel worse thinking this is coming out of jealousy.

391
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:58,000
What is this, cuteness leaking out of her?

392
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,960
The more I think about it, the angrier I get.

393
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:18,610
Anyway, he's such a weirdo.

394
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,620
You don't even know your own pass code to get into your home?

395
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,800
I do know.

396
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,260
Then why are you doing this?

397
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:36,670
I wanted to see how I would feel when someone opened the door for me.

398
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:11,330
You don't have to worry about Ju Hee.

399
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:15,090
I'm not someone who dates just anybody.

400
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:19,560
I'm not worried. But I just don't feel so good.

401
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,720
Also, I have a lot of guys who say they like me.

402
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,540
Which guy?

403
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:30,610
By chance, does Tae Ha contact you?

404
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:34,140
Tae Ha? Who's Tae Ha?

405
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:36,740
If you don't know, that's fine.

406
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:41,750
He's not important. Who is it?

407
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:42,960
The guy who said he liked you.

408
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,680
I don't know. I only gave them my phone number.

409
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:49,950
Also, everybody asks me to do a marriage meeting with him. They say he's a fine man.

410
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,930
- If you dare to meet up with him—
- And what if I do?

411
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:55,370
I'll bring a kid and tell him you're the kid's mom.

412
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:58,850
That's a tactic that a woman would use.

413
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,770
Does it matter if a man or a woman uses that tactic?

414
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:02,090
As long as the result is the same.

415
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:06,100
Anyway, no blind dates or meetings with other men.

416
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,020
Do you understand?

417
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:10,810
Why am I always not allowed when you're dating other women?

418
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:12,920
Who did I date? What women?

419
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:17,590
Who do you think? "Jae In-ah..." You, Mr. Lee Jae In.

420
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:22,710
Of course you got perfume on you since she hugged you like that.

421
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:26,540
Thinking about all that with a sober mind pisses me off more.

422
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,880
Oh, so you're sober now?

423
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,190
I haven't been drinking.

424
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:39,160
Then that means you're feeling fine now, right?

425
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,610
Yes, I'm telling you precisely that.

426
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:04,090
♫ Isn’t it about time to confess? ♫

427
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:08,750
Then I should leave now because something would really happen.

428
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:11,770
♫ Isn’t it about time to say yes? ♫

429
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:14,750
Keep good watch on the house.

430
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:18,580
♫ It's not as easy as I thought ♫

431
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:22,450
♫ When I look at your clear eyes ♫

432
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:26,410
♫ My heart just beats ♫

433
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:31,530
♫ How should we go about this love? ♫

434
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:33,730
I guess I can get drunk from just water.

435
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:37,000
♫ Whether it's getting awkward ♫

436
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:46,200
What is this? What is there in this?

437
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:52,480
Besides the bomb threat last time, it's not time for SH Mall or Hotel stocks to go up and down like this.

438
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,680
The headquarter's planning department said they would keep watching this for a while.

439
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,370
Then Grandpa must have gotten a report about this.

440
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,510
I guess he must know about it already.

441
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:06,300
It... it's not Chairman's work.

442
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,160
Don't trust my grandpa too much.

443
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,090
CEO.

444
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,140
I was just teasing.

445
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,920
I only trust you now.

446
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,400
I don't trust him.

447
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,480
You may leave now.

448
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:29,390
If Jae In noticed something going on, something must be up.

449
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:32,360
Yes, they are moving bit by bit.

450
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:36,460
Interesting! I wonder who'd dare probe Seong Hyeon Group.

451
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,720
Go investigate it properly.

452
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,400
Yes.

453
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:46,220
Are we heading to my home?

454
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:51,460
I received word that the construction on the house is finished.

455
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:18,250
Do you like it?

456
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,960
What is this?

457
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:27,630
Uh, why isn't this working?

458
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:34,450
What's wrong?

459
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,100
Right hand or left hand?

460
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,700
Huh?

461
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:47,660
Registered User Confirmed

462
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,290
What is all this?

463
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:08,290
What? You don't like it?

464
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:10,950
Is this really my home?

465
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:13,220
What did you do to my home?

466
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:17,790
I made it safer. I installed a double-layered system for the door and the windows.

467
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:21,070
If someone tries to break in, the police will be notified automatically.

468
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:26,260
So you have to turn the security system off as you get into the house. Don't try to break in yourself with your idiocy.

469
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:28,770
Why did you replace the furniture and bed?

470
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,660
Because they were old.

471
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:35,640
Why don't you throw this stuff away? Why, why, why?

472
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,380
Uh, stop that!

473
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:41,230
Ah, Ji Su's face is all ruined.

474
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:43,630
I'm jealous. Throw that away.

475
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,840
Pardon?

476
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,760
What did you say?

477
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,490
I'm jealous. So get rid of that.

478
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:53,030
Why do you need to have another man's photo in the bedroom?

479
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:55,260
It's not another man... it's Ji Su—

480
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:58,710
I don't care who he is, I just don't like it!

481
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:02,260
Instead, just chase a puppy. Then I'll bear it as much as possible.

482
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:05,150
♫ Minus when you go to the bathroom ♫

483
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:09,110
♫ Grab onto me and let's walk together ♫

484
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:11,300
No way...
♫ step by step ♫

485
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:16,000
♫ Oh my girl ♫

486
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,700
♫ Oh, oh, oh, let's all ♫

487
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:22,050
Take a look around and let me know if you don't like anything.

488
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:24,240
I want to make sure I fix everything together this time around.

489
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:30,290
Such a player... A complete player.

490
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:13,480
♫ Without a word, time just passes ♫

491
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:20,890
♫ Even just one word ♫

492
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:24,450
It's strange... I just can't get used to this place.
♫ Can't be spoken without consideration ♫

493
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:33,230
♫ When you ask me why ♫

494
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:38,590
♫ With a sad face ♫

495
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:46,520
♫ You look away from me as if you feel sorry ♫

496
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:57,210
♫ And with that days went by without any chat ♫

497
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:08,000
♫ But instead of feeling hate, I worried more ♫

498
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:16,750
♫ Wondering if you were sick ♫

499
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:22,190
♫ or if something was bothering you ♫

500
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:30,250
♫ What do I do about this fleeting feeling? ♫

501
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:38,550
♫ Did I do anything to disappoint you? ♫

502
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:43,410
♫ You only acted that way to get back at me ♫

503
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:48,810
♫ Something that all lovers ♫

504
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:52,220
♫ must feel  ♫

505
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:58,540
♫ If not, tell me that you've fallen out of love with me ♫

506
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:01,630
I don't think this will happen but don't fall in too in love.

507
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:04,830
People like us can't just marry anybody.

508
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:06,330
Especially you, you know that, right?

509
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:08,360
To Jae In,

510
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,960
you are like a poorly fitting pair of shoes, Da Hyeon.

511
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,660
Jae In is actually a very comforting man.

512
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,160
You might not know that though.

513
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,580
Ah, Jae In, who is Tae Ha?

514
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,100
Jae In has dated a lot of women.

515
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,800
At the longest, it was six months.

516
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,480
What?

517
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,780
How many women have you dated?

518
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:26,810
Is this new way to show jealousy, or are you just probing me?

519
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:28,870
I think I need to be the one to kill him.

520
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:30,460
♫ We need some time ♫
