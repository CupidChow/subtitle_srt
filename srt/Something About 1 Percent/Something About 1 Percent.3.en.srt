00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:10,400
I'm really worried about the next two hours.

164
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,190
You are worrying about your next two hours,

165
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:16,230
but I'm worried about the next six months.

166
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,050
Get out now.

167
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,680
Don’t hold it...

168
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,700
Let me say hello.

169
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,400
Thank you.

170
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,990
How much is this and this?

171
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,770
What is it?

172
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:03,770
- Let's go. Hurry.
- Me, me! I'll pay.

173
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:06,320
It's a personal gift.

174
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,120
Give up and let's go in.

175
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,500
No matter how long you do this, I have to go in there.

176
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,170
I surely warned you.

177
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:15,230
Here you go.

178
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:17,660
Thank you.

179
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,440
What are you doing?

180
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,040
Isn't that Jae In?

181
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,720
Honey, that's Jae In, right?

182
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,030
Yes. But who's that girl?

183
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:48,420
I don't know. I don't recognize her face.

184
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,850
Does Jae In have a girlfriend?

185
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:04,430
Pretend not to know me if possible.

186
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:07,220
Don't even turn your face this way.

187
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,810
You said I'm not that embarrassing.

188
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,800
You should have told me earlier that we were going to a concert.

189
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,080
I'm not talking about that.

190
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:21,500
Then should we go out now? I'm totally fine.

191
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:39,060
I don't know. I already warned you. This is all your fault.

192
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,300
What are you saying?

193
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,710
How is this my fault?

194
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:47,550
I don't like concerts.

195
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,060
So when is Jae In keeping his promise?

196
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,830
Why isn't there any news from him?

197
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,620
I heard that he is meeting the teacher today.

198
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,960
Today?

199
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,850
Then he won't come to work on the weekends.

200
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:07,820
He's meeting her at the hotel.

201
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,300
Ch-Chairman, please excuse me.

202
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,060
Why?

203
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,370
I need to go back and give him the impression I'm at work...

204
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,480
He told me to write a letter of resignation.

205
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,950
You may go.

206
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:23,500
If he stalls and there's no news from him, I will introduce her to Tae Ha right away.

207
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,390
Tell him it's up to him.

208
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,010
Yes.

209
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:47,750
What, what...?

210
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:05,440
Why are you doing this? People are looking.

211
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:09,050
That's what I want to say. People are watching.

212
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,780
- Oh...
- Stay still.

213
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:32,950
Doze off one more time if you want to know what I'm going to do next.

214
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:37,060
What... what are you going to do?

215
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:45,090
Close your eyes and I will kiss you.

216
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:58,370
Don't even touch me.

217
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:01,750
Don't sleep.

218
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:02,460
[Concert Hall]

219
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,010
She looks unfamiliar, right?

220
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:13,990
Yes. I don't know her.

221
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,880
Let's find out.

222
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,590
Oh my, CEO! It’s been a while.

223
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,700
Nephew, long time no see.

224
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,760
Who is that girl? You came together, right?

225
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,540
I'm seeing her due to business.

226
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:43,920
Business? Is she associated with the hotel? She doesn't look like it.

227
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,270
You’re looking at physiognomy now, aren’t you?

228
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:48,170
Excuse me.

229
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:53,610
He's so arrogant.

230
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:11,300
Let's go talk somewhere.

231
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:15,110
Let's rewrite the contract.

232
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:21,060
I didn't think about it back then but there's something missing in that contract.

233
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:24,630
Shes a smart fox.

234
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:29,610
So...

235
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:31,530
Why? What do you want?

236
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,190
Don't copy the last page.

237
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,920
You want me to take out the important part?

238
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,800
Tae Ha is also a candidate for marriage.

239
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,920
What is missing?

240
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,000
Physical contact.

241
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,930
Do you really want to put that in the contract?

242
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:53,400
You could just do it if you want to.
(drops formality in speech)

243
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:59,810
Still, let's take time to sleep together.

244
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:01,580
You are crazy. Crazy.

245
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,060
Who said I want to do it?

246
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,130
Don't even lay a finger on me.

247
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,290
That's not fair to me.

248
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,330
What did you say?

249
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:10,410
We are in a serious relationship. We need to progress.

250
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:13,340
Who said we would progress? I don’t want to.

251
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,980
Then you shouldn't have made a deal.

252
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,160
Or pay the penalty!

253
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,570
I can make sure that pop star never sings.

254
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:24,360
Are you threatening me?

255
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,680
No way.

256
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,690
What do you mean "threatening" when we're dating?

257
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:31,810
Just don’t worry too much. Let’s take things slowly.

258
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:35,590
But still, if Teacher Kim Da Hyeon truly wants it—

259
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:39,190
No. You said you hate someone like me.

260
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:41,350
You don't like them.

261
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:45,610
My grandfather likes you so much. Therefore, as his grandson, I should bear it.

262
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:47,920
Shouldn't I?

263
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,690
Since when are you such a nice grandson?

264
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:02,600
Yes, Mother.

265
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,890
Again?

266
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:08,160
Man? This Saturday?

267
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,870
That’ll be a little difficult.

268
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:16,060
No. I don't have a boyfriend.

269
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,270
Hello, I'm Lee Jae In.
(back to formal speech)

270
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,300
Are you crazy?

271
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:23,450
Yes, yes. I'm that guy from last time.

272
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:25,690
This guy is really...

273
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:30,940
Miss Da Hyeon, she can hear you if you’re whispering like that right next to me, no matter how quietly you whisper.

274
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,220
Yes, yes.

275
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,200
No, we are in a serious relationship.

276
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,430
Of course, she doesn't need another man.

277
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:42,390
Yes. I'll meet you in person next time.

278
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:44,120
Yes, yes.

279
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:46,770
Yes, it's me, Da Da.

280
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:49,070
No, that's not true.

281
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:53,270
Later. Let's talk later. I'll explain everything later.

282
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:55,550
No, I said it's not true!

283
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:00,100
What on earth did you just do?

284
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,270
Who's Da Da?

285
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:06,060
You don't need to know! I'm really going crazy.

286
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:13,870
Why did you do this to me, seriously?

287
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:19,760
Don't overreact.

288
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:30,180
Honey, I think Da Hyeon really has a man.

289
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,620
He’s energetic and has a nice voice.

290
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,420
What does he do?

291
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,340
He has to be an Oriental doctor.

292
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:39,920
That would be the best. I could leave my Oriental medicine practice to my son-in-law.

293
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,110
And it would be great if Da Da lived with us, wouldn’t it?

294
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,550
A son-in-law is like a real son.

295
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:01,750
- Find out who that woman is.
- Yes.

296
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,680
Especially if your grandfather, the chairman, is involved.

297
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,650
All right.

298
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:08,810
What the heck is he up to this time?

299
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:17,240
Don’t you think about anything else, Father?

300
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:24,390
So who’s Da Da? Are you Da Da?
(informal)

301
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:28,500
Wow, you're really persistent.

302
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,040
Yes, I’m Da Da.

303
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,370
Everyone at home calls me Da Da. But is that important right now?

304
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:36,680
Da Da? Why Da Da?

305
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:40,170
Is it because you run around going "dadada"?

306
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:43,540
Da Da... it suits you.

307
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,470
What wouldn’t suit me?

308
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:49,570
But you’re not supposed to call me by my nickname.

309
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:54,190
Da Da, usually when a man and a woman are dating, they call each other by nicknames.

310
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:57,350
Are you going to keep acting like this? You're unctuous and greasy.

311
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,510
Is it because you're old?

312
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:02,330
Did you just say I’m old? Is 32 old?

313
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:04,600
What kind of bullshit is that?

314
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,630
I’m still in my prime, you know.

315
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:11,350
Sure. Whatever you say, let's say it is if you want.

316
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:16,790
By the way, why are you speaking more and more informally to me?

317
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:21,030
I’m six years older than you. I’m older, you know.

318
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:42,590
Oh my, it’s raining.

319
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,940
It’s just a shower. It’ll stop soon.

320
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:49,230
How do you know that?

321
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:51,890
I’ve experienced a lot of them.

322
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:55,050
In my teens, twenties...

323
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:56,770
And...

324
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:00,380
- Let’s go.
- Oh my!
(formally)

325
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:03,690
It’s cold!

326
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:06,220
Did that jerk Jae In meet her? Or end things with her?

327
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,020
What's going on? I haven't heard anything from him.

328
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,870
I'm sure he will report to you soon.

329
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:11,710
Report?

330
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:15,860
Isn’t this the business you ordered him to do?

331
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:21,210
Of course... he will ca— no, not call, he’ll report back to you.

332
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:30,910
What do you think happened to those two?

333
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:34,230
Well... would it be the same as the other times, don't you think?

334
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:36,590
He doesn’t give his heart to anybody.

335
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:39,430
Well, he’ll probably sleep with that woman but...

336
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:42,250
After some time has passed, when he thinks "this woman is clingy,"

337
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:45,570
he’ll ruthlessly dump her and speed off.

338
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,950
How do you know that?

339
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:52,820
The same way that you knew it, Chairman.

340
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:56,880
I managed the report materials going to you at the secretarial office.

341
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,140
We’re here. You can stop there.

342
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:07,490
I know. I won’t go in front of your house.

343
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,140
Oh, yeah.

344
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:20,550
Here.

345
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:23,000
I don’t really want to give it to you but...

346
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,910
You bought this for me?

347
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:27,890
It’s wasn’t expensive.

348
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:30,900
But that was my first time going to a classical music concert.

349
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,470
I think it’s a couple item.

350
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:45,580
Why are you keeping the one with your initials?

351
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,520
It’s only meaningful if we switch.

352
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,130
After all, we’re dating.

353
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:51,570
No. I don't want to. I bought these, you know.

354
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:52,960
I paid for it with my own money.

355
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,200
It’s my present.

356
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:03,000
What are you doing? Aren't you getting out?

357
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,780
Well if you don’t want to part ways...

358
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,880
Shall we eat ramen at your place?
 (like watch a movie and chill but with inuendo)

359
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:11,810
I’m getting out! Ramen? As if!

360
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:18,230
In any case, thank you for today.

361
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:21,220
- Half of it.
- Half?

362
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,250
You helped Ji Su.

363
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:26,390
I mean, did you think I was grateful for you threatening me?

364
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:29,080
Because that was my promise.

365
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,980
Yes, it was your promise.

366
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:34,980
Anyway, thanks to your grandfather, everything went well.

367
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:39,260
I don’t know what he looks like, but tell him that I’m really grateful.

368
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,210
You really don’t know?

369
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:47,980
You really don’t know my grandfather, the chairman?

370
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:51,330
I wish you'd reveal the truth.

371
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,270
Have you lived your whole life being deceived?

372
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:57,460
Were you born with a lot of doubts,

373
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,390
or did you go wrong as you grew up?

374
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:01,760
I think it’s the latter.

375
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,630
Went wrong?

376
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:20,410
See you next week. Get home safely.

377
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:22,930
And don't waste energy on wild thoughts tonight.

378
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:25,820
Just sleep. You are old, after all.

379
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,670
Bye.

380
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:23,030
I had my key ring in the car earlier...

381
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,670
Oh, that’s right. I left something behind again.

382
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:28,690
You’re going crazy, Kim Da Da.

383
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,900
What should I do?

384
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:42,060
Do I have to call him?

385
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,830
He’s going to talk about ramen again.

386
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:53,120
By chance, are you looking for this?
 (drops formality again)

387
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:00,330
I thought you were gone. Thank you.

388
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:02,790
No way I would just leave.

389
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:05,630
It's not like I lack the sense.

390
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,900
We’re moving a little fast for a first date.

391
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:11,090
Well, if that’s what Da Da really wants...

392
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:12,820
What are you doing?

393
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,670
Weren’t you purposely trying to seduce me?

394
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:17,530
Since you did this, it would be bad manners to disregard your effort.

395
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:19,640
What manners? It’s not like that, you know.

396
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,330
I really made a mistake. A mistake!

397
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:24,620
I just forgot them because you kept driving me out of my mind.

398
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,390
Who’s seducing who?

399
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:27,930
Give it to me.

400
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:38,330
Come on.

401
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,540
Give it to me.

402
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,330
This... why...

403
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:37,850
Since we are really dating, shouldn’t we make some progress?

404
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:44,210
Go in. No matter how I think about it, I had a strict upbringing.

405
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:47,090
I'm not okay with sleeping with you on the first date.
(picks up formality)

406
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,460
No one was offering, you know! You...

407
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,430
What are you doing?

408
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:57,700
Who, who should be saying that?

409
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,380
If you bring up making progress to me one more time...

410
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,270
You’re asking for trouble.

411
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:04,870
You’re not even going to say goodbye?

412
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,770
Whether you get home safely or not,

413
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:48,040
Lee Jae In, what are you doing?

414
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,060
Why this...

415
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,070
Jerk.

416
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:27,400
Isn't he such a player?

417
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,240
Yeah.

418
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:53,350
You block reporters since it's about the contract.

419
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:55,150
How is a lawyer supposed to stop that?

420
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,890
The Group should be stopping them.

421
00:34:56,890 --> 00:34:59,240
Then leave it.

422
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,630
Hey, you made trouble,

423
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,050
but I clean it up?

424
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,980
At a formal event,

425
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,330
if you show up with a woman,

426
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:10,520
didn't you think that reporters would see that with wide eyes and jump in to write about it?

427
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:13,170
It's not like I was completely unaware.

428
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:15,480
But I did it knowing that it was something you could stop.

429
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,060
So take responsibility and stop them.

430
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:22,530
Wow, despite everything, you at least have a good brain.

431
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:30,000
Oh, you're laughing?

432
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,370
I didn't laugh.

433
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:33,560
You laughed for sure.

434
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:38,630
What is it? What happened? I have really good senses.

435
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,970
One more bottle...

436
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:47,740
Ah, there is something...

437
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,730
There isn't anything.

[SH Alpenzia CEO Lee Jae In Accompanied by Beautiful Woman at Concert]

440
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:19,230
What is this? What did this punk, Jae In, do?
[SH Alpenzia CEO Lee Jae In Accompanied by Beautiful Woman at Concert]

441
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:22,720
S-Still, thankfully it was after work hours that...

442
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,910
It appeared a little bit only on a few Internet sites and a few newspapers.

443
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:30,530
Attorney Park was up all night trying to block them from publishing...

444
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:34,020
Ah, this punk, Jae In!

445
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:37,730
I told him to tell me some news, and this is how he tells me.

446
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:41,600
I'm sorry, it was too late at night for me to handle it.

447
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,260
It's okay. How could you stop him when he planned it out this way?

448
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,590
Are you not worried?

449
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:50,250
If it were like this, the relationship between the two of them would spread.

450
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:54,280
Well, if it were like this, wouldn't it be easier for them to marry?

451
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:58,360
If it goes like that, then I'll win.

452
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,100

[SH Alpenzia CEO Lee Jae In Accompanied by Beautiful Woman at Concert]

It's an accident. An accident.

455
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,320
Just forget about it.

456
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:09,690
Yes, Mother.

457
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:12,380
The news is not completely wrong.

458
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:16,300
No, it is not marriage.

459
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,940
Don't worry about it.

460
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,630
Yes.

461
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:27,430
Yeah, Su Jeong.

462
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:30,030
Have you got a girlfriend? Are you going to get married?

463
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:33,300
I'm not getting married. And speak Korean.

464
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,800
How is Aunt's health?

465

Are you really going to get married?

- Drink this.
- Thanks.

469
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:08,480
Right, Deputy Han. Did you see the news?

470
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,410
Our boss finally got a girlfriend.

471
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:13,460
Did he ever not have a girl?

472

That's not it.

I think it's different this time.

474
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:24,090
Well, I heard he took her to our hotel concert.

475
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,180
Team Leader, what kind of woman is it?

476
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,450
I don't know. How would I know?

477
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:33,600
There were only two lines of news.

478
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:37,030
I have to know who she is.

479
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,230
Why?

480
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:42,330
Do you perhaps have feelings for our CEO, Deputy Han?

481
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:43,390
Are you crazy?

482
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:44,980
I was going to stop her from dating him even if I had to follow her all day long with my lunch box.

483
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:49,500
If our CEO got a woman, I'm sure he would change somehow.

484
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,660
- Really?
- Of course.

485
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:54,930
When he has a perfect balance of yin and yang, would he lose his temper needlessly?

486
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:57,620
We have a meeting in ten minutes.

487
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:00,680
Tell the general manager and Director Hwang that they need to be present, too.

488
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:06,670
Um... but lunchtime is in 10 minutes...

489
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,900
So?

490
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,510
Ah, yes, yes. We understand.

491
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,350
Who said he got a woman? Huh?

492
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:17,360
Balance of yin and yang, my ass!

493
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,160
How is that a guy who got a woman?

494
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,610
He's becoming more of an asshole every day.

495
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:26,490
Speak prettily, that... doesn't really fit you.

496
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:37,640
Lee Jae In? A beautiful woman?

497
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,550
Ah, this guy really...

498
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:47,710
Well... beautiful woman is true.

499
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:50,940
True... but...

500
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:57,960
Pretend not to know me if possible.

501
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,390
Don't even turn your face this way.

502
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:04,220
This jerk... Should I just kill him?

503
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:08,010
If I'd known that he'd do this, I would've kicked him one more time yesterday.

504
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:10,460
It's not like I can bury him in the ground either, right?

505
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:34,580
♬  Now it's time to talk  ♬

506
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,250
If you show up with a woman at a formal event,

507
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:40,810
didn't you think reporters would see that with wide eyes and jump in to write about it?

508
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:42,710
It's not like I was completely unaware.

509
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,900
If it were Da Hyeon, she would correct him.

510
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:49,160
Our CEO will not change easily.

511
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:52,460
You knew, didn't you? That the reporters were there.

512
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:53,560
What is it?

513
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,230
That they would write news about me.

514
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:57,730
Well... a little?

515
00:41:57,730 --> 00:42:00,790
I know how to kick a vital spot. Should I try it?

516
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:06,870
