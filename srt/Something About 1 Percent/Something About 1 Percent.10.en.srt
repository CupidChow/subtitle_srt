Jae In has dated a lot of women.

00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,040
But they never lasted long.

133
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,170
Perhaps a month for a short relationship, or six months for the longest one.

134
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,810
He just dated enough to break up easily.

You aren't imagining marrying him, are you?

139
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:40,070
I'm giving you some words of caution for your sake. Don't fall for Jae In.

Well, who knows what will happen between a man and a woman?

141
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:48,150
I understand why you are giving me this advice,

142
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:52,620
but we will take care of our own relationship.

Can I try these on?

144
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,530
Yes, of course. Let me help you.

145
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,110
It's a bit uncomfortable.

No.

Jae In is a more comforting man than you think,

I am!

165
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:08,400
But he needs to be punished today. Very fairly.

166
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,750
You're so cute! Cute!

167
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,890
Ah, right! That's it! Fairness!

Why aren't you answering your phone?

169
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,920
Because I had a lot to think about.

170
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,920
What happened this time?

171
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,400
You are not the type to get mad at me for not being able to drive you home.

172
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,680
I am pissed because you didn't drive me home.

173
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:41,730
If only you had driven me home, I wouldn't have run into that woman.

Come to your senses, Kim Da Hyeon.

175
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,360
He's just another guy, you know.

176
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:55,550
Is that why he put six months in here?
[Dating Contract]

177
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:58,460
Well then, I must be one of his longest relationships.

178
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:05,050
He was never someone I was going to see for a long time anyway.

179
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:08,830
But still, why did he date that rude girl, of all people?

But how are you... here?

I'm actually in charge of SH Mall's PR Department.

217
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,530
Ji Su's concert today was also planned and cast by our office.

Thank you so much!

219
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:47,000
It's been hard finding a stage for Ji Su since he's still a trainee.

220
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,800
Not a problem. It wasn't anything big. It was just a small, mini-concert event here.

221
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,770
Also Ji Su's style fits our company's image well too. So it receives a lot of good responses.

I believe there is another event here next week as well.

226

Well, I think we are booked with another artist here but we do have openings in Gangnam and Busan.

Come on, talk.

00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:33,100
I need to know what the issue is so that I can either explain myself or resolve it some other way.

245
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,160
What is the issue?

246
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:38,190
How many women have you dated?

247
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,230
If it's a short-term it's one month, and if it's long-term it's six months? Was it like that?

248
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:47,730
Is this a new kind of jealousy or are you just probing me?

249
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,490
Probing.

250
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:52,070
You just try cheating on me.

251
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,320
Do you think I have time to meet another woman?

252

I'm busy enough with Kim Da Hyeon alone.

253

Don't waste your time thinking about that useless kind of stuff.

254

If you have time to think about things like that, just call me before I call you.

255
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:08,220
Why don't you call me? No. Why don't you even answer the phone?

256
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,790
Why am I the only one that calls?

257
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,790
Because... I'm busy.

258
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:18,750
I'm probably a dozen times more busier than you.

Oh, Hyeon Jin, what's up?

I'm busy getting ready to leave.

I know but take a look at your phone.

262
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,780
Why? Is there a scandal about Ji Su?

00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,770
Oh, look at this.

321
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:44,000
Wow, this is really a big potato.

322
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:51,580
Teacher, look how much pumpkin and crown daisy I was able to harvest.

323
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:54,060
Can we eat them now?

324
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,350
Yes, we can cook and eat them now.

325
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:59,700
Yum, yum. But don't you dislike pumpkins, Gyeong Eun?

326
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,550
I want to eat this one though.

327
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,380
Okay, good choice.

328
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:17,330
Jae In-ah.
(intimate/casual form)

329
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:19,990
Don't you know that you shouldn't show up right now in this situation?

330
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:22,120
I don't think it's that bad.

331
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,260
You are the worst.

332
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:27,400
I was the one that saved you last time when we almost got married.

333
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,310
Don't you owe me?

334
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:33,570
No, I don't owe you.

335
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:36,760
You didn't want that marriage, either.

336
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:41,580
Follow me. I don't want to cause more false rumors to spread about us by loitering here.

337
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:50,010
I want to let you know first that the only reason I'm speaking with you face to face right now

338
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:54,220
is to resolve this issue.

339
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,470
Release a corrected article.

340
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:57,440
Do you really hate this that much?

341
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,280
Why shouldn't we get married?

342
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:03,140
Han Ju Hee, why are you acting like this?

343
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:07,980
I... I think I love you.

344
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:13,930
Even if I weren't not Seong Hyeon Group's Lee Jae In?

345
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:17,340
You don't love me. You love Seong Hyeon Group.

346
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,720
Three years ago and even now.

347
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,630
It's true that I covet the Seong Hyeon Group first lady position, too.

348
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:25,340
But I also want you.

349
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,600
Just stop it right there.

350
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,020
I'm not your toy.

351
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:34,850
Don't even think about toying with me. It disgusts me.

352
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:44,270
And don't call my name whenever you please.

353
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:51,380
It's true, "Jae In-ah" is too casual.

354
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:54,520
I will call you Mr. Jae In in public settings.

355
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,770
That's even worse.

356
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:58,940
You have no reason to call my name, so just don't call me.

357
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:03,530
Lee Jae In, if you act like this, I can retaliate.

358
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:08,280
I can become as ruthless as you.

359
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:15,830
You only threaten other people when you have a real ability.

360
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:18,360
That should be also done depending on your opponents.

361
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:22,230
Let's pretend I didn't hear this.

362
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:47,760
You have some talent.

363
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,680
Bye, Teacher.

364
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,730
Bye.

365
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:13,790
Bye.

366
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:21,600
Oh, please.

367
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,350
Excuse me...

368
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:49,680
Teacher Kim Da Hyeon just left.

369
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:04,800
I thought I missed you. How do you walk so fast?

370
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,980
Don't check the internet for a while.

371
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,240
Don't watch the news either.

372
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:18,540
It's too late. I already went online and saw the news.

373
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,620
Damn it.

374
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,890
There is really nothing that I like.

375
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:25,160
You cuss as you please. You also got engaged on your own.

376
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,560
I didn't get engaged.

377
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:34,960
Contract rule #12, when one of the two gets a real partner, the contract automatically terminates.

378
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,060
Congratulations on your engagement!

379
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,410
That's not it!

380
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:38,680
I took screenshots, want me to show you?

381
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,330
Why would you take screenshots of that crap news?

382
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:44,880
Why are you the one getting angry? What did you do well?

383
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,980
Do I look like that kind of person to you?

384
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:53,240
The type to get engaged to another girl while dating you?

385
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:02,170
I'm... I'm not sure.

386
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:23,870
If it doesn't come from my mouth, don't trust anything.

387
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:25,670
Just trust me.

388
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:28,270
You need to make me believe in you.

389
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,670
I don't know what's wrong with me.

390
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:38,140
Our contracted relationship is going to be over soon anyway.

391
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:43,250
Then this whole engagement is not my business.

392
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:47,200
Don't move forward so quickly.

393
00:31:55,990 --> 00:32:00,060
You think way too much with your small brain.

394
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:04,520
Trust me and think only of me.

395
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:09,590
Until the end of this contract, I won't let anything hurt you, understand?

396
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:17,420
Also, please answer my calls.

397
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,830
You laugh?

398
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:24,990
Go now.

399
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:26,640
Seriously, go.

400
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,590
Get in.

401
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,290
Is it okay not to go up together?

402
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:37,320
Go in safely.

403
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:08,040
- Did you see?
- Yeah.

404
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,240
Looked like you were shooting a movie.

405
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,510
Making me jealous, Kim Da Da.

406
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:23,140
Hyeon Jin,

407
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:31,160
I think I'm getting attached to him while hating him. What should I do?

408
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,600
What's there to do?

409
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:38,400
With the time left, you just have to date like crazy so you'll have no regrets when you break up.

410
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,020
Then what'll happen when I can't break up?

411
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,820
What are you worried about?

412
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:46,800
Are you worried that you might break up or that you might not break up?

413
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,780
I mean, it's not like you're being unfaithful here.

414
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:52,670
It's not like you're divorced after getting married.

415
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:56,070
Why worry in advance about things that haven't happened yet?

416
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:58,820
Makes sense.

417
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:02,310
Also, don't worry.

418
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:05,550
Your big sister has been through a lot, so I know.

419
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:10,580
Breaking up? It's really not such a big deal.

420
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:16,130
Out of sight, out of mind.

421
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,590
That's it.

422
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:19,420
Really?

423
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:26,610
If that's the case... I hope it works out like that.

424
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,770
My innocent one.

425
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:51,730
I don't know what's wrong with me.

426
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:55,560
Our contracted relationship is going to be over soon anyway.

427
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:21,910
The first reporter who wrote the fake news was Gang Jin Yeong.

428
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:26,010
But he won't tell us who gave him the information.

429
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,960
How much did Han Ju Chemical's stock price rise yesterday?

430
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,070
The price soared 6.28% even after we released our statement refuting the fake news.

431
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:37,760
Is there any evidence that Chairman Han sold stock using over-the-counter transactions?

432
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,250
Nothing has been reported about that yet.

433
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:44,780
In the mean time, keep an eye on the Han Ju Chemical stock and even the directors as well.

434
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,020
Yes.

435
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:50,840
There is definitely something going on here. All the puzzle pieces are on the table,

436
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,580
yet they aren't fitting properly.

437
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:06,090
Contract end date: 24th Saturday

438
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:12,680
It must be hard to keep up with this schedule.

439
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,360
Today's the weekend, but you're not going on a date?

440
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:17,740
I have to meet Ji Su. Hotels are busy on the weekends too.

441
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:21,040
If you tell him you're meeting Ji Su, the gentleman will just pop up at the same time.

442
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,040
Regardless of how busy he may be.

443
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,560
That's why I didn't tell him.

444
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,110
You cunning thing.

455
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:21,920
Even Seo Jin abandoned me and went to Ji Su.

456
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:29,140
Director.

457
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:31,220
I heard from Ji Su.

458
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:35,020
Our SH Mall works with a variety of nonprofit organizations,

459
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:38,360
and I think there could be some good synergy here with a small concert.

460
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:41,610
He's also going to give out some scholarships.

461
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:44,510
Thank you.

462
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:48,270
Our Ji Su has done something big.
(talking about the donation)

463
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:50,670
Right, Director?

464
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,870
Don't you have to go back to the dorm?

465
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:56,980
I got permission from my manager. He said it would be okay for me to spend the night here.

466
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:01,350
Nice, well done. The kids are going to be so excited tonight.

467
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:03,960
Director, I will come back next week.

468
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,070
Go ahead, otherwise you'll get stuck in traffic.

469
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:08,260
Don't get lost.

470
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,730
I'll drop you off.

471
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:11,960
It's okay, I should be okay taking the bus.

472
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:16,230
We're in a remote area so it looks like a bus won't come soon.

473
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:20,720
That's right. Its already getting late, so at least get a ride to the train station.

474
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,710
Go ahead.

475
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,450
It's okay to drop me off in front of the station.

476
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:34,490
Which direction is your house? I live towards Bundang.

477
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,690
Oh, me too!

478
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:39,600
Then I'll drop you off close to the Bundang area.

479
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:49,190
Where are you?

480
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:51,100
I am on my way home.

481
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:54,270
Exactly. Where are you?

482
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:57,430
Coming back from the orphanage.

483
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:00,620
Oh, when are you coming back? I'm almost done here.

484
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:02,850
Should I come to pick you up?

485
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:05,420
I'm telling you I am on my way home.

486
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,550
See you next weekend.

487
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:15,790
How could she not even jokingly ask for me to pick her up?

488
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:18,820
That must have been the boyfriend you mentioned last time.

489
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,350
Pardon?

490
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,660
Yes.

491
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:27,500
Are you planning on getting married to him, by chance?

492
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,990
Excuse me for my mistake.

493
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:34,360
That question is too personal, but I was just curious.

494
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:40,730
It's okay. We are dating after all, but just not at that level yet.

495
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:44,950
Please drop me off in front of the crosswalk over there.

496
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:47,680
Since we've come all this way, I'll just drop you off in front of your house.

497
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,370
No, I'm really thankful for you taking me this far.

498
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:56,710
Ahh, it's really okay...

499
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,400
Thank you.

500
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,210
Da Hyeon?

501
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:29,350
Jae In.

502
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:38,400
♫ Yeah, come on come on baby ♫

503
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,870
♫ Yeah, come on come on baby. Uh uh uh check it out ♫

504
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:42,830
♫ Check it out ♫

505
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:46,300
♫ Excuse me baby, tell me ♫

506
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:51,430
♫ My beating heart, please help me ♫

507
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:52,180
♫ Let's go! ♫

508
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:55,300
♫ Mustering courage and asking if you have time ♫

509
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:58,420
He's so ridiculous. He doesn't even know what he did wrong.

510
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:01,430
You are the more ridiculous one.

511
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:03,150
Wow, this man just doesn't repent for his sins.

512
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:04,680
Do you think I will just let this go?

513
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,400
If you don't want your lawyer's license to be suspended, just come over to my house now.

514
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,200
What do we do? Da Hyeon is really angry.

515
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,570
Maybe get her a bouquet of flowers and act cute.

516
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:16,410
I don't know what's really going on but he will never marry that teacher.

517
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:18,970
Right, it's about time to meet.

518
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:21,990
If Da Hyeon attends that event as my partner, I know what will happen.

519
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:24,980
How do you feel though?

520
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:27,020
♫ Even the white smile ♫

521
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:30,550
