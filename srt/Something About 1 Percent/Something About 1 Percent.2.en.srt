I'm telling you that there is!

162
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,830
I'm not exactly sure what kind of debt that may be, but...

163
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,900
is there any other way to repay her?

164
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,210
Throwing CEO Lee at her isn't paying back her kindness.

165
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:48,110
You're making her your enemy.

166
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:51,220
- Is my grandson really that lacking?
No, of course not lacking.

167
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:54,210
Excessive. Too excessive. Being too excessive, that's the problem.

168
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,310
His rude and jerky manners are just—

169
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,820
That's why he needs Da Hyeon.

170
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,210
You're well aware that Jae In is really inconsiderate.

171
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:03,800
And the women he has dated are just like him.

172
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,190
All he cares about is money.

173
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:14,000
I can't let him live like that forever.

174

And I'm running out of time.

175
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:26,120
So that chairman left me his fortune, but I have to marry you to get it.

176
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,040
That's what you're telling me, right?

177

Do you know how much our company's shares cost right now?

182

That annual dividend that you're apparently not interested in

183
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,210
is more than what you'd make in the next ten years, Teach!

185

You've been calling me "Woman" or "Teach'" all this time. Call me "Teacher."

186
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:06,160
"Teach," "Teacher," whatever. Instead of paying attention to terms of address,

187
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,770
if we settle our relationship,

188

you would get many more benefits.

192
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,130
Look here.

193

- Yes, Mr. Lee Jae In.

195

It's not like I'm about to lose my house or starve from hunger.

196
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:36,980
I'm living just very fine without this nuisance of an inheritance,

197
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,190
so why would I have to marry you?

198
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,460
And you, of all people.

199

Do you think that's something you can handle?

What... do you mean by that?

202
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:54,530
You'll get a lot of power to control this society all of a sudden by just marrying someone... even if it's not me.

203
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:57,180
Tons of people will try to seize this chance, and swarm over it like flies.

204

It'd be fine to just choose someone among that crowd, I guess, but—

Oh, that doesn't sound bad.

206
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:08,860
But you know, you definitely won't be that one I choose to marry.

 (strong and in good health)

What did she say?

228
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,620

Wait, so what happened in the end?

231
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,520
She said I could figure out myself whether I marry or something, but she didn't want any part of it.

232
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,580
She's not interested in marriage or money.

233
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:50,890
Wait, so what are you going do then?

234
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:54,670
What else? I'll just keep asking until she agrees.

00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:20,670
I don't want to make my life weird because of this.

319
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:23,670
So tell your grandfather

320
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:27,520
I really refused.

321
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,270
You are sincere.

322
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:40,630
Yes. I've been sincere since the last time.

323
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:28,050
That was a perfectly good chance. But even so, would all of that money be mine?

324
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:32,630
Who knows what they are up to, when you know what kind of people they are?

325
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:40,160
Yes, Mom.

326
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,810
I know, I know.

327
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:46,770
I'm going to end up meeting all the Oriental doctors in Korea!

328
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:53,820
No, I mean I will marry a Oriental doctor for sure.

329
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,960
Yes.

330
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,190
SH Alpenzia

331
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:06,820
I don't want to make my life weird because of this.

332
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:10,570
So tell your grandfather

333
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:14,060
I really refused.

334
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:20,560
Seong Hyeon Group will become Tae Ha's. Of course, that includes SH Mall's shares.

335
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,900
There's no reason that you must be my successor, after all.

336
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,870
[Personal Information]

337
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:29,220
Hey, Teacher.

338
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:37,360
If you act like this, I'll be in a bit of trouble.

339
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,520
Is Jae In quiet?

340
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,090
Yes.

341
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:52,100
He got rejected by Da Hyeon. I knew it would be like this.

342
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,420
No way... Our CEO did?

343
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,600
I hate him from time to time.

344
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,820
Da Hyeon must hate him more.

345
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:04,280
Let's see. When should I tell Tae Ha?

346
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,720
Call Attorney Park.

347
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,840
R-Right now?

348
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,710
No...

349
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,020
Dong Yang Hotel Restaurant, No Hyeon Wu.

350
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,770
Ah, I really don't like it.

351
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:27,010
On this golden weekend with beautiful weather,

352
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:31,450
I have to go out on a blind date.

353
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,700
Let's go.

354
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:57,820
- Have you been waiting for a long time?
- I just got here.

355
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:01,540
It's so hard to see my son's face.

356
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:18,110
I heard your grandfather called. What did he threaten you with this time?

357
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:21,440
It's nothing, really. I can handle it.

358
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:31,400
Do you... call your aunt in Canada often?

359
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:39,960
- Nice to meet you, Miss Da Hyeon.
- Hello.

360
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,600
I called her once last week.

361
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,170
Her health has improved a lot.

362
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:48,140
- Was there any traffic on the way here?
- No, not really.

363
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:52,780
Oh, is that so? I thought there was a lot of traffic...

364
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:56,220
Is it someone you know? Your friend?

365
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,120
Yes. A little.

366
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,140
- I heard you are an Oriental doctor.
- Ah, yes.

367
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:07,130
It looks like they are on a blind date. They look good together.

368
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,140
Aren't you going to get married?

369
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:15,650
I'm going to lose my neck waiting for my son to get married.

370
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:17,060
When the time comes.

371
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,490
Come back home.

372
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:23,630
You are Seong Hyeon Group's eldest grandson.

373
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,030
I know.

374
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:32,610
But I don't want to take up a place just because I'm Chairman Lee Gyu Cheol's grandson.

375
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:33,740
I'll go back when the time comes.

376
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:37,950
You're not just Chairman Lee Gyu Cheol's grandson.

377
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:40,530
You are also a son of Dae Han Electric's Chairman's daughter.

378
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:44,460
If you need anything, your maternal grandfather and I will do everything for you.

379
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:47,060
- You should eat too.
- You understand?

380
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:55,370
Mother, I think we need to leave now.
- It tastes good.

381
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,910
Is there something wrong?

382
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:03,060
Yes. There's a big problem.

383
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:06,970
Okay, I get it. I should go see Mrs. Gang.

384
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:09,350
Take care of your work.

385
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:13,730
I'm going to leave.

386
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:21,020
Are you close to the broadcasting station's PD?

387
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,560
Yes. He is my schoolmate, so we're in touch once in a while.

388
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,530
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

389
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,460
Teacher Kim Da Hyeon?

390
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,360
Oh my!

391
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,260
What are you doing here, Lee Jae In?

392
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,870
I don't think you're done with me.

393
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,130
Isn't this cheating?

394
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:39,460
What do you mean, "cheating?"

395
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:43,570
I told you enough already last time.

396
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:46,960
- I'm not going to marry you—
- That's what I'm saying.

397
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,100
Like you said, let's postpone our marriage.

398
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,530
But I don't really care if we do it tomorrow.

399
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:55,390
I'm sorry.

400
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:58,880
There's a small misunderstanding when a woman and a man date...

401
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,330
Any way, it's really hard to date.

402
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:02,710
It's not what you think.

403
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,110
What are you doing?

404
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:07,570
If not, do you just want to marry first like my grandfather told us to?

405
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:10,830
You said we are only going to date, not marry—

406
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:15,790
I don't think I belong here.

407
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:20,460
- Wait...
- Go home safely.

408
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:28,300
Should we start again from the beginning?

409
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,140
I'll go on this side.

410
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:36,900
He didn't touch his food.

411
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,000
Do you want to talk about it after you finish eating?

412
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:52,490
Are you crazy? Why are you doing this?

413
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:55,640
I'm not crazy. I already told you. I want to start over.

414
00:30:55,640 --> 00:31:01,360
What do you mean, start over? When did we even start?

415
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,890
Then we can start from now.

416
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:07,510
Wait. Ah. W-Wait...

417
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:11,120
You were already dating someone?

418
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,370
Then you should've introduced him to us.

419
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,840
No, that's not true. I don't know him.

420
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,440
I'm not someone you don't know.

421
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:29,300
That is... He has a bit of mental problem.

422
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:32,360
It's ridiculous.

423
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,610
No, he's not dangerous.

424
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:36,920
Okay, okay.

425
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:40,460
Next week? I will. I will go on a blind date.

426
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:43,180
No, that's not true, Mom.

427
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,680
Okay, I'm going to hang up.

428
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,460
Make an excuse so I can forgive you.

429
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:54,690
I'm not planning to make an excuse.

430
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:58,400
Why do you have to meet other guys even through a blind date?

431
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,720
It will all be resolved if you just date me.

432
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,940
That's complicating and suspicious.

433
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:06,080
We don't have to make it complicated.

434
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:12,270
What is there to be suspicious about? It seems like you need a man, Teach—

435
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:15,030
—er, and I need you.

436
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:19,490
Don't people say you are stubborn?

437
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:22,720
- Sometimes.
- That is people criticizing you.

438
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:27,130
Okay! Let's try it.

439
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:32,080
He said to reveal the will to Tae Ha as well?

440
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:35,530
By when?

441
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:38,220
Immediately. Right now.

442
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:43,940
♫ Shut up and let's work. Let's work. Let's work ♫

443
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:48,850
Yes, Assistant Manager Ahn. What did the American Chamber of Commerce say?

444
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:56,610
The CEO? The situation right now... You know the millstone handle situation? It's exactly like that.
(TN: The handle was broken so the millstone couldn't grind grain)

445
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:59,500
I'm going crazy.

446
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,420
Call me back again.

447
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:15,480
I'm telling you once again. What my grandfather wants is a serious relationship for six months.

448
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,970
These are the best and the most advantageous terms for us.

449
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:24,070
I think this is not the best for us but only for you.

450
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:27,470
You get a fortune just from dating me.

451
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:33,290
For me, I have to give up my future husband, stocks, and moreover I have to date you.

452
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:37,190
You are really smart.

453
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:39,190
I never heard that I was stupid.

454
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:41,150
You said you were not interested in my grandfather's fortune.

455
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:46,100
I am not interested in you as husband either. But the deal needs to be fair.

456
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:55,020
Listen, this is not a losing business for you either.

457
00:33:55,020 --> 00:34:01,270
If everything goes well in six months, I will give you three years' dividends in cash.

458
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:06,530
Dating me will be much easier for you than talking about such complicated things like stock or board meetings.

459
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:12,080
Oh. You don't even have to go on blind dates with weird guys.

460
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,560
Is that so?

461
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,940
I think this is more complicated.

462
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:20,870
If I marry, you won't need to show off giving me cash.

463
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:23,940
People who are related to me through stocks will be so nice to me.

464
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:27,340
I'll be rich, have stocks, and even a husband.

465
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:30,710
Why would I take a hard way when there is a easier path?

466
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:36,930
And the guy I was meeting earlier isn't weird.

467
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:40,780
Fine.

468
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,560
What is it that you want, Teach?

469
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,290
I'll say it in advance. I'm not going to marry you.

470
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:49,570
Thank you. I think the same.

471
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:52,200
- First of all—
- First?

472
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,470
You want more than one thing? Don't you think you're being greedy in the beginning?

473
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:59,310
First of all, call me "Miss Kim Da Hyeon" or "Teacher."

474
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:02,700
I've told you that many times already. You can do it easily, can't you?

475
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,630
Damn it.

476
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:07,160
I don't want you to curse.

477
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,740
I understand, Miss Kim Da Hyeon.

478
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,960
Teacher Kim Da Hyeon.

479
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:22,590
This is Lee Jae In.

480
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:25,730
Negotiate the KOCHAM proposals with AMCHAM first.
(Korean Chamber and American Chamber)

481
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:30,410
If you ruin this case, you should write a letter of resignation.

482
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:38,210
What is it?

483
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:43,280
He told me to write a a letter of resignation.

484
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,530
Did you finally get caught that you are Chairman's spy?

485
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,870
By any chance... did you tell him that?

486
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:56,670
Are you crazy? What kind of commotion would he make if he found out?

487
00:35:56,670 --> 00:36:00,740
I am his friend, but I'm scared of him.

488
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:03,130
Me too, me too.

489
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:06,830
Why are their family all jerks like that?

490
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:08,690
I know, right?

491
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:14,260
I really don't get it. Do you think the fortuneteller will know? Have you thought about it?

492
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:16,380
I think about it all the time.

493
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:28,220
So what do you want? Is it money, Seong Hyeon Group, or something else?

494
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,850
Tell me. I need to know in order to negotiate.

495
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:33,050
Is anything possible if I tell you?

496
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:37,900
I guess you are really rich? How much can you give me?

497
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,920
It's much easier since we're being honest.

498
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,980
So what do you want?

499
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:48,260
Digital system in our school library.

500
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:52,780
The education department cut it off because they ran out of funds. It'd be better if it's equipped with good books.

501
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:58,000
We need an indoor gym so the kids can play indoors when it's raining, and I'd like to have a school bus.

502
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,260
Oh, and I'd like to have a big mirror in the multipurpose room.

503
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:04,400
I'm in charge of the dance club.

504
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,510
Is there anything else you want?

505
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:09,280
Can you also get me a star from the sky so I can put it in the science classroom?

506
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:14,610
I'm not sure about getting a star, but space business might be included in Seong Hyeon Group's future projects.

507
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:17,270
- Anything else?
- Excuse me.

508
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:20,530
- I was just joking.
- Not me.

509
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,790
Is that everything you need?

510
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:28,710
The school will manage everything, so there's no need for you to do it.

511
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:32,240
Solve our Ji Su's problem with his agency.

512
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,200
What? Who?

513
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,080
He's a very good singer and even a very good actor too.

514
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,580
And he's also very good-looking.

515
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:43,560
So with a little bit of help, he can become a star in no time.

516
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:48,530
His agency is somehow crappy. No, rather tyrannical.

517
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:53,310
He's on a slave contract so he can't do anything. He may get sued by them.

518
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:58,000
How could they ask a ₩300 million (about $27,000) breach of contract penalty from a kid? Does that make sense?

519
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,930
Can a lawyer do such a thing?

520
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:04,800
Is that what you want? Seriously?

521
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,690
Seriously. I'm not even joking this time.

522
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:11,800
This is more important than the will that nobody knows what will happen to and when.

523
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,700
The life of a kid who has a long future ahead of him is at stake here.

524
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:20,480
That is what you think, Teach—er.

525
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,260
Besides that, do you need anything else?

526
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:29,480
No, that's it. If you do that, I am willing to do whatever you tell me to do.

527
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,920
Well, anything but marriage, like you said.

528
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,050
Okay.

529
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:37,450
Contract complete. Don't change your mind later.

530
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:39,990
Great. Let's write a contract.

531
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:41,480
What did you say?

532
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,880
Bye.

533
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,710
Teacher!

534
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:01,730
- Are you doing this on purpose?
- Pardon?

535
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:04,870
Why do you always leave things behind?

536
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:28,010
[One Percent of Something]

537
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:44,750
I'll date him if he solves Ji Su's problem with his agency.

538
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:48,690
She's a fox. Very smart one too. Don't copy the last page.

539
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:49,730
You are three minutes late.

540
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:54,290
I guess you really do have a lot of money. You've done that in one day.

541
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:59,650
Well, she's a new face. Does Jae In have a girlfriend?

542
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:03,310
Don't act like you know me. Don't even turn your face towards me.

543
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:05,800
You said I'm not embarrassing.

544
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:10,600
Close your eyes, and I will kiss you.

545
