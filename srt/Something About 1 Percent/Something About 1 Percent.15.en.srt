00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,560
That jerk.

164
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,560
Da Da. Do you want me to go down there and kick him in the shin?

165
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,780
It's fine. Lets go. I'm hungry.

166
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,510
This is why you also need to start dating now.

167
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:44,250
Meet a new man! I promise you I can set you up with best of the best!

168
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:47,580
It's fine. I'm not even completely over all this yet.

169
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,160
It'll be disrespectful to the other man.

170
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,380
Disrespectful? As if.

171
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:56,680
You can only beat a man with another man!

172
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,730
You're not going to give me a "good job" stamp this time?

173
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:22,560
Good... job.

174
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,320
There is nothing.

175
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,630
It's not like I did something good to deserve the "good job" stamp.

176
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,940
Pardon?

177
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,940
Nothing.

178
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,680
If I had known this would happen, I would have gone all out while dating him.

179
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:27,980
I would've done everything that everyone else does with him so I wouldn't have any regrets.

180
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,190
Rather,

181
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:42,040
I shouldn't have made any memories with him.

182
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:12,170
Did he really break up with Da Hyeon?

183
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:15,540
Yes. He's really a lot scarier

184
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,150
than I thought.

185
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:21,040
Of course he is. He's my grandson, after all.

186
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,290
One's work life and dating life should be kept separate, after all.

187
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:30,700
A long, long time ago, a salt merchant was traveling through the hills.

188
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,890
And then he ran into a scary tiger.

189
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:36,210
The tiger pounced on the salt merchant,

190
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:38,340
and swallowed him up!

191
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,220
All right. Relax and take it easy.

192
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,210
Make a right over there.

193
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,350
- Wait, you have to put on your right signal—
- Oh my!

194
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,900
Right turn!

195
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,790
Just keep going straight.

196
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:01,180
♫ Without a word ♫

197
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,710
♫ Only time passes by ♫

198
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,500
♫ Every word has to be cautious ♫

199
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:14,650
And the salt merchant and the charcoal merchant were given a huge award in the end!

200
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:23,440
♫ “Why is it like this?” you ask me  ♫

201
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:28,950
♫ With sad face ♫

202
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:36,890
♫ You look away from me ♫

203
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:45,260
♫ Could I have made you sad? ♫

204
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:50,050
♫ You're acting this way because you're mad at me, right? ♫

205
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:55,520
♫ All couples go through this ♫

206
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,940
♫ For lovers, this is a common experience, right? ♫

207
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:07,120
♫ If not, and you're having doubts about us, ♫

208
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,890
♫ If you feel the same as I do, ♫

209
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:17,360
♫ Could you just smile at me again now ♫

210
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,580
♫ like before? ♫

211
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:36,290
After your morning schedule,

212
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:45,800
the Chairman would like you to meet Gang Han Pharmaceuticals' daughter for lunch.

213
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:49,350
And he called to remind you.

214
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:54,770
Guess he's back to good health. Tell him not to worry.

215
00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:00,040
Are you really going to marry this soon?

216
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:03,830
I'm the only blood from the Lee family.

217
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:08,880
If I don't marry, my grandpa won't stay still.

218
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,720
But if you marry the wrong person, it will affect your children and their children too.

219
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,290
Please think carefully.

220
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:17,660
I have no choice.

221
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:22,680
Before we marry, there will be a prenup.

222
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:28,160
Of course, its condition is that before we marry, Gang Han Pharmaceuticals will be merged into Seong Hyeon Group.

223
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,200
Aren't you going too straight to the point?

224
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,860
I thought we shouldn't waste each other's time.

225
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,520
Isn't that the reason you are here today?

226
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:38,220
But still, I thought that you would at least have basic etiquette.

227
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,960
Marriage is not business.

228
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,500
How old are you?

229
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,930
Twenty-eight.

230
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:57,570
So you must have had a lot of these kinds of meetings.

231
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:59,460
But you still don't know the rules of this world?

232
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:03,280
This marriage is just a deal.

233
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:08,600
A business deal, nothing more, nothing less.

234
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,290
Let's stop this. Anyway,

235
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:13,180
I don't think we can expect anything from each other.

236
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:21,740
Yes, Jae In is very picky with girls.

237
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,980
So am I.

238
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,950
I'm sure you already knew that it's not easy to be accepted into Seong Hyeon Group.

239
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:34,360
Managing Director Lee didn't go home yesterday again?

240
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,810
Well...

241
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:40,120
I'm worried because he's been working so hard.

242
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,090
Don't worry about that! He won't die from that hard work.

243
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:44,860
Father-in-law!

244
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,620
Then I will be leaving.

245
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,390
Father-in-law.

246
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:59,450
I have done a good job, right?

247
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,570
They broke up because they deserved it.

248
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:08,630
They loved each other only that much.

249
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:12,130
So don't overthink it. That's his fault.

250
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,460
Kids! You guys worked hard today too!

251
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,690
Come here!

252
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:25,860
Be careful going home!

253
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,420
- Okay?
- Yes, ma'am.

254
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,020
Beware of cars!

255
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,410
Bye-bye!

256
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:33,310
Bye!

257
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,610
Aigoo, Ru Mee. Let me fix up your clothes here.

258
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:38,330
- Bye.
- See you later!

259
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,360
Don't worry, I can vouch for him.

260
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,500
- Is he really handsome?
- Yeah.

261
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,830
He's amazing!

262
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:03,120
He's a mix of Won Bin and Cho In Seong.

263
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,900
Best of all, he's a doctor of oriental medicine!

264
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,260
You're telling me the truth, right? If he turns out to be a mama's boy or a player, I'm really going to kill you.

265
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:16,180
Da Da, I already did a full background check.

266
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,220
Oh, I'm so full.

267
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,510
Just see him casually.

268
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:24,320
Date this guy and that guy. If no one works out, I'll take care of you.

269
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,920
She's not into players!

270
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,230
So stop making moves on her.

271
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:31,500
You're the reason I can't get married.

272
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,800
♫ You made me bewildered ♫

273
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,960

♫ I like you for being like that ♫

275
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,160
Ooh!

276
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,700
You'll give me an employee discount, right?

277
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:58,290
I'll buy it for you to congratulate you on getting over your broken heart.

278
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:00,770
Wow! Since you are on your way buying...

279
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,790
- This one too!
- Ah, really.

280
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,550
You're looking for trouble!

281
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:10,030
I broke up with a man...

282
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:13,120
I was so hurt...

283
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:17,870
You didn't used to be such a fox...

284
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,080
You are not going to buy them?

285
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,430
All right, all right.

286
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,430
What? She's eating and laughing well.

287
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:32,240
Da Hyeon does not like creamy spaghetti.

288
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,790
She's not one to finish an entire plate of it.

289
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,830
Take them all away! Just take them all.

290
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,350
Wrap them up.

291
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:43,320
[Lee Jae...]

292
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,340
Hey, Mom...

293
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:04,690
He is Dad's junior?

294
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:06,980
I should definitely meet him then.

295
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,360
All right, I won't mess up.

296
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,940
Bye.

297
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:23,550
It's... raining.

298
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,350
I think I like you, Jae In.

299
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:44,880
Are you really considering transferring schools to Jinju?

300
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:49,280
Da Hyeon?

301
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,710
I'm sorry.

302
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:01,220
Miss Da Hyeon! I'll take you home. It's raining.

303
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:04,170
No, I can just take a taxi in front here.

304
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:07,200
Um... I'm sorry about today.

305
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,360
I'm still not in a good state right now.

306
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,070

I'm Jeong Hyeon Jin.

334
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:55,000
I'm your cousin's ex-girlfriend's friend.

335
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:59,930
So... Kim Da Hyeon is my friend.

336
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,470
Excuse me, you should show some interest.

337
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:07,310
You kidnapped her.

338
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:11,890
I didn't kidnap her; I saved her.

339
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:14,050
That wasn't your true intention, though.

340
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:16,600
It was because of your show-off cousin.

341
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,900
What are you trying to say?

342
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,600
You know that my friend and Lee Jae In broke up, right?

343
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,180
Yes, I believe I heard something like that.

344
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:30,550
The two of them... were really good together.

345
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,440
And?

346
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:38,960
Do you want to do a good deed together?

347
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,260
I'm not really a nice person.

348
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:46,410
Also... I have no interest in other people's love affairs.

349
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:53,680
That real jer—

350
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:57,390
Fine! She can just date someone else then.

351
00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:00,630
I mean, is Lee Jae In the only man in the world?

352
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,090
You look so young.

353
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:06,530
Thank you.

354
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:07,760
Do you like dogs?

355
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,400
I like dogs very much.

356
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,090
I have a big dog though.

357
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:16,260
Hobbies?

358
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,910
I like to read.

359
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:21,890
What do you like?

360
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:25,430
I like to exercise and watch movies alone.

361
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:40,390
- Do you have a good appetite?
- Yes.

362
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,990
Should we go somewhere else?

363
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,680
That would be nice.

364
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,350
Otherwise we'll make them uncomfortable.

365
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:07,200
What is it?

366
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,120
Cousin....

367
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,150
Call me "Hyung," you punk.

368
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:13,590
Making me call him "hyung" when he's only seven months older...

369
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:18,080
Anyway... this is the first time I've seen you being considerate to someone.

370
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,100
I owe a debt to that woman.

371
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:37,340
I did as much as I could.

372
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:39,400
Vicious bastard.

373
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,600
Not you, your cousin.

374
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:50,590
That's why he makes so much money. People should be vicious like him.

375
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:53,290
My hyung endured a lot— No, no...

376
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:56,740
My cousin.

377
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:00,030
Then maybe he really doesn’t have feelings for her.

378
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:02,480
Anyway, thank you for today.

379
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:07,770
Maybe he doesn't love Da Hyeon as much as I thought.

380
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:09,910
I was mistaken.

381
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:13,440
But then... it would be neater in this way.

382
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,420
She can meet an even better person.

383
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:18,530
Anyway, I did everything I could.

384
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:22,220
So if you mention the contract or the kidnapping in the media,

385
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,260
you will be responsible for the consequences, Jeong Hyeon Jin.

386
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,700
My cousin is a really scary person.

387
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,540
Yes, yes. I know that too.

388
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:34,700
I also know that publicizing that kind of news is not good for Da Hyeon.

389
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:39,010
So I had no plans to actually reveal any of that information on the internet from the beginning.

390
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:42,980
Anyway, thank you. Good-bye.

391
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,780
Wait a minute.

392
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:48,130
So you were bluffing this entire time? How dare you?

393
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:51,380
On top of threatening me?

394
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,920
What do you mean threatening?

395
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,330
Let's just say I was just desperate.

Okay.

First,

we'll establish the infrastructure for the Canadian tourists.

404
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:08,390
We'll hire a coordinator who will customize the package for Canadians.
