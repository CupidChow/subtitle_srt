who make the other people around them change just by being next to them.

164
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,200
Just like my late wife.

165
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:08,200
Da Hyeon will be able to set that kid straight.

166
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:13,999
The CEO won't change easily.

167
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:16,300
He's changed quite a bit already.

168
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,800
He's the only one who doesn't know it.

169
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,199
What an idiot.

170
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,299
This is the first time I've ever received texts like these.

171
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,599
Those emoticons are for curse words.

172
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:55,700
It's not something to laugh about.

173
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,299
Where did you get this bouquet of flowers?

174
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,700
I'm pretty sure you didn't buy them for me.

175
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,599
It's not like you're lovable.

176
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,000
Then... did you get these from a guy, by any chance?

177
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,700
Why are you curious about that?

178
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,400
I'm sure you didn't go on a blind date.

179
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,700
So who could it have been, then?

180
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,200
It's not like you'd know, even if I told you.

181
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,799
Does that man know about me?

182
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:27,299
Do you explain your arrangement with me to every woman you're seeing?

183
00:12:30,599 --> 00:12:34,700
So... what you're saying is that you met a guy.

184
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,700
And not too long ago, at that.

185
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:44,299
You know, I do think there's something that I left out of the contract.

186
00:12:45,099 --> 00:12:47,299
Yeah.

187
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,900
Let's rewrite the contract.

188
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,599
What would you rewrite?

189
00:12:56,599 --> 00:12:59,000
No two-timing. No.

190
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,700
No putting on an innocent act only to stab me in the back later. No.

191
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,000
You will not see any other man besides me.

192
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,700
Who is a two-timer?

193
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,500
Define "see any other man."

194
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,900
Forget about a male friend.

195
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,400
Except your family,

196
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,599
keep your distance even from guys you may randomly encounter on the street.

197
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,450
Then... are you going to keep your distance from other women

198
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:24,500
except your family while you're dating me?

199
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,200
You don't really have to do that, though.

200
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:38,799
So you're not going to see women like Lee Su Jin, Gang Mi Ra, or Yeon Seo Hee anymore?

201
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,599
You should only believe one-tenth of what you read online.

202
00:13:46,599 --> 00:13:49,000
Which one of them were you actually dating, then?

203
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:54,099
Is it true that you have a kid, too?

204
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:56,099
I heard that you're having your kid raised in the States.

205
00:13:57,299 --> 00:14:00,400
Do you want to be sued for defamation and spreading of false rumors?

206
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,099
Well, fine, then. It's not like I'll be your kid's mom, anyway.

207
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:09,000
In exchange, you'd better keep your hands off me.

208
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,900
Don't grab my wrist without permission, or kiss—

209
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:16,599
Well, anyway, no physical contact!

210
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,500
Why are you laughing?

211
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,000
You've never dated a guy before, have you?

212
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,700
That's not true!

213
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,400
Then did you only ever date eunuchs?

214
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:32,099
You seem like you don't know things well.

215
00:14:32,099 --> 00:14:35,700
When a man and woman are dating, they hold hands, kiss, and sleep together.

216
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,000
That's what all dating couples do.

217
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,900
It's all perfectly natural among couples!

218
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,700
You've only dated playgirls?

219
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,000
You don't seem to know things well.

220
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,500
That's not what people do while they're dating.

221
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,700
That's what people do when they actually like one another!

222
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,599
So, what you're saying is...

223
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,500
you don't like me?

224
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,099
Of course not.

225
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,000
Fine.

226
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,700
Just keep being that way forever, then.

227
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,400
Don't you dare fall for me!

228
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,000
Things will get quite complicated if you do.

229
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,599
That's what I'm saying!

230
00:15:03,599 --> 00:15:05,000
Well, whatever.

231
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,099
We've met today, so let's count this as our official meeting for the week.

232
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,500
I don't think so.

233
00:15:11,099 --> 00:15:12,900
We have to meet more than once a week.

234
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,299
There is no limit on the frequency of our meetings.

235
00:15:14,299 --> 00:15:17,000
What's important is establishing and maintaining some regularity.

236
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,900
It's a bit stuffy in here. Let's get out of here first.

237
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:23,900
Hey, that's mine!

238
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,700
Hey! That's my bouquet! No! Stop it!

239
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,000
Why are you doing this?

240
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,599
Do other people know what a terrible person you are?

241
00:15:45,099 --> 00:15:46,099
Yeah.

242
00:15:46,099 --> 00:15:47,799
But I don't care.

243
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,400
Why a concert hall, of all places?

244
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,500
My hotel is a sponsor.

245
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,400
What now?

246
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,299
On top of classical music, you don't like theater either?

247
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:08,400
No. That's not it.

248
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,799
You've never dated a woman before, have you?

249
00:16:12,299 --> 00:16:13,299
What?

250
00:16:13,299 --> 00:16:15,500
Figures, since you still look like a normal person, despite everything,

251
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,299
you must've dated women.

252
00:16:17,299 --> 00:16:19,700
But you always got dumped, right?

253
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,299
Is that why you're so damaged?

254
00:16:22,299 --> 00:16:24,400
What kind of ridiculousness is that?

255
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,299
I've never been dumped by a woman in my life.

256
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:29,500
You probably got dumped without realizing it.

257
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,500
I can assure you,

258
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,599
those women didn't like you much.

259
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:35,099
They probably liked your title with Seong Hyeon Group, though.

260
00:16:35,099 --> 00:16:37,200
How are you so sure about that?

261
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,299
You're doing work while dating!

262
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:42,000
Who'd like a man like that?

263
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
This is something I have to do, anyway!

264
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,400
I'm killing two birds with one stone. And I'm saving time.

265
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,000
What a relief.

266
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,700
What?

267
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,400
You haven't fallen for me.

268
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,400
There isn't a single person on this planet

269
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,299
who tries to be frugal with their time while seeing someone they like.

270
00:16:59,299 --> 00:17:01,599
Usually, they go out of their way to make time.

271
00:17:03,099 --> 00:17:05,400
Well, fine. Keep being like that forever.

272
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,000
Don't you dare fall for me.

273
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,599
I'm sure that won't be an easy feat, though.

274
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:12,700
Why are you laughing?

275
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,500
Well, whatever. Let's go.

276
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,500
Wait, where?

277
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,700
We went to the concert last time like you wanted, so it's my turn to choose.

278
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,900
That's only fair. Come on.

279
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:29,000
I should've said hello to the stage director, at the very least!

280
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,599
You can go do it by yourself later.

281
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,700
How dare you hold my hand!

282
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,700
Wow.

283
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,700
Hello.

284
00:17:52,099 --> 00:17:54,500
What are you doing, not going up?

285
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,900
You... want to go in here?

286
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,799
I have to save time, after all. Killing two birds with one stone.

287
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,000
- This is what you really want?
- I told you, yes!

288
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,799
Are you a child? You're not 10 years old!

289
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,799
The kids that I teach are 10 years old.

290
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,599
Come on. Let's go.

291
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,000
You should really reconsider this.

292
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,200
Why? I feel like this will be fun.

293
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,000
You never did things like this when you were a child?

294
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,500
No, I didn't.

295
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,500
What did you do, then?

296
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,799
I took lessons in violin, cello, golf, swimming, ballet, and Spanish.

297
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:41,799
Wow, that's totally different from what I did growing up.

298
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:43,200
What did you do?

299
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,000
I played soccer, took piano lessons for two months,

300
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,599
watched cartoons, and played with paper dolls.

301
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,799
It's okay. It's my first time assembling a plastic model kit, too.

302
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:53,200
So then why did you—

303
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,599
The kids in my class will like it.

304
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,799
Buy me that, Mom! Buy me. I want it!

305
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,299
No. Let's go.

306
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:26,200
But I want it!

307
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,700
If you keep misbehaving, I'm just going to leave you here!

308
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:34,000
You want to live with the shopkeeper? And I'll get a new son?

309
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,200
But still! Buy it for me!

310
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,000
No!

311
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,599
- Come on!
- Hey! Let's go.

312
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:42,400
Hurry it up!

313
00:21:50,099 --> 00:21:52,799
What are you doing? Are you sleeping with your eyes open?

314
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,399
I'm not sleeping.

315
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,400
You're not sick, are you?

316
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,000
Or do you hate doing this that much?

317
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,599
Should we leave then?

318
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:04,599
No, it's fine.

319
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:07,899
Just keep working on this. I'll go buy some drinks.

320
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,199
He's such a weird guy.

321
00:22:23,699 --> 00:22:26,199
- Hurry up and buy it for me, Mom!
- Here.

322
00:22:26,199 --> 00:22:28,000
You're really not going to listen to your mom?

323
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,300
Come on! Buy it for me!

324
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,000
No!

325
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,500
Here, kid.

326
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,500
Make sure to listen to your mom, okay?

327
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,699
Thank you.

328
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:46,100
It looks like Jae In has another girl again.

329
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,000
You saw them, too?

330
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,800
Yes, I happened to see them.

331
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,000
How is it that he has a different girl on his arm so often?

332
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,500
It'd be even weirder for him to not have a girlfriend at his age.

333
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,700
It's not bad for him to do everything he wants

334
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,000
before going to work at the headquarters.

335
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,500
The headquarters?

336
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:05,600
Of course. Did you think Jae In would stay at that hotel forever then?

337
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,099
No matter what anyone says, Jae In is the eldest grandson of this household.

338
00:23:09,099 --> 00:23:10,599
I'm my father's child too.

339
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:12,400
My elder brother isn't my father's only child!

340
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,699
My Tae Ha is also a blood-lined grandson of my father, just like Jae In!

341
00:23:16,699 --> 00:23:18,200
Did I ever say otherwise?

342
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,800
What's important is his ability, anyway.

343
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:28,400
Sister-in-law, Jae In is clearly my elder brother's second son.

344
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,400
You two don't even share a single drop of blood, Sister-in-law.

345
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,799
He won't become your son just because you keep siding with him.

346
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:35,500
Young Sister-in-law!

347
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,900
Watch your words.

348
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,799
It won't benefit you in the slightest to get on my bad side.

349
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:43,299
I have SH Mall shares too, you know.

350
00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:45,799
Stop it, already! How annoying.

351
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,799
Why are you still here?

352
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:53,999
Were you planning to eat here before you left?

353
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,400
I'm sorry, Father-in-law.

354
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,899
As I told you before, Jae In is my son now.

355
00:24:09,899 --> 00:24:12,400
And he's also the grandson of the chairman of Dae Han Electric.
(TN: She is a daughter of Dae Han Electric's chairman.)

356
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,900
I'd like you to remember that.

357
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:20,599
Why does that punk take after you so much?

358
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:24,400
He might as well have been born from your belly if he is like that.

359
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,599
Don't worry.

360
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:28,800
That punk is ten times more devious than I am.

361
00:24:38,099 --> 00:24:41,800
Is a piece missing? Why doesn't it fit?

362
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,400
Here.

363
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:22,300
Did you know that kid you bought a plastic model set for?

364
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,100
No.

365
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,500
Then why...

366
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,500
Because his whining was so annoying.

367
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:33,099
When are you planning to leave? It's been over an hour already.

368
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,299
I think the instructions are wrong. Everything is rolling around!

369
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:45,700
Don't do this in front of kids.

370
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,800
Kids think that their teachers are good at everything.

371
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:08,700
Wow, it looks like you really have a knack for this!

372
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:13,000
Even kids can make these just fine. It's just Da Da who can't.

373
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,099
[Suitable for ages 10 and up]

374
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,700
Oh, it looks like a sudden downpour.

375
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,900
Looks that way.

376
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,199
It'll probably stop soon, right?

377
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,100
Here, a present.

378
00:27:23,199 --> 00:27:25,500
It's new, so try making this when you have some time.

379
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,699
Who knows? It might be fun.

380
00:27:27,699 --> 00:27:28,499
I'm busy.

381
00:27:28,499 --> 00:27:31,500
That's why, do it when you have time.

382
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,699
Oh, it's not stopping.

383
00:27:33,699 --> 00:27:35,999
Should we just make a run to the parking lot?

384
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,600
Just a second.

385
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:48,099
- Did you borrow that?
- Yeah.

386
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:49,099
You should've borrowed another one!

387
00:27:49,099 --> 00:27:51,200
What for?

388
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,999
Oh my!

389
00:27:55,340 --> 00:28:00,480
♫ Tomorrow will be the first day I met you ♫

390
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,080
♫ Today is the day I’m letting you go ♫

391
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,699
I heard that working on plastic model figures

392
00:28:08,699 --> 00:28:10,800
is good for concentration and creativity.

393
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,900
Does that mean you lack both concentration and creativity, Da Da?

394
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,699
You, really...

395
00:28:15,699 --> 00:28:20,700
Oh, you really are bad.

396
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,400
It'll just be your loss if you try to run off.

397
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,500
You're the one with bad concentration!

398
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,400
I'm creative, though, so it's okay if I lack concentration.

399
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,190
Oh, geez!

400
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:32,580
♫ It half-felt like a lie ♫

401
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:39,770
Oh my gosh! You surprised me! You should've told me that you were coming!

402
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:42,960
Why? Why are you surprised?

403
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,340
By... any chance...

404
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:51,520
What are you doing?

405
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,210
I'm looking for a man.

406
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:54,800
What? What are you looking for?

407
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,100
Apparently you have a man now.

408
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,950
Your mom loves it.

409
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,810
She said you couldn't live together until you get married even though you're so desperate.

410
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:08,960
She said she would shave your head if you did. She told me to stop by and see you, just in case.

411
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,680
Darn it. If only that stupid guy hadn't talked to her on the phone...

412
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:16,130
What? You actually have one?

413
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:20,980
Well, maybe?

414
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,210
Wow.

415
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:27,890
Just go.

416
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,130
This is Lee Jae In.

417
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:10,560
If you don't have anything special planned, come around for lunch.

418
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,950
I do have something special.

419
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:13,770
It's difficult for me to go.

420
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:18,200
And I don't think this phone was made for such purposes.

421
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,290
That's what I'm saying. Why do you make me use the red phone

422
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:23,470
just to ask my grandson to eat lunch with me?

423
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:25,430
You're not calling me over just for food.

424
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:30,420
Also, I'd like to decline your repeated suggestion that I come back to the main branch.

425
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:33,190
Think about your mother.

426
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:36,690
You shouldn't be the one to speak like that, Grandfather.

427
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:39,750
You're probably the person who made my mother cry the most.

428
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:42,710
And recently I've been very busy

429
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:47,380
with something important and serious. I've got to go.

430
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:52,620
He hung up on me first?

431
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:56,130
How dare he hang up on me first?

432
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:00,680
Lawyer Park.

433
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,650
Yes.

434
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:04,320
You're on Jae In's side, aren't you?

435
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:06,670
What do you mean?

436
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:10,720
It's like that. Team Leader Gang is a spy I planted at Jae In's company.

437
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,810
You're acting as a spy for Jae In here on your own.

438
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,630
Is he really seeing her?

439
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:19,730
Who?

440
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:22,550
Da Hyeon! Da Hyeon!

441
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:25,520
How is he getting ruder by the day?

442
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,380
What is that teacher doing? She should be teaching him!

443
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:31,080
Get out!

444
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:37,190
It's not even an apartment contract.

445
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:40,230
What the heck is a dating contract?

446
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:42,720
How creepy...

447
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,390
Seon Hyeong Group's Lee Jae—

448
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:48,940
Lee Jae In? That prince?

449
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:57,610
Da Hyeon, I think you should just move in and live together first.

450
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:01,380
You trip him up, you fall together, and just sleep with him.

451
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,560
You call yourself a friend?

452
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,780
All right, all right. Then just sleep.

453
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:09,450
But you have to use contraception, you know that, right?

454
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:11,250
You don't know?

455
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:15,050
Stop talking gibberish. If you tell Mom, you're dead.

456
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:18,920
Of course not. If she finds out, she'll faint. She will.

457
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:22,630
But how is he?

458
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:23,280
What?

459
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,900
You've probably kissed, right?

460
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,610
Is he good? Is it good? Is it amazing?

461
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:32,460
What? You actually kissed him?

462
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:36,540
You? Kissed? A man?

463
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:42,320
Wow. I really can't tell your mom.

464
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:50,050
So you're going to meet this rich heir born with a silver spoon in his mouth later tonight?

465
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:52,600
Luckily, the guy's very busy.

466
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,650
Where are the two of you meeting?

467
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:55,330
Gangnam?

468
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:56,850
Are you crazy?

469
00:32:56,850 --> 00:33:00,760
You would never find your way to Gangnam from Uijeongbu.

470
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:03,700
You can't even get the subway stations right with going back and forth.

471
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,750
You're so courageous. So courageous.

472
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:07,620
I know. So I'm just going to go as far as I can.

473
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,660
And I'll take a cab if I can't.

474
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:12,820
Oh, really? Good girl.

475
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,480
Eyes front.

476
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:19,810
♫ Open the South, South, South Gate ♫

477
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:21,050
♫ The gate is open ♫

478
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:22,060
Teacher!

479
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,280
Teacher!

480
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,900
Aigoo! My precious ones!

481
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,410
Hello!

482
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:31,850
- Hi!
