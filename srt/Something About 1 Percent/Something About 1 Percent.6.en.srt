00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,610
Did you contact the police?

11
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,600
Yes. They already start checking the security video, so the authenticity of the threat will be revealed soon.

12
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,240
As of now, they say it seems like a prank...

13
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,180
Like a prank? When I heard it's a bomb?

14
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,830
Is this such a light matter?

15
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:10,230
Check the manuals and secure the guest evacuation routes first.

16
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,890
But if we do that, the hotel will be damaged—

17
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,840
It'll be an even bigger problem if we don't do anything about it!

18
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,530
We should do everything we can first.

And if it doesn't work, we'll activate the emergency system.

- Yes, sir.

Reason?

174
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:37,620
The bomb was just a toy, but for us considering it was just a simple prank,

175
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,880
they put in too much prep work for this.

Right now, there is only one person that seems suspicious to me.

To be honest, the most suspicious person right now is you, Grandfather.

181
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:04,360
My hotel isn't huge, but it just emerged from a deficit.

182
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:09,490
And since this business makes some cash, you're just waiting for a chance to steal it back, aren't you?

183
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:12,500
And you're doing tons of snooping on someone else's hotel.

00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,750
Good job! Bye.

318
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,870
Bye.

319
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:59,380
Good job, bye!

320
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:03,660
Good job!

321
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:48,190
I’m glad you’re here. I have something to give you.

322
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:50,120
To me?

323
00:32:55,210 --> 00:33:00,800
I think your uncle is up to something. That’s what your maternal grandfather told me.

324
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,880
Grandfather noticed it too?

325
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,490
Of course he did. He has a sharp eye.

326
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:09,140
I heard you couldn't even sleep these days. Let's go.

327
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:12,410
There’s something I want to give you.

328
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:14,410
It’s a present.

329
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:19,910
A present? Do you know how to do such a thing?

330
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:23,690
I don’t know if you’ll like it, since I've never given you one before.

331
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:31,620
I’ll love anything if you’re the one giving it to me.

332
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,570
CEO? Lunch...

333
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:52,280
It’s fine. I’ll be getting off work soon.

334
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,190
Pardon?

335
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:57,560
It’s the weekend... Get off work early.

336
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:08,230
What? Did something happen?

337
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:10,290
He’s getting off work.

338
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:14,320
He told me to get off work early because it’s the weekend.

339
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,440
That workaholic... does this make sense?

340
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,170
If you don’t like it, should the two of us work?

341
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:23,530
I’d hate that even more, you know.

342
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,320
Going home early!

343
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,110
Secretary Gang. What a surprise to see you here!

344
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,680
Ah, yes.

345
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:43,830
I have something to say. Don't be so mean to me.

346
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:47,980
Three years ago... we weren't so bad together, were we?

347
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:51,370
What is it you want to say?

348
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:53,280
Here?

349
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:05,760
Let’s start over.

350
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:11,570
You don’t have any feelings for me. What kind of...

351
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:14,970
It doesn't matter. You don’t care about things like love either.

352
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:18,020
I would be of help to you.

353
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,660
Seong Hyeon Group and Han Jo Chemical—

354
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:24,160
As you said, I don’t care about things like love.

355
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,450
So it doesn't have to be you, Han Ju Hee.

356
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:30,920
I can find a replacement for a company the size of Han Jo Chemical any time.

357
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,840
I’m sure the chairman will like me.

358
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:36,370
He knows what's in his company's best interest.

359
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:39,390
Then you should meet my grandfather instead.

360
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:54,580
Sorry. I’m a little late, aren’t I?

361
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:58,160
Yes, you’re 15 minutes late.

362
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:02,200
It’s okay.

363
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:07,970
Are you free now?

364
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:12,010
I’m not free. I don’t have time but I’m making time.

365
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:19,100
A man... no matter how busy he is... will make time for the woman he likes.

366
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,010
Why are you smiling?

367
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:27,020
I'm thinking about what to do with the time you’re making.

368
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:30,270
What do you want to do?

369
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:32,630
Whose turn is it to decide?

370
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:36,250
- Is it mine?
- Mine?

371
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:48,250
Hyeon Jin!

372
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:51,490
Oh, Brother. What brings you here?

373
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:54,410
I came to see you. Why else would I come here?

374
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,400
How's business?

375
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,820
Can you buy some of these?

376
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:10,220
Hyeon Jin, the man Da Hyeon is dating, you know who he is, right?

377
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,650
That person is Lee Jae In, right? From Seong Hyeon Group?

378
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:20,740
Somehow I knew I saw him somewhere. Does Da Hyeon’s family know about this too?

379
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:24,550
Of course not, so you have to keep quiet too.

380
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:26,200
Why him of all people?

381
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,060
It's none of our business, right?

382
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:32,310
Anyway, don’t go talking about this anywhere. Otherwise they’ll worry.

383
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:35,020
I don’t have anyone to tell, okay?

384
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,760
I think it’s my turn.

385
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,430
Why? Last time you came and slept the whole time. Don't you remember?

386
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:51,240
That’s what I’m saying. That doesn't count. We didn’t even do anything.

387
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,520
So who told you to sleep then?

388
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,630
Let’s go to the hotel if there’s nothing you particularly want to do.

389
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:59,290
What else can you do there?

390
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:03,560
No, today is the start of a summer event. I’m curious about the guests' reactions.

391
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:07,820
Let’s go. There's even a fruit buffet in the Tower Lounge.

392
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,730
What?

393
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,430
Nothing.

394
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:15,630
Are you worried about something?

395
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:24,060
Jae In. What do you think is the most important thing in the world?

396
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,340
What?

397
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:28,580
Don't you have anything you consider important?

398
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:34,190
I do... money.

399
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:36,760
Money is number one.

400
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:40,370
Money? The most important thing is just money?

401
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:43,290
Why do you like money so much when you’re the third generation of a chaebol?

402
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:46,690
That’s not my money. It’s all my grandfather’s.

403
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:52,520
I don’t want to be the third generation of a chaebol. I want to form a chaebol myself.

404
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,710
Never mind.

405
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:57,270
I’m stupid to ask.

406
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:02,470
Jae In!

407
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:07,400
Are you okay? I’m sorry.

408
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,750
Are you okay?

409
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:13,430
Watch where you’re going, you punk. Aren't you hurt?

410
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:15,390
Let's get up.

411
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,850
Be careful from now on, okay?

412
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:31,810
What?

413
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,070
What do you mean?

414
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:38,690
You keep staring at me and following me around.

415
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,290
What are you doing?

416
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:53,590
It’s a stamp to praise you.

417
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,570
You did really well.

Well, it's not like you did anything to try to make me feel better. All you did was fall asleep.
