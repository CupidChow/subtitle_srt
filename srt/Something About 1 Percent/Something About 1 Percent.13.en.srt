You’re not okay.

00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,180
Your face is still pale.

76
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,090
It’s because I don’t have makeup on.

Today is the last day before the weekend so I can rest after today.

00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,160
CEO, you have a guest.

79
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,180
- Who?
- He said he is Jeong Seon Wu.

80
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:39,390
I think we have something to discuss.

81
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,700
Please keep this incident absolutely secret from Da Hyeon’s family.

82
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:49,790
Lee Jae In, I’m sure it will be completely secret if you end things with Da Hyeon.

83
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:59,650
Don’t make things harder for Da Hyeon.

84
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:03,400
You know better than anyone else that you two can’t get married anyway.

85
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,420
I don't think it's anything for you to be concerned about.

86
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:12,660
Do you know why Hyeon Jin and I care so much for Da Hyeon?

87
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:17,100
When Hyeon Jin was bullied for being a illegitimate child, Da Da was her only friend.

88
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,900
She couldn't ignore someone else's hardship or pain even when she was young.

89
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:26,170
She never went against anything adults told her to do and is really an angel.

90
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:31,220
She's never been suitable for a man like you, Lee Jae In.

91
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,820
Bad guys usually

92
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,340
need angels the most.

93
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,670
- Whatever they— Huh?
- Team Leader!

94
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:48,870
Is CEO inside?

95
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,550
Yes, he is.

96
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:58,130
Is something really wrong?

97
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,110
Later, okay?

98
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:03,280
This is really turning out to be difficult.

99
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,900
What are you going to do about Ju Hee?

100
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,450
What do you think I’ll do?

101
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:14,490
This wasn't just a joke. She really kidnapped someone, that someone being my woman.

102
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,350
How can I just let her go?

103
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:21,790
I'm going to get her back on top of all the pain and suffering.

104
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:28,400
Since you called me, you must want to take legal action... that would require a prosecutor's investigation.

105
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,060
It's going to cause quite a ruckus.

106
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,140
Who said I would take the legal route?

107
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,560
That sounds even scarier.

108
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:39,450
I also disagree with taking this through the legal system.

109
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,980
I'm Da Hyeon's brother.

110
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:44,140
She's family. No more different than my real sibling.

111
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,990
Family? Oh, please.

112
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,520
Women are at a disadvantage in kidnap cases.

113
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:54,280
Especially if she's involved with Lee Jae In or SH Mall people, even untrue stories will be developed and inflated.

114
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,630
If rumors spread needlessly, it will do her no good when she tries to get married later.

115
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,080
Then what should we do?

116
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,540
Go and tell Chairman Han to try to work something out.

117
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:16,420
And you, talk to your father to stop doing stupid things.

118
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:20,230
I will talk to him but I can't promise anything.

119
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:25,220
I'm giving him a chance because he's my uncle. If talking to him doesn't work, he's out of luck.

It still looks pale.

I'm sorry, Da Hyeon.

135
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,790
What? Does anything hurt? Do you want to go to the hospital?

136

No, no hospital.

137

Are we going to your house again?

140
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,930
I really want to go to my house.

141
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:21,340
Not yet, I'm worried about you being alone.

142

Still...

143
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:25,440
I'm not going to eat you.

144
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,340
Well... if you cry and hold on to me...

145
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,630
I will try my best.

146
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:47,840
Tell me if you need anything, I'll bring it over.

147

It's okay.

148
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:54,970
Other than that, what happened and why?

149
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:01,800
You don't think I really believe what happened was due to anemia, do you?

150
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,900
That was...

151
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:07,070
You should have given me a more creative excuse than I passed out due to anemia.

152
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:11,360
I'm warning you... don't you lie to me. I'm not stupid, you know.

153
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,430
Just this one time, can you act as if you are?

154
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:22,720
Ju Hee.

155
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,870
Han Ju Hee?

156
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,130
Don't create any false accusations.

157

Nothing more or less. Just in accordance with the law.

That's Da Hyeon's way.

160

My way is different.

161

00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,850
I will think about it.

164
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,690
No wonder you were so quiet.

165
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:03,170
Don't worry about me and go.

166
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,660
You'll stay here, right?

167
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,910
It's the weekend.

168
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:18,130
Just stay here... for my sake.

169
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:22,260
I was the one kidnapped here.

170
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,970
Why are you so scared?

171
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,520
Even though I don't look like it, I am very fearful.

172
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:32,070
Stay here, okay? I will be back soon.

173
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,350
I heard about it too.

174
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:46,950
Can't we take care of this with money?

175
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:49,700
I will compensate properly.

176
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,010
This case is a real crime.

177
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:54,850
I know, I know.

178
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:58,620
But what in this world can't be solved with money?

179
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,350
Lee Jae In.

180
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:07,880
I'll take care of that. Just don't contact the police.

181
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,860
If this blows up, it'll be bad for both of us. Don't you think so, Lawyer Park?

182
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:18,160
He's fine as long as we don't contact the police?

183
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,440
Okay, tell him we will do as he wants.

184
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:29,570
We found evidence that Han Ju Chemical bought SH Mall stock.

185
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,630
SH Affiliated Companies' Stock Fluctuation Status

186
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:36,630
So this is why SH Mall stock is going up and down like crazy.

187
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:40,460
Han Ju Chemical is buying SH Mall stock.

188
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,400
This is funny.

189
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,120
Can Han Ju Chemical normally afford to look at someone else's stuff like this?

190
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,130
No.

191
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:51,480
I'm getting curious where they got the money to do all this.

192
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,780
Don't you think we should take care of this through our group's central business department?

193
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,110
Of course.

194
00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:00,490
If we know about all this, the national prosecutors or the Financial Supervisory Service must know too.

195
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:04,980
They've probably started reviewing public notifications and analyzing the stock transactions already.

196
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:10,390
Even Seong Hyeon Group could be accused of stock price manipulation because of my uncle.

197
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:11,580
Then?

198
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:16,420
We need to cut the tail by filing an official complaint to the prosecutors from Seong Hyeon Group's headquarters.

199
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:21,280
Let's take that direction. Tell them we'll cooperate in any way we can.

200
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:30,300
I guess he hasn't killed these yet but has done well.

201
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,170
Welcome home.

202
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,550
Nothing happened, did it?

203
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:47,120
What could happen?

204
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,710
Have you eaten?

205
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,250
I was just about to make something.

206
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:55,860
But again, there's nothing in the fridge. Why do you have a fridge? Is it there for decoration?

207
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:00,150
That's why I stopped by at the market.

208
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:18,090
Do you really know how to cook?

209
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,870
I'm probably better at it than you.

210
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:22,860
When I was studying in America, I tried to cook at home a lot.

211
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,560
I couldn't just eat hamburgers everyday.

212
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:33,210
I should've cooked steak, right? You need to eat well.

213
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,760
You said I was anemic.

214
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,990
Yeah, that's why you need to eat well.

215

216

Do you feel stronger already?

217
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,440
It's tasty.

218
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,710
You can sleep here.

219
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,600

220
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,830
Last night, I was incoherent.

221
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:09,780
I... I'm still in shock so I don't think I can sleep without someone.

222
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:16,080
Will you drive me back, or should I take a cab?

223
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:22,890
I will sleep at the hotel so you can stay here.

224
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,890
You tried this last time.

225
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:28,810
It's for real this time, so rest up here.

226

You're the safest here.

227
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,360

228
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:20,450
Ho-Hold on.

229
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,690
Are you not going to come out?

230
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:38,750
Once you leave!

231

I'm not going to leave until you come out.

232
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:47,730
I went through a lot yesterday due to someone... Are you really going to keep acting like this?

233
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:50,890
Fine, I'm leaving then.

234
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:54,150
I'm really leaving! Make sure to lock the doors.

You wouldn't look at me because of her,

00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:54,400
- I'm really okay...
- Let's go.

474
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,840
♫ Should we make a natural promise? ♫

475
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:08,420
Jae In, did anything happen today?

476
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,670
Nothing worth mentioning.

477
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:12,050
What did you eat for dinner?

478
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:14,110
I ate Chinese food.

479
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:16,040
Really?

480
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:19,750
What time are you leaving tomorrow?

481
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:22,220
The same. I'm leaving around 6:30 a.m.

482
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,280
Do you want me to wake you up?

483
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,590
No. I'll probably wake up before you. I'll wake you up.

484
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:28,670
No, you don't need to.

485
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,100
Goodbye.

486
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:35,600
Shall we walk around one more time?

487
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:41,560
♫ Your smile, gesture ♫

488
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:46,230
♫ Emotions are coming to me. All right... ♫

489
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:50,330
I'll see you.

490
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,230
I have something to give you.

491
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,400
You should have given it to me earlier.

492
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:05,210
Good job today too.

493
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:28,030
♫ Let me collect all my prayers ♫

494
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:31,100
♫ And show them all ♫

495
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:34,490
♫ This world will fill up with your scent ♫

496
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:35,830
This is our last.

497
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:38,610
So we should do all the things we haven't done.

498
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:40,220
So that we will have fewer regrets later.

499
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,720
We really have different tastes.

500
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,900
It's okay if we have different tastes in music or something else.

501
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,700
We have done so well together until now.

502
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:51,700
Do you want to stay together today?

503
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:52,880
He is?

504
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,330
The condition of the contract with Da Hyeon was already reflected in the will.

505
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:59,790
Don't meet such a good woman.

506
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:02,080
Then I will feel bad for that woman.

507
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,960
Meet a good man.

508
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,880
In that way, I will feel less sorry.

509
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,810
