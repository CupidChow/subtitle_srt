00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:18,700
You are really a consistent person.

11
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,999
First, a classical music concert and now an art gallery.

12
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:24,900
Doesn't the hotel sponsor any dance performances?

13
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:25,999
This isn't related to my hotel work.

14
00:01:25,999 --> 00:01:27,000
Why are we here then?

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,999
It's because someone I know is exhibiting a drawing.

16
00:01:29,999 --> 00:01:32,699
Someone you know?

17
00:01:32,699 --> 00:01:36,030
My aunt's husband.

18
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,400
If it's your aunt's husband...

19
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,000
That's your uncle.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,799
How can your uncle just be someone you know? He's your family.

21
00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:51,300
- Hey!
- Good to see you, buddy.

22
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,200
How are you doing?

23
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,699
Nice to meet you.

24
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:58,100
Congratulations. Your paintings are wonderful.

25
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:03,199
Thanks, sonny. Your mother couldn't come, but she really misses you.

26
00:02:03,199 --> 00:02:04,100
You know that, right?

27
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,500
Yeah, I know.

28
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,300
Okay. You two have fun.

29
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,000
- See you later.
- See you later.

30
00:02:17,499 --> 00:02:18,999
- Just a moment.
- Sure.

31
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:27,999
It would've been nice for you to tell me ahead of time.

32
00:02:27,999 --> 00:02:31,200
I told you. He's my aunt's husband.

33
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,999
We need to get the name right. It's not like he's my uncle.

34
00:02:34,999 --> 00:02:37,299
That may be true, but...

35
00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:44,100
Then... did your aunt get remarried?

36
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,800
But... it seemed like he said your mother earlier... it's strange.

37
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:56,200
Oh, Oppa Seon Wu! What brings you here?

38
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,700
I want to ask you what you're doing here.

39
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,800
I brought her here.

40
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,100
Who's this?

41
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:06,200
Oh, this is Hyeon Jin's older brother.

42
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,800
My younger sister is Da Da's best friend.

43
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,299
And we're more than just acquaintances, aren't we?

44
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:17,999
No way. If you had any kind of special relationship, Da Hyeon would've told me about you before.

45
00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:23,400
Oh, and I don't acknowledge my girlfriend's other guys.

46
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,900
It seems like you just started dating.

47
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,500
And with her personality, I doubt that Da Hyeon fell for you first.

48
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,000
Does time matter between a man and a woman?

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,999
And is love only the kind where you fall in love at first sight?

50
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:38,400
Not for me.

51
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,700
Da Hyeon and I have already started.

52
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,000
What are you talking about love... No, it's not.

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,300
Well, excuse us..

54
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,100
- I'll call you later!
- Okay.

55
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,300
I told you last time.

56
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,300
No other men allowed.

57
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,300
He's not "another man."

58
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,699
He's just my friend's brother.

59
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:05,600
Whether it's your friend's brother or your brother's friend, I won't allow it.

60
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,400
Forget they exist.

61
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,200
Excuse me, this isn't something that you allow or not.

62
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,000
I've known him for over ten years! How can I just pretend I don't know him?

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,899
You've seen him for ten years?

64
00:04:14,899 --> 00:04:17,699
Well, then it's time for you to stop seeing him.

65
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:20,199
That's ridiculous.

66
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,899
So you're going to keep seeing him?

67
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:25,800
Why... why are you acting like this?

68
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,800
You do know that's a breach of our contract, right?

69
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,600
How is that a breach of contract? I told you he's an oppa I've known for a while!

70
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,700
Stop calling him "oppa"!
(Literally "older brother," but often used for boyfriends/romantic interests)

71
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,800
Let's refer to people properly!

72
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,200
Then, Oppa Seon Wu—

73
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:43,300
All right, all right.

74
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,799
I'll think about it again.

75
00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:50,099
- Geez, you're the king of the devils!
- King of the devils?

76
00:04:50,099 --> 00:04:51,299
Who are you talking about here?

77
00:04:51,299 --> 00:04:53,399
Just someone.

78
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,200
What a nasty temper.

79
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,799
Fasten your seat belt!

80
00:05:21,099 --> 00:05:23,499
Daddy, where's Jae In?

81
00:05:23,499 --> 00:05:25,200
He just left.

82
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:31,700
Hmm, yeah. Absolutely.

83
00:05:55,499 --> 00:05:57,600
Oh, Director Min. It's been a while.

84
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,600
Yes, Chairman Han.

85
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,600
You're still single, right?

86
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,299
How about taking this opportunity to become my son-in-law? Hmm?

87
00:06:04,299 --> 00:06:06,599
We'd love to.

88
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:08,500
Have a safe trip home, sir.

89
00:06:15,799 --> 00:06:18,400
What brought Chairman Han here?

90
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,200
Well, nothing much.

91
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,699
So did you find out who Jae In is dating?

92
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:27,400
No. And seeing how the Group stopped the media from publishing about them,

93
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,900
she's definitely no ordinary woman.

94
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,099
So headquarters stopped the media, eh?

95
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:37,600
Interesting. This means that the chairman knows about it, too.

96
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,900
Have someone tail them.

97
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,400
We'll have to find out who she is to figure out how to deal with this situation.

98
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,800
Yes.

99
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:02,200
So is the person named Hyeon Jin your best friend?

100
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,200
Yes. She's been my friend since middle school.

101
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,399
And she lived next door?

102
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:08,000
Up until college.

103
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,500
Oppa Seon W—

104
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,899
Ah, what do you want me to call him, then? That's his name!

105
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:16,900
It's not like his name is John Doe! I can't even refer to him as "oppa"?

106
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,800
Just don't see him!

107
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,190
Then you won't have any chance to call his name.

108
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,299
Aw...

109
00:07:24,299 --> 00:07:26,200
Aw?

110
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,760
- Oh, Teacher!
- Hello.

111
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,199
What's going on?

112
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,900
The apartment in the next building got robbed clean!

113
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,399
You should be careful too, Teacher!

114
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:54,599
Oh, you have such a reliable boyfriend so you won't have to worry.

115
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,100
Boyfriend?

116
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:57,800
Let's go up.

117
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,000
Huh?

118
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,200
Why did you come all the way up here?

119
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,500
I didn't even invite you.

120
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,499
Don't worry. I don't like ramen anyway.

121
00:08:13,499 --> 00:08:16,000
What the... I have to go down again?

122
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,799
The building structure is unique.

123
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,399
Is there a stairway that goes up this way?

124
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:22,999
No.

125
00:08:29,499 --> 00:08:32,300
What about your keys? Do you lock your door properly?

126
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,100
What?

127
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,700
Well, yes.

128
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,799
At least you're doing something right.

129
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:41,799
What about the inside? Is there a lock inside, too?

130
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,400
What's this?

131
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,100
Your keys.

132
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,900
Take them out and open the door.

133
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,100
Wait.

134
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,100
I won't touch you.

135
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:39,200
You'll need to install some bars on your window.

136
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,300
I was actually thinking about that, but it'll make me feel like I'm in jail.

137
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,500
That's better than having something bad happen.

138
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,599
They won't be able to come in through the back side.

139
00:09:57,599 --> 00:10:00,400
They could climb up the gas pipe and come in.

140
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,300
You're... not going to leave?

141
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,899
I will.

142
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,699
Um, what are you doing?

143
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,700
Kissing you.

144
00:11:02,099 --> 00:11:03,900
Aren't you leaving?

145
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:07,299
Make sure to lock all the doors properly after I leave.

146
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:10,599
And call me if anything happens.

147
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,299
And take these weird things down from your walls.

148
00:11:20,099 --> 00:11:21,700
Aren't you going to lock your door?

149
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,299
Good job, Kim Da Da.

150
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,000
Good job.

151
00:11:58,299 --> 00:11:59,600
Yeah.

152
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,200
Right now?

153
00:12:03,699 --> 00:12:05,199
Okay.

154
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:09,299
What do you want?

155
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,300
The chairman asked me if you put me there to work as your spy.

156
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:21,800
He's doing the same thing. That's why he put Team Leader Gang next to me.

157
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,500
So you noticed it, huh?

158
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,300
You think I'm stupid? How could I not know?

159
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:29,999
Why would Secretary Gang get demoted all of a sudden when he was working fine?

160
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:33,900
So I have something to tell you.

161
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:37,600
Stop showing up at hotel-sponsored events.

162
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,600
Did he say something?

163
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,000
Of course!

164
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,599
Geez, just hearing about it, I felt you were so pathetic.

165
00:12:42,599 --> 00:12:44,699
You brought her to the classical music concert, and the art gallery.

166
00:12:44,699 --> 00:12:48,600
Geez. Just date like everyone else does.

167
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,400
I am dating like anyone else, though.

168
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,300
What you're doing isn't dating but just working.

169
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,900
There isn't a single person on this planet who tries to be frugal with their time while seeing someone they like.

170
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,700
Usually, they go out of their way to make time.

171
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,799
Well, fine. Keep being like that forever.

172
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:08,699
Don't you dare fall for me.

173
00:13:08,699 --> 00:13:11,100
I'm sure that won't be an easy feat, though.

174
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,500
There are tons of things a man and woman are supposed to do when dating.

175
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,399
Are you telling me to sleep with her?

176
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:19,299
It's a bit too soon for that, though.

177
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,000
It'll take some time to seduce Da Hyeon.

178
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,300
Hey, no! Not sleeping with her! I'm talking strictly about dating!

179
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,800
What's the difference?

180
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,400
Geez. Have you two even seen a movie together?

181
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,399
I'm not expecting you to take her to an amusement park, with your temper.

182
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:33,599
Do you even text her at night?

183
00:13:33,599 --> 00:13:35,100
What about flowers? Have you bought her any?

184
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,000
Have you two ever held hands while walking together?

185
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,500
Goodness gracious.

186
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,300
This is what dating is, you dolt.

187
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,699
What have you even been doing until now?

188
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:46,400
Seriously. How pathetic.

189
00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:14,899
I'm not expecting you to take her to an amusement park, with your temper.

190
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:16,899
Do you even text her at night?

191
00:14:35,299 --> 00:14:37,100
Is that you, Ji Su?

192
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,000
Which problems don't you know how to solve?
[GED Exam Prep - Actual Tests for 3 Years]

193
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:52,699
The person you are trying to reach is on the phone with someone else at this time.

194
00:14:52,699 --> 00:14:55,000
You will be connected to their voice mailbox.

195
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,299
Who could she possibly be talking to at this hour?

196
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,399
Yeah, study hard since you have time now.

197
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,999
And call me again if there's anything you don't know.

198
00:15:04,999 --> 00:15:07,299
Next Saturday?

199
00:15:07,299 --> 00:15:09,599
How about in the morning, just for a short bit?

200
00:15:09,599 --> 00:15:12,200
Sure. Okay.

201
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,899
Okay.

202
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,200
Yes, what is it, Ji Su?

203
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,599
Ji Su?

204
00:15:22,599 --> 00:15:25,000
Ah... oh. Mr. Jae In.

205
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,799
Wait, so... you've been talking to that pipsqueak this whole time?

206
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:29,800
At this hour?

207
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,500
Well... Ji Su is—

208
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,700
I don't care if it's Ji Su or Park Su!

209
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,100
You aren't dating that kid, are you?

210
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:37,900
Are you two going out?

211
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,599
What are you saying? Who would date a 21-year-old?

212
00:15:41,599 --> 00:15:43,300
That's dangerous to say, you know!

213
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,500
I'm just his fan club's president.

214
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,300
I can't have my Ji Su get swept up in an unnecessary scandal!

215
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,400
But, um, why are you calling at this hour?

216
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,699
I wanted to try dating like other people do.

217
00:15:58,699 --> 00:16:00,300
Pardon?

218
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,000
Like I said before,

219
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,300
you're not allowed to have any other guys.

220
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,800
I don't care if you're his fan club's president, or president's fan club.

221
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,200
or if he's your friend's brother or brother's friend.

222
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,600
None of them are okay.

223
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:16,199
Do other people date with these kinds of restrictions, too?

224
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:20,600
I don't know. It's my first time talking on the phone this late.

225
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,699
Let's see a movie later.

226
00:16:28,699 --> 00:16:32,199
How come your hotel hosts cultural events so often?

227
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,299
They're not hosted by us.

228
00:16:34,299 --> 00:16:36,000
Then what?

229
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,900
Oh, is there an actor in your family? Or a director?

230
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,699
No, it's completely unrelated to me! I just want to see a movie, that's all!

231
00:16:43,699 --> 00:16:45,799
Just any movie!

232
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,199
Did you lock all your doors?

233
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:51,599
Yes.

234
00:16:58,499 --> 00:17:01,200
Um, just... just a second.

235
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,499
- Why?
- I hear something outside.

236
00:17:03,499 --> 00:17:05,399
I think someone's trying to open the door!

237
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,700
Stay right there. I'll be right over.

238
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,100
Wait, no. Call the cops first.

239
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,600
Da Da! Da Da! Open the door!

240
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,200
- Oh, it's Hyeon Jin.
- Da Da!

241
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,100
- Open the door!
- Just a sec!

242
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,100
See you next week, Mr. Jae In. Bye.

243
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,100
Hello?

244
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,000
What was that?

245
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:29,400
So it's Hyeon Jin? Why is it that family again?

246
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,999
What's with everyone in that family?

247
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,400
Man, I'm wide awake now.

248
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,399
Hey, I almost pooped my pants!

249
00:17:44,399 --> 00:17:45,900
Why were you talking on the phone for so long?

250
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,600
And why did you use the second lock on your door?

251
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,500
I heard an apartment in the next building got broken into, that's why.

252
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,699
Really?

253
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,900
But why are you back here, instead of being at your own place?

254
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,899
Did you fight with your mom again?

255
00:17:56,899 --> 00:17:59,600
Man, I seriously feel like I'm going to die.

256
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,600
It's hard being the daughter of nouveau-riche parents.

257
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:06,700
But who were you on the phone with?

258
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,900
Was it that Ji Su again?

259
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:11,700
Geez. Date him, why don't you? Please do, already!

260
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:17,200
That kid is merely a student! A student! And you're a teacher!

261
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,100
It's not like that.

262
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,000
Also, hey! Sleep on the floor!

263
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,500
No thanks, no thanks!

264
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,600
Hey, sleep on the floor.

265
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,700
It wasn't Ji Su? Who was it, then?

266
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,900
Did your mom call again?

267
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,800
No!

268
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,900
I'm dating, remember?

269
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:37,600
Ooh! Ooh!

270
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,599
Oh, so you're dating, Miss? Ooh la la!

271
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:41,699
Hey! Stop it!

272
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,699
Oppa Seon Wu told me that guy was no joke.

273
00:18:58,999 --> 00:19:04,800
Oh yeah. Oppa— wait, no, no. Seon Wu—

274
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:10,300
Man, what am I supposed to call him now? Geez!

275
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:13,699
Anyway, tell your brother to keep his mouth shut.

276
00:19:13,699 --> 00:19:17,299
Why? You were just telling me you're dating!

277
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:21,500
By the way... you really don't have any feelings for my brother?

278
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,899
No thanks.

279
00:19:22,899 --> 00:19:24,700
You used to have the biggest crush on him, though!

280
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:29,799
That was ten years ago, when I didn't know he was a player.

281
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:31,999
Well, yeah. There's no doubting that he's a player.

282
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:35,000
- How did he end up becoming a doctor?
- Sleepy time!

283
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,999
Who the heck did he seduce?

284
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,800
This is strange, no matter how much I think about it.

285
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,499
I'm talking about Father! Isn't he acting strange?

286
00:19:50,499 --> 00:19:54,900
Why is he so quiet, when he knows that Jae In has a girlfriend?

287
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,499
He didn't even say anything last time when I went to Pyeongchang-dong.

288
00:19:58,499 --> 00:20:01,300
Well, maybe he thinks it's not a big deal.

289
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,900
There's no way!

290
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,399
He even rejected Chairman Han's daughter and left home.

291
00:20:07,399 --> 00:20:10,400
If my father heard he's dating some mystery girl,

292
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,400
would he stay quiet like this with his character?

293
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,380
♫ We keep growing apart ♫

294
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,890
♫ You keep trying to leave me like this ♫

295
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:27,250
♫ I just want you to turn back however I can ♫

296
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,050
♫ Yeah ♫

297
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:31,560
♫ What did you say? Please say something ♫

298
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:35,470
♫ You can even curse at me ♫

299
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,900
Wow, Ji Su! You were awesome!

300
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,500
We have to hurry and find you a new agency!

301
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,500
The attorney told me not to worry about that.

302
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,800
He said we wouldn't have to take legal action and he's looking for an agency for me.

303
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:51,499
Oh yeah. I'm going to an audition next week!

304
00:20:51,499 --> 00:20:53,200
Really?

305
00:20:55,799 --> 00:21:01,500
Oh... oh my. I shouldn't do this to our precious Ji Su.

306
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,200
Oh my!

307
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,699
Thank you, Teacher. This is all thanks to you.

308
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,000
I'm sure everything will work out fine.

309
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,299
You're not allowed to have any other guys.

310
00:21:14,299 --> 00:21:16,600
I don't care if you're his fan club's president, or president's fan club.

311
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,100
Oh.

312
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,600
No, I didn't do anything. It's all because you're so good.

313
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,399
And that guy did a great job, too.

314
00:21:24,399 --> 00:21:26,300
"That guy?"

315
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,400
Oh, you mean the attorney?

316
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,500
No. There's someone else. A real psychopath, devil king.

317
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,700
Oh. I'm supposed to see him later.

318
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,000
You're amazing.

319
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,599
You're so good. Really!

320
00:21:47,299 --> 00:21:48,199
What is it now?

321
00:21:48,199 --> 00:21:49,800
Geez, what a greeting.

322
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,299
And yet you never hesitate to burst in when you need something.

323
00:21:52,299 --> 00:21:53,600
Let's head out and have lunch.

324
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,499
I managed to spare some of my precious time for you, you know!

325
00:21:55,499 --> 00:21:58,800
It's too bad, since you're sparing me some of your precious time.

326
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,199
But I actually have a prior engagement.

327
00:22:00,199 --> 00:22:03,900
Oh-ho. Is it business or personal?

328
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,300
Both.

329
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,200
Look at you, you're dating like that again!

330
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,800
This is why the chairman says he feels like he's been scammed!

331
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,099
What are you talking about?

332
00:22:12,099 --> 00:22:13,700
- Well anyway, let's head out.
- Sure.

333
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,400
Geez.

334
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,499
"Scammed?"

335
00:22:17,499 --> 00:22:20,000
It's because you're making no progress at all.

336
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,399
How do you know that?

337
00:22:21,399 --> 00:22:23,600
It's so obvious even if I didn't see it.

338
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,800
The chairman is really curious about how you two are dating.

339
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,200
We're doing it just like everyone else.

340
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,200
No, no. Other people don't date the way you two do.

341
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,799
So, what kind of woman is she?

342
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:35,500
Why don't you follow me if you're so curious?

343
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,700
Sure.

344
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,400
Excuse me. Thank you.

345
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,699
But still, doesn't it feel different now that you've started dating?

346
00:22:43,699 --> 00:22:44,900
Do you feel she's more special to you?

347
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:48,399
It's not different at all. She is just ordinary.

348
00:22:48,399 --> 00:22:51,600
You definitely speak more generously of her than before, though.

349
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,600
At this rate, are you going to get bitten by the love bug?

350
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,599
Don't glare at me. That glare is the scariest thing in the world for me.

351
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,300
I mean, you've been seeing her quite a bit.

352
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:05,199
You really don't feel any special way toward her? No?

353
00:23:05,199 --> 00:23:07,499
She's just "not bad." That's all.

354
00:23:07,499 --> 00:23:09,600
She's definitely a teacher, through and through!

355
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,700
She's inexplicably tacky sometimes, so stuffy, and old-fashioned.

356
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,800
But she has tons of guys around her, though!

357
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,500
I think she's definitely a bit of a player in that way.

358
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,499
That's all there. There's nothing else worth saying about her.

359
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,700
What?

360
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,700
"Not bad?" "Ordinary?" "Old-fashioned?" "Tacky?"

361
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,000
Insufferable brat.

362
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,500
I'll show you what a real fox looks like.

363
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,700
You're dead meat.

364
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,599
Oh, look who it is! CEO Lee!

365
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:57,300
- Have you been well?
- How are you, sir?

366
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,800
- Is the chairman doing well?
- Yes. Thanks to you, he's fine, sir.

367
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,400
Ah. Let's run into each other again sometime, then.

368
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,499
- Yes, yes.
- Let's do that, yes.

369
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,800
You know, this is the first time you've ever talked about a woman this much.

370
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,299
I guess you don't completely hate her.

371
00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:21,800
No. I don't hate her.

372
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,499
Really? Which part?

373
00:24:25,499 --> 00:24:28,900
She's the same as she was when I met her the first time.

374
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,900
And I feel like she'll still be the same in 10 years.

375
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,700
That's what I like about her.

376
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:40,099
She's just "not bad."

377
00:24:40,099 --> 00:24:41,400
She's a teacher, through and through.

378
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:46,799
She's inexplicably tacky sometimes, so stuffy, and old-fashioned.

379
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,600
Valued Customer!

380
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,900
Oh, you've come to the perfect place.

381
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,900
Please come this way.

382
00:25:16,499 --> 00:25:18,499
Look. Super sexy, right?

383
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:24,500
No, no. That's the back. There you go.

384
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,600
Looks great.

385
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,200
Go and try it on.

386
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:35,000
Wow, she's late.

387
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,699
Yeah. She's never been late before.

388
00:25:37,699 --> 00:25:39,100
Are you worried?

389
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:42,800
No. She's bad with directions. I bet she's just lost again.

390
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,799
She's stubborn though, so she never admits that she has no sense of direction.

391
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,400
I don't think I'll be able to see her today.

392
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,000
Wow.

393
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,400
Amazing.

394
00:26:05,499 --> 00:26:06,700
I've kept you waiting for a long, haven't I?

395
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,399
What is this?

396
00:26:12,499 --> 00:26:13,410
It's okay.

397
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:15,250
I'm not okay.

398
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,870
No.

399
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:25,310
Are you crazy? Why are you dressed like this?

400
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,940
Why are you here dressed like this?

401
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:31,020
Because we promised I would be here. And what's wrong with this? Is it weird?

402
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:31,990
Yes! You look weird from head to toe!

403
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,900
No. You don't look weird. You look stunning!

404
00:26:39,499 --> 00:26:40,699
Why?

405
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:42,099
Why didn't you just come out in your birthday suit, while you're at it?

406
00:26:42,099 --> 00:26:43,900
This is actually pretty plain.

407
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:47,199
Actually, I've been dressing a bit old-fashioned.

408
00:26:47,199 --> 00:26:49,600
Orange juice, please.

409
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,199
I liked what you wore before much better.

410
00:26:51,199 --> 00:26:54,200
This, this! Is this outfit appropriate for a teacher?

411
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,500
I'm not working today, though.

412
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,490
Stop it. You're making Miss Da Hyeon feel awkward.

413
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:02,699
We've met before, right?

414
00:27:02,699 --> 00:27:04,840
But you've gotten a lot more beautiful since we first met.

415
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,670
Thank you. You're as fashionable as ever, too.

416
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,620
Thank you.

417
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:14,480
You must receive skincare treatment.

418
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,120
Find out what changes the chairman made to his will.

419
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,580
You figure it out!

420
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:25,450
So who's the girl that Jae In's seeing, again?

421
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:28,090
I heard she's a schoolteacher, but there's nothing about her anywhere.

422
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:29,450
She's really as plain as they come.

423
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:33,200
How did you find that out? They stopped attending official events together.

424
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,640
By chance. I confirmed that the two of them are dating.

425
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,600
Keep looking into it. There's definitely something going on.

426
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,330
Otherwise, there's no other reason that Jae In would be dating this girl.

427
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:48,030
I've got someone tailing them.

428
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:50,740
Good job.

429
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,380
You're not dating anyone?

430
00:27:56,950 --> 00:28:00,170
This place is more important for now.

431
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:01,770
Good thinking.

432
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:03,820
Don't go around dating useless women.

433
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:07,200
I'm looking into getting you a wife, anyways.

434
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,420
Hey, aren't you leaving? I thought you said you had other plans.

435
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:15,390
No, it's okay. I'm already late anyway.

436
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,430
Excuse me.

437
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,180
Wear this.

438
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,090
It's hot. Why would I wear a jacket inside?

439
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:38,120
You think I'm giving you my jacket because I'm afraid you'll get cold?

440
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,680
People are side-eyeing you!

441
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:43,720
Who's side-eyeing? They're just looking at me, that's it.

442
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,960
Just wear it!

443
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,040
I don't want to! It doesn't go with my dress.

444
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,830
Who cares if it doesn't go with your dress? Just wear it!

445
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,480
I told you, I don't want to.

446
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,340
Wear it! If you don't, I won't stand for it.

447
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:14,220
I have another meeting to get too, so I'll get going.

448
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,370
Where are you going dressed like that?

449
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:19,850
Don't tell me you're going to see your friend's brother or brother's friend, or whoever.

450
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:22,580
No, I'm going to see my friend, Hyeon Jin.

451
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,040
Just keep it on. It's fine.

452
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:25,850
No, thanks.

453
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:28,610
So where the heck are you going?

454
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,130
Wow, she's really sexy.

455
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:40,210
Hey, I told you she's not a sexy type.

456
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:43,100
She's just plain and old-fashioned—

457
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,920
Oh, damn it all.

458
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,920
I'll be heading out first.

459
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,640
Hey!

460
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,050
What about me?

461
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:07,230
Chairman, it looks like he's doing a fine job dating her.

462
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,920
What do you want now?

463
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,450
Why are you walking so fast?

464
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:31,320
You must have something to say to me.

465
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,190
No?

466
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:37,330
It's not me, but you, Jae In, who has something to say to me, right?

467
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,400
After secretly eavesdropping,

468
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,360
making it obvious like this right away is a lowly thing to do.

469
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,730
It's because I am not a professional at it.

470
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:50,950
And because I am uncultured.

471
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:55,850
I can't be ashamed of myself in front of your friends when we're dating.

472
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:59,270
I will take care of the shame,

473
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:01,610
so don't dress like this ever again.

474
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:05,120
Then don't ever speak ill of me behind my back.

475
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,680
I didn't.

476
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,300
If that wasn't speaking ill of me, then what would be?

477
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,760
You didn't hear it to the end.

478
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:15,380
What... did you say?

479
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:37,300
Don't ever recommend those kinds of clothes to Da Da again.

480
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:41,210
Why not? She looked a bit sexy and it suited her well in its own way.

481
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:44,470
First, it does not fit her at all. And I do not like it.

482
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:47,650
Excuse me. Aren't you being a bit too conservative?

483
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:52,300
That style is very trendy these days. So it's super popular in our shop.

484
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,610
Really, everyone wears stuff like that.

485
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:59,030
I don't know about other women, but anyway, Da Da can't dress like that.

486
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:03,300
See? This looks much better. Even when you see it yourself, it suits you well, right?

487
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,080
The other one was all right too.

488
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,420
It was not all right at all.

489
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,020
Ah, purse.

490
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,360
How close are you guys?

491
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,540
What should I do with Oppa Seon Wu?

492
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:22,290
He's really one step behind.

493
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:30,210
The woman Jae In is seeing lately, what kind of girl is she?

494
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:32,340
She has nothing.

495
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,160
And she is socially no help for Jae In either.

496
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,670
Then why?

497
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:44,570
By chance, could you be blocking Jae In from joining the company?

498
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:48,080
If you are, Father-in-law, I will not stay quiet.

499
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,450
Do you think he'd be dating her if he didn't like her?

500
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:55,980
He is not someone who gives his heart to anyone easily, or will marry anyone.

501
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:59,390
Don't you remember he rejected Han Jo Chemical's Chairman's daughter three years ago?

502
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:01,200
Then why?

503
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,350
Because that girl has something.

504
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:10,630
Perhaps she might make Jae In come back home.

505
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:14,030
If that happens, then it's not a bad deal.

506
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:25,950
You didn't hear it to the end.

507
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,820
What... did you say?

508
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:36,490
I like you, Da Da, because you're just ordinary.

509
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:39,970
And I like you being moderately uncultured.

510
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:43,470
I don't know what other people think, but that's how I feel.

511
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:47,880
But I'm right about one thing.

512
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,080
You are a fox. You know that?

513
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,520
You are very sly.

514
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:59,230
Thanks, but that’s your preference as well, isn't it?

515
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:05,270
You are right, but still don't go around with little clothes on.

516
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:09,310
I thought my heart was going to drop.

517
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:17,460
Are you so happy because that chicken tastes good,

518
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,080
or because you like him?

519
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,270
Obviously, it's the chicken.

520
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:25,960
You think I would betray chicken?

521
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:31,000
I don't know about chicken, but I feel betrayed.

522
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,060
How could you...

523
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,690
How could you ditch me and date? Huh?

524
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:38,030
- You traitor.
- Hey.

525
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:40,960
Well, you ditched me several times and dated.

526
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,240
Also, this is all fake. Well, even though we are dating.

527
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:48,950
Yes, yes. Let's leave it at that.

528
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,630
Why? Why? Why?

529
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:02,320
I can't become enemies with your boyfriend. I should apologize.

530
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,600
No.

531
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:07,080
Stay still. Wait.

532
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,020
Unknown
Picture

533
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,810
It’s Jeong Hyeon Jin.

534
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:23,570
Here's a little something as my apology.

535
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:28,080
But still, when you're looking at it alone, you like these clothes better, right?

536
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:33,410
Today at seven, let's eat dinner and go watch a movie.

537
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:35,910
Wear some uncultured clothes.

538
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,680
How am I supposed to dress to look uncultured?

539
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,070
CEO?

540
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,730
He's inside.

541
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,150
CEO, something big happened.

542
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:50,910
What is it?

543
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:53,050
First please come to the control room.

544
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:56,150
Follow along.

545
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,930
Did you contact the police?

546
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:07,210
Yes. They already start checking the security video, so the authenticity of the threat will be revealed soon.

547
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:09,780
As of now, they say it seems like a joke...

548
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:12,620
Like a joke? When I heard it's a bomb?

549
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:15,210
Is this such a light matter?

550
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:18,780
Check the manuals and secure the guest evacuation routes first.

551
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,070
But if we do that, the hotel will be damaged—

552
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:23,330
It'll be an even bigger problem if we don't do anything about it!

553
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:29,320
We should do everything we can first, and if it doesn't work, we'll activate the emergency system.

554
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:32,500
But Mr. Robinson is waiting for you right now.

555
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,150
Should I just cancel the meeting?

556
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,860
We'll just do it.

557
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:39,290
Instead, we'll keep it brief.

558
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,440
- We'll go to the dining hall right now.
- Yes, sir.

559
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,420
If this isn't resolved within an hour, make sure you evacuate all the guests without fail.

560
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,390
Yes, CEO.

561
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,350
Thank you so much, we appreciate your time.

562
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:54,220
My pleasure.

563
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:56,420
And I'm very much looking forward to doing business with you in the future.

564
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:59,550
- Yes.
- Thank you so much.

565
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,030
- Hi, Mr. Robinson.
- Thank you.

566
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:03,250
Thank you, thank you very much for your time.

567
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:05,590
- Hope to see you again.
- Thank you.

568
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:07,820
Let's move to the next scheduled activity.

569
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,200
Mr. Robinson!

570
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,420
Oh, no. Hey!

571
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,280
Hey! Are you okay?

572
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,780
- Call an ambulance.
- Yes, sir.

573
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:27,950
Excuse me, call someone over.

574
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:28,820
- Quickly.
- Yes, sir.

575
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,760
This is driving me crazy.

576
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,160
- Team Leader Gang, please go with them.
- Yes.

577
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,820
Yes, I understand. Don't worry.

578
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,750
But sir, shouldn't you get out of here first?

579
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:57,120
Have you seen a captain abandon his ship, even when it's sinking? Hurry and get in.

580
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,390
- Did you check this route?
- Yes, we did.

581
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:16,020
♫ Why are you doing this to me? ♫

582
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:23,570
♫ Why is my heart like this? ♫

583
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:36,120
♫ But you keep coming into my eyes ♫

584
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:46,620
♫ Nothing is easy, nothing goes exactly as I want ♫

585
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:50,980
♫ Even if love is a common word ♫

586
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,270
The woman Jae In has been seeing these days,

587
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:54,290
what kind of person is she?

588
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:56,220
Keep looking into it. There's definitely something going on.

589
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,920
But I'm right about one thing, you’re a fox, do you know that?

590
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,410
You’re so sly.

591
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:02,680
Thanks, but that’s your preference, isn’t it?

592
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:06,320
I don't know about other women, but anyway, Da Da can't dress like that.

593
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,560
Because I missed you.

594
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,960
I came across the ocean but you’re too indifferent.

595
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,630
Still, we were about to get married three years ago.

596
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:15,760
Like a joke?

597
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,990
Is this such a light matter?

598
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,500
