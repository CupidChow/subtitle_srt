So...

31
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,280
So you're saying your grandfather put Min Tae Ha's name

as well as Lee Jae In's in his will, aren't you?

33

But Lee Jae In, you've completely deceived me about it.

34
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,530
And Min Tae Ha, you acted nice toward me because of the will.

35

Wow, now I see...

36

I'm sorry.

39
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:37,690
At first, I was just curious who you were. That was how I started but I didn't think it would turn out this way.

40
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:41,310
You should speak correctly here. You wanted to fool me from the start!

41
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,760
That was...

42

I had no choice.

What?

52
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,240
Besides deceiving me about the will, what else did you deceive me about?

53
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,570
Nothing! And I just left out only one page of the will.

54
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,930
That's deception!

55

56

57

I asked him to.

58

Don't worry.

69
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,340
I'm going to stop it from getting out of control no matter what.

70
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:43,180
That's not the problem. The fact that Tae Ha got to know the contents of the will means he saw the will.

71
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,580
Hold up, how does this all fit?

72
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,720
Even so, that's just our assumption. We have no proof that he saw it.

Of course. It's not like I gave you money or a gift certificate.

00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,590
- Take it down, please
- Oh, no!

164
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,380
Ah!

165
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:04,160
Would you let it slide now?

166
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:08,190
What are you talking about?

167
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:10,370
You already punished me enough this time.

168
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:13,340
Did I say something?

169
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:16,380
And you're still being hard on me.

170
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:20,800
But from now on I'm going to do what I want, no matter what you do.

171
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,770
Why is your grandfather doing this?

172
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:05,980
What?

173
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,690
I mean, why is he doing this to me?

174
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:12,960
Of all people, why me? If it hadn't been for his will,

175
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:17,350
I wouldn't have been used by you and Min Tae Ha and wouldn't have felt upset like this.

176
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,670
I never used you.

177
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:23,880
We contracted properly.

178
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:27,260
Stop fooling yourself!

179
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:31,140
Who was the one that left out the last page of the will, again?

180
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,550
Set up a meeting for me.

181
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,940
With who? Tae Ha?

182
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,590
Why?

183
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:43,370
You take care of Min Tae Ha by yourself.

184
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:48,770
But I need to meet with your grandfather, the Seong Hyeon Group Chairman or whatever, and ask him why he's doing this.

185
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:52,400
I mean, isn't it only fair if I know the reason? I'm the very person involved!

186
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:58,550
You're right. I think it's time you meet him.

187
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,970
You should go now.

188
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,700
What?

189
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:34,530
There's a new ice cream shop over there.

190
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:39,400
I don't think you're the kind of person who likes ice cream, though.

191
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:42,090
I'm not fond of it.

192
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:46,100
But still, it's been a while since we've had a date.

193
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:50,060
It hasn't been that long. And who told you to take so long to apologize properly?

194
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:55,620
And as for ice cream... I like it.

195
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,360
Shall we go?

196
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:14,250
♫ When you call me first ♫

197
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:19,160
♫ And remember our anniversary ♫

198
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,680
♫ Yet I forget your birthday ♫

199
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,640
♫ But you still smile at me, a fool ♫

200
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:31,720
♫ Now I'll make you happy ♫

201
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:36,280
♫ When you feel sick, I will be sicker instead ♫

202
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:40,400
♫ If you smile at me, ♫

203
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,060
♫ I can do anything ♫

204
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:47,140
♫ Like I did when we first met ♫

205
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:55,970
What brings you here? I didn't even call for you.

206
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,570
When is your schedule open?

207
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,510
For what?

208
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:04,390
I'll still be alive for a good while yet, so don't count your chickens before they hatch.

209
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:10,970
Da Hyeon wants to meet you. I think it's time you meet face-to-face, anyway.

210
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:16,260
Tae Ha, that punk, did something unnecessary, and now this.

211
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,810
You're the one who started all this.

212
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:23,020
Bring her by on the day of our group anniversary celebration.

213
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,390
Pardon?

214
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,620
Are you deaf?

215
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,780
Grandfather...

216
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:40,240
Do you think he doesn't know what will happen if Da Hyeon shows up as my date?

217
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,650
The media will be all over it.

218
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:46,340
Well, how do you feel about it?

219
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:51,260
If you bring Da Hyeon to the party, she will be acknowledged officially as your partner.

220
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,080
You know what that means, don't you?

221
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,900
Your cover was blown?

222
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:05,520
You idiot. Why didn't you do it properly?

223
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:11,530
You have to seduce her if we're to work the will to our advantage.

224
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,720
No. The marriage has nothing to do with the will.

225
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,410
At least, to Lee Jae In.

226
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:21,920
Do you think he's that innocent?

227
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:26,950
He corrected the newspaper issue, but according to Han Ju Chemical, it was all true.

228
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:32,790
I don't know what he's planning, but he definitely won't marry that teacher.

229
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,410
I hope so, too.

230
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:49,600
Oh, for once you're calling me? What's the occasion?

231
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,570
Today is the school anniversary. Do you have time to have dinner with me?

232
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,520
If you don't have time, I'll eat with Hyeon Jin instead.

233
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,360
Where are you?

234
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,420
In front of the hotel.

235
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:01,550
Then wait in the lobby for 30 minutes. Don't wander off and get lost.

236
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,070
Have a seat.

237
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,690
Do you really think we'll be able to finish this meeting in 30 minutes?

238
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,400
₩50,000 (about $45) says yes we will.

239
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,680
Looks like you're waiting for Jae In.

240
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,410
I'm sure you saw the article about our engagement.

241
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:36,820
Yes. But he said it was all false.

242
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,430
And that the article was full of errors.

243
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:43,950
Right. I got a little ahead of myself this time.

244
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:46,750
But it wasn't like that three years ago.

245
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:50,390
We were engaged three years ago.

246
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:53,730
Our families approved it, too.

247
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:59,230
I don't care what happened three years ago, though. Because Jae In told me you two aren't engaged anymore.

248
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:03,880
Do you know who pushed Jae In and me to get married?

249
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,690
Seong Hyeon Group Chairman Lee Gyu Cheol.

250
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:09,780
Jae In won't be able to go against the Chairman's will.

251
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:15,820
And he's not an idiot who would ignore Han Ju Chemical. And there's a lot I can do for Jae In.

252
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:22,820
So why don't you slowly start letting him go now?

253
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,360
Because you seem so pathetic latching onto him like this.

254
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,550
Just wait.

255
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:46,460
I'm at the coffee shop... with a guest of yours.

256
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,700
Yes.

257
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,930
What are you doing?

258
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,810
You said I seemed pathetic.

259
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:57,800
But I feel the same about you. And having encounters like this is really pissing me off.

260
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:03,380
Jae In will be here soon, so discuss this with him instead of me.

261
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:06,570
If he chooses you, you can have him.

262
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:10,170
I hate men who cheat, anyway.

263
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:19,980
Don't go. You look like you're running away.

264
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,360
Sorry.

265
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,040
Sure, fine.

266
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,250
But choose. What will you do?

267
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:38,930
What?

268
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:41,970
Miss Han Ju Hee says she has a lot of things she wants to do for you.

269
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:45,380
Also, she says she's going to marry you.

270
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:48,730
If you like that condition, we should end our relationship here.

271
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,160
Neatly.

272
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,810
How can you say that to me right now?

273
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:55,890
Then, should I fight with Han Ju Hee, pulling her hair?

274
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,340
Well, I don't think I'd lose in that kind of battle, but still.

275
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:09,130
Do you really like such an unrefined woman like her?

276
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:11,460
I know, right?

277
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:15,530
Jae in, you decide whether it's me or Han Ju Hee!

278
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:23,330
Of course I choose you.

279
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:26,460
We're legally bound together by signing with my stamp and your stamp!

280
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,650
So you can't go anywhere, understand?

281
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:32,390
What sort of... Lee Jae In!

282
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,890
Are you satisfied now?

283
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:38,390
If you want to date Lee Jae In, discuss it with him, but not me!

284
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:40,490
You're the one acting really pathetic here.

285
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:42,920
Who'd date who?

286
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,460
Move, move.

287
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,180
Wait.

288
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:51,560
What did you mean by that just now?

289
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,170
By chance... did you register a marriage with her as well?

290
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:56,570
It's none of your business.

291
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:59,800
And don't bother Da Hyeon again.

292
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,800
Jae In!

293
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,790
Lower your voice.

294
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:07,130
I hate women who throw tantrums when they don't get their way.

295
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:11,760
You... really are too cruel.

296
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,560
Ugh!

297
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,960
Is that woman... Buddha herself?

298
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:34,040
Is that man really our CEO over there?

299
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,200
I think I'm seeing things

300
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,760
Me too. We must've been really busy lately. (hallucinating from overwork) Wow...

301
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:48,320
What? I made things perfectly clear with her.

302
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,750
What was perfectly clear? You should have drawn a line much earlier.

303
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,520
Why did you make me sit there and talk among the three of us? It made me look so petty.

304
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,690
You didn't do anything wrong.

305
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:57,400
That's the problem.

306
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:02,030
So... I plan on doing something from now on.

307
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,100
What?

308
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:08,260
My grandfather wants to invite you to the company's anniversary party.

309
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,300
Your grandfather's company anniversary party?

310
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,800
What do you want to do? You choose, Da Da.

311
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,590
Want to go together?

312
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:17,550
Won't there be a lot of people there?

313
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,760
Fine. We'll just go separately.

314
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,760
Jae In, don't you dare act like you know me.

315
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,390
What?

316
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:28,940
There will be a ton of people attending.

317
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:33,570
But the only people who would recognize me are you and your cousin. Oh!

318
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:34,540
Hyeong Jun would, too.

319
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,490
Anyway, you just need to pretend you don't know me.

320
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:38,730
Does that make any sense?

321
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:39,860
Why not?

322
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:43,680
So you expect me to go stag?

323
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:47,350
But still, this way is better than having rumors spread and complicating things later.

324
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:52,170
All I need is to meet the Chairman and ask why he's doing this to me.

325
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:56,600
One thing for certain is that Grandfather knows you, Da Da. And he said that the two of you are very close.

326
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,510
I am?

327
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:05,390
So just tell the truth now. What kind of relationship do you two have?

328
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:10,370
A screaming relationship! I told you, I really don't know your grandfather!

329
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:22,540
You'll need a few things if you're coming to the party, won't you? Aren't women like that?

330
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,410
Wow, you seem very knowledgeable about these things.

331
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:31,930
I know some.

332
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:34,520
Whatever. I can just pick out some things with Hyeon Jin.

333
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,600
Come on. Let's go together.

334
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,860
Why are you even coming along for this?

335
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:50,160
I'm not too fond of Hyeon Jin's taste. It doesn't suit you at all.

336
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,400
Ta-da!

337
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:12,560
♫  Yeah! Come on, come on baby! ♫

338
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,270
♫  Yeah! Come on, come on baby! ♫

339
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,100
What the hell is this?
♫  Uh, Uh! ♫

340
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,080
♫  Check it out! ♫

341
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,680
This won't do. No.
♫  Excuse me, baby, ♫

342
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,560
Go back in there. Go back.
♫  Can I say something to you?  ♫

343
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,610
♫  My beating heart,  ♫

344
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:26,610
♫  please help me  ♫

345
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:30,100
♫  Can I ask you  ♫

346
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,850
♫ If you have some time?  ♫

347
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:33,470
It's not bad, but...

348
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:36,180
I want something a bit... more...
♫  I'm singing  ♫

349
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,710
♫  Wo-oh,  ♫

350
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:39,220
Refined.
♫  I like you  ♫

351
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,470
I would like to have that feeling in it.
♫  Baby, I want you  ♫

352
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:43,710
Yes, sir. We'll do that.
♫  I must’ve fallen for you at first sight  ♫

353
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:46,020
Let's go.

354
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:49,660
♫  I'm singing,

355
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,670
♫  Baby, I need you  ♫

356
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:54,700
Right. That's it.
♫  I’m going to ask you out
 Now yeah, I want you bad  ♫

357
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,450
♫ Verse 2!  ♫

358
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:57,970
♫  They feel good, your eyes,  ♫

359
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:58,860
♫ Yeah,  ♫

360
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,300

00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,500
♫  I won't bend till I know  ♫

362
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,250
Here. How about this?
♫  I belong to you ♫

363
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,770
♫  (break it down) ♫

364
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,920
Actress Gang Eun Seo wore this to the Film Festival recently.

365
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,720
Isn't it amazing?

366
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,490
Absolutely no way.

367
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:15,340
The cut has to at least be this low if she's going to look sexy—

368
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,170
Stop going on about being sexy!

369
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:19,420
She doesn't need to look sexy!

370
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:25,780
Also, don't you consider her chest size?

371
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,400
I think you're right, Jae In.

372
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,140
I give up.

373
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:35,660
W-w-what do you mean, he's right?

374
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,770
Just stay still, you two. I'll pick out my own dress.

375
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:41,790
Lee Jae In, keep that mouth of yours shut! And you just give me your employee discount, got it?

376
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:46,090
Find another dress just like that one.

377
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:51,490
That black dress looked good, too.

378
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:52,730
Right, right.

379
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:58,230
It also looked sort of like a nun's habit, though. Turtleneck and all.

380
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:01,860
Haven't you ever seen "The Sound of Music"? In the movie, Maria was so attractive.

381
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:06,500
No, I haven't. Because in 1965, I hadn't been born yet.

382
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:22,780
Wow, I really am busy lately.

383
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:25,470
You do know this is all your fault, right?

384
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:29,360
What are you doing here again?

385
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:32,910
I came to apologize. I'm sorry.

386
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:37,120
I don't think you're in any position to be angry right now. You're at fault too.

387
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,350
I'm different from Tae Ha, though. We are dating, after all.

388
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:45,160
That's why you're even more guilty. Stay here.

389
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,550
Let me apologize again.

390
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:59,200
And if I were to offer any excuse at all, it'd be that... I was curious.

391
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,710
You were curious?

392
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:03,850
I don't want to admit it, but...

393
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:07,660
Lee Jae In sometimes feels like an impenetrable wall.

394
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,180
So I was curious

395
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:12,650
about what kind of woman he was dating.

396
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:16,060
In truth... that's understandable.

397
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:22,370
But you know, he may seem like a wall. He's not impenetrable, he's just stubborn.

398
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:23,000
Excuse me?

399
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,880
He's not as bad a jerk as you think.

400
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:30,150
And... he's not a perfect person, either.

401
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,280
Anyway, you're admitting that you did something wrong to me, right?

402
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:40,610
Of course. It was a big mistake on my part. Again, I'm very sorry.

403
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:44,000
All right. You have a good habit.

404
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,410
People should apologize if they do something wrong. And as long as you're sincerely sorry, it's fine.

405
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:50,590
I forgive you.

406
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:52,730
But in exchange...

407
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:57,320
About the Cultural Festival Concert at your department store...

408
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,320
Couldn't you invite my Ji Su back just one more time?

409
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:06,850
He had to start over as a trainee. If his recognition goes up, it'll be easier for him to debut.

410
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:08,150
I understand.

411
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:12,120
Also, we're thinking of switching the model for SH Mall.

412
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,690
I'll consider him as well when the time comes.

413
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:17,930
Thank you! Thank you, Min Tae Ha.

414
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,600
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

415
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,190
What are you doing?

416
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:25,950
Thanking him.

417
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:27,840
- Then, until next time.
- Okay.

418
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,400
Goodbye. See you again.

419
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:35,180
What is it, now?

420
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:38,470
How come you gave me such a hard time but so easily accepted his apology?

421
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:42,860
Because Min Tae Ha is better at handling people than you are.

422
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:49,120
And it's not like I'll run into him again, anyway. So... I should accept his apology, of course.

423
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,650
Indeed. You won't need to see him again.

424
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:56,720
- Wait, CEO Lee really said he would attend?
- Yes.

425
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,640
That's why I told you that Da Hyeon is special.

426
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,710
It's the first time since he left three years ago

427
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,800
that he's coming to the company's anniversary party!

428
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,900
By chance, you didn't threaten him with something else, did you?

429
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,630
Are you all right?

430
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:13,300
My foot got caught on something. It's nothing, really.

431
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:17,030
I'll have someone get rid of this carpet!

432
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,770
Are you really sure it's okay that I don't accompany you in getting there?

433
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:24,820
You said you would be the host today. But where do you want to come?

434
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:29,030
You're with Hyeon Jin right now, right? I'll send a car over there, so take it to the party.

435
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:31,690
It's all right. Hyeon Jin is—

436
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:38,580
Looks like your carriage is all ready, then.

437
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:42,470
Then all that's left is for me to work my magic?

438
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:50,210
Your unnie will make you shine amazingly today, okay?

439
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,460
Ta-da!

440
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:23,150
All you need to do now is put on these shoes and your ensemble will be perfect.

441
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:24,790
Hey, aren't these heels a little too high?

442
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:28,600
No, not at all! High heels are women's pride.

443
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,620
Straighten your back and put a confident look in your eyes.

444
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:35,770
And I'm saying this just in case, but never lose your temper.

445
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:39,770
The one who gets angry first loses. So no matter what, just smile.

446
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:47,970
And... don't lose.

447
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,760
To anyone.

448
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:56,080
Wow! You look so pretty!

449
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,080
The end of next year...

450
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:18,860
I seem to be a little late.

451
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:22,230
Not at all. You're right on time.

452
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,520
Grandfather isn't here yet?

453
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,790
No. Secretary Jang called and said later

454
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:31,730
he'd make a statement at the end.

455
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:36,390
You're the host today. You know that, right?

456
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:38,980
Why is Jae In the host?

457
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:42,380
Oh, Sister-in-law...

458
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:46,410
Of course Jae In has to act the part of company owner when Father-in-law isn't present.

459
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:50,160
He's the only true male heir with a direct bloodline to the Lee family, after all.

460
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:54,280
I'll go and greet some guests.

461
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,860
Su Yeong!

462
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:05,120
You're here.

463
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,950
Jae In. Did you come here alone?

464
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:10,190
So did I.

465
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,350
I'm not alone.

466
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:15,470
And there's no reason for you to act this way even if I came alone.

467
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:17,360
Lee Jae In.

468
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:21,620
- It's been a while, sir.
- Yes.

469
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:03,230
What? Do I look strange?

470
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:04,980
No.

471
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,960
You look pretty.

472
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,780
Let's go.

473
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,680
Can you step away a bit?

474
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,720
Why? Do I have to?

475
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,950
Yes, you have to.

476
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:29,040
And, anyway, you have a ton of people to greet.

477
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,260
Isn't it your first time attending the party in three years?

478
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,420
Where did you hear that?

479
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,610
What does it matter to you?

480
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,420
Don't worry too much.

481
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:42,560
Go greet some more people. I'll take care of Da Hyeon.

482
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:50,800
- I'm sorry about last time.
- Oh...

483
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:56,830
I'm sure Jae In made you do it, so I'll forgive you, Hyeong Jun.

484
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:59,460
This is why you need to be careful who you make friends with.

485
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:07,490
- But, uh, when is the Chairman coming?
- Oh...

486
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:11,420
He should be here soon. He'll just come by to make the closing remarks and then leave.

487
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:16,390
I guess you really aren't familiar with the Chairman, seeing how nervous you are.

488
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:17,320
Do I show it too obviously?

489
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,820
A little.

490
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,670
But it will be okay since Jae In is here.

491
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:25,910
If anything happens, he'll sprint over here from there.

492
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,150
Thank you.

493
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:26,030
You see? I told you that shoes that don't fit would make your feet feel uncomfortable.

494
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:30,730
I knew there was something odd about the fact that Jae In was dating a woman like you.

495
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:34,890
I should have known that it had something to do with money.

496
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:40,900
Isn't it a bit childish to cling to someone

497
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,780
just because of such a will?

498
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:46,410
I know, right?

499
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:50,410
Jae In is clinging to me because of such a will.

500
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:55,260
That's why people like us should never mix with the poor.

501
00:36:56,550 --> 00:37:00,450
Put an end to the contract between you and Jae In now.

502
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:02,260
I'll give you all the money you need.

503
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:07,830
So withdraw yourself appropriately now.

504
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:15,290
Do you truly believe we're only dating because of the contract?

505
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:19,320
I guess you truly don't know what kind of man Jae In is.

506
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:23,600
He's not the type of person who can be forced to do something he doesn't want to do.

507
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,500
Who would he listen to when he doesn't even listen to his grandfather?

508
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:31,200
And I'd never date a man I didn't want to date, either.

509
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:37,420
So I'm completely fine without your money, thank you.

510
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,770
They said it was profitable...

511
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,570
This company mentioned...

512
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:53,530
Where did she go?

513
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:07,360
Do you know why we broke up three years ago?

514
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,350
Because he wanted me to sign a prenup.

515
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:13,860
Do you think you'll be able to sign something like that?

516
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:18,190
A prenup is a completely different level of contract from a dating contract.

517
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,340
Kim Da Hyeon, I'm sure you won't be able to do something like that.

518
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:24,690
Who knows?

519
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:28,870
I'll think about it if it happens.

520
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:32,640
Do you really think you'll be able to marry him?

521
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:37,820
Jae In has been my man since three years ago.

522
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:40,630
I... love that man.

523
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:45,140
Han Ju Hee, you're supposed to make confessions to the person you actually love.

524
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:47,840
Not to his girlfriend.

525
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:59,800
And I think you've misunderstood something. It's not that Lee Jae In agreed to date me.

526
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:04,610
Rather, I'm dating him because he asked me to.

527
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:10,080
Da Hyeon! So this is where you are.

528
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,770
I felt a bit stuffy in there.

529
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:13,950
Can you let me know when the Chairman arrives?

530
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:16,500
Of course.

531
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,950
Why are you here? You're bothering Da Hyeon.

532
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:20,690
Come on.

533
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,400
Let go!

534
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,960
Just a moment.

535
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:48,430
♫  Yeah! Come on, come on baby! Yeah! ♫

536
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:51,940
♫  Yeah! Come on, come on baby! Uh, uh! ♫

537
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:52,850
♫  Check it out! ♫

538
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:56,320
♫  Excuse me, baby,  ♫

539
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,730
♫  Can I say something to you?  ♫

540
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:01,720
♫  My beating heart, please help me  ♫

541
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,270
♫ Let's go! ♫

542
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:07,290
♫  Can I ask you  ♫

543
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:09,000
♫  if you have some time?  ♫

544
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,930
Do you really think you'll be able to marry him?

545
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:14,450
Jae In has been my man since three years ago.

546
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:16,190
I... love that man.

547
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:18,000
Why are you here alone?

548
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,160
I don't like it but for right now, I want to do it this way.

549
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,640
Honestly, I think Ju Hee might be better for him.

550
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:29,140
Why does he have to be a chaebol member? Why is there so much difference between us?

551
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,270
- Ah!
- Hyeon Jin.

552
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:33,660
Can you go home alone? I need to talk to Da Hyeon.

553
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:34,840
Should we?
♫  They feel good, your eyes,  ♫

554
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,130
♫  Yeah, your smile, too  ♫

555
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:38,740
♫  I won't bend till I know I belong to you ♫

556
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:42,360
