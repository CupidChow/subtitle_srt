00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:53,830
Do you know why we broke up three years ago?

11
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:56,850
Because he wanted me to sign a prenup.

12
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,410
Do you think you'll be able to sign something like that?

13
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:04,450
A prenup is a completely different level of contract from a dating contract.

14

Kim Da Hyeon, I'm sure you won't be able to do something like that.

Jae In has been my man since three years ago.

Ah!

23
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,260
And I think you've misunderstood something. It's not that Lee Jae In agreed to date me.

24
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:50,760
Rather, I'm dating him because he asked me to.

Yes, of course.

No...

You must've been hurt by what my aunt said.

107
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:06,140
No, I'm sure it hurt you more since what she said wasn't directed at me.

108
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,290
You should go back in. I don't think the party is over yet.

Of course... don't you know how big Seong Hyeon Group is?

115
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,780
I think I just figured it out.

116
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:44,930
How different he is from me...

117
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,490
Ah, why does he have to be a chaebol member? Why is he so different from me?

118
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:58,500
You see? I told you that shoes that don't fit would make your feet uncomfortable.

119
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,050
Dang it, what that witch said is completely right!

Witch? Who?

00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:07,040
By chance, was it Han Ju Hee? Did she show up there?

122
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,640
Han Ju Hee is a little witch compared to the big witch I saw today.

What? Something happened?

126
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,580
Her voice sounded off.

127
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,090

Da Hyeon.

129

Let's go in.

130
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,000
Okay.

131
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,040
Is that girl really someone you introduced to Jae In?

132
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,280
Yeah.

133
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,160
What? Don't you like her?

134
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,020
Honestly for me, I think Ju Hee might be better.

135
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,760
Well, indeed,

136
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,480
Han Ju Chemical is more attractive.

137
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:18,250
Probably, Ju Hee would be realistically more helpful to Jae In.

138
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,650
Marriage between similar people tends to be easier.

139
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:26,850
Jae In is a bit stoic but he's a good son to me.

140
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:32,480
My family, his birth mom and her family in Canada, and even his older brother that passed...

141
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,910
He has taken good care of them silently.

142
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,400
That is not enough for him so if we make him even take responsibility for his wife's having a hard time...

143
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,400
I really don't want it, Father-in-law.

144
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:45,830
I want someone to take care of my son from now on.

145
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:51,190
I don't want to see Jae In having a hard time anymore.

146
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:05,730
I guess this is not the right time to enjoy spaghetti.

147
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,670
Let's go.

148
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:12,340
On days like this, we need to drink.

149
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:30,140
I think I need to drink more.

150
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:33,710
Excuse me, could we get one more beer?

151
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:34,710
Two, please!

152
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,550
Yes, ma'am.

153
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:45,170
Damn it, I guess I can't drink today.

154
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:48,790
Here you go.

155
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,430
Thank you.

156
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:56,280
Hey, drink more slowly. You'll get drunk.

157
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,580
And eat some food too.

158
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,750
Why does it have to be him?

159
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:04,680
His personality is so prickly and he behaves badly.

160
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,750
It's always like that.

161
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:12,680
Look, there's someone with 99 positive qualities. But if he shows just one negative trait,

162
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:17,130
you can't like him at all although he is so good.

163
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,130
But there's someone with 99 bad qualities.

164
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:25,010
If you see his one good trait, you can fall for that one good trait.

165
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:27,480
That's that person's charm!

166
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:32,940
The charm that only you know and felt attracted to... that's Jae In's charm.

167
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:38,350
Ah, nobody knows, but you probably know what I'm talking about.

168
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:44,860
Exactly... that's the problem.

169
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,890
Lee Jae In probably feels the same way.

170
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:55,170
He's probably drinking somewhere right now thinking of you.

171
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,680
I don't think so.

172
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:03,380
He's super busy with no time to think about other people.

173
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,950
Oh, I'm so sorry.

174
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,550
You should've been more careful!

175
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,840
- Oh, it's all right.
- I'm really sorry.

176
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,740
Are you okay?

177
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,920
I'm going to go wash my hands.

178
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:29,980
♫ I know you're as sad as I am but you must endure  ♫

179
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:34,710
♫ So our memories can be beautiful ♫

180
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:38,320
♫ Like the flower petals that wither in a moment ♫

181
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,290
Hello?

182
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:44,170
Wow, ah, seriously... you drank too much...

183
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:48,170
Uh! It's Lee Jae In!

184
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,190
I didn't think you were coming.

185
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,240
Ah, no way.

186
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,820
How much did you drink?

187
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:02,860
A lot... But I'm not drunk.

188
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,650
That's being drunk.

189
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:06,490
And why didn't you pick up your phone again?

190
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:09,690
I wanted to piss you off.

191
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,690
What?

192
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:18,620
I got so pissed off because of you... so this makes it fair!

193
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:23,540
Fair... fair. Fair!

194
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:28,330
Hyeon Jin, you can go home by yourself, right? I need to talk to her.

195
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:31,790
I think it's just about to get fun for the first time in a while. Do I have to leave?

196
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,980
Hyeon Jin, please.

197
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,510
Okay.

198
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:38,740
Then have a hot night.

199
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,700
Ah, yes.

200
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,880
I'm only going to take her home.

201
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,960
You don't need to take her home.

202
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,660
Hyeon Jin, bye-bye...

203
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,830
I'll give you a call after taking her home.

204
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,750
- Bye.
- Bye.

205
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,870
Goodbye, friend!

206
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,120
Bye...

207
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,940
I'm so jealous.

208
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,960
No, no.

209
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,590
It's not fair. So bad!

210
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:16,810
What are you saying?

211
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,180
Are you really drunk?

212
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,970
Just how much did you drink?

213
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,730
Three bottles?

214
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,510
Four bottles?

215
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:32,580
Ah, but I'm not drunk at all.

216
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:35,300
I'm very sober.

217
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,780
Yeah, you're very sober.

218
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:48,940
It would have been nice to date you without that contract.

219
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,140
No, no.

220
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:59,940
It would be nice for you to not be a chaebol member.

221
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,400
I don't know if you're going to understand me since you're so drunk.

222
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:27,860
I also feel the same way.

223
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,410
So I'm telling the truth.

224
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:36,880
Are you willing to follow me and endure the hardship?

225
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,980
Do you want to stay with me until the end?

226
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,220
Shall we?

227
00:17:55,540 --> 00:18:02,660
But... I want to, but...

228
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:09,160
So... but we shouldn't.

229
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:16,410
We can't...

230
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:23,480
So...

231
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,690
Hello?

232
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,140
What did Jae In say?

233
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,990
Huh?

234
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,710
Who?

235
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:19,040
What?

236
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,860
What is this? Did you guys sleep together?

237
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,700
What?

238
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,680
Shut up, I'm hanging up.

239
00:20:54,290 --> 00:21:02,360
It feels like... we talked about... something important.

240
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,290
Ah! It's Jae In!

241
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,040
What's up?

242
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,880
Get changed and let's go eat breakfast.

243
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,250
At this time?

244
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:47,120
It's 7 a.m., time for breakfast.

245
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:47,800
Oh.

246
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:53,780
She didn't even wash her face.

247
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:59,390
You come to places like this, too?

248
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:03,280
I searched the internet. It should help with the hangover.

249
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,570
Why on earth did you drink so much?

250
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,260
I have a high alcohol tolerance!

251
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,690
Oh, my stomach hurts.

252
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:15,110
Yeah, you have a very high alcohol tolerance.

253
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:18,390
But still, don't drink like that again.

254
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:20,930
Especially, don't drink with men.

255
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,220
Thank you.

256
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,370
You know how to eat stuff like this?

257
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:33,070
I'm not that picky with food.

258
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:37,290
Yeah, right. You're not picky with food at all.

259
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,780
Ah, so refreshing!

260
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:52,760
Come on, eat up!

261
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,470
Yeah.

262
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:02,870
You're not eating?

263
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,610
I didn't drink last night.

264
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,280
Aren't you going to be late?

265
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,890
Not yet, I should be okay.

266
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:27,250
By chance,

267
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:30,730
do you remember what I said last night?

268
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:37,540
No.

269
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:40,610
Did you say something important?

270
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:47,610
Never mind. Go inside. You'll be late.

271
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,460
What brings you here?

272
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:17,710
I'm curious about Jae In's real feelings.

273
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:20,680
You're close to him.

274
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,340
Jae In is said to be a genius in business.

275
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:31,780
But he's ignoring a person like me who has all kinds of business benefits. Does that make sense?

276
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:37,000
There are so many women who have as many business benefits as you around Jae In.

277
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,660
But still, that girl isn't it. Without that will, he probably wouldn't even have glanced at her.

278
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:46,790
That's why Da Hyeon is so amazing. Let him go.

279
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:52,320
Her family, money, education, background... I'm much better than her in everything.

280
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,200
But you want me to give up on him?

281
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,090
There must be something we don't know then.

282
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:04,060
That girl... does she have a complicated past history or a man that she's dating now?

283
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:12,160
I don't know about her past, but how can she date someone else while dating Jae In?

284
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,860
Don't you know what type of man Jae In is? Do you think he would let that pass?

285
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:22,740
Yes, this is Park Hyeong Jun.

286
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:31,280
Then I just need to try harder to find her another man.

287
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,790
Yes?

288
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:46,380
Jae In, I can't go up today. I have to work on the design project for tomorrow.

289
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,860
Then I will head on over there. I might also get off work a little late.

290
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,070
Would you?

291
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:54,640
What do you mean "would you?" You should beg me to.

292
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,380
Okay, let's do that then.

293
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,920
Okay.

294
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,210
This is Min Tae Ha.

295
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:17,730
Oh good, you're still at work even though it's after 9 p.m.

296
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:18,760
Who is this?

297
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:22,590
I'm Han Ju Hee, from Han Ju Chemical.

298
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,170
Yes, Hyeon Jin. This is Lee Jae In.

299
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:52,790
Is Da Hyeon with you by chance?

300
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:56,870
I was supposed to meet her. I was wondering if she and I missed each other.

301
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:58,830
Oh, okay then.

302
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:22,740
You already knew about the Chairman Lee Gyu Cheol's will, right, Min Tae Ha?

303
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:26,220
Can you get to the point?

304
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,550
Fine.

305
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:32,500
Tae Ha, are you interested in Seong Hyeon Group?

306
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,900
What?

307
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,420
I want to work out a deal with you.

308
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:40,520
But I need to know your thoughts first.

309
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,150
I'm not joking.

310
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:50,390
If you make the right decision, Seong Hyeon Group could just fall into your lap.

311
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:53,320
It would be a lie if I said that I'm not interested in leading Seong Hyeon Group

312
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,940
when I'm not a fool or an idiot.

313
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:00,580
Here.

314
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,970
What is this?

315
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:09,460
Hotel key?

316
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:13,660
I created a small accident for you.

317
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:17,570
Follow your true feelings and keep your Seong Hyeon Group.

318
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:21,310
I only need Lee Jae In.

319
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:22,470
Yes, sorry to call you at this hour.

320
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:23,430
Yes, CEO?

321
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:25,230
Could you run a task force with the security team?

322
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,550
Will you make it run under the Group's order?

323
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:28,190
Yes.

324
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:29,880
I need to find someone urgently.

325
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,690
Ah, yes. Understood.

326
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:39,750
We're looking at all the security videos on the roads and streets around the school.

327
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:42,780
It's a school zone so something will pop up for sure.

328
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,730
What on earth was Jae In doing?

329
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:46,820
That bastard! I just—

330
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:51,070
Excuse me, Chairman, calm down. She will be fine.

331
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:55,470
I'll keep updating you promptly whenever I learn something.

332
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,980
Chairman?

333
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,100
Min Tae Ha

334
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,490
What's up with you?

335
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,350
Where are you?

336
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:20,850
If you dare touch Da Hyeon,

337
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:23,000
you'd better be prepared.

338
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:50,250
Where is Da Hyeon?

339
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:51,960
What did you do to her?

340
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,790
Don't misunderstand. I didn't lay one finger—

341
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:06,190
No need to be alarmed. She's just sleeping.

342
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,170
Call Dr. Kim.

343
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:36,090
She's just asleep from anesthesia.

344
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:37,880
Just do it!

345
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,390
Who did this?

346
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:25,020
Why don't you think that I did this?

347
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,370
If you had done it, you wouldn't have called me.

348
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:29,830
I don't think you are stupid enough to do something like this either.

349
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:33,170
Are you complimenting me or warning me?

350
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:35,540
I'm thanking you.

351
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:38,930
So, who did this?

352
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,360
Ju Hee.

353
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,030
Ju Hee?

354
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:50,600
Han Ju Hee?

355
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:56,250
She told me to take Seong Hyeon Group. In return, she would take you.

356
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:07,860
Yes, Hyeon Jin.

357
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:11,050
How about Da Hyeon? You haven't found her yet, have you?

358
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,840
Just call the cops!

359
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:17,080
I found her. No need for the police. She's with me.

360
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,680
R-Really?

361
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,280
Can you put her on the phone? I need to hear her voice directly.

362
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,280
Ah, Hyeon Jin, that's not it. She's actually asleep...

363
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,100
Are you all crazy?

364
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,250
Don't worry.

365
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,600
Just leave her. She'll wake up soon.

366
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,280
It's too much to move her right now.

367
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,560
I don't want her to lie here at the hotel.

368
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,200
Get the car. I can't drive right now.

369
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,080
So you are asking me to play the driver at this hour?

370
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,500
Just move.

371
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,240
Thanks.

372
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,530
You're welcome. I'm more thankful for what you will do for me moving forward.

373
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:19,570
Just call me "hyung." You're a year younger than me.

374
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:23,810
One year? It's only seven months, to be exact.

375
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:27,590
Anyway, we were born in different years. Start addressing me correctly from now on.

376
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:30,170
That'll give you more benefits when you deal with other people.

377
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:33,900
You mean no one can touch Lee Jae In's little brother?

378
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,450
No.

379
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:39,650
It means you'll be a person I need to protect now.

380
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,300
Tell me.

381
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:46,590
You must have called me because you wanted something, right?

382
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:54,300
SH Mall. I want complete management power.

383
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:59,580
There's something going on. You must know about it too.

384
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:03,180
Something fishy is going on around SH Mall.

385
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:11,120
So Uncle has been the sole reason that the stocks are fluctuating.

386
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,220
He's playing a dangerous game.

387
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:17,760
Shouldn't you be taking Uncle's side?

388
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,960
Will you be able to bear it?

389
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,490
It's an unlawful game. And it's unreliable too.

390
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:26,670
So that is not winnable either.

391
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,430
That's right.

392
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:32,830
So I can't be a good son this time.

393
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:37,950
I started as a parking attendant at the mall. It's my first workplace.

394
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:40,070
And my first love.

395
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:44,290
Like you invested your life in SH Hotel, I've invested my life in this mall.

396
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:47,150
But I can't just give it up to someone.

397
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:49,740
I don't play losing games.

398
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:03,640
This is Lee Jae In. I know you're resting right now, so I'm sorry, Secretary Jang.

399
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:07,030
I'm going to go back to the company in a bit.

400
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:10,270
Yes, I'm going to tell the chairman about it tomorrow.

401
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:15,520
So... Could you look into Han Ju Group? Anything would be great.

402
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:19,220
Also, please look into Director Min Hyeok Ju.

403
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:22,310
No, no, it's not a personal favor. It's for the company.

404
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:26,640
Please investigate all and I will see you tomorrow at the hotel.

405
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:40,310
I guess Chairman Han lost his mind due to old age.

406
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:45,860
You wouldn't be thinking about destroying Han Ju Chemical, would you?

407
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:48,600
Why are you asking me? This order came from Jae In, so it's up to Jae In.

408
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,960
Yes, that is why I'm asking.

409
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,060
CEO is not the type of person to let this slide at all.

410
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,750
Han Ju Chemical is a middle-sized company. If that company goes bankrupt like that—

411
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:02,100
What are you talking about? How can even Seong Hyeon Group just touch a perfectly fine company?

412
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,690
Is Jae In a mafioso?

413
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:05,600
Then...

414
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,590
He can probably replace the company owner.

415
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:11,360
Of course, through the board meeting.

416
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:19,100
So I'm asking you, Chairman.

417
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:24,570
Can I just stay put at the hotel?

418
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:52,260
♫ Without saying anything, time passes ♫

419
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,400
I'm sorry, Da Da.

420
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,670
This will never happen again.

421
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,400
I promise you.

422
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:16,810
♫ With a sad face ♫

423
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:26,690
♫ You avoid my gaze ♫

424
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,400
♫ And like that days went by without any contact ♫

425
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:40,550
Don't bother Da Hyeon anymore. You know better than anyone else that you both can't get married.

426
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:42,130
Do you want to go to the hospital?

427
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:47,260
Hospital? Gah. If I hear another "I'm sorry" or "are you okay?," it'll be the 100th time.

428
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,830
You can just sleep here.

429
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:51,900
Nothing happened last night either.

430
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,830
Are you going to drive me home or should I take a taxi?

431
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:56,970
I'm not going to eat you up.

432
00:39:56,970 --> 00:40:04,180
Well, if Da Da clings to me crying, then I will try my best.

433
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,500
