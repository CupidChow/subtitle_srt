That’s it!

132
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:26,400
Ah, let's remove the SIM card as well. >> Yeah, that's right.

133
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:29,903
(Takuya) But not all the data is on your smartphone.

134
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:33,907
(Yosuke) So first, check where the data is saved.

135
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:35,976
(Takuya) How?

136
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:39,980

00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:57,931
Camera and recording functions can be activated remotely →

There are apps that can monitor your smartphone.

143
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:03,937
>> What? That's scarier than an app that shifts location information.

144
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:05,939
(Yosuke) It's scary. Well, originally →

145
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:08,942
Developed for parents to keep an eye on their children's smartphones →

146
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:11,445
It's a proper app, but recently →

147
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:14,948
It's used to monitor partners and investigate cheating.

148
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:16,950
>> But what are you going to do about it?

149
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:20,454
(Yosuke) In other words, use this app to infiltrate that person's smartphone.

150
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,956
Then you can delete the photo from your phone.

151
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:24,958
You can also find the storage location.

152
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:27,461
(Takuya) Does that mean I should just delete all the data on that photo?

153
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:29,963
(Yosuke) Yeah. (Mina) Then use that app →

154
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:33,967
Wouldn't it be nice if I could secretly download it to someone else's smartphone?

155
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:36,036
(Takuya) Okay, I'll try it.

156
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:45,979
(Endo) Sorry for keeping you waiting.

157
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:51,551
So, how much alimony did you plan on getting?

158
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:55,989
(Takuya) Not so →

159
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:58,992
When I asked you to stop doing that →

160
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:00,994
Will you please stop?

161
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:02,929
>>No way.

162
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:06,433
But it's fine if you buy it.

163
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,437
(Takuya) After all, that's how you threatened Chiharu?

164
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:15,442
>> I mean, it's worse to have an affair in the first place.

165
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:17,444
(Takuya) Ah, I'll buy it.

166
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:19,946

172
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:46,473
(Endo) Wow! >> Oh, sorry.

173
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,975
It's tough. I need to remove the coffee stain quickly.
