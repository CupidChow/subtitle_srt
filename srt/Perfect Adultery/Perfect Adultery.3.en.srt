183
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:40,393
I also wanted to try something, so I found someone on SNS.

184
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,395
(Chiharu) Are you by any chance having an affair?

185
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:45,398
>> I found out right away. (Chiharu) Eh, why?

186
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:47,901
>>I lent my smartphone to my wife.

187
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:51,905
So when I typed ``ah,'' it seemed like ``I want to meet you.'' came out.

188

Hey, uh... do you mean the predictive conversion function? Because of that.
