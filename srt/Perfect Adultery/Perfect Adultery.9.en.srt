(Intercom: Kanae) I didn't ask you to clean.

213
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:46,393
(Chiharu) There's a strange smell in front of the entrance.

(Takuya) Sorry, that's a lie.

218
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:00,407
>>Yes?

219
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:03,410
(Takuya) My friend must be on the balcony.

220
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:05,412
>> Eh.

221
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:09,983
(Takuya) I got a call saying that I was hiding and couldn't come out, so I came.

222
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:14,487
Please, please cooperate.

225
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:25,432
Why? Suddenly. (Takuya) Ah...

226
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:29,002
It's currently in service.

00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:47,387
I thought it was no good.

233
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:49,389
(Chiharu) Put this on now.

234
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:51,891
>> This? Are you going to wear it?

235
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,894
No, no, that's when it happened.

236
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:56,963
(Yosuke) Oh no, I'm looking at you.

237
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:01,968
>> It's not just because he blames me.

00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,405
(Chiharu) It's perfect. It suits you.

239
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:08,908
>> Thank you. Let's go now. Everyone is here, so I'm not scared anymore.

00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:11,978
Okay, okay, okay, okay…｡

241
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:17,917
Well, I'm sorry for being in such a dirty place.

242
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:20,420
(Takuya) Cleaning is finished.

243
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:22,422
>> Eh, isn't it early?

244
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:24,924
(Takuya) That's the selling point, so please excuse me.

245
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:26,926
(Tomoki) Wait a moment. (Takuya) Yes, what is it?

246
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:30,931
>> Yes, where is the vendor? Because I didn't receive a business card.

247
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:35,368
(Takuya) Ah, uh...

248
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,370
(Tomoki) Recently, I did a preliminary inspection like this→

249
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:41,374
I heard from a friend that it's possible for a burglary to occur later.

250
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,876
yes.

251
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:47,380
(Takuya) That... that... (Tomoki) Is there?

252
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,884
(Takuya) Yes, there is... (Tomoki) Yes?

253
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,387
do not have? be? Which one?

254
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:57,390
(Chiharu) Ah, you gave me your business card just now.

255
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,392
>>Ah, yeah, I just got it.

256
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,394
Ah yes, thank you.

257
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,463
(Chiharu) Excuse me. (Takuya) Excuse me.

258
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,911
(Takuya) It was seriously dangerous. (Yosuke) No, it was thrilling and interesting.

259
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,913
(Takuya) Idiot! (Chiharu) Were you injured?

260
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,415
>> No, it's okay, I train at the gym every day.

261
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:26,486
I mean, thank you so much everyone today.

262
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:38,365
(Takuya) Wataru.

263
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:40,367
>> Yeah? (Takuya) This.

264
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:42,869
>> Ah, there it is... (Takuya) It's really broken though.

265
00:16:42,936 --> 00:16:45,872
>> It's really broken. Is this for real?

266
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:47,874
Thank you. (Takuya) Yeah.

267
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:50,877
>> After all, this is the only girl I have.

268
00:16:50,944 --> 00:16:53,880
So hehehe.

269
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:55,882
I'm going to go to the handshake event now.

270
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:57,884
(Yosuke) Starting now? >>Of course!

271
00:16:57,951 --> 00:17:01,955
Thank you everyone, Happy & Healthy!

272
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,893
(Yosuke) He's overdoing it.

273
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,897
(Takuya) Kou looks like he's more sensitive than most people.

274
00:17:10,964 --> 00:17:13,900
Even so, I always stay strong.

275
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:16,970
(Chiharu) I kind of get it.

276
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:28,915
>> I believe in location information more than in love.

277
00:17:28,982 --> 00:17:31,918
(Yosuke) What did you say? You. (Takuya) Another word of encouragement?

278
00:17:31,985 --> 00:17:34,421
>> Yes, it sounds like the lyrics are for me.

279
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:36,423
(Yosuke) That idol has been underground forever →

280
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:38,425
Maybe it's the lack of sense.

281
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:40,927
>> The ground is not the only place where the sun shines, Yang-chan.

282
00:17:40,994 --> 00:17:42,929
(Yosuke) Probably only on the ground. (Takuya) So→

283
00:17:42,996 --> 00:17:44,931
Have you stopped using the app?

284
00:17:44,998 --> 00:17:47,434
>> Yeah, I guess that's enough.

285
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,938
Well, I've decided to devote the rest of my life to pushing.

286
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:53,873
I'm not suited for it.

287
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,876
Besides, I got dragged into trouble like the other day...

288
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:59,379
(Tomoki) Hey, cleaner! >>Yes?

289
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:02,449
Is this yours?

290
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,886
Ah, that...

291
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:09,389
Hey! Hey! >> Ah, ah, ah…｡

292
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:13,393
I'm sorry. It's all my fault. There's nothing wrong with this person.

293
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,962
I just deceived this person.

294
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:37,984
(Takuya) Wataru…｡

295
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:42,422
>> What is it?

296
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:45,925
Do you know the name of your wife's app?

297
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:47,927
Huh?

298
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:49,929
It's called Luna.

299
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:52,932
He said he named it because he and the moon resemble each other.

300
00:18:57,437 --> 00:19:00,373
It's floating somewhere far away.

301
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:05,378
That's me... That's like me.

302
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:07,380
I thought, why?

303
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:10,383
But when I saw Luna from the balcony →

304
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:13,386
I understand the meaning.

305
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:18,391
My father was rarely at home because of work.

306
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:23,396
Even during holidays, my mother neglected me, preferring to play with friends.

307
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:27,467
That's why my mother always had the same face as Luna.

308
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:31,905
What do you want to say?

309
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:34,474
I was so lonely, Luna!

310
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:40,914
That's why I wanted someone to talk to me.

311
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,484
It just happened to be me.

312
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:47,420
Actually, with my husband →

313
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:49,422
I think I want to talk more.

314
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:53,927
So try talking to Luna more and more...

315
00:19:55,428 --> 00:19:58,364
There's no reason for someone like you to say something like that!

316
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:01,434
(Sound of throwing down a cup) (Tomoki) Let's go home!

317
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:10,443
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

318
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:22,455
The moon is the super idol of the night sky!

319
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:26,960
The center is always yours.

320
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:32,398
This is not a recommendation →

321
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:36,469
These are my words dedicated to Luna.

322
00:20:43,977 --> 00:20:45,979
thank you.

323
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,428
Yay!

324
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:11,871
(Takuya) Wataru's parents It seems like they hardly ever talked to each other.

325
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:16,376
So when my parents laugh at something stupid→

326
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:19,379
I always looked at him strangely.

327
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:22,382
(Chiharu) Takuya, do you understand that?

328
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:25,385
It's like an unusual family.

329
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:29,455
(Takuya) Hmm, I don't think it's possible to understand everything you want to understand.

330
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:33,893
But if you grow up in that kind of environment→

331
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,896
It must be painful.

332
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:38,898
(Chiharu) I see.

333
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:42,402
(Takuya) So if I were a parent→

334
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:46,973
I don't want my child to feel that way.

335
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:58,351
(Takuya) That's it. (Chiharu) Yeah.

336
00:21:58,418 --> 00:22:00,853
(Takuya) It’s about time→

337
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:05,358
Child, why don't you think about it?

338
00:22:05,425 --> 00:22:06,859
(Chiharu) Huh?

339
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:12,432
(Takuya) No, until now I thought it would be nice if it could be done naturally.

340
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:17,437
I want to think about it properly.

341
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:24,877
(Chiharu) I am →

342
00:22:24,944 --> 00:22:27,947
I think it's still early.

343
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:31,451
(Takuya) Yeah.

344
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:37,457
(Takuya) Ah, I see.

345
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:41,894
I'm sorry, I just said it at my own timing.

346
