130
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:44,938
Hey Mina-san. >> Eh.

131
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:48,942
Well, divorce doesn't necessarily mean the beginning of unhappiness.

132
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:53,947
That's right, it's annoying to get involved in marital problems.

133

(Mina) But look, Chiharu-chan→

134
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:58,452

So don't you feel like you don't want a divorce?

136
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:05,392
Well, if you ask me.

137
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:09,396
(Mina) There are cases where I simply called for divorce.

138
00:07:09,463 --> 00:07:13,901
If Takuya doesn't want a divorce, maybe he can cooperate.

139
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:17,905
(Yosuke) As expected, Mina-san, Takuya probably doesn't want a divorce!

140
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:20,908
>> In that case. (Yosuke) Yeah.

141

(Takuya) Yeah. (Chiharu) Yeah.

151
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:57,444
Oh, can I help you with something?

152
00:07:57,511 --> 00:07:59,446
(Navigation) I'm going to the river now to cool down some drinks.

153

161
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:31,912
After all, I just can't accept it.

162

(Takuya) Is that what it is?

167
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:52,432
>>That's right.The problem is only with the first wall.

00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:57,437
oh yeah.

170
00:08:57,504 --> 00:09:00,440
(Takuya) Eh, what are you talking about?

171
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:05,379
>> You're also deciding whether to keep a dog or not, right?

172
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:07,381
(Kou) Stop it.

173
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:10,884
Yo-chan, stop it. You're a little too wet.

174
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:15,889
(Chiharu) I'm sorry for getting you two involved in all that stuff.

175
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:18,892
>> No, nothing like that. (Yosuke) Why are you apologizing?

176
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,394
(Chiharu) Huh?

177
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:24,398
(Yosuke) I have decided not to apologize even if my affair is found out.

178
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:26,466
Do you know why?

179
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:30,404
Because I understand.

180
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:35,409
If he finds out, he'll hurt his wife and get the people around him involved.

181
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:37,911
I'm doing it knowing that apologizing doesn't mean being forgiven →

182
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:40,414
I'm the worst bastard.

183
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,482
But...

184
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:49,423
(Yosuke) I'm having an affair even though I'm not prepared for it→

185
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:52,426
This is what will happen, right?

186
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:55,929
In the end, you're blaming Takuya.

187
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:58,432
>>Yo-chan, as expected, we have no right to blame you.→

188
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:00,434
Even if I blame you... (Yosuke) Don't blame me.

189
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,436
I'm just talking about my own style.

190
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:04,938
(Chiharu) I am confident. (Yosuke) Yes?

191
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:09,443
(Chiharu) I love Takuya more than the two of you, more than anyone else.

192
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:12,946
That's all I have confidence in.

193
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:17,517
That's why I'm definitely not criticizing it.

194
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,955
(Yosuke) If so, would you have an affair?

195
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:25,525
(Chiharu) I know that no one will understand.

196
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:30,530
(Yosuke) If you don't talk about that, you won't understand.

197
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:39,973
>> Delicious. Ahhh.

198
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,975
\Ah, shiitake mushrooms are delicious/

199
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:44,478
Hmm.

200
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:47,481
So, what kind of dog do you want to keep?

201
00:10:47,547 --> 00:10:49,983
(Chiharu) A dog? (Koi) Ah, that's it, isn't it?

202
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,486
Um... Pome?

203
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:54,488
(Chiharu) Pome… Pomeranian. >> Pomeranian.

204
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:57,491
Pome-chan!? Then leave it to me for advice.

205
00:10:57,557 --> 00:11:00,494
What? See? (Chiharu) Yeah. >> Would you like to see the photo first?

206
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,931
(Yosuke) He's going to talk endlessly about dogs.

207
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,934
(Takuya) The real reason: Thank you for keeping quiet.

208
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,003
(Yosuke) As expected.

209
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:13,507
(Takuya) I've decided.

210
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,444
After all, with Chiharu...

211
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:19,446
(Mina) But →

212
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:22,449
This is all I want to say to Takuya.

213
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,451
(Takuya) Yes.

214
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:28,955
>> Once you become a family, never cut ties.

215
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:33,460
If you throw me away or betray me, I'll be hurt.

216
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:34,961
(Takuya) That's...

217
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:38,465
>> Dogs get angry when other dogs come back after touching them.

218
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:41,468
I get really angry when my owner cheats.

219
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:44,538
Even humans get angry if they are cheated on.

220
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,975
(Yosuke) Ah, the meat is grilled, so let's eat it.

221
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,977
>> Let's eat meat. >> I mean →

222
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:54,981
Whether it's a human or a dog, people who cheat are the worst.

223
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,984
There's a guy who sometimes brags about cheating on me.→

224
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,487
It's so stupid that I can laugh.

225
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:04,925
There are so many more fun things to do in life.

226
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:08,428
It's about how boring a life he has.

227
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:10,430
(Yosuke) Is it wrong to brag?

228
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:12,432
>> Huh? (Yosuke) Ah, that's it.

229
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:15,435
Now, on the contrary, Higami doesn't even get cheated on with, ah!?

230
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:17,938
>> Let's eat meat... >> Ah, I understand.

231
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:19,940
Are you a cheating bastard too?

232
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:22,442
I'm breathing well and without shame.

233
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:24,444
(Yosuke) I'm smoking~｡ >> That Yo-chan is →

234
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:27,447
This is the default. (An) What is the default?

235
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:30,450
Long-haired twins who are friends or trash!

236
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:33,453
(Chiharu) Anzu-chan, let's eat the meat. (Anzu) It's shaggy, shaggy.

237
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,455
(Takuya) Yosuke, let's grill some meat too. (Yosuke) If you don't want him to eat it →

238
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:37,457
I'll eat it all! >>Not the hair→

239
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:39,459
Woman, take care of yourself, woman!

240
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:41,461
Pome-chan look...

241
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:43,964
(Yosuke) Don't blame Kou!

242
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:47,467
Kou hates being called shaggy!

243
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:50,971
>> I had no idea that An-chan was such a mad dog.

244
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:52,973
(Yosuke) If I go out with someone like that, I'll get covered in my ass →

245
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:55,475
You'll become sluggish, stop it.

246
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:59,479
>> Ah, I thought it was time for me to break free from my amateur virginity.

247
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:02,482
(Yosuke) Huh? Takuya: Weren't you about to say something earlier?

248
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:05,919
(Takuya) Ah...｡

249
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:08,421
I've decided.

250
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:11,424
>> When you say you decided, do you mean Chiharu-chan?

251
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:15,495
(Takuya) Yeah, I honestly don't know if this is the correct answer.

252
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:19,432
(Yosuke) There's no such thing as a correct answer!

253
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:23,436
But no matter what choice you make →

254
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:27,440
Don't worry, we'll definitely support you.

255
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:29,509
What? >>Yes.

256
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:32,946
(Takuya) Thank you.

257
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:34,948
(Yosuke) So?

258
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:40,020
(Takuya) I'll get the divorce papers tomorrow.

259
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:46,026
(Yosuke) I see.

260
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:52,465
>> He also said that in the future that I have decided for myself, I will definitely be able to smile someday.

261
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:54,534
Good luck, Taku-chan.

262
00:13:57,037 --> 00:14:00,040
(Takuya) I'll dry this over there.

263
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:04,411
(Sound of collision) (Takuya) Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

264
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:06,479
(Female) Sorry.

265
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:19,426
Oh no, wasn't the dog the cause? (Chiharu) Yes.

266
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:22,429
>> He's not only a cheating bastard, he's also a liar.

267
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:24,931
(Chiharu) Ah, no, I think he was being kind to me.

268
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:27,434
>> Why?

269
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,437
(Chiharu) Because I'm the reason for the fight.

270
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:33,440
>> What did you do?

271
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:35,875
(Chiharu) Um...

272
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:38,878
>> It's okay, it's okay, don't force it.

273
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:42,449
Well, there are many things in life.

274
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:51,391
(Yosuke) We have to do something to prevent them from getting divorced.

275
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,393
>> Yeah, why?

276
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,396
(Yosuke) This area is making me squirm. >> Huh? Huh?

277
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:58,898
(Yosuke) If those two really got divorced, he would probably feel responsible.

278
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:01,902
I think we might have done something unnecessary. That's amazing. >> No...

279
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:04,904
But you just said that you'll support whatever Taku-chan decides to do.

280
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:06,907
(Yosuke) I never thought he would choose divorce.

281
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:08,908
>> Eh~ You must be lying about me, Yang→

282
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:11,411
I thought it was really cool. (Yosuke) You wouldn't like it either.

283
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:13,413
Do you feel like you destroyed your childhood friend's happiness?

284
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,415
>> No, that's true, but there's nothing we can do about it.

285
00:15:15,482 --> 00:15:17,917
Taku-chan, I've made up my mind. (Yosuke) Don't give up!

286
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:20,487
There is a part 2 of the strategy.

287
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:23,990
>> Part 2?

288
00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:31,998
(Chiharu) I'll give you a massage when I get back.

289
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,435
(Takuya) Ah, it's okay.

290
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:42,375
(Chiharu) To Takuya →

291
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:45,945
All I keep saying is "It's okay".

292
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,883
I'm sorry.

293
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:53,453
(Takuya) Chiharu also only said "I'm sorry."

294
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,458
(Chiharu) I see.

295
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,399
(Chiharu) What is that?

296
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:10,470
(Takuya) Huh? Was it when we bumped into each other earlier?

297
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:15,408
(Chiharu) What kind of person are you? I'll ask.

298
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,911
He asks if I bumped into him on purpose.

299
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,480
(Takuya) Hey, why? What do you do when you hear something like that?

300
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,984
(Chiharu) What a joke.

301
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,422

It's too bad that there are only things that Chiharu likes.

Nowadays, you can live alone without getting married.

00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,894
Why would you go out of your way to call it marriage?

337
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,897
What benefits does it have for you?

338
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:26,399
(Takuya) Ah, the benefits...｡

339
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:30,904
>> Because if you are alone, you can survive on your own responsibility.

340
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:35,909
However, once you get married, there is a possibility that you will be unhappy because of your partner.

341
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:40,914
There's no benefit to doing something like gambling.

342
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,918
(Takuya) That may be true, but→

343
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:48,421
Even more than that, I’m happy… >> Yeah.

344
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:52,425
Some people say that their happiness doubles.

345
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:57,363
But the unhappiness seems to be three or ten times greater.

346
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,866
I don't want Chiharu to feel that way →

347
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:03,369
I was against marriage.

348
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:07,440
But it's adultery.

349
00:20:14,948 --> 00:20:17,383
You told me.

350
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:23,389
Takuya-san will definitely love Chiharu more than me.

351
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:27,961
But look, in the end, people will betray you.

352
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:35,902
If Chiharu just listens to what her mother says, she'll be sure.

353
00:20:35,969 --> 00:20:40,974
The person who loves Chiharu more than anyone else is her mother.

354
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:48,982
(Chiharu) It's me, not Takuya.

355
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:57,924
(Chiharu) I had an affair.

356
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:02,362
I was the one who betrayed you!

357
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:05,865
I'm making Takuya tens of times more unhappy!

358
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:08,368
(Takuya) Chiharu.

359
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:10,937
(Chiharu) It's all my fault.

360
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:19,445
>> Hehehehehehehe…｡

361
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:25,885
This isn't interesting in the slightest. Hmph.

362
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:28,388
I'll come back later.

363
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:31,391
