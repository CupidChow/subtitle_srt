It felt like he was serious and working hard.

172
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:10,510
Chiharu, your mother is also a decent person, right?

173
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:16,016
That's why I was wondering if there was a time when I lost strength.

174
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:22,956
That's why by being with me →

175
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:27,027
If Chiharu can feel relieved, I'm happy.

176
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:38,472
But in the countryside, in the parking lot of a supermarket →

177
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:41,475
There's one car that I left behind.

178
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,977
The number and model of the car were seen →

179
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:46,980
Ah, it seems like there's a chance they'll find out that this is his.

180
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:48,982
(Yosuke) It's the most tragic thing ever.

181
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:52,486
(Takuya) In that case, if one of them lives in a city, is there still a low chance of it being discovered?

182
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:54,988
>> That person also recently transferred here →

183
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:59,493
Nowadays, it seems like he has his partner come by car to meet him.

184
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:02,496
I don't have anyone like that around me →

185
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:04,931
It's gotten a lot easier.

186
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,934
(Takuya) If you want to have fun, you shouldn't have an affair in the first place.

187
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:11,505
(Yosuke) It's not that easy for humans.

188
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:16,443
(Takuya) I guess so. (Yosuke) If you try having an affair, you'll understand.

189
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,445
(Takuya) That's why it's still early for jokes like that.

190
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,447
📱(Notification sound) (Yosuke) Bad bad.

191
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:23,450
>> Yay! (Takuya) No, it's dirty. What?

192
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:25,452
>> No, it's nothing. (Yosuke) What?

193
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,954
Pushing again?

194
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:31,525
(Takuya) It's nothing. This is amazing.

195
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,969
(Chiharu) Then I'll contact you again. >> Yeah.

196
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:46,473
Ah, but aren't you going to be busy with moving?

197
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,476
(Chiharu) Moving? >> Are you coming back here?

198
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:51,478
(Chiharu) Huh? >> Chiharu's mother is →

199
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:53,547
That's what I said when I came to my farm.

200
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,983
``Chiharu is coming back this time.''

201
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,486
So, thank you again."

202
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:01,988
Looks like they'll be living in two households.

203
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,424
(Chiharu) No, I don't have any plans like that.

204
00:12:04,491 --> 00:12:08,929
>> Huh? So what was the story about?

205
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:11,998
I was also working.

206
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:22,442
(Mina) You've been watching me from the window.

207
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:30,016
(laughter)

208
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:38,024
Ah!

209
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:47,033
(Chiharu) Looks delicious.

210
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:55,976
>> How much do you think this dress costs?

211
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:57,978
(Chiharu) Yeah...｡

212
00:12:58,044 --> 00:12:59,980
>>25,000 yen.

213
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:03,416
I bought something with a floral pattern before I was old enough.

214
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:05,919
(Chiharu) It suits you. >> Really?

215
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:07,988
(Chiharu) Yeah. >> I'm really happy.

216
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:14,928
Me, after getting married →

217
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:17,931
I've never bought One Piece.

218
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:22,435
All the clothes are easy to move in, affordable, and plain.

219
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:26,439
My husband and I had promised to buy an apartment.

220
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:32,012
So wearing clothes like that didn't bother me at all.

221
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:36,950
But→

222
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:41,955
You told me before that your husband was having an affair.

223
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:44,457
(Chiharu) Yes.

224
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:46,960
>>To the other woman→

225
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:50,964
I bought a dress that cost 50,000 yen.

226
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:52,966
(Chiharu) Maybe a floral pattern?

227
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:57,470
>> Yes! And even though it costs 50,000 yen, it's really lame.

228
00:13:57,537 --> 00:14:00,974
I'd rather walk around naked than wear something like that.

229
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,410
(Chiharu) Ahahaha…｡

230
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:07,414
>>That's why I decided.

231
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,418
When I have an affair, I always do it with my own money →

232
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:14,487
I'll buy you a dress with a floral pattern.

233
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:18,992
Although I couldn't afford 50,000 yen.

234
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:24,931
(Chiharu) Where did you meet him?

235
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:27,500
>> App exclusively for married people.

236
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:30,937
Do you know? (Chiharu) Yes.

237
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:32,939
At work or something.

238
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:34,941
>> That's amazing.

239
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:37,444
I was surprised that some places have over 500,000 members.

240
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,446
So open →

241
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:42,449
I didn't know there was a time when married people could meet each other.

242
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:44,951
(Chiharu) So, is he also married?

243
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:50,023
>> Yeah, but I hear you're thinking about divorce.

244
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:55,962
(Chiharu) Hey, Mina-san started that app →

245
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:58,031
Revenge against your husband?

246
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:04,904
>> That's how I felt at first →

247
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:07,474
Not that it didn't happen, but...

248
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:11,912
But for myself.

249
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:13,913
(Chiharu) For yourself?

250
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:18,918
>> I wanted time to truly enjoy myself.

251
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:23,423
My husband doesn't even notice that I bought this dress.

252
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:27,427
But he says, ``It suits you, it's wonderful.''

253
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:29,429
It's okay if it's a lie.

254
00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:33,933
I can see myself clearly in someone's eyes.

255
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,505
That alone is so much fun and satisfying.

256
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:46,446
I don't want to associate this kind of fun with a husband like that.

257
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:50,950
This is what I started for me→

258
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:54,955
I found it myself.

259
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:58,024
That's why I'm happy.

260
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:06,132
(Chiharu) I see.

261
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,470
(Takuya) I'm home.

00:16:38,932 --> 00:16:43,370

265
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:45,872
(Chiharu) What did you say?

266
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:49,442
>> If you have an affair, let's cooperate.

[If Chiharu-chan commits an affair, I will also cooperate. What do you think? ]

(Chiharu) [Okay, I'll make sure you don't find out]

269
00:17:00,954 --> 00:17:03,957
>>Won't you cooperate as promised?

270
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:08,895

(Takuya) Great timing, I just received a call from Mina.

276
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:34,421
"Can I borrow something from Chiharu?" (Chiharu) Huh?

277
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:37,924
(Takuya) Huh? Are you going on a trip with Mina this weekend?

278
00:17:37,991 --> 00:17:40,927
(Chiharu) Ah, yes, okay?

279
00:17:40,994 --> 00:17:42,929
(Takuya) Of course, have fun.

296
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:33,413
(Yosuke) No, Chiharu-chan is also trying hard.

297
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,415
If you could show me where you are in real time→

298
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:37,417
That will make you feel at ease. (Takuya) Yeah.

299
