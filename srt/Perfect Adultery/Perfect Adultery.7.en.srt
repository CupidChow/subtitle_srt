(Yosuke) Well, that's...

173
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,026
(Takuya) It's for me.

174
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:42,536
(Takuya) I guess they were trying to stop the divorce somehow.

175
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,540
I'm afraid I'll regret it.

176
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:51,478
(Yosuke) Well, the general idea is correct. >> The general idea is correct.

177
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:54,981
(Takuya) Honestly, I'm fine with what I wrote →

178
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,984
I couldn't pass judgment.

179
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,053
I'm still confused.

180
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,991
I couldn't even tell Chiharu properly.

181
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:10,430
(Chiharu) I feel relieved.

182
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:12,432
(Takuya) Huh?

183
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:16,436
(Chiharu) I thought that every time Takuya said it was okay.

184
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:19,940
I wonder if you're trying to kill your feelings by being shy about me.

185
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:23,443
Takuya continues to hold back →

186
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,012
I wonder if it will go back to normal.

187
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:34,454
(Chiharu) I don't know what to say even though I planted the seeds myself.

188
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:39,960
But I heard that Takuya is trying to decide properly →

189
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:42,028
I felt relieved.

190
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:47,968
(Chiharu) I don't need your kindness.

191
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:50,036
Because it's okay.

192
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:58,979
(Yosuke) Hey, do you know? (Takuya) What?

193
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:02,482
(Yosuke) If your husband has an affair, the probability of divorce is about 30%.

194
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:06,920
However, if your wife has an affair, there is a 70% chance of divorce.

195
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:10,924
In other words, women are open-minded, but men are narrow-minded.

196
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:15,428
They are delicate creatures that would get hurt if they were betrayed that much.

197
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:18,932
So even if you choose divorce →

198
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:20,934
He's not a terrible man.

199
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:22,936
(Takuya) Hmm.

200
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:24,938
(Yosuke) Besides, I won't stop now.

201
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:27,440
No matter what choice you make this time →

202
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:29,442
I seriously support you.

203
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:32,445
>> I've been through something terrible like that, and I'll never stop it again.

204
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:34,447
(Takuya) No, but I scavenge for trash.→

205
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:36,950
If that's the case, they'll probably think he's a dangerous guy and fight back.

206
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:40,453
>> Garbage? What is that?

207
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,957
(Takuya) Eh, you picked up my garbage, right?

208
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:45,959
(Yosuke) As expected, it's not that far.

209
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:47,961
>> That's too serious, isn't it?

210
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:50,030
(Takuya) Well then...

211
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:54,968

00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:56,897
📱 Yeah?

223

(Chiharu) Are you okay?

224
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:02,469
📱 Ah, no (Takuya) I suddenly felt anxious about something.

225
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:07,907
(Chiharu) It's okay.

226
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:10,910
(Takuya) That would be great.

227
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:12,912
Hey. (Yosuke) Chiharu-chan?

228
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:14,914
Takuya: Can I borrow it and go for a drink?

229
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:17,417
Yeah yeah, see you then.

230
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:20,921
(Takuya) Hey, why are you cutting it without permission? (Yosuke) Fine, let's go.

231
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:24,924
>> Let's go, let's go. (Yosuke) Tonight...

232
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:26,993
It's Mexican.

233
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:32,499
>> I've been thinking about it for a long time.

234
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,937
I wonder what Chiharu-san wants from me.

235
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,377
love freedom→

236
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:48,381
Peace of mind, stimulation, pleasure.

237

None of it clicked.

238
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,454
But I finally understood.

239
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,891
(Chiharu) What?

240
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,894
>>Coexistence.

241
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,396
We shouldn't leave.

242
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:06,466
We need to be together more often.

243

(Chiharu) I...

244
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:23,917
(Chiharu) I love my husband.

245
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:26,419
Honestly, I only want to love Takuya.

246

247
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:33,360
I will pour my love only into Takuya→

248
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:36,863
I want everything about Takuya to be mine.

249
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,866
absolutely.

250
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:42,869
So→

251
00:16:42,936 --> 00:16:46,439
I'm dissipating those feelings.

252
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:51,945
(Chiharu) Dispersion of love.

253
00:16:54,948 --> 00:16:56,950
>> Scattered?

254
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:01,888

255
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:04,958

>> What is that?

259
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:19,472
(Chiharu) No matter how many people have affairs, the reason is always the same.

260
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:24,411
Because Takuya doesn't hate me.

261
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:26,980
That's all I have.

262
00:17:33,987 --> 00:17:37,490

(Takuya) What are you saying?

273
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:32,979
(Takuya) Why? I have to call the police. (Chiharu) Takuya.

274
00:18:33,046 --> 00:18:36,416

(Takuya) Do you still like him?

277
00:18:58,004 --> 00:19:00,440
Is that why you didn't call the police?

278
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:04,444
(Chiharu) Absolutely not. (Takuya) Then why?

279
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:08,448
(Chiharu) I don't want to cause any more trouble to Takuya.

280
