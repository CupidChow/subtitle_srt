(Takuya) No, it's a challenge...

180
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,975
(Takuya) How to open it.

During my student days.

200
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:35,936
I fell in love at first sight with Chiharu, who was my senior.

201
00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:38,938
I wooed you many times, dozens of times →

202
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:42,008
I was really happy when I got the OK.

00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:53,953
Chiharu told me that she wanted to break up with me.

00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,956
Even if I asked you the reason, you wouldn't tell me.

207
00:15:57,023 --> 00:15:59,960
But I loved it →

208
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:02,962
I could never forget it.

So when I looked at Mr. Yoshioka's smartphone and saw Chiharu →

210
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:10,470
I was surprised.

211
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:14,040
I thought I'd definitely take it away.

212
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:19,045
[Sometimes I think I should try it too.]

213
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:23,049
[Obviously seize the marriage! 〕

214
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:26,986
(Takuya) That's why you've always been with me.

>> I thought it would be faster to drop Mr. Yoshioka in order to get him to break up with me.

216
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:35,428
But you pretend to be pure and dodge.

217
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,998
Yoshioka-san is seriously annoying.

218
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,936
(Takuya) I mean, I really loved Chiharu.

Chiharu had affairs with four people.

00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:54,013
Mr. Yoshioka, a pure-hearted bastard, won't be able to accept it.

223
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,454
Don't force yourself.

224
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,456
Quickly break up →

225
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:07,026
The most recommended option is to return Chiharu to me.

226
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:15,034
I don't care about the weight of love at all.

227

If Chiharu still says she's worried →

228
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,975
It's okay to disperse.

229
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,979
(Takuya) It means having an affair with someone else.

230
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,983
>>Because I'm happy just having Chiharu by my side.

231

00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:39,058
Mr. Yoshioka, this is what love is.

233
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:50,503
