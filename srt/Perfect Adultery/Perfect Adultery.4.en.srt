00:00:11,012 --> 00:00:12,947
(Takuya) Huh? ⟨What I saw there→

3
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:16,450
It was Chiharu having a work meeting⟩

4
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:18,452
⟨The relief was short-lived→

5
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,955
It turns out that he was tailing Chiharu⟩

6
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,957
(Chiharu) I think it was wrong to let Takuya misunderstand →

7
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,959
But there was really nothing.

8
00:00:25,026 --> 00:00:27,461
(Takuya) I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

9
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:33,033

(Takuya) Good morning. (Chiharu) Good morning.

13
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:50,484
It's ice cream today. (Takuya)

14
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,486
(Chiharu) Good. (Takuya) That's fine.

15
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:55,055
(Chiharu) Please take this. (Takuya) Thank you.

16
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,993
(Chiharu) Oh! (Takuya) Ah, sorry! wait a minute!

17
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,995
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...I'm really sorry.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

(Chiharu) Wow, I liked this dress.

20

(Takuya) I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, I'm really sorry.

21
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:10,438
(Chiharu) It's a lie, it's a joke. (Takuya) What?

22
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:12,940
(Chiharu) I think it will come off if I wash it right away. (Takuya) No, no... I'm really sorry.

23
00:01:13,007 --> 00:01:14,942
(Chiharu) Oh! (Takuya) Huh?

24
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:16,444
(Chiharu) Look at this.

25
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:20,014
It looks like a four-leaf clover, doesn't it?

26
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:24,018
Maybe something good will happen, hehe.

27
00:01:30,024 --> 00:01:31,959
(Salesperson) Yes, sorry to have kept you waiting.

28
00:01:32,026 --> 00:01:35,463
(cheers and applause)

29
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:37,465
(Yosuke) It's my treat today, Takuya.

30
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:39,967
(Takuya) Huh? Is that okay? Yay! (Koi) Ah, I did it!

31
00:01:40,034 --> 00:01:41,969
(Yosuke) Because you're different, you're different. >> That's fine, already.

32
00:01:42,036 --> 00:01:43,971
(Takuya) Hey, if you don't mind, can I invite Chiharu too?

33
00:01:44,038 --> 00:01:45,973
>>Ah, it's totally fine, I'm skeptical.→

34
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,975
You caused me trouble, Yo-chan.

35

(Takuya's voice) What are you doing now?

39
00:01:58,052 --> 00:02:00,488
How about joining us after the painting class?

40
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:02,490
(Yosuke) Ah, I'm the same as the one on the left.

41
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:04,925
Please have a lot. (Ko) Please.

42

(Takuya) Hahahaha...｡

43
00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:10,931
(Yosuke) No, but it was really a misunderstanding.

44
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:13,434
>> Really... Huh? That's why the person I met in the lounge was →

45
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:15,436
You mean we met at work, right?

46
00:02:15,503 --> 00:02:18,439
(Takuya) Yes, even the sales person at the client.

47
00:02:18,506 --> 00:02:20,941
>> Good, really good. 📱(Vibration sound)

48
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:23,944
(Takuya) Ah, Chiharu, it's still a painting class.

49
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:27,948
(Chiharu's voice) Looks delicious! But I'm sorry, it's not finished yet.

50
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:30,951

51

wait a minute! (Takuya) What?

52
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:36,957
>> This girl looks like Oshi! (Takuya) I was surprised.

53
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:38,959
(Yosuke) No, you must have said something like that the other day.

54
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:42,463
(Kou) It's similar to Oshi, it's dangerous.

55
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:45,466
(Yosuke) Wataru Stop it, you won't be treated as a partner.

56
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:47,468
>> That Yang, even if it doesn't work 100 times →

57
00:02:47,535 --> 00:02:49,470
Something might change the 101st time →

58
00:02:49,537 --> 00:02:51,472
Do you know the words? (Yosuke) You always give up so easily.

59
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:53,974
(Kou) No, I really won't give up this time. (Yosuke) Your dream won't come true.

60
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,976
(Kou) Why are you saying that? (Yosuke) I'll say it.

61
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:57,978
(Kou) Why? (Yosuke) It won't always come true!

62
00:02:58,045 --> 00:03:00,981
(Ko) Stop saying it in a strong way. Just stop saying it in a strong way.

63
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:03,918
Hey, it will come true, right? Taku-chan

64
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:05,920
(Takuya) It will come true. (Wataru) Right!

65
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:07,922
(Takuya) It will come true. (Wataru) Is that so? Absolutely.

66
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:10,991
Because I'm really serious this time. (Yosuke) Even if I'm serious, it won't come true.

67
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:17,932
(Sasaki) What kind of relationship do you think those people have?

68
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:20,434
(Chiharu) Well →

69
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:23,938
We're both in love, but we're not dating yet.

70
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:26,941
No matter how you look at it, they're a couple.

71
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:30,444
>>For me, I think we've been together for quite a while.

72
00:03:30,511 --> 00:03:32,446
(Chiharu) Why?

73
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:34,448
(Sasaki) Neither of them are trying to match their stride.

74
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:35,950
(Chiharu) Huh?

75
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:38,452
(Sasaki) You know, before we started dating, you were so attentive to the little things.

76
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,955
You will try to match the other person.

77
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:45,025
But those two look like a natural fit.

78
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:50,531
(Chiharu) I see you a lot, that kind of thing.

79
00:03:55,536 --> 00:03:59,974
>> What about Chiharu-san? How are you and your husband?

80
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,911
(Chiharu) Hmm, it fits.

81
00:04:03,978 --> 00:04:08,916
But I think it's because the other side is agreeing to it.

82
00:04:08,983 --> 00:04:10,918
>> Hmm.

83
00:04:10,985 --> 00:04:12,920
(Chiharu) What? Suddenly.

84
00:04:12,987 --> 00:04:16,490
(Sasaki) No, I think he's a kind person.

85
00:04:18,993 --> 00:04:23,430
Then what should I do? You're in danger of divorce right now.

86
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:25,432
(Chiharu) It's okay.

87

(Sasaki) Even though you two were seen together?

88
00:04:29,003 --> 00:04:33,507
(Chiharu) Do you know what is the correct thing to do when you are suspected of infidelity?

89
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:41,448
As long as there is no proof, they will continue to lie to the end.

90
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:43,450
