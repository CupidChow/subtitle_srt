Because my husband is the type of person who will never stray from that →

148
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,397
It gives me a sense of security or something that I can trust.

(Yosuke) In the first place, isn't Takuya not enough for Chiharu-chan?

152
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:33,413
Because he's a weak bastard who can't break out of the norm.

153
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:37,417

154
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:39,920

155
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:42,923
In the first place, I said you were a weakling and a pest.

156
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,925
(Yosuke) But I guess that's what it means to be angry.

I also felt like I wanted to stand out from the norm.→

158
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:50,931
Is it because there is? (Takuya) It's noisy.

159
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:52,933
(Yosuke) Ah! (Kou) I was surprised.

160
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,936
(Yosuke) Maybe sex is normal so you're not satisfied?

161
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:57,938
(Takuya) On the other hand, it would be more dangerous if it wasn't normal.

162
00:08:58,005 --> 00:09:00,440
>> Is there a response in the first place? (Takuya) I'm doing it to some degree.

163
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:02,376
(Yosuke) Wataru: That's why you're an amateur virgin.

164
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:04,378
>> Why do you say that? Stop, why...

165
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:07,881
(Yosuke) I spend 4 weeks a week with my current wife, and 4 days a week with my mistress.

166
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:10,884
>>Yo-chan, your physical strength is a monster.

167
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:13,387
(Yosuke) In other words, it doesn't matter whether you do it or not.

168
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:15,389
After all, adultery is common sense.

169
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:17,391
(Takuya) Don't make stupid statements.

170
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:21,895
(Yosuke) Okay? 40% of men have affairs and 20% of women have affairs.

171
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:23,964
But is there a difference between men and women here?

172
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:28,402
But when we reach the age when infidelity is common →

173
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:30,904
Both men and women agree that they are in their 30s.

174
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:34,408
I mean now! In any case, your 30s are the period of extramarital affairs →

175
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:36,410
Everyone should do their best without regrets.

176
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:40,914
So it's no wonder that Chiharu-chan is so active.

177
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:42,916
(Takuya) You should be careful.

178
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:45,419
(Yosuke) But there must be something uneasy about it?

179
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:47,421
>> Why don't you take a look? Smartphones etc.

180
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:49,423
(Yosuke) Yes.

181
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:51,425
(Takuya) I looked into it, but I found out.

182
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:54,928
>>Eh, eh... something sucks.

183
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:56,930
(Yosuke) What did you see?

184
00:09:56,997 --> 00:10:00,934
(Takuya) No, well, it's a chat app with everyone or something like that...

185
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:03,937
(Yosuke) That's the same as not investigating it.

186
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:06,506
Okay? First, I'll teach you the basics.

187
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,455
(Chiharu) Sharing location information?

188
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:25,459
>> I allowed it on those conditions along with the game ban.

189
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:27,461
(Chiharu) Did your husband approve of that?

190
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:29,463
>> Reluctantly.

191
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:31,465
(Chiharu) So, do you check it sometimes?

192
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:33,467
>> At first.

193
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:37,904
But once I saw it, I was no longer interested.

194
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,906
As expected, I've come this far →

195
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:43,477
I thought he probably wouldn't do it, but...

196
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,981
I'm still worried.

197
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:54,921
That's why even when I'm with my husband these days,

198
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,491
I can't smile well.

199
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,497
(Yosuke) Do you know what this means?

200
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:07,934
It would be dangerous if the person you were having an affair with contacted you.

201
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,936
That's why you turn it over like this.

202
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,439
This is the behavior of adulterous people.

203
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:14,441
(Takuya) Is that it? (Yosuke) That's why →

204
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:16,443
Chiharu-chan, what do you think? Haven't you done it?

205
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,446
(Takuya) That's why you shouldn't doubt Chiharu. (Yosuke) You want to make sure she's safe, right?

206
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:22,949
If I hadn't done this, it would have been 100% Shiro.

207
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:26,520
When you put your smartphone down, is the screen facing up or down?

208
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,023
(Chiharu) [I also saw about 3 of them today]

209
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:35,896
(Takuya) Top!

210
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:38,899
(Yosuke) Should you bring your smartphone to the toilet or bath?

211
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:40,967
(Chiharu) [Then I'll take a bath first]

212
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:44,404
(Takuya) I'll leave it behind.

213
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:46,973
(Yosuke) Has your makeup and clothes changed before you know it?

214
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:52,412
(Takuya) We've been together ever since we met.

215
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:54,915
(Yosuke) Do you often ask me about my plans?

216
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:56,917
(Takuya) [Okay, I'll go have a drink with Yosuke and the others.]

217
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:58,418
(Chiharu) [Understood]

218
00:11:58,485 --> 00:12:00,420
(Takuya) No, they won't listen unless I tell them.

219
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:02,422
>> Chiharu-chan, it's Shiro after all.

220
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:04,925
(Yosuke) There's something wrong with you. He's been so kind lately.

221
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,427
Have you changed the books you read or have fewer conversations?

222
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:11,498
(Takuya) Hey, aren't you really trying to black out Chiharu?

223
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,938
(Mina) That's right. Speaking of infidelity, do you know the story of Mr. Shirai?

224
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:20,440
(Chiharu) Mr. Shirai? >>Yes.

225
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:22,442
Everyone is talking about it →

226
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:25,445
Apparently someone saw him entering the hotel with a woman.

227
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:27,948
Isn't that adultery?

228
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:30,450
(Chiharu) Who is the other party? (Mina) I don't know.

229
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:35,388
I wonder who it is, but I guess it's someone from the art class.

230
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,390
(Chiharu) Isn't that your wife?

231
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:41,394
(Mina) That's right, Mr. Shirai's wife is from a foreign country.

232
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:45,899
However, the person I entered the hotel with was clearly Japanese.

233
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:47,400

234

>> Excuse me.

238
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:03,416
(Chiharu) Mr. Shirai's wife is a foreigner.

239
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:05,919
>> What? How to open it.

240
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:10,423
(Chiharu) Don't you know that this way the contents won't splash out when you open it?

241
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:13,426
>> Yeah, that's the first time I've heard of it.

242
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:15,929
Who taught you this?

243
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:20,433
(Chiharu) Ah... my mother... I guess.

246
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:30,944
(Takuya) This? Chiharu told me that it wouldn't bounce.

247
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:32,946
(Yosuke) How do you know how to open it like that?

248
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:36,383
Oh, maybe the person you had an affair with told you about it.

249
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:38,885
(Takuya) Don't worry, he said, "I saw it on TV."

252

00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,316
>>I really didn't want to tell you about that shop.

333
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:14,387
This is the store where I used to go shopping with someone I used to date.

334
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:18,391
(Takuya) Ah, that's right.

335
00:19:20,894 --> 00:19:25,331
>> He was someone I loved, loved, and loved.

336
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:28,334
But we broke up.

337
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:32,405
That's why when I go to that store, I remember that person.

338
00:19:34,908 --> 00:19:38,411
(Takuya) Sorry for something.

339
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:43,850
>> But I thought Mr. Yoshioka would overwrite it.

340
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:46,419
More and more exciting memories.

341
00:19:51,424 --> 00:19:54,794
(Salesclerk) I'll take exactly 3,150 yen with you.

342
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:57,797
Here is the receipt in return. (Takuya) Thank you very much.

343
00:19:57,864 --> 00:20:00,300
>>Oh, I forgot my wallet.

344
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:03,303
(Takuya) Ah, then I'd like to thank you for introducing me to the shop.→

345
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,805
I'm sorry I'm having lunch today rather than having a feast.

346
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:10,310
>> No, I don't like it, it becomes a feast right away.

347
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,812
Does Yoshioka-san run PAOPAO?

348
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:15,315
(Takuya) Ah, yes. >> Well then, I'll give it back to you.

349
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,383
(Takuya) Yes.

350
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,821
You're doing something right.

351
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:25,325
>>If you are pampered by everyone, you will be cheap.

352
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:28,328
I'm a good woman who is kind to me when the time comes.

353
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,330
(Takuya) I see.

354
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:33,333
(Rino) Yes, thank you for sending it.

355
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,902
(Takuya) You're welcome.
