(Seven years ago)

25
00:01:52,522 --> 00:01:53,762
(When I was young,)

26
00:01:53,762 --> 00:01:56,442
(I thought happiness was
all about appearances.)

27
00:01:57,122 --> 00:01:58,922
(Thinking that this love is real,)

28
00:01:59,762 --> 00:02:00,802
(not realizing that)

29
00:02:00,882 --> 00:02:02,482
(giving in to the wrong person)

30
00:02:02,482 --> 00:02:04,442
(always results in more exhaustion.)

31
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,808
(A 80% chance of
cooler temperatures and rain at 8 p.m.)

32
00:02:24,882 --> 00:02:25,402
Hello?

33
00:02:25,962 --> 00:02:27,282
Ran, I'm sorry.

34
00:02:27,602 --> 00:02:29,522
I am unable to pick you up
due to an unexpected meeting.

35
00:02:29,562 --> 00:02:31,522
Let's meet right away
at the art gallery.

36
00:02:32,602 --> 00:02:33,082
Okay.

37
00:03:01,042 --> 00:03:04,442
(When we confront
our past hurts and vanity,)

38
00:03:04,882 --> 00:03:07,642
(admitting that
we misunderstood the essence of love,)

39
00:03:07,882 --> 00:03:09,082
(we will discover that)

40
00:03:09,642 --> 00:03:11,002
(starting over)

41
00:03:11,562 --> 00:03:13,762
(should not be so difficult.)

=Episode 8=
(Time lost cannot be recovered)

43
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:43,562
Hey, Miss An.

44
00:03:43,722 --> 00:03:45,002
Have you seen the plan?

45
00:03:45,562 --> 00:03:46,002
Tian Xin,

46
00:03:46,282 --> 00:03:47,722
I've sent you the feedback.

47
00:03:47,722 --> 00:03:48,722
I've already marked the parts

48
00:03:48,722 --> 00:03:49,882
that require adjustment.

49
00:03:50,442 --> 00:03:53,282
Peng and Yaoyao's
artistic styles are also excellent.

50
00:03:53,282 --> 00:03:54,362
Simply stick to that.

51
00:03:54,362 --> 00:03:55,282
You guys incorporate it.

52
00:03:55,562 --> 00:03:57,442
Okay, I'll sort it out with Peng.

53
00:03:59,002 --> 00:04:00,202
What's wrong, Miss An?

54
00:04:02,162 --> 00:04:02,802
It's nothing.

55
00:04:03,082 --> 00:04:04,642
The power is out at my house.

56
00:04:05,282 --> 00:04:06,442
I have made my point clear.

57
00:04:06,442 --> 00:04:08,722
You guys just stick with this.
Thank you for your hard work.

58
00:04:24,688 --> 00:04:25,904
(Payment Platform, System busy)

59
00:04:27,482 --> 00:04:28,442
Why?

60
00:04:29,562 --> 00:04:31,682
Isn't it available 24 hours a day?

61
00:04:34,722 --> 00:04:36,242
Where did I put my candles?

62
00:05:06,162 --> 00:05:07,562
My house's power went out.

63
00:05:07,562 --> 00:05:09,722
I can't pay my electricity bill

64
00:05:09,922 --> 00:05:11,362
because there is a system error.

65
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,282
Can I stay here for a while?

66
00:05:13,282 --> 00:05:14,802
I need to finish presentation revisions.

67
00:05:15,042 --> 00:05:16,162
I've to propose it tomorrow.

68
00:05:17,202 --> 00:05:18,802
You've already come in before asking me.

69
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,282
The living room has an outlet.

70
00:05:25,762 --> 00:05:26,482
Go there.

71
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:53,162
Eat it.

72
00:05:57,202 --> 00:05:59,042
Well then, I won't be polite.

73
00:05:59,042 --> 00:06:00,162
Is this for me?

74
00:06:02,602 --> 00:06:03,362
Thank you.

75
00:06:20,482 --> 00:06:22,002
Miss An, how is the proposal going?

76
00:06:24,802 --> 00:06:26,482
It should have been ready by now,

77
00:06:27,162 --> 00:06:28,482
given how long it's been.

78
00:06:28,882 --> 00:06:30,882
But the closer we get to
the day of the proposal meeting,

79
00:06:31,602 --> 00:06:33,482
the more I feel like something is wrong.

80
00:06:40,802 --> 00:06:41,602
Look.

81
00:06:46,042 --> 00:06:47,802
Regarding this slogan,
I'm not completely certain.

82
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,240
(Slogan)

83
00:06:57,322 --> 00:06:58,602
I hope you have one more hour of love

84
00:06:59,402 --> 00:07:00,482
in your busy day

85
00:07:01,082 --> 00:07:03,042
on this lonely night.

86
00:07:28,762 --> 00:07:29,882
I think it's pretty good.

87
00:07:59,362 --> 00:07:59,922
Teacher.

88
00:08:00,402 --> 00:08:01,322
Excuse me.

89
00:08:01,722 --> 00:08:03,602
"Disaster Star Lovers"
is on which shelf?

90
00:08:04,322 --> 00:08:05,642
Check that bookshelf over there.

91
00:08:06,202 --> 00:08:06,642
Thank you.

92
00:08:29,002 --> 00:08:30,362
Hi there.

93
00:08:32,642 --> 00:08:33,362
Hey.

94
00:08:36,762 --> 00:08:38,482
Are you going to borrow this book?

95
00:08:45,362 --> 00:08:47,162
Are you going to
borrow both of these books?

96
00:08:47,976 --> 00:08:50,171
(Disaster Star Lovers)

97
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,322
Sorry for the interruption.

98
00:09:30,322 --> 00:09:31,842
When do you want me to start officially

99
00:09:31,842 --> 00:09:33,562
recording the Fragment Time Boyfriend?

100
00:09:35,322 --> 00:09:37,002
How considerate of you, little brother.

101
00:09:38,922 --> 00:09:39,882
Who's your little brother?

102
00:09:40,202 --> 00:09:41,242
How many times have I told you?

103
00:09:41,442 --> 00:09:43,082
Don't sweat the details.

104
00:09:45,162 --> 00:09:47,962
Then that section will remain empty.

105
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:54,000
(Line-up, Heisha)

106
00:11:23,002 --> 00:11:23,682
What's wrong?

107
00:11:24,922 --> 00:11:25,682
Nothing, nothing.

108
00:11:25,682 --> 00:11:27,002
I-I fell down.

109
00:11:33,082 --> 00:11:34,642
Um... Can I

110
00:11:35,642 --> 00:11:36,402
go in?

111
00:11:36,602 --> 00:11:38,242
No. No need.

112
00:11:38,722 --> 00:11:40,002
I-I'm fine.

113
00:11:41,082 --> 00:11:41,842
Thank you.

114
00:11:44,842 --> 00:11:45,322
Then...

115
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:47,882
Call me for anything.

116
00:11:49,802 --> 00:11:50,362
Okay.

117
00:12:33,442 --> 00:12:35,642
My house still has no power.

118
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:38,002
I saw you were sleeping just now,

119
00:12:38,402 --> 00:12:40,202
so I used your bathroom.

120
00:12:40,402 --> 00:12:41,442
You don't mind, do you?

121
00:12:46,962 --> 00:12:47,642
Yan Yue?

122
00:12:56,682 --> 00:12:57,322
Do you mind?

123
00:12:57,962 --> 00:12:58,562
I...

124
00:12:59,002 --> 00:13:00,202
don't mind.

125
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,482
Why would I mind?

126
00:13:04,442 --> 00:13:05,322
How did you fall?

127
00:13:05,562 --> 00:13:06,322
Are you hurt?

128
00:13:06,882 --> 00:13:08,762
I hit the doorknob.

129
00:13:08,762 --> 00:13:09,202
It's okay.

130
00:13:09,562 --> 00:13:10,322
Just a little scrape.

131
00:13:24,562 --> 00:13:26,442
Yan Yue, I'll go back first.

132
00:13:27,442 --> 00:13:28,402
Wait a minute.

133
00:13:31,682 --> 00:13:32,122
There.

134
00:13:36,002 --> 00:13:36,682
Sit.

135
00:13:50,682 --> 00:13:51,322
It may hurt.

136
00:13:51,682 --> 00:13:52,202
Bear with it.

137
00:13:57,202 --> 00:13:57,962
Does it hurt a lot?

138
00:14:18,322 --> 00:14:19,362
Be careful next time.

139
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:23,442
Don't be so careless.

140
00:14:25,202 --> 00:14:27,322
I am focusing on my work.

141
00:14:28,442 --> 00:14:29,082
Really?

142
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:31,562
You are constantly
making excuses for yourself.

143
00:14:33,202 --> 00:14:34,442
You're just a fool.

144
00:14:46,882 --> 00:14:47,442
Thank you.

145
00:14:49,002 --> 00:14:49,682
Tell me about it.

146
00:14:51,562 --> 00:14:52,202
What?

147
00:14:52,442 --> 00:14:53,442
The proposal.

148
00:14:54,562 --> 00:14:56,642
How is Miss An, who is

149
00:14:57,202 --> 00:14:58,082
focusing on her work,

150
00:14:58,082 --> 00:14:59,362
going to propose on this game?

151
00:15:00,562 --> 00:15:03,842
No way. It's embarrassing.

152
00:15:04,202 --> 00:15:05,442
What's so embarrassing?

153
00:15:05,682 --> 00:15:06,442
Besides,

154
00:15:07,202 --> 00:15:08,202
what embarrassment about you

155
00:15:08,202 --> 00:15:08,722
is new to me?

156
00:15:11,442 --> 00:15:12,202
Come on.

157
00:15:12,322 --> 00:15:12,922
Right now,

158
00:15:13,322 --> 00:15:14,442
consider me an investor.

159
00:15:19,642 --> 00:15:21,442
Okay, I'll go back and prepare first.

160
00:15:25,442 --> 00:15:26,842
My house has no power.

161
00:15:27,962 --> 00:15:28,642
I just paid for it.

162
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:29,762
It's on soon.

163
00:15:32,082 --> 00:15:32,442
Thank you.

164
00:15:33,962 --> 00:15:34,842
I will send payment later.

165
00:15:35,962 --> 00:15:36,842
I don't need this money.

166
00:15:46,562 --> 00:15:48,242
Fragment Time Boyfriend

167
00:15:48,242 --> 00:15:50,642
is a female romance mobile game.

168
00:15:50,802 --> 00:15:52,042
We have noticed

169
00:15:52,042 --> 00:15:53,402
that life is full of

170
00:15:53,402 --> 00:15:55,322
wasted fragmentary time.

171
00:15:55,442 --> 00:15:57,162
It is actually

172
00:15:57,162 --> 00:15:59,322
the twenty-fifth hour of the day.

173
00:15:59,682 --> 00:16:00,962
We have differentiated

174
00:16:00,962 --> 00:16:02,402
the four male leads to satisfy

175
00:16:02,402 --> 00:16:03,402
everyone's love expectation

176
00:16:03,402 --> 00:16:05,522
of the twenty-fifth hour.

177
00:16:05,922 --> 00:16:08,242
Imagine yourself coming home from work,

178
00:16:08,242 --> 00:16:10,282
dragging your tired body,

179
00:16:10,282 --> 00:16:11,602
and unexpectedly falling into

180
00:16:11,602 --> 00:16:13,162
a space-time rift.

181
00:16:13,402 --> 00:16:15,042
You can get the twenty-fifth hour

182
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:16,402
beyond the twenty-four hours

183
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,402
in this space-time rift.

184
00:16:18,802 --> 00:16:20,962
It's your own parallel time.

185
00:16:21,282 --> 00:16:22,962
You can choose

186
00:16:22,962 --> 00:16:23,802
your favorite boyfriend

187
00:16:23,802 --> 00:16:25,402
and spend that hour with him

188
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:27,722
in that space-time rift.

189
00:16:28,722 --> 00:16:29,122
Okay.

190
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:31,522
That's all for the
"Fragment Time Boyfriend"

191
00:16:31,522 --> 00:16:33,162
project proposal.

192
00:16:35,802 --> 00:16:36,402
Is it okay?

193
00:16:36,842 --> 00:16:37,402
Excellent.

194
00:16:38,522 --> 00:16:39,522
What is your project's

195
00:16:39,522 --> 00:16:41,402
main selling point to attract investors?

196
00:16:41,922 --> 00:16:43,282
High-quality content.

197
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,842
Our company has spent a significant
amount of time developing content

198
00:16:46,042 --> 00:16:47,402
and arranging plots.

199
00:16:47,402 --> 00:16:48,282
Very solid.

200
00:16:48,802 --> 00:16:50,042
Is there any detailed data

201
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:51,522
to back this up?

202
00:16:53,162 --> 00:16:53,642
There is.

203
00:16:54,282 --> 00:16:55,162
But I did not include it

204
00:16:55,162 --> 00:16:56,642
in my presentation for tomorrow.

205
00:16:56,922 --> 00:16:58,402
I want to devote more time

206
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,042
to content explanation.

207
00:17:00,282 --> 00:17:01,842
Miss Lan also said

208
00:17:02,162 --> 00:17:03,802
that these numbers don't matter to her.

209
00:17:05,282 --> 00:17:07,642
Is the presentation
tomorrow just for Miss Lan?

210
00:17:08,282 --> 00:17:09,402
Is there anyone else?

211
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,722
Yan Yue, you made a good point.

212
00:17:49,962 --> 00:17:51,642
Don't be restrained. Sit down and talk.

213
00:17:53,962 --> 00:17:55,362
Let me introduce you

214
00:17:55,762 --> 00:17:57,002
to Pei Jun, Mr. Pei,

215
00:17:57,002 --> 00:17:58,362
the new director of our company.

216
00:17:59,242 --> 00:18:00,362
Mr. Pei has always had

217
00:18:00,362 --> 00:18:02,362
a keen interest in gaming.

218
00:18:02,722 --> 00:18:03,762
Especially after seeing

219
00:18:03,762 --> 00:18:05,762
the Fragment Time Boyfriend project,

220
00:18:05,762 --> 00:18:07,162
he thought it has a lot of potential.

221
00:18:08,402 --> 00:18:09,362
So, from now on,

222
00:18:09,642 --> 00:18:11,762
Mr. Pei and I will

223
00:18:12,242 --> 00:18:14,242
co-manage the Fragment Time Boyfriend

224
00:18:14,242 --> 00:18:15,362
project.

225
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:17,362
Miss An,

226
00:18:17,842 --> 00:18:18,522
we meet again.

227
00:18:19,242 --> 00:18:19,882
Great to work with.

228
00:18:20,242 --> 00:18:21,242
Speaking of which,

229
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,482
An Ran is also
a graduate of Bowen University.

230
00:18:23,482 --> 00:18:24,402
She's our junior.

231
00:18:24,762 --> 00:18:26,082
Did you happen to meet on campus?

232
00:18:26,962 --> 00:18:28,242
An Ran was so great at our university

233
00:18:28,642 --> 00:18:29,642
that I had to meet her.

234
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:31,002
That's great.

235
00:18:31,362 --> 00:18:32,882
Since you know each other,

236
00:18:32,882 --> 00:18:35,162
future collaboration will be easier.

237
00:18:36,242 --> 00:18:37,482
Miss Lan, can we start?

238
00:18:38,002 --> 00:18:38,482
Sure.

239
00:18:54,722 --> 00:18:56,282
Fragment Time Boyfriend

240
00:18:56,282 --> 00:18:58,482
is a female romance mobile game.

241
00:18:59,162 --> 00:19:02,362
We will create a variety of love scenes

242
00:19:02,362 --> 00:19:03,362
with the main characteristics

243
00:19:03,362 --> 00:19:05,002
of lightness, freedom, and immersion.

244
00:19:05,762 --> 00:19:06,802
You can check out

245
00:19:06,802 --> 00:19:07,722
the game's demo.

246
00:19:09,842 --> 00:19:12,082
We differentiated the character designs

247
00:19:12,082 --> 00:19:13,642
of the four male leads in order to

248
00:19:13,642 --> 00:19:15,242
match different players and expectations

249
00:19:15,242 --> 00:19:16,242
of various dimensions.

250
00:19:16,562 --> 00:19:18,882
(Character Design)
These four male leads are

251
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:21,242
a college teacher, a music producer,

252
00:19:21,682 --> 00:19:23,762
the younger boy next door
in senior year, and a lawyer.

253
00:19:24,362 --> 00:19:26,602
Their personalities
and lives have been different.

254
00:19:27,362 --> 00:19:27,842
Excuse me.

255
00:19:28,562 --> 00:19:29,602
Allow me to interrupt, Miss An.

256
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:31,602
These materials

257
00:19:31,602 --> 00:19:33,842
have been seen before.

258
00:19:33,842 --> 00:19:35,362
But the main question is

259
00:19:36,322 --> 00:19:39,562
what makes Fragment Time Boyfriend

260
00:19:39,842 --> 00:19:42,002
competitive compared to

261
00:19:42,002 --> 00:19:44,122
other female's love games?

262
00:19:48,362 --> 00:19:50,722
In fact, we conducted extensive research

263
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:52,002
on several experienced players.

264
00:19:52,322 --> 00:19:53,842
The words of one girl

265
00:19:53,842 --> 00:19:54,842
made a big impression on me.

266
00:19:55,242 --> 00:19:56,602
Everyone is probably familiar

267
00:19:56,602 --> 00:19:58,082
with the Cinderella story.

268
00:19:58,722 --> 00:20:02,082
Why has the prince never inquired

269
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:05,082
about the comfort of Cinderella

270
00:20:05,602 --> 00:20:07,002
in those seemingly

271
00:20:07,602 --> 00:20:08,602
dazzling crystal shoes?

272
00:20:11,082 --> 00:20:13,282
Many game developers are now

273
00:20:13,322 --> 00:20:14,282
focusing on

274
00:20:14,282 --> 00:20:15,842
the story mode

275
00:20:15,842 --> 00:20:17,842
"domineering CEO falls in love with me."

276
00:20:18,242 --> 00:20:22,362
However, this view of love is outdated.

277
00:20:23,242 --> 00:20:25,082
So the classic story type

278
00:20:25,082 --> 00:20:26,562
of Cinderella and the prince

279
00:20:26,562 --> 00:20:27,602
will not be the main thing

280
00:20:27,602 --> 00:20:29,962
that makes our game competitive.

281
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:31,762
if you mean what you say,

282
00:20:31,882 --> 00:20:32,882
the main characters

283
00:20:32,882 --> 00:20:34,602
in this game are all just regular men.

284
00:20:35,122 --> 00:20:36,082
Do you think that

285
00:20:36,682 --> 00:20:38,082
players will fall in love with them?

286
00:20:38,442 --> 00:20:39,082
Don't

287
00:20:39,562 --> 00:20:41,602
regular people deserve love?

288
00:20:43,082 --> 00:20:45,442
We are trying to break this doubt.

289
00:20:46,882 --> 00:20:49,562
There is a character
in our game who is a lawyer.

290
00:20:49,722 --> 00:20:51,842
He has the personality
of a domineering CEO.

291
00:20:52,362 --> 00:20:54,482
However, because this character

292
00:20:54,482 --> 00:20:56,442
no longer represents the ideal type

293
00:20:56,882 --> 00:20:59,842
of modern ordinary woman,
we added a game mission

294
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:01,602
that can transform him.

295
00:21:02,082 --> 00:21:04,122
Then our players can
customize their boyfriends

296
00:21:04,122 --> 00:21:05,722
to meet their specific requirements.

297
00:21:06,562 --> 00:21:08,602
We hope that all female players

298
00:21:08,842 --> 00:21:09,882
will experience

299
00:21:09,882 --> 00:21:12,602
a true lover's understanding,

300
00:21:12,602 --> 00:21:13,842
empathy, and responsibility.

301
00:21:14,842 --> 00:21:16,842
We also believe that a good game

302
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:19,362
can instill a healthy,

303
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:20,842
positive value system in its players.

304
00:21:24,362 --> 00:21:26,082
Actually, as investors,

305
00:21:26,082 --> 00:21:28,602
we are most concerned with
the game's market competitiveness.

306
00:21:29,682 --> 00:21:30,962
Do you have specific data

307
00:21:30,962 --> 00:21:31,962
to back you up right now?

308
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:35,562
Mr. Pei is very professional.

309
00:21:38,602 --> 00:21:39,842
(Data Analysis)
This is our data support.

310
00:21:46,082 --> 00:21:47,482
Next, I will continue to talk about

311
00:21:47,482 --> 00:21:49,362
how the stories of
the other three characters grew.

312
00:22:00,722 --> 00:22:02,322
That's the end of my game explanation.

313
00:22:03,042 --> 00:22:03,682
Thank you.

314
00:22:14,562 --> 00:22:15,402
As far as I'm aware,

315
00:22:15,842 --> 00:22:18,962
Gaishi Unparalleled
has never independently

316
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,042
operated a mobile game.

317
00:22:20,802 --> 00:22:22,042
So, my recommendation

318
00:22:22,602 --> 00:22:23,802
is to start with the beta version

319
00:22:24,082 --> 00:22:24,962
and see how things go.

320
00:22:29,402 --> 00:22:30,082
Mr. Pei.

321
00:22:31,162 --> 00:22:31,722
I must speak

322
00:22:31,722 --> 00:22:33,362
for them in this matter.

323
00:22:34,282 --> 00:22:36,562
So far, Gaishi Unparalleled

324
00:22:36,562 --> 00:22:37,962
has not independently

325
00:22:37,962 --> 00:22:38,802
operated any projects.

326
00:22:39,322 --> 00:22:40,962
But they have worked
on some big productions.

327
00:22:41,682 --> 00:22:42,562
I believe

328
00:22:43,082 --> 00:22:44,802
they have the most
fundamental production

329
00:22:44,802 --> 00:22:45,682
capabilities.

330
00:22:46,482 --> 00:22:48,562
I fully understand
the doubts of the investors.

331
00:22:48,802 --> 00:22:50,322
We will use the beta test results

332
00:22:50,322 --> 00:22:51,322
to prove it to everyone.

333
00:22:52,562 --> 00:22:53,282
Alright.

334
00:22:53,842 --> 00:22:55,282
When can the beta version be completed?

335
00:22:56,802 --> 00:22:57,482
Next week.

336
00:22:58,402 --> 00:22:59,322
In that case, I believe

337
00:22:59,562 --> 00:23:02,082
that whether we can
successfully collaborate this time

338
00:23:02,082 --> 00:23:04,202
will be determined by
the results of this beta test.

339
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:05,402
Is it okay?

340
00:23:07,562 --> 00:23:07,962
Okay.

341
00:23:10,682 --> 00:23:11,402
Here's the deal.

342
00:23:12,322 --> 00:23:13,602
Miss Lan. Let's set a benchmark.

343
00:23:14,922 --> 00:23:16,042
The beta version's positive rate

344
00:23:16,442 --> 00:23:17,562
must be at least 80%.

345
00:23:21,602 --> 00:23:22,322
Is it okay?

346
00:23:25,202 --> 00:23:25,962
Okay.

347
00:23:29,322 --> 00:23:30,562
Then I am okay too.

348
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:32,322
Let's call it a day.

349
00:23:32,562 --> 00:23:33,322
When you get back,

350
00:23:33,802 --> 00:23:35,082
you should get ready quickly.

351
00:23:35,962 --> 00:23:36,722
Thank you, Miss Lan.

352
00:23:36,722 --> 00:23:37,202
Thank you.

353
00:23:37,202 --> 00:23:37,962
Thank you, Miss Lan.

354
00:23:43,202 --> 00:23:43,762
An Ran.

355
00:23:48,602 --> 00:23:49,802
Many unexpected challenges

356
00:23:49,802 --> 00:23:51,682
will undoubtedly arise
during the investment process.

357
00:23:52,442 --> 00:23:54,322
You can be
certain of success if you prepare

358
00:23:54,962 --> 00:23:56,082
countermeasures ahead of time.

359
00:23:56,722 --> 00:23:57,682
Thank you for the reminder.

360
00:24:12,042 --> 00:24:12,442
Miss An.

361
00:24:13,682 --> 00:24:15,802
Is it okay
if I leave now because I have

362
00:24:15,962 --> 00:24:17,442
another appointment later today?

363
00:24:18,442 --> 00:24:18,802
Sure.

364
00:24:19,162 --> 00:24:19,562
Good job.

365
00:24:20,162 --> 00:24:20,682
Then I'll go.

366
00:24:20,682 --> 00:24:21,082
Bye.

367
00:24:21,162 --> 00:24:22,042
Bye.

368
00:24:25,082 --> 00:24:26,962
What's the matter with Pei Jun?

369
00:24:26,962 --> 00:24:28,322
How can he treat you like this?

370
00:24:29,082 --> 00:24:30,562
He has two faces.

371
00:24:31,082 --> 00:24:33,562
What he said makes sense.

372
00:24:33,802 --> 00:24:35,082
You're still speaking for him.

373
00:24:35,402 --> 00:24:35,802
Alright.

374
00:24:36,442 --> 00:24:38,042
We are capable of
producing quality game.

375
00:24:38,042 --> 00:24:38,482
Why fear him?

376
00:24:39,802 --> 00:24:40,322
By the way,

377
00:24:40,602 --> 00:24:41,562
I asked Yan Yue

378
00:24:41,562 --> 00:24:42,802
to play a game after this one ended.

379
00:24:43,282 --> 00:24:43,722
Are you in?

380
00:24:43,802 --> 00:24:45,082
You are never worried.

381
00:24:45,082 --> 00:24:45,602
That's great.

382
00:24:45,802 --> 00:24:47,082
Playing games sounds good.

383
00:24:47,562 --> 00:24:49,322
I've been worrying
about where to vent my anger.

384
00:24:49,562 --> 00:24:50,602
Do you know how to play games?

385
00:24:50,602 --> 00:24:51,682
You are just joining the fun.

386
00:24:51,682 --> 00:24:52,602
What's it to you?

387
00:24:52,802 --> 00:24:54,322
Stay out of beauty's business.

388
00:24:54,722 --> 00:24:56,402
Don't interfere with
handsome men's games.

389
00:24:56,562 --> 00:24:56,962
You.

390
00:24:57,322 --> 00:24:57,882
Me?

391
00:25:21,962 --> 00:25:22,482
An Ran,

392
00:25:22,802 --> 00:25:25,082
what does he mean exactly?

393
00:25:27,682 --> 00:25:28,842
How would I know?

394
00:25:29,162 --> 00:25:31,282
I don't even know why he was there.

395
00:25:31,282 --> 00:25:33,722
You suddenly added a data support page?

396
00:25:35,562 --> 00:25:37,082
Did you two collude?

397
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:38,082
Are you acting?

398
00:25:40,042 --> 00:25:40,802
Are you fooling us?

399
00:25:41,042 --> 00:25:44,082
Girl, stop your nonsense fantasies.

400
00:25:44,082 --> 00:25:44,962
Mr. Heisha taught me

401
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,482
about the data support page.

402
00:25:56,842 --> 00:25:57,322
Hello?

403
00:25:57,482 --> 00:25:58,202
Hello, Yan Yue.

404
00:25:58,562 --> 00:25:59,562
The second round of auditions

405
00:25:59,842 --> 00:26:00,802
for We Who Love Voices

406
00:26:00,802 --> 00:26:02,082
will begin early next month.

407
00:26:02,562 --> 00:26:03,962
You were invited by the program team

408
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:04,802
to be a judge.

409
00:26:05,162 --> 00:26:05,842
I'm not going.

410
00:26:07,042 --> 00:26:08,882
That show was very popular last season,

411
00:26:09,282 --> 00:26:11,922
and it focuses primarily
on new generation voice actors.

412
00:26:12,042 --> 00:26:13,362
It's tailor-made for you.

413
00:26:13,402 --> 00:26:14,242
No shows for me.

414
00:26:16,002 --> 00:26:16,722
I beg you.

415
00:26:16,722 --> 00:26:17,842
Please think about it again.

416
00:26:18,162 --> 00:26:19,802
It was hard for me
to get this opportunity.

417
00:26:23,722 --> 00:26:24,962
Did you just hear that?

418
00:26:25,322 --> 00:26:27,162
The program he mentioned is...

419
00:26:27,722 --> 00:26:29,802
We Who Love Voices.

420
00:26:29,802 --> 00:26:30,322
Right.

421
00:26:30,962 --> 00:26:31,802
It went viral on

422
00:26:31,802 --> 00:26:33,562
social media last year, right?

423
00:26:33,962 --> 00:26:35,082
You're a big fan of it.

424
00:26:35,562 --> 00:26:36,962
Why would he pass up

425
00:26:37,482 --> 00:26:38,602
such an excellent opportunity?

426
00:26:40,082 --> 00:26:41,162
He just likes to lay low.

427
00:26:41,162 --> 00:26:42,562
He never shows his face.

428
00:26:42,682 --> 00:26:44,042
That's how he was when we first met.

429
00:26:44,562 --> 00:26:46,682
Come on, let's have a toast.

430
00:26:49,082 --> 00:26:50,322
After this meal,

431
00:26:50,562 --> 00:26:52,442
we will have to
start preparing for the beta test.

432
00:26:53,562 --> 00:26:54,442
No need to wait for him?

433
00:26:56,602 --> 00:26:58,082
When we make a toast

434
00:26:58,082 --> 00:26:59,282
with our alcoholic beverages,

435
00:26:59,282 --> 00:27:00,322
his plain water makes no sound.

436
00:27:00,842 --> 00:27:01,682
Come on.

437
00:27:02,282 --> 00:27:03,082
To beta test success.

438
00:27:11,202 --> 00:27:12,082
But speaking of which,

439
00:27:13,082 --> 00:27:13,842
Pei Jun

440
00:27:14,402 --> 00:27:15,442
was a bit too much.

441
00:27:16,202 --> 00:27:17,322
Isn't that like throwing stones?

442
00:27:18,082 --> 00:27:20,282
An 80% positive rating.

443
00:27:21,082 --> 00:27:22,562
Isn't that too difficult?

444
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:24,962
Why would he suddenly do this?

445
00:27:27,202 --> 00:27:28,042
Revenge on his ex?

446
00:27:29,882 --> 00:27:31,202
Why are you kicking me?

447
00:27:31,802 --> 00:27:33,162
Did I say something wrong?

448
00:27:33,162 --> 00:27:34,842
Wasn't Pei Jun always helping

449
00:27:34,842 --> 00:27:36,322
An Ran at university?

450
00:27:36,562 --> 00:27:37,802
Who knows why he suddenly

451
00:27:37,802 --> 00:27:38,962
pulled this stunt?

452
00:27:39,402 --> 00:27:40,282
You know?

453
00:27:41,082 --> 00:27:41,962
Alright.

454
00:27:46,282 --> 00:27:46,802
An Ran.

455
00:27:47,682 --> 00:27:49,082
Is there anything new

456
00:27:49,402 --> 00:27:50,722
between you two?

457
00:27:52,042 --> 00:27:53,962
What's so secret about it?

458
00:27:57,082 --> 00:27:58,082
Alright,

459
00:27:58,962 --> 00:27:59,802
I'll tell you today.

460
00:28:14,962 --> 00:28:16,802
Imagine yourself in
a different space-time,

461
00:28:17,322 --> 00:28:19,082
away from the fast-paced life.

462
00:28:19,802 --> 00:28:22,322
You put on your backpack
and ride your bicycle,

463
00:28:22,962 --> 00:28:23,562
facing the wind,

464
00:28:25,082 --> 00:28:25,802
and going to

465
00:28:26,282 --> 00:28:28,322
a relaxing location.

466
00:28:28,962 --> 00:28:30,842
You make a few good friends,

467
00:28:31,722 --> 00:28:33,442
and you stop here.

468
00:28:34,202 --> 00:28:36,682
All the vitality of life gathers here.

469
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:38,842
You forget about your worries

470
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,442
and talk about everything.

471
00:28:41,802 --> 00:28:44,442
You each bring
your own dim light to each other,

472
00:28:45,082 --> 00:28:46,082
healing loneliness.

473
00:28:52,082 --> 00:28:54,202
I chose green as the main color

474
00:28:54,442 --> 00:28:57,322
for this painting right from the start.

475
00:28:57,962 --> 00:29:00,082
In the face of
life's depressing elements,

476
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:02,042
I hope to bring warmth and joy

477
00:29:02,322 --> 00:29:04,082
to everyone with vitality and energy.

478
00:29:09,602 --> 00:29:10,402
Goodbye.

479
00:29:10,842 --> 00:29:11,202
Goodbye.

480
00:29:11,202 --> 00:29:11,722
Thank you all.

481
00:29:11,722 --> 00:29:12,162
Goodbye.

482
00:29:18,282 --> 00:29:21,042
Hi, I really like your painting.

483
00:29:22,042 --> 00:29:22,802
Can I get to know you?

484
00:29:23,802 --> 00:29:24,482
My name is Pei Jun.

485
00:29:25,962 --> 00:29:26,842
My name is An Ran.

486
00:29:28,442 --> 00:29:30,322
Pei Jun. An Ran.

487
00:29:30,562 --> 00:29:31,082
Hi, director.

488
00:29:31,602 --> 00:29:32,442
You're both here.

489
00:29:33,322 --> 00:29:33,962
He is

490
00:29:34,282 --> 00:29:35,802
senior Pei Jun, an outstanding alumnus

491
00:29:36,082 --> 00:29:36,962
of our university.

492
00:29:38,282 --> 00:29:39,082
He is a major sponsor

493
00:29:39,322 --> 00:29:40,882
of this art exhibition.

494
00:29:42,202 --> 00:29:42,802
She is

495
00:29:42,962 --> 00:29:44,482
the event's first prize winner

496
00:29:44,802 --> 00:29:45,962
and also represents

497
00:29:45,962 --> 00:29:47,042
our school's highest level.

498
00:29:47,562 --> 00:29:47,962
An Ran.

499
00:29:48,322 --> 00:29:49,202
You flattered me.

500
00:29:50,842 --> 00:29:51,562
Nice backdrop.

501
00:29:51,802 --> 00:29:52,202
Come here.

502
00:29:52,202 --> 00:29:53,322
Close up and take a photo.

503
00:29:54,282 --> 00:29:56,402
The school magazine
then has new materials.

504
00:30:03,042 --> 00:30:04,082
Come on, get ready.

505
00:30:04,562 --> 00:30:07,042
Ready. One, two.

506
00:30:08,402 --> 00:30:09,642
Done.

507
00:30:11,082 --> 00:30:12,642
I see others do it this way.

508
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:14,282
Ran.

509
00:30:20,042 --> 00:30:20,562
Happy birthday.

510
00:30:25,082 --> 00:30:25,482
Thank you.

511
00:30:26,402 --> 00:30:27,802
I hope that in the future,

512
00:30:27,802 --> 00:30:28,682
we can celebrate every

513
00:30:29,042 --> 00:30:29,962
important day together.

514
00:30:43,962 --> 00:30:44,562
Please enjoy.

515
00:30:44,562 --> 00:30:45,082
Thank you.

516
00:30:49,442 --> 00:30:50,562
(Star Studio Employment Invitation)
I found an internship.

517
00:30:51,442 --> 00:30:52,042
Internship?

518
00:30:53,202 --> 00:30:54,802
Many of my classmates are interning.

519
00:30:55,082 --> 00:30:56,322
Shouldn't I start working?

520
00:30:58,082 --> 00:30:59,082
Don't you still have me?

521
00:30:59,802 --> 00:31:00,682
I can arrange for you.

522
00:31:01,322 --> 00:31:02,082
Moreover,

523
00:31:02,082 --> 00:31:03,442
internship as an assistant

524
00:31:03,682 --> 00:31:04,402
is pointless.

525
00:31:06,562 --> 00:31:09,162
So, should I continue
with this internship?

526
00:31:11,722 --> 00:31:12,442
Don't go.

527
00:31:12,962 --> 00:31:14,802
It is not very useful,
and you will have a lot of work.

528
00:31:15,842 --> 00:31:16,962
Listen to me, okay?

529
00:31:21,802 --> 00:31:22,402
Pei Jun.

530
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:25,162
We will always be together,

531
00:31:26,202 --> 00:31:26,562
right?

532
00:31:28,482 --> 00:31:29,082
Of course.

533
00:31:49,042 --> 00:31:50,002
Where's my painting?

534
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,570
(Girl at the Window, An Ran
Digital Painting, Dept. of Animation)

535
00:32:23,962 --> 00:32:24,642
Really?

536
00:32:33,424 --> 00:32:37,298
(Pei Jun, where are you? I miss you.)

537
00:32:39,568 --> 00:32:42,864
(Pei Jun, why don't
you reply to my messages?)

538
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:56,368
(Pei Jun, where are you?
Can I come to you?)

539
00:33:14,682 --> 00:33:15,562
They're all in the bag.

540
00:33:15,602 --> 00:33:16,802
Okay, that's settled, let's go.

541
00:33:16,802 --> 00:33:17,202
Let's go.

542
00:33:23,562 --> 00:33:24,082
Who is it?

543
00:33:25,522 --> 00:33:26,322
Wait for me.

544
00:33:27,322 --> 00:33:27,842
I'll be back.

545
00:33:27,842 --> 00:33:28,282
Okay.

546
00:33:33,082 --> 00:33:33,682

547
00:33:34,282 --> 00:33:35,042

570
00:34:44,722 --> 00:34:45,962
Open the door.

571
00:34:47,442 --> 00:34:47,962
It is me.

572
00:34:51,082 --> 00:34:52,802
An Ran, open the door.

573
00:34:53,802 --> 00:34:55,322
If you don't open it, I will kick in.

574
00:35:16,482 --> 00:35:17,002
An Ran!

575
00:35:18,202 --> 00:35:20,002
You're the campus belle
of Bowen University.

576
00:35:20,762 --> 00:35:23,042
You are the top student
in the animation department.

577
00:35:24,162 --> 00:35:25,002
In six months

578
00:35:25,002 --> 00:35:26,442
after graduating, you don't go out,

579
00:35:26,442 --> 00:35:27,602
and look for work, and just eat

580
00:35:27,602 --> 00:35:28,522
and sleep at home.

581
00:35:29,522 --> 00:35:31,162
Are you planning to
stay at home forever?

582
00:35:39,202 --> 00:35:40,842
Your parents called me today.

583
00:35:43,922 --> 00:35:45,042
They are very worried about you.

584
00:35:48,042 --> 00:35:49,002
They said that you don't

585
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:51,722
pick up when they call.

586
00:35:53,042 --> 00:35:55,042
They asked me if you are doing well.

587
00:35:59,522 --> 00:36:00,202
If this continues,

588
00:36:00,522 --> 00:36:01,482
I will stop covering you.

589
00:36:02,522 --> 00:36:04,042
I'll call your parents right away,

590
00:36:04,042 --> 00:36:05,522
and let them come and take you away.

591
00:37:56,562 --> 00:37:57,282
Welcome.

592
00:38:07,002 --> 00:38:07,682
Enjoy your meal.

593
00:38:07,682 --> 00:38:08,322
Thank you.

594
00:38:10,442 --> 00:38:10,962
Hello.

595
00:38:14,202 --> 00:38:14,842
Alright, thank you.

596
00:38:14,842 --> 00:38:15,522
Enjoy your meal.

597
00:38:33,682 --> 00:38:35,002
Hello, Dad.

598
00:38:35,402 --> 00:38:36,522
I'm at work.

599
00:38:37,202 --> 00:38:38,802
You are still working this late?

600
00:38:39,482 --> 00:38:41,562
We are working hard on our project,

601
00:38:41,922 --> 00:38:43,922
and we have meetings
every night these days.

602
00:38:47,922 --> 00:38:48,682
Dad, what's up?

603
00:38:49,682 --> 00:38:50,282
Nothing.

604
00:38:50,482 --> 00:38:51,482
Dad just wants to ask you

605
00:38:51,482 --> 00:38:52,522
if you have enough money.

606
00:38:53,402 --> 00:38:55,162
If you don't have enough, tell Dad.

607
00:38:56,242 --> 00:38:57,042
Enough.

608
00:38:57,482 --> 00:38:59,242
Of course it's enough.
You don't need to worry.

609
00:39:00,042 --> 00:39:00,562
Dad,

610
00:39:00,562 --> 00:39:01,522
I have to get back to work.

611
00:39:03,522 --> 00:39:04,242
Then you go ahead.

612
00:39:04,762 --> 00:39:05,682
Rest early.

613
00:39:05,962 --> 00:39:06,442
Alright.

614
00:39:24,522 --> 00:39:25,802
Hello, I'd like to check out.

615
00:39:28,562 --> 00:39:29,002
Coming.

616
00:39:42,522 --> 00:39:43,042
Goodbye.

617
00:39:45,722 --> 00:39:47,402
Hu Yingjun has mentioned you many times.

618
00:39:47,922 --> 00:39:49,242
He said you have very strong abilities.

619
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,162
I have also seen some of your works,

620
00:39:51,562 --> 00:39:54,042
and I believe they complement
the style of our company quite well.

621
00:39:54,962 --> 00:39:56,002
Thank you for the appreciation.

622
00:39:56,522 --> 00:39:58,162
Whether I appreciate it or not,

623
00:39:58,762 --> 00:39:59,962
I still have to tell you the truth.

624
00:40:00,442 --> 00:40:02,162
I can give you
a chance to work on a project,

625
00:40:03,002 --> 00:40:04,042
but the salary won't be high.

626
00:40:04,962 --> 00:40:06,042
You just graduated, having been

627
00:40:06,602 --> 00:40:07,922
in graduate school for three years,

628
00:40:08,522 --> 00:40:09,802
and have little work experience.

629
00:40:11,202 --> 00:40:12,202
Salary is not a problem.

630
00:40:12,522 --> 00:40:13,722
I can live a bit more simply,

631
00:40:14,042 --> 00:40:14,962
as long as I can work.

632
00:40:16,522 --> 00:40:18,042
I believe in you. Work hard.

633
00:40:19,002 --> 00:40:20,562
Come, take a look around.

634
00:40:21,922 --> 00:40:22,562
Don't be nervous.

635
00:40:23,522 --> 00:40:25,722
This will be your company in the future.

636
00:40:29,482 --> 00:40:33,322
An Ran, why didn't you tell me?

637
00:40:34,482 --> 00:40:35,482
He told me he wanted to

638
00:40:35,482 --> 00:40:36,482
get you back, and I even

639
00:40:36,482 --> 00:40:37,722
set up a date for him and you.

640
00:40:38,482 --> 00:40:39,322
I...

641
00:40:44,002 --> 00:40:44,922
What should I tell you?

642
00:40:46,162 --> 00:40:48,682
At such a young age,

643
00:40:49,722 --> 00:40:50,522
I have no ambition,

644
00:40:51,242 --> 00:40:52,602
and I can't even find work

645
00:40:52,602 --> 00:40:54,322
after my boyfriend left.

646
00:40:55,082 --> 00:40:55,762
And...

647
00:40:58,522 --> 00:40:59,842
Now that I think about it,

648
00:41:00,722 --> 00:41:02,002
it's quite embarrassing.

649
00:41:02,682 --> 00:41:05,322
You must have been
upset alone in the past.

650
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:07,722
You only had Hu Yingjun by your side,

651
00:41:08,042 --> 00:41:10,722
and he is completely useless.

652
00:41:11,442 --> 00:41:12,802
Why am I useless?

653
00:41:13,242 --> 00:41:14,562
An Ran.

654
00:41:14,802 --> 00:41:16,922
You've had it tough.

655
00:41:17,402 --> 00:41:20,202
You've had it too hard.

656
00:41:20,202 --> 00:41:23,242
Why didn't you tell me?

657
00:41:23,242 --> 00:41:24,242
Don't cry.

658
00:41:24,242 --> 00:41:26,002
Am I okay now?

659
00:41:26,242 --> 00:41:27,962
Alright, why are you crying?

660
00:41:29,002 --> 00:41:30,922
She didn't tell me.
You didn't tell me either.

661
00:41:30,922 --> 00:41:32,962
Don't you know there's a kind
of caring as keeping quiet?

662
00:41:35,002 --> 00:41:36,242
Now that everything's fine,

663
00:41:36,442 --> 00:41:37,162
let's toast.

664
00:41:38,482 --> 00:41:38,802
Come on.

665
00:41:39,562 --> 00:41:40,242
Let's toast.

666
00:41:40,802 --> 00:41:41,322
Let's toast.

667
00:41:55,082 --> 00:41:55,762
An Ran,

668
00:41:56,442 --> 00:41:56,922
in the future,

669
00:41:57,842 --> 00:41:58,922
if there's anything,

670
00:41:59,482 --> 00:42:00,682
you must tell me.

671
00:42:01,162 --> 00:42:02,722
You can't suffer in silence.

672
00:42:03,402 --> 00:42:03,962
Promise me.

673
00:42:04,682 --> 00:42:05,442
I promise.

674
00:42:05,562 --> 00:42:06,522
Promise me.

675
00:42:06,522 --> 00:42:07,002
I promise.

676
00:42:08,162 --> 00:42:08,762
Promise.

677
00:42:09,082 --> 00:42:09,962
An Ran,

678
00:42:10,242 --> 00:42:11,242
keep going.

679
00:42:11,522 --> 00:42:13,682
You've had it too hard.

680
00:42:14,482 --> 00:42:17,242
You've had it tough.

681
00:42:17,242 --> 00:42:19,482
Y-You've had it tough.

682
00:42:19,482 --> 00:42:20,562
I know.
