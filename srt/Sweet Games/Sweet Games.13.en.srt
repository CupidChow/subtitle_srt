unexpected things that)

(I would say cute young girls.)

33
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:27,558

(Get out. Auntie fans
should stop daydreaming.)

35
00:02:35,038 --> 00:02:36,718
(Do you know the charm of older women?)

36
00:02:36,718 --> 00:02:38,438
(This is age discrimination.)

Explain yourself.

46
00:03:05,238 --> 00:03:07,278
What does it mean by "I'm always here"?

47
00:03:07,758 --> 00:03:08,638
What?

48
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:11,518
Don't you remember what you just said?

49
00:03:13,278 --> 00:03:14,158
You joined the fan group?

Why can't I?

51
00:03:16,438 --> 00:03:18,358
You always seem unpredictable to me,

52
00:03:18,358 --> 00:03:20,078
but you're so nice to your fans.

53
00:03:21,278 --> 00:03:23,158
- You're jealous.
- No, I'm not.

54
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:24,198
This is a basic principle.

55
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:26,038
What principle?

56
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:27,638
They support me. I offer feedback.

57
00:03:27,718 --> 00:03:28,558
We embrace each other.

58
00:03:29,558 --> 00:03:30,838
You sweet talk all those girls

59
00:03:30,838 --> 00:03:31,838
of different ages.

60
00:03:31,838 --> 00:03:33,838
You're totally
a merciless flirting machine.

61
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:36,518
I'm just doing my job.
It's part of my job.

62
00:03:36,518 --> 00:03:37,438
I didn't do anything.

63
00:03:37,438 --> 00:03:39,158
Blah, blah.

64
00:03:43,758 --> 00:03:46,318
This is outrageous.

65
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:47,878
Whoever is slightly handsome

66
00:03:48,038 --> 00:03:50,318
gets carried away
when they're surrounded by girls.

67
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:53,398
Lecher. Playboy. Untrustworthy.

68
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:56,238
Listen, you can't let him off so easily.

69
00:03:56,718 --> 00:03:57,878
- Make a fuss.
- Yeah.

70
00:03:57,878 --> 00:03:59,518
- Teach him a lesson.
- Yeah.

71
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:01,238
- Do not forgive him.
- Yeah.

72
00:04:07,718 --> 00:04:08,958
(But a timely apology)

73
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:11,798
(makes the fight a spice in love.)

74
00:04:13,398 --> 00:04:15,478
(We may look dumb to others.)

75
00:04:15,638 --> 00:04:18,038
(But this is how we love each other.)

Yueyue.

78
00:04:50,838 --> 00:04:52,158
- You...
- Mom.

79
00:04:53,718 --> 00:04:56,558
- This is my girlfriend, An Ran.
- Hello, Auntie.

80
00:04:58,358 --> 00:05:00,078
Girlfriend.

81
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:06,358
You're the one
who's renting our apartment, right?

82
00:05:08,798 --> 00:05:09,878
Is it fine living here?

83
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:13,718
- Yeah.
- That's good.

84
00:05:14,238 --> 00:05:17,038
I guess you get along well

85
00:05:18,678 --> 00:05:19,798
with Yan Yue.

86
00:05:20,358 --> 00:05:21,318
Yeah.

87
00:05:22,398 --> 00:05:24,358
You just moved in
a few months ago, right?

88
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:26,198
Mom, enough with the questions.

89
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:28,638
What's wrong? I'm just showing concern.

90
00:05:29,198 --> 00:05:30,638
These are organic vegetables.

91
00:05:30,798 --> 00:05:33,598
I got them from
an organic farm in the suburbs.

92
00:05:34,078 --> 00:05:35,918
Cook them when they're still fresh.

93
00:05:36,518 --> 00:05:39,758
Auntie, I'll leave you to talk.

94
00:05:40,358 --> 00:05:42,638
You're leaving? See you around.

95
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:44,198
- See you.
- Come and visit.

96
00:05:44,198 --> 00:05:47,638
- Alright.
- I'll see you around.

97
00:05:54,598 --> 00:05:57,918
Mom, how many times have I told you?

98
00:05:58,518 --> 00:06:00,478
Tell me before visiting.

99
00:06:00,998 --> 00:06:02,198
Don't just show up.

100
00:06:02,198 --> 00:06:03,478
I forgot, okay?

101
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:04,878
I just got the vegetables

102
00:06:05,118 --> 00:06:06,998
and wanted to give them to you.

103
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:17,478
(Yan Yue's mom came.
We met for the first time.)

104
00:06:24,158 --> 00:06:26,038
- Hello.
- Hello, An Ran.

105
00:06:26,518 --> 00:06:28,118
You already greeted his mom?

106
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,118
It's nothing formal.

107
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:32,438
How was it?

108
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:33,838
Is she easy-going?

109
00:06:35,278 --> 00:06:36,838
I guess.

110
00:06:38,518 --> 00:06:40,398
I don't think...

111
00:06:40,838 --> 00:06:42,198
What?

112
00:06:42,518 --> 00:06:46,518
I don't think
she sees us as a matching couple.

113
00:06:47,118 --> 00:06:48,358
No, no, listen.

114
00:06:48,358 --> 00:06:50,118
You're jumping to conclusions.

115
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:54,958
Maybe I was too sensitive.

116
00:06:56,678 --> 00:06:57,798
That's it. I'll go to bed.

117
00:06:58,038 --> 00:07:00,358
(Good night. Don't overthink.)

118
00:07:10,078 --> 00:07:11,198
(Did you get scared?)

119
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:21,318
(Not really.
It was just a bit embarrassing.)

120
00:07:23,718 --> 00:07:26,518
(Why is that? You'll meet anyway.)

121
00:07:29,878 --> 00:07:32,038
(Don't stay up late. Go to sleep.)

122
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,838
(Good night, sweetie.)

123
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:54,718
Miss An, I did some
preliminary selection.

124
00:07:54,718 --> 00:07:56,238
We have a good candidate today.

125
00:07:56,718 --> 00:07:57,838
- Really?
- Yeah.

126
00:07:57,838 --> 00:07:58,998
And she's serious about it.

127
00:07:58,998 --> 00:08:00,678
She's been waiting for some time.

128
00:08:01,838 --> 00:08:03,798
- Thank you. Let's go.
- Okay.

129
00:08:04,438 --> 00:08:06,198
Look. This is the one.

130
00:08:09,076 --> 00:08:13,238
(Chen Rui)

131
00:08:14,438 --> 00:08:16,518
Hello, Miss An. I'm Chen Rui.

132
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:19,278
Hello, I'm An Ran.

133
00:08:19,518 --> 00:08:21,918
I'm glad you came to the interview.

134
00:08:22,718 --> 00:08:25,718
May I ask why you applied for the job?

135
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:29,558
I really like the concept of

136
00:08:29,638 --> 00:08:31,038
Fragment Time Boyfriend.

137
00:08:31,718 --> 00:08:34,638
So you came specifically for this game?

138
00:08:35,998 --> 00:08:38,718
I think it's the dating game
that understands

139
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:40,038
contemporary women the best.

140
00:08:40,558 --> 00:08:41,838
I also did some research

141
00:08:42,358 --> 00:08:44,158
and truly admired your staff's

142
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:45,318
passion for this game.

143
00:08:47,758 --> 00:08:49,158
You speak so highly of us.

144
00:08:50,398 --> 00:08:53,998
Most of the games in the market
are meant for passing time.

145
00:08:54,398 --> 00:08:57,678
But this game offers us extra time.

146
00:08:58,158 --> 00:09:00,278
It's something exclusive to ourselves.

147
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,278
And I can sense
the developer's consideration

148
00:09:03,398 --> 00:09:06,678
for the female customers in the game.

149
00:09:07,398 --> 00:09:10,838
Everything is anti-cliché
from character setting to art style.

150
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:13,838
I believe your employees
have an obsession

151
00:09:13,838 --> 00:09:15,558
with developing games.

152
00:09:20,078 --> 00:09:21,718
- That's it.
- Thank you.

153
00:09:23,638 --> 00:09:25,718
Mr. Heisha, here's the script for today.

154
00:09:25,718 --> 00:09:28,198
Script? Why haven't I
heard anything about it?

155
00:09:28,518 --> 00:09:30,718
It's just the system of contest
and the schedule.

156
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:33,518
It's easier to film the show
if you know it by heart.

157
00:09:43,478 --> 00:09:46,078
"I watched every episode
of the previous season."

158
00:09:46,278 --> 00:09:47,758
"The contesters were unique."

159
00:09:48,038 --> 00:09:49,758
"The rule setting was also brilliant."

160
00:09:50,758 --> 00:09:52,158
Should I say what's written?

161
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,078
That's what other guests do.

162
00:09:54,318 --> 00:09:56,078
Just stick to the script.

163
00:10:11,318 --> 00:10:13,838
Dear audience, I'm the host Damu.

164
00:10:14,558 --> 00:10:15,518
Welcome to

165
00:10:15,518 --> 00:10:16,678
We Who Love Voices.

166
00:10:16,678 --> 00:10:18,238
It's the first contest of Season Two.

167
00:10:18,558 --> 00:10:20,758
Let's welcome our guests today.

168
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,678
Three famous voice actors.

169
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:26,638
Hello, I'm your old friend Zhou Qing.

170
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,838
Hello, I'm Bian Hai.

171
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:35,558
Hello, I'm Heisha.

172
00:10:36,838 --> 00:10:37,838
This is

173
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:39,398
the first variety show of Mr. Heisha.

174
00:10:39,918 --> 00:10:42,078
Have you watched our show before?

175
00:10:43,158 --> 00:10:44,118
I've watched some.

176
00:10:44,358 --> 00:10:46,758
Which contester from the last season

177
00:10:46,758 --> 00:10:48,758
left a deep impression on you?

178
00:10:50,518 --> 00:10:52,718
Mr. Heisha, the script.

179
00:10:53,798 --> 00:10:54,798
Mr. Heisha.

180
00:11:01,438 --> 00:11:03,878
Actually, I'm looking forward to finding

181
00:11:03,878 --> 00:11:05,678
an impressive voice this season.

182
00:11:09,998 --> 00:11:12,118
Alright, let's look forward to it

183
00:11:12,118 --> 00:11:13,238
with Mr. Heisha.

184
00:11:13,878 --> 00:11:16,318
Let's welcome
our old friend, Mr. Zhou Qing.

185
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:20,158
First, welcome
all the rising voice actors

186
00:11:20,398 --> 00:11:22,198
to this show.

187
00:11:43,838 --> 00:11:44,958
Hello, Mom.

188
00:11:45,118 --> 00:11:48,278
Yueyue, what fruits does An Ran like?

189
00:11:49,158 --> 00:11:50,918
- Strawberries.
- Alright.

190
00:11:53,718 --> 00:11:55,478
Mom, what now?

191
00:11:56,518 --> 00:11:58,918
I'm placing an order
on the organic farm.

192
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,478
I thought I'd get An Ran some fruits.

193
00:12:00,478 --> 00:12:02,638
Mr. Heisha, are you ready?

194
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:07,198
- Yueyue, go ahead. Talk later.
- Mom.

195
00:12:56,438 --> 00:12:58,718
Auntie, what brought you here?
Come on in.

196
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:05,158
The whole place looks
much cuter with the decorations.

197
00:13:05,358 --> 00:13:06,718
- Please sit down.
- Okay.

198
00:13:08,918 --> 00:13:09,998
Yan Yue and I

199
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,358
redecorated the place together.

200
00:13:12,838 --> 00:13:13,918
Look at the sofa cover.

201
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,158
Yan Yue picked it.

202
00:13:16,478 --> 00:13:18,158
He picked something colorful?

203
00:13:21,998 --> 00:13:23,838
I guess he's much happier

204
00:13:24,278 --> 00:13:25,398
with you.

205
00:13:25,918 --> 00:13:27,558
Originally, he would

206
00:13:27,718 --> 00:13:29,358
love to make everything

207
00:13:29,358 --> 00:13:30,998
black or grey at home.

208
00:13:31,798 --> 00:13:34,038
- Really?
- Bear with him.

209
00:13:34,678 --> 00:13:36,358
He bears with me, too.

210
00:13:38,238 --> 00:13:39,678
What do you do for a living?

211
00:13:40,118 --> 00:13:42,918
Auntie, I'm starting
a business with a few friends.

212
00:13:42,918 --> 00:13:44,358
It's a mobile game startup.

213
00:13:45,318 --> 00:13:46,198
Mobile game?

214
00:13:47,518 --> 00:13:50,198
Young people love to play
those fighting games

215
00:13:50,518 --> 00:13:52,758
on their phones.

216
00:13:52,758 --> 00:13:54,998
Yan Yue also loves it.
I really don't get it.

217
00:13:55,518 --> 00:13:58,078
Our game is mainly targeting girls.

218
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:01,078
You started a company

219
00:14:01,318 --> 00:14:03,958
at such a young age.

220
00:14:04,198 --> 00:14:05,518
That's impressive.

221
00:14:06,558 --> 00:14:08,958
I bet you have a clear plan

222
00:14:09,158 --> 00:14:10,078
for your future.

223
00:14:11,398 --> 00:14:14,198
I'm just getting by for now.

224
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:16,998
It's not so easy to start a company.

225
00:14:17,638 --> 00:14:20,718
Yeah, the time has changed.

226
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,838
There are many chances for young people.

227
00:14:23,318 --> 00:14:24,638
So how old are you?

228
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:27,758
Auntie, I'm 31.

229
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:34,078
You're 31?

230
00:14:34,278 --> 00:14:37,198
Then you're six years older than Yueyue.

231
00:14:39,998 --> 00:14:42,398
Do your parents know about it?

232
00:14:42,398 --> 00:14:43,518
What do they think?

233
00:14:44,998 --> 00:14:47,278
I haven't told them.

234
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:52,958
Right, you haven't told them.

235
00:14:57,678 --> 00:14:59,918
Yueyue is still quite young.

236
00:15:00,798 --> 00:15:04,798
You've seen much more in life.
So think twice.

237
00:15:07,998 --> 00:15:09,918
Girls should drink less cold stuff.

238
00:15:12,238 --> 00:15:13,998
That's it, I'll stop bothering you.

239
00:15:14,158 --> 00:15:15,398
- See you.
- See you, Auntie.

240
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:49,278
You filmed the show? What's the rush?

241
00:15:49,478 --> 00:15:50,518
I miss you too much.

242
00:15:57,518 --> 00:15:58,518
You had a guest?

243
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,398
How did your show go?

244
00:16:01,398 --> 00:16:03,838
- Was it fine?
- Yeah.

245
00:16:04,398 --> 00:16:05,638
That's good.

246
00:16:10,838 --> 00:16:11,598
Let me help.

247
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:22,025
(Game Billboard)

248
00:16:28,638 --> 00:16:31,118
(Jiang Shan Bowen Gossip Group)
(Have you tried that dating game?)

249
00:16:37,318 --> 00:16:38,838
(Which one?)

250
00:16:43,038 --> 00:16:45,598
(Fragment Time Boyfriend. I love it.)

251
00:16:45,598 --> 00:16:47,038
(You're the sixth person)

252
00:16:47,038 --> 00:16:49,158
(who mentioned it within the month.)

253
00:16:49,238 --> 00:16:50,958
(It's just the beta version.)

254
00:16:51,638 --> 00:16:53,638
(I'm planning to try it when it's out.)

255
00:17:00,518 --> 00:17:01,598
(Is it fun?)

256
00:17:03,758 --> 00:17:04,678
(I tried it.)

257
00:17:04,678 --> 00:17:07,198
(I love it so much. Download it.
Make an appointment.)

258
00:17:08,158 --> 00:17:10,078
(I'm working on Fu Hanshu.)

259
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:13,158
(I love the gentle
and easy-going young guy.)

260
00:17:14,718 --> 00:17:16,598
(All four protagonists look real.)

261
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:19,038
(It's like they can grow up with you.)

262
00:17:38,638 --> 00:17:40,558
- Why aren't they talking?
- Really?

263
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:44,758
Gaishi Group has acquired
many small companies these years.

264
00:17:44,878 --> 00:17:46,438
Are they coming for us?

265
00:17:57,078 --> 00:17:58,038
What are you looking at?

266
00:18:00,198 --> 00:18:01,438
You finally came.

267
00:18:01,438 --> 00:18:03,438
Miss An, someone came
from the Gaishi Group.

268
00:18:04,158 --> 00:18:06,078
The major Gaishi came to mini Gaishi.

269
00:18:07,918 --> 00:18:10,758
Miss An, did something go wrong?

270
00:18:12,518 --> 00:18:13,198
Don't worry.

271
00:18:15,758 --> 00:18:19,438
Miss An.

272
00:18:21,798 --> 00:18:22,678
You finally came.

273
00:18:25,678 --> 00:18:26,718
Let me introduce you to

274
00:18:27,358 --> 00:18:30,038
our vice president Miss An Ran.

275
00:18:30,278 --> 00:18:31,038
- Hello.
- Hello.

276
00:18:31,158 --> 00:18:32,678
I may be the owner of the company.

277
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:34,718
But Miss An has the final say.

278
00:18:35,278 --> 00:18:38,038
And this is the well-known Mr. Zhao Qian

279
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:40,558
from the Gaishi Group.

280
00:18:40,718 --> 00:18:41,598
I'm flattered.

281
00:18:41,838 --> 00:18:43,438
- Hello, Mr. Zhao.
- Hello.

282
00:18:43,838 --> 00:18:44,838
Please have a seat.

283
00:18:44,838 --> 00:18:45,718
Alright.

284
00:19:00,078 --> 00:19:01,918
Mr. Zhao, fate brought us together.

285
00:19:02,438 --> 00:19:04,678
Gaishi Group. Gaishi Unparalleled.
I came up with the name.

286
00:19:05,198 --> 00:19:06,038
Not bad, right?

287
00:19:07,278 --> 00:19:09,318
Miss An, here's my business card.

288
00:19:10,438 --> 00:19:11,838
Zhao Qian from Gaishi Group.

289
00:19:12,998 --> 00:19:14,038
I've heard so much

290
00:19:14,238 --> 00:19:16,038
about this youthful mobile game company

291
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:17,078
called Gaishi Unparalleled.

292
00:19:17,438 --> 00:19:19,798
Seeing is believing.

293
00:19:20,318 --> 00:19:21,918
What a youthful company.

294
00:19:21,918 --> 00:19:22,798
Very good.

295
00:19:24,438 --> 00:19:27,038
We're honored to have you here

296
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:28,278
in our humble office.

297
00:19:29,078 --> 00:19:31,438
May I ask what brought you here,

298
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,638
Mr. Zhao?

299
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:37,638
He wants to buy us.

300
00:19:39,918 --> 00:19:43,038
Miss An, Mr. Hu is not exactly wrong.

301
00:19:43,318 --> 00:19:45,798
I used to be the Investment Director
of Gaishi Group.

302
00:19:46,438 --> 00:19:47,798
I majored in

303
00:19:47,998 --> 00:19:49,638
investment and acquisition.

304
00:19:50,438 --> 00:19:51,678
I came today

305
00:19:51,678 --> 00:19:54,078
to talk about the collaboration

306
00:19:54,078 --> 00:19:55,678
between our two companies.

307
00:19:56,038 --> 00:19:58,438
I know Gaishi Unparalleled is a startup.

308
00:19:58,918 --> 00:19:59,798
But

309
00:20:00,398 --> 00:20:01,678
your achievements

310
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:03,398
are well-recognized.

311
00:20:03,838 --> 00:20:05,838
That's why I came here

312
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:07,038
to propose

313
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:07,918
a collaboration.

314
00:20:08,438 --> 00:20:10,278
What do you think about it?

315
00:20:15,278 --> 00:20:17,398
Thank you so much for your appreciation.

316
00:20:17,438 --> 00:20:19,678
We're truly flattered.

317
00:20:21,398 --> 00:20:23,798
But our company is not at the stage

318
00:20:23,798 --> 00:20:25,838
to cooperate with major companies.

319
00:20:25,918 --> 00:20:28,198
As you can see,
our staff are quite indolent.

320
00:20:28,278 --> 00:20:31,318
I'm afraid they're not
used to big companies.

321
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:34,318
Mr. Hu, Miss An, I have a suggestion.

322
00:20:35,078 --> 00:20:38,038
Why don't you think twice about it?

323
00:20:38,158 --> 00:20:39,678
The way of collaboration

324
00:20:39,798 --> 00:20:41,038
is up for negotiation.

325
00:20:48,438 --> 00:20:51,678
Okay, let's call it a day.

326
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:53,798
Please think about it.

327
00:20:54,438 --> 00:20:55,438
Let's keep in touch.

328
00:20:55,558 --> 00:20:56,518
Alright.

329
00:20:56,718 --> 00:20:57,558
See you, Mr. Zhao.

330
00:20:57,558 --> 00:20:58,678
Alright. Stay.

331
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:01,718
See you.

332
00:21:07,718 --> 00:21:09,158
What the heck?

333
00:21:10,678 --> 00:21:12,198
What do they want?

334
00:21:12,918 --> 00:21:14,798
Are we going to be
a branch of Gaishi Group?

335
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:16,558
Don't jinx it.

336
00:21:16,918 --> 00:21:19,198
So I'll inform the new employee
to start next Monday?

337
00:21:19,518 --> 00:21:20,798
The window is dirty.

338
00:21:21,078 --> 00:21:22,078
Who's on duty today?

339
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:24,638
Where is that from?

340
00:21:24,638 --> 00:21:26,558
Alright, get back to work.

341
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:28,438
Or clean the window. Stop standing here.

342
00:21:28,678 --> 00:21:30,838
We're getting too tanned here.

343
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:32,798
Let's go.

344
00:21:41,878 --> 00:21:44,478
Oh no, we attracted the attention
of a huge company.

345
00:21:47,838 --> 00:21:49,838
I thought they wanted to sue us.

346
00:21:51,198 --> 00:21:53,838
We didn't break any law
or infringe any copyright.

347
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:55,078
Why would they sue us?

348
00:21:55,678 --> 00:22:00,598
True. The worst we did
was using a similar name.

349
00:22:03,558 --> 00:22:09,238
What is Zhao Qian up to?

350
00:22:10,438 --> 00:22:12,598
Do they really want to acquire us?

351
00:22:14,598 --> 00:22:15,998
Our most valuable asset

352
00:22:15,998 --> 00:22:18,078
is Fragment Time Boyfriend.

353
00:22:19,598 --> 00:22:21,718
I don't care what he wants.

354
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:23,998
As long as we make the game work,

355
00:22:24,238 --> 00:22:25,878
we have some cards to play.

356
00:22:28,478 --> 00:22:29,318
Got it?

357
00:22:31,078 --> 00:22:33,238
Got it.

358
00:22:33,438 --> 00:22:34,958
I knew.

359
00:22:51,598 --> 00:22:53,558
Auntie, I'm 31.

360
00:22:55,918 --> 00:22:57,718
You're 31?

361
00:22:57,838 --> 00:23:00,678
Then you're six years older than Yueyue.

362
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:04,598
Yueyue is still quite young.

363
00:23:05,518 --> 00:23:09,438
You've seen much more in life.
So think twice.

364
00:23:21,678 --> 00:23:24,078
Mr. Heisha, you still didn't

365
00:23:24,078 --> 00:23:25,438
stick to the script.

366
00:23:30,358 --> 00:23:31,558
I don't know

367
00:23:31,718 --> 00:23:32,958
the people you mentioned.

368
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:35,438
How can I say that I know them well?

369
00:23:35,838 --> 00:23:37,798
You'd better stick to the script.

370
00:23:41,078 --> 00:23:43,958
- Yan Yue.
- An Ran.

371
00:23:45,118 --> 00:23:45,998
Why did you come?

372
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:48,398
I brought coffee to visit you.

373
00:23:48,998 --> 00:23:51,518
Thank you for taking care of Mr. Heisha.

374
00:23:51,518 --> 00:23:52,478
Thank you.

375
00:23:52,838 --> 00:23:55,358
- Mr. Heisha, see you next time.
- Okay.

376
00:23:59,558 --> 00:24:03,078
What's wrong? It didn't go well?

377
00:24:03,798 --> 00:24:05,198
Not exactly.

378
00:24:05,518 --> 00:24:08,438
I'm just not used to it.

379
00:24:10,118 --> 00:24:12,038
I thought it was just an ordinary

380
00:24:12,038 --> 00:24:13,198
contest reality show.

381
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:16,398
But she made such a detailed script.

382
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:21,278
- She's even telling me what to say.
- Let me see.

383
00:24:25,918 --> 00:24:26,678
Really.

384
00:24:33,198 --> 00:24:35,798
The lines are quite common.

385
00:24:36,758 --> 00:24:40,758
- Did they tell you who the winner is?
- Not yet.

386
00:24:42,638 --> 00:24:45,318
- Let's see how it goes.
- Okay.

387
00:24:49,918 --> 00:24:53,798
I hear something. You're hungry.

388
00:24:55,598 --> 00:24:56,678
It's been a whole day.

389
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:58,198
Poor you.

390
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:00,678
Have you tried the grill in front of

391
00:25:00,678 --> 00:25:01,558
Bowen University?

392
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:07,398
The one on the corner
right outside the entrance.

393
00:25:07,558 --> 00:25:10,758
- You remember it so well.
- I used to go very often.

394
00:25:10,918 --> 00:25:12,838
- So let's go there, okay?
- Okay.

395
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:17,638
Let's go. Wait. Have some.

396
00:25:21,078 --> 00:25:22,038
Let's go.

397
00:25:23,718 --> 00:25:25,078
- I'll go get changed.
- Alright.

398
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,038
(Zhouzhou BBQ)
What do you like?

399
00:25:34,718 --> 00:25:36,198
I like

400
00:25:36,438 --> 00:25:39,878
grilled peppers,
sliced potatoes, and skewers.

401
00:25:39,878 --> 00:25:41,238
I would always get those.

402
00:25:41,238 --> 00:25:42,398
What a coincidence.

403
00:25:42,398 --> 00:25:44,318
Those are the things I get.

404
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:45,638
You also like those?

405
00:25:47,998 --> 00:25:49,998
Why haven't I met your earlier?

406
00:25:49,998 --> 00:25:51,518
We could have shared dinner.

407
00:25:52,878 --> 00:25:54,278
- Sir.
- Coming.

408
00:25:56,238 --> 00:25:58,358
I'd like grilled peppers,

409
00:25:58,358 --> 00:25:59,758
sliced potatoes, skewers,

410
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:02,198
and gizzards, ten each.

411
00:26:02,398 --> 00:26:03,598
- Alright.
- Thank you.

412
00:26:06,958 --> 00:26:08,398
How was work today?

413
00:26:09,838 --> 00:26:11,198
Not bad. Not good.

414
00:26:11,758 --> 00:26:13,238
We met some investors

415
00:26:13,598 --> 00:26:15,878
and interviewed some candidates.

416
00:26:15,958 --> 00:26:16,998
Some of them were good.

417
00:26:17,838 --> 00:26:20,358
And there was trouble, of course.

418
00:26:21,318 --> 00:26:23,718
What is it? Tell me.

419
00:26:24,598 --> 00:26:26,478
Let's eat first. I'll tell you later.

420
00:26:26,998 --> 00:26:28,358
Alright, let's eat.

421
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,878
- I'm cursing you, so what?
- Watch it.

422
00:26:32,238 --> 00:26:33,518
I'm swearing. Bite me.

423
00:26:35,678 --> 00:26:36,798
Come and bite me.

424
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:47,998
Yan Yue?

425
00:26:51,438 --> 00:26:52,598
Are you feeling sick?

426
00:27:04,358 --> 00:27:04,918
Let's go.

427
00:27:15,558 --> 00:27:18,598
- Yan Yue, shall we take a break?
- Okay.

428
00:27:25,718 --> 00:27:29,438
- Are you better?
- I'm fine.

429
00:27:31,958 --> 00:27:35,318
Yan Yue,
it's the second time it happened.

430
00:27:35,798 --> 00:27:38,958
Let's go to the hospital for a checkup.

431
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:41,958
I did.

432
00:27:43,198 --> 00:27:44,478
Nothing was found out.

433
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:49,878
Could it be something psychological?

434
00:27:51,358 --> 00:27:54,478
We should find the cause and target it.

435
00:27:56,718 --> 00:27:58,198
Don't get me wrong.

436
00:27:58,478 --> 00:27:59,798
I'm just worried about you.

437
00:28:01,558 --> 00:28:04,078
Maybe it's because
my parents fought a lot

438
00:28:04,838 --> 00:28:06,278
when I was little.

439
00:28:08,318 --> 00:28:11,398
I don't think you've ever
mentioned your father.

440
00:28:18,438 --> 00:28:21,278
- Nine Circle.
- (When I was young,)

441
00:28:21,518 --> 00:28:23,518
(my dad was home, unemployed.)

442
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:26,998
(He set up
a chess and card room at home.)

443
00:28:27,878 --> 00:28:29,398
(Many people came to play)

444
00:28:30,158 --> 00:28:32,038
(and wouldn't leave the whole day.)

445
00:28:33,918 --> 00:28:36,878
(The place was filled
with smoke, liquor smell, and noise.)

446
00:28:39,118 --> 00:28:39,998
Go to bed.

447
00:28:41,078 --> 00:28:41,918
I won!

448
00:28:49,438 --> 00:28:52,558
- Sleep tight.
- (When I was in bed,)

449
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:56,358
(my mom would put headphones on me)

450
00:28:56,598 --> 00:28:57,998
(to screen the noise.)

451
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:07,078
Sleep.

452
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:28,918
(But sometimes,
the headphones didn't work.)

453
00:29:31,638 --> 00:29:32,278
I won.

454
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:38,598
What? What do you want?

455
00:29:39,318 --> 00:29:40,438
Are you crazy?

456
00:29:43,518 --> 00:29:44,478
Just talk it out.

457
00:29:44,798 --> 00:29:46,558
Why can't I play Mahjong?

458
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:47,718
Crazy woman.

459
00:29:48,478 --> 00:29:50,718
Get out!

460
00:29:51,558 --> 00:29:53,158
Alright, stop it.

461
00:29:55,638 --> 00:29:57,078
- Yeah.
- Get lost!

462
00:29:57,158 --> 00:29:58,038
Enough.

463
00:29:58,038 --> 00:29:59,398
- Stop it.
- What's your problem?

464
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:02,398
It's not a casino. Do it somewhere else.

465
00:30:03,398 --> 00:30:05,638
I can do whatever I want at home!

466
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:08,598
Then their fights escalated.

467
00:30:09,798 --> 00:30:11,558
Once when they were fighting,

468
00:30:12,078 --> 00:30:13,678
I came out of my room.

469
00:30:18,758 --> 00:30:20,198
Tuition fee matters more than my life?

470
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,278
You're not taking a penny from home!

471
00:30:22,678 --> 00:30:23,918
Stop fighting.

472
00:30:23,958 --> 00:30:25,318
Get back in there.

473
00:30:26,598 --> 00:30:27,958
Where's the bank book?

474
00:30:28,038 --> 00:30:29,918
Bring it to me. Go away.

475
00:30:35,558 --> 00:30:39,278
Yueyue!

476
00:30:39,398 --> 00:30:41,598
Did you hit somewhere? Your head?

477
00:30:41,958 --> 00:30:44,078
Talk to Mommy. Please.

478
00:30:44,118 --> 00:30:46,798
Talk to Mommy. Yueyue.

479
00:30:47,598 --> 00:30:52,798
I'm getting a divorce! Yueyue.

480
00:30:53,398 --> 00:30:56,198
I never saw my dad again.

481
00:30:57,238 --> 00:30:58,718
My mom brought me up.

482
00:31:00,278 --> 00:31:02,038
After that, I always

483
00:31:03,958 --> 00:31:05,398
react like that to fights.

484
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:13,038
What do you want?

485
00:31:13,798 --> 00:31:14,838
He doesn't live here now.

486
00:31:15,678 --> 00:31:17,038
He owes us money.

487
00:31:17,518 --> 00:31:19,798
I have no idea. We're divorced.

488
00:31:20,198 --> 00:31:21,678
We only know he lives here.

489
00:31:22,678 --> 00:31:24,198
Pay back the money for him.

490
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:25,638
He borrowed money, not me.

491
00:31:25,838 --> 00:31:26,678
Besides, I have

492
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:27,918
nothing to do with him now.

493
00:31:28,278 --> 00:31:29,318
What should I do?

494
00:31:29,398 --> 00:31:31,158
Should I sit here with a banner

495
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,838
saying, "Give my money back"?

496
00:31:34,038 --> 00:31:35,118
Are you paying up or not?

497
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:36,558
Yueyue, you're sick again.

498
00:31:36,678 --> 00:31:39,038
Acknowledge the debt. Where is he?

499
00:31:39,518 --> 00:31:41,478
I'll pay you back one day.

500
00:31:41,798 --> 00:31:43,518
- Leave us alone.
- Listen.

501
00:31:55,078 --> 00:31:56,678
You had such a tough childhood.

502
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:04,798
That's why I love the sound of nature.

503
00:32:06,918 --> 00:32:08,038
Those sounds,

504
00:32:08,838 --> 00:32:11,078
be they separated or mixed,

505
00:32:13,078 --> 00:32:14,678
can always make me calm.

506
00:32:19,358 --> 00:32:21,718
Alright, from now on,

507
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:24,958
I'll listen to
the flowers and trees with you

508
00:32:25,518 --> 00:32:26,998
and feel your superpower.

509
00:32:44,678 --> 00:32:48,278
I heard trees and leaves.

510
00:32:49,758 --> 00:32:52,878
And wind.

511
00:32:55,758 --> 00:32:59,638
And cicadas.

512
00:33:11,558 --> 00:33:13,238
- Good night.
- Good night.

513
00:33:17,838 --> 00:33:18,718
Auntie.

514
00:33:18,718 --> 00:33:19,918
You're back.

515
00:33:20,278 --> 00:33:22,118
I bought some fresh strawberries.

516
00:33:22,118 --> 00:33:23,438
No pesticide.

517
00:33:23,718 --> 00:33:24,598
Thank you, Auntie.

518
00:33:25,238 --> 00:33:28,118
Don't sleep so late
although you're young.

519
00:33:28,278 --> 00:33:29,158
Mom.

520
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:32,758
Yan Yue, it is a bit late now.

521
00:33:33,158 --> 00:33:34,358
Go to bed.

522
00:33:34,438 --> 00:33:36,038
I'll see you around.

523
00:33:36,038 --> 00:33:37,678
- Thanks for the strawberries.
- No problem.

524
00:33:37,678 --> 00:33:38,598
See you.

525
00:34:05,198 --> 00:34:07,958
Yueyue, are you busy at work?

526
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:14,998
Mom, what now?

527
00:34:16,958 --> 00:34:17,638
Yueyue.

528
00:34:21,958 --> 00:34:24,958
I don't have a problem
with you two dating each other.

529
00:34:27,518 --> 00:34:28,998
I spoke to An Ran.

530
00:34:31,238 --> 00:34:32,718
You spoke to An Ran?

531
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:34,198
What did you say?

532
00:34:35,278 --> 00:34:37,518
She's six years older.
What do you think about that?

533
00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:41,918
That was what you talked about?

534
00:34:44,478 --> 00:34:46,598
She's been working for years.

535
00:34:46,598 --> 00:34:48,358
You just started your career.

536
00:34:48,958 --> 00:34:50,198
You can't even understand

537
00:34:51,038 --> 00:34:52,478
what she's been through.

538
00:34:55,638 --> 00:34:58,198
Maybe you're getting along well

539
00:34:58,198 --> 00:34:59,238
for now,

540
00:34:59,718 --> 00:35:01,598
but what about in the future?

541
00:35:02,958 --> 00:35:05,638
If something happens at work,

542
00:35:05,878 --> 00:35:07,358
will you be able to

543
00:35:07,758 --> 00:35:09,278
see things from her perspective?

544
00:35:10,198 --> 00:35:13,838
Or maybe you want to fight
for your career for a few years more.

545
00:35:14,198 --> 00:35:15,438
Can she wait?

546
00:35:16,598 --> 00:35:18,158
She is already 31.

547
00:35:18,438 --> 00:35:20,838
Her prime childbearing years will pass.

548
00:35:20,838 --> 00:35:24,678
Mom, you're not showing her respect.

549
00:35:25,158 --> 00:35:26,838
We're in a serious relationship.

550
00:35:29,238 --> 00:35:31,718
Yueyue, I'm not trying

551
00:35:31,718 --> 00:35:33,438
to diminish her.

552
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:36,198
I just want to offer you
some objective thoughts.

553
00:35:36,518 --> 00:35:39,198
The problems caused
by your age difference

554
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,958
are way more than what I mentioned.

555
00:35:42,958 --> 00:35:45,438
Even if I don't point them out,

556
00:35:45,718 --> 00:35:48,118
shouldn't you think about it?

557
00:36:33,632 --> 00:36:35,036
(Heisha)

558
00:36:39,078 --> 00:36:42,718
- You're also a fan of Mr. Heisha?
- No.

559
00:36:43,078 --> 00:36:44,318
But you're buying so many.

560
00:36:44,558 --> 00:36:46,558
Thank you. These are for my colleagues.

561
00:36:47,478 --> 00:36:49,158
They're all fans of Heisha?

562
00:36:50,038 --> 00:36:51,398
Not exactly.

563
00:36:52,758 --> 00:36:55,398
So you must have heard of Jiang Shan.

564
00:36:55,478 --> 00:36:57,598
Jiang Shan? Sounds familiar.

565
00:36:57,958 --> 00:36:59,198
What have you heard?

566
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:00,558
Thank you.

567
00:37:01,518 --> 00:37:02,718
I don't remember.

568
00:37:03,278 --> 00:37:04,678
I'm not interested in him, anyway.
