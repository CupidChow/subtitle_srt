will you marry...

00:02:19,674 --> 00:02:20,234
Hi.

31
00:02:20,754 --> 00:02:21,474
What are you doing?

32
00:02:26,314 --> 00:02:27,114
You are hungry, right?

33
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:28,394
I'll make lunch for you.

34
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:34,514
You are Chef Yan indeed.

35
00:02:34,514 --> 00:02:36,234
You can even make a barbecue yourself.

36
00:02:36,514 --> 00:02:37,114
Let's eat.

37
00:02:37,634 --> 00:02:38,074
Wait.

38
00:02:40,954 --> 00:02:42,194
I want to make a reservation first

39
00:02:43,514 --> 00:02:44,354
because I'll eat garlic.

40
00:02:54,914 --> 00:02:56,354
That's great.

41
00:02:57,034 --> 00:02:57,394
Cheers.

42

00:03:02,914 --> 00:03:03,794
It's really delicious.

45
00:03:03,794 --> 00:03:04,634
Of course.

46
00:03:04,794 --> 00:03:05,794
I made it.

47
00:03:08,634 --> 00:03:09,634
Let me wrap one for you.

48
00:03:09,634 --> 00:03:10,234
Alright.

49
00:03:11,074 --> 00:03:13,354
Wrap one with lots of garlic.

50
00:03:14,354 --> 00:03:15,354
Really?

51
00:03:16,394 --> 00:03:16,914
More.

52
00:03:28,594 --> 00:03:29,634

53
00:03:31,034 --> 00:03:31,834
Let me kiss you.

54
00:03:32,154 --> 00:03:33,914
No. You ate garlic.

55
00:03:34,394 --> 00:03:34,954
What?

56
00:03:34,954 --> 00:03:35,354
- Kiss.
- No.

57
00:03:35,354 --> 00:03:35,994
No, no, no.

58
00:03:39,314 --> 00:03:39,914
Let me kiss you.

59
00:03:43,594 --> 00:03:44,634
I cooked a meal for you.

60
00:03:44,634 --> 00:03:45,394
So many delicacies.

61
00:03:45,394 --> 00:03:46,354
And no kiss?

62
00:03:47,674 --> 00:03:48,194
Alright.

63
00:03:50,634 --> 00:03:51,034

00:03:51,074 --> 00:03:51,754

Hello.

I'm Nan, in charge of
JS Sound Art Studio.

72
00:04:28,914 --> 00:04:29,234
Hello.

73
00:04:29,234 --> 00:04:29,794
Hello.

74
00:04:30,074 --> 00:04:32,034
I'm Zhao Min, the editor
of Oaks Literature.

75
00:04:32,594 --> 00:04:34,834
This is the author of Lovely Moonlight,

76
00:04:34,834 --> 00:04:35,674
Ms. Qingqing.

77
00:04:36,354 --> 00:04:37,634
Hello, I'm Yan Yue.

78
00:04:38,314 --> 00:04:39,354
Please, sit down.

79
00:04:42,354 --> 00:04:43,394
Thank you so much

80
00:04:43,394 --> 00:04:45,114
for coming to our studio.

81
00:04:45,914 --> 00:04:47,114
Actually, this issue

82
00:04:47,234 --> 00:04:49,234
was caused by
our negligence in copyright.

83
00:04:49,514 --> 00:04:50,634
It has caused you trouble

84
00:04:50,794 --> 00:04:52,314
and we are really very sorry.

85
00:05:00,074 --> 00:05:02,234
Regarding the extortion
from Southern Lights,

86
00:05:02,234 --> 00:05:03,394
we have decided

87
00:05:03,794 --> 00:05:05,234
to resolve it by legal means.

88
00:05:05,914 --> 00:05:07,074
As for the copyright,

89
00:05:07,794 --> 00:05:10,114
we will buy the copyright of
Lovely Moonlight

90
00:05:10,114 --> 00:05:11,674
at twice the market price

91
00:05:11,674 --> 00:05:12,794
as an apology.

92
00:05:22,194 --> 00:05:23,914
Before verifying the copyright issue,

93
00:05:24,354 --> 00:05:25,914
I rashly spoke out online,

94
00:05:26,634 --> 00:05:28,514
arousing a lot of
unnecessary public opinion.

95
00:05:29,114 --> 00:05:30,474
It has caused both of you trouble,

96
00:05:30,594 --> 00:05:31,794
and I am really very sorry.

97
00:05:37,674 --> 00:05:39,514
We see the sincerity of your studio,

98
00:05:40,514 --> 00:05:41,514
and we agree to settle.

99
00:05:45,314 --> 00:05:45,794
Okay.

100
00:05:47,794 --> 00:05:48,634
Later,

101
00:05:48,634 --> 00:05:50,234
all members of our studio will

102
00:05:50,474 --> 00:05:51,514
write an apology letter by hand

103
00:05:51,514 --> 00:05:52,474
and apologize publicly.

104
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:56,354
You should remember
to check the copyright next time.

105
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:59,354
Actually, you are
also victims this time.

106
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:00,954
Don't worry.

107
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:03,634
Our studio
also suffered a lot this time.

108
00:06:05,594 --> 00:06:07,354
But I would like to ask Ms. Qingqing

109
00:06:07,354 --> 00:06:09,394
to issue
a clarification statement for us.

110
00:06:10,474 --> 00:06:11,074
Okay.

111
00:06:11,314 --> 00:06:11,754
Thank you.

112
00:06:14,194 --> 00:06:15,074
Any other questions?

113
00:06:15,394 --> 00:06:15,794
None.

114
00:06:16,514 --> 00:06:16,914
Alright.

115
00:06:17,234 --> 00:06:18,234
Let's end here today.

116
00:06:18,954 --> 00:06:19,954
Thank you for your hard work.

117
00:06:24,314 --> 00:06:24,914
Take care.

118
00:06:25,954 --> 00:06:26,594
Okay, thank you.

119
00:06:27,474 --> 00:06:28,234
Thank you.

120
00:06:28,794 --> 00:06:29,354
- Bye.
- Bye.

121
00:06:29,354 --> 00:06:29,914
We'll leave you.

122
00:06:39,114 --> 00:06:41,114
I will bear all the losses

123
00:06:41,114 --> 00:06:42,234
from this copyright issue.

124
00:06:42,914 --> 00:06:44,674
If I hadn't spoken up at the time,

125
00:06:44,674 --> 00:06:45,474
this matter

126
00:06:45,474 --> 00:06:47,114
wouldn't have snowballed.

127
00:06:49,114 --> 00:06:50,154
You

128
00:06:50,914 --> 00:06:52,594
just focus on making money now.

129
00:06:52,994 --> 00:06:54,434
I'm counting on you for my house.

130
00:06:56,474 --> 00:06:57,594
I got it.

131
00:06:57,594 --> 00:06:58,914
You keep nagging.

132
00:06:59,034 --> 00:06:59,794
If I don't nag...

133
00:06:59,994 --> 00:07:00,794
Shan.

134
00:07:00,914 --> 00:07:01,474
How is it?

135
00:07:02,234 --> 00:07:03,354
It's all right.

136
00:07:03,594 --> 00:07:04,994
They've agreed to settle.

137
00:07:05,354 --> 00:07:07,114
We'll be fine as we issue

138
00:07:07,114 --> 00:07:07,994
a statement later.

139
00:07:08,794 --> 00:07:10,434
This time we are paying
to get out of trouble.

140
00:07:11,594 --> 00:07:13,474
In the future, our studio

141
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:14,474
must scrutinize every project.

142
00:07:14,714 --> 00:07:15,794
We can afford to pay once.

143
00:07:15,794 --> 00:07:16,554
But if you pay twice,

144
00:07:16,714 --> 00:07:18,114
our company will definitely go bankrupt.

145
00:07:19,674 --> 00:07:21,554
The master is back.

146
00:07:21,554 --> 00:07:22,794
Cash cow number two is in place.

147
00:07:23,114 --> 00:07:24,154
Shan, don't worry.

148
00:07:24,914 --> 00:07:25,594
Alright then.

149
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,114
Issue the statement.

150
00:07:27,674 --> 00:07:28,354
Open for business.

151
00:07:28,474 --> 00:07:29,434
I'll go back to recording.

152
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,114
Why are you looking at me?

153
00:07:32,794 --> 00:07:33,874
Write your statement now.

154
00:07:34,034 --> 00:07:35,354
Young and impulsive.

155
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,960
(Apology statement)

156
00:08:20,464 --> 00:08:23,490
(Handwritten apology statement)

157
00:08:57,594 --> 00:08:58,474
Has Miss An contacted you

158
00:08:58,474 --> 00:08:59,874
since that day?

159
00:09:01,234 --> 00:09:01,674
No.

160
00:09:02,154 --> 00:09:03,714
I've been coding recently.

161
00:09:04,114 --> 00:09:05,034
I dare not disturb her.

162
00:09:05,034 --> 00:09:05,994
I'm afraid she's in a bad mood.

163
00:09:07,234 --> 00:09:08,234
Me too.

164
00:09:08,914 --> 00:09:10,794
I sent her all the information,

165
00:09:11,114 --> 00:09:12,914
even though I don't know if it's useful.

166
00:09:12,914 --> 00:09:14,234
But she hasn't contacted me.

167
00:09:16,474 --> 00:09:17,874
Neither of you two has contacted her?

168
00:09:18,994 --> 00:09:20,794
Say something. Hurry up.

169
00:09:21,674 --> 00:09:22,554
It's okay.

170
00:09:23,994 --> 00:09:24,874
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

171
00:09:26,114 --> 00:09:26,994
Say it.

172
00:09:27,354 --> 00:09:28,594
You'll know

173
00:09:28,594 --> 00:09:29,714
when Miss An's here.

174
00:09:29,714 --> 00:09:31,234
She'll definitely tell you.

175
00:09:31,674 --> 00:09:32,714
So don't worry.

176
00:09:32,874 --> 00:09:33,674
Don't worry.

177
00:09:34,034 --> 00:09:34,914
- Cheer up.
- Don't worry.

178
00:09:35,034 --> 00:09:35,594
Right, you know.

179
00:09:36,594 --> 00:09:37,274
An Ran

180
00:09:37,794 --> 00:09:38,994
can overcome every obstacle.

181
00:09:39,354 --> 00:09:39,994
Right?

182
00:09:42,794 --> 00:09:43,354
It's okay.

183
00:09:44,034 --> 00:09:44,554
Miss An.

184
00:09:47,034 --> 00:09:47,594
Miss An.

185
00:09:47,714 --> 00:09:48,594
Miss An.

186

Thank you all for coming to the cafe
for a meeting with me.

188
00:10:04,674 --> 00:10:05,674
During this period,

189
00:10:06,994 --> 00:10:07,914
you've worked hard.

190

Please sit down.

191

Let's sit.

192
00:10:14,874 --> 00:10:17,114
I'll take this opportunity
to update you all.

193
00:10:17,994 --> 00:10:20,794
During this period,
we visited companies in the industry

194
00:10:20,794 --> 00:10:22,714
that have had
the same experiences as us.

195
00:10:23,354 --> 00:10:25,554
Some of them went bankrupt

196
00:10:25,554 --> 00:10:26,594
in order to pay the hackers.

197
00:10:27,114 --> 00:10:29,154
Some were acquired by big enterprises,

198
00:10:29,154 --> 00:10:30,994
and ended up just as miserable.

199
00:10:31,594 --> 00:10:33,154
Mr. Hu and I thought

200
00:10:33,874 --> 00:10:35,354
we should unite with them

201
00:10:35,354 --> 00:10:38,234
and set up an
Anti-Cyber Attack Alliance.

202
00:10:39,554 --> 00:10:41,474
The meaning of the alliance is,

203
00:10:41,594 --> 00:10:44,434
for small start-up companies like us,

204
00:10:44,554 --> 00:10:45,874
to unite

205
00:10:46,114 --> 00:10:48,474
and gather

206
00:10:48,474 --> 00:10:49,554
all the evidence we have,

207
00:10:49,914 --> 00:10:51,434
so those hackers in the dark

208
00:10:51,554 --> 00:10:53,914
won't dare to be as rampantly as before.

209
00:10:57,354 --> 00:10:59,474
However, for now,
we still need you to hold on.

210
00:11:00,674 --> 00:11:01,874
Our ultimate goal

211
00:11:02,154 --> 00:11:03,154
is to get

212
00:11:03,234 --> 00:11:04,714
Fragment Time Boyfriend

213
00:11:04,994 --> 00:11:05,994
back online.

214
00:11:06,554 --> 00:11:07,154
- Okay.
- Great.

215
00:11:09,554 --> 00:11:10,354
Take a look.

216
00:11:26,554 --> 00:11:27,154
Miss An.

217
00:11:27,594 --> 00:11:29,354
How many people are in this alliance?

218
00:11:29,994 --> 00:11:32,434
Look, there are many companies here.

219
00:11:32,874 --> 00:11:34,234
Among them, already two

220
00:11:34,234 --> 00:11:35,674
are willing to side with us.

221
00:11:36,354 --> 00:11:38,674
But two is far from enough, right?

222
00:11:39,554 --> 00:11:42,434
So, I need you, Tian Xin and Wu,

223
00:11:42,554 --> 00:11:45,034
to check on
the status of other companies.

224
00:11:45,034 --> 00:11:46,354
Then, according to their situations,

225
00:11:46,354 --> 00:11:47,434
we'll talk to them one by one.

226
00:11:49,434 --> 00:11:50,154
Don't worry, Miss An.

227
00:11:50,674 --> 00:11:51,354
No problem.

228
00:11:52,594 --> 00:11:53,354
Miss An,

229
00:11:53,794 --> 00:11:56,234
I think this method is worth promoting.

230
00:11:56,234 --> 00:11:57,034
But

231
00:11:58,354 --> 00:11:59,114
why would these companies

232
00:11:59,114 --> 00:12:01,594
stand with us on the same front

233
00:12:01,594 --> 00:12:03,034
to fight against large companies?

234
00:12:03,554 --> 00:12:04,994
Just because we are all victims

235
00:12:05,594 --> 00:12:08,474
and we have the same demands and goals.

236
00:12:10,674 --> 00:12:11,554
Do you all still remember

237
00:12:11,554 --> 00:12:12,474
the World of Imagination?

238
00:12:12,474 --> 00:12:13,354
We did an event for it.

239
00:12:13,554 --> 00:12:15,154
The World of Imagination was so good,

240
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,274
but you've seen

241
00:12:16,274 --> 00:12:17,114
how bad it became.

242
00:12:18,114 --> 00:12:20,354
Previously, because no one
was willing to lead

243
00:12:20,594 --> 00:12:21,994
to establish such an alliance.

244
00:12:22,474 --> 00:12:23,434
Now that we have established it,

245
00:12:24,354 --> 00:12:25,994
won't it have a better effect?

246
00:12:29,114 --> 00:12:29,794
Miss An,

247
00:12:29,994 --> 00:12:32,234
do you need us?

248
00:12:33,114 --> 00:12:34,434
Of course, I need you.

249
00:12:34,674 --> 00:12:36,714
Yaoyao, Changfeng and Peng.

250
00:12:36,914 --> 00:12:37,794
You three

251
00:12:37,794 --> 00:12:39,594
are the gatekeepers of
our Gaishi Unparalleled.

252
00:12:39,914 --> 00:12:41,794
You have to help us guard the crystal.

253
00:12:42,034 --> 00:12:43,594
Because Fragment Time Boyfriend

254
00:12:43,914 --> 00:12:45,594
may come back online at any time.

255
00:12:46,034 --> 00:12:47,434
But before that,

256
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,234
we have been offline for so long

257
00:12:49,474 --> 00:12:50,874
and lost a lot of fans.

258
00:12:52,034 --> 00:12:53,994
Did you receive the email
I sent you yesterday?

259
00:12:54,434 --> 00:12:55,874
It has my modification requests

260
00:12:55,874 --> 00:12:57,034
and a new promotional plan.

261
00:12:57,034 --> 00:12:58,354
We can make some adjustments

262
00:12:58,354 --> 00:12:59,554
based on it.

263
00:12:59,794 --> 00:13:01,354
I read your email.

264
00:13:01,434 --> 00:13:03,554
Actually, there're many places
that need to be changed.

265
00:13:03,914 --> 00:13:04,434
Peng,

266
00:13:04,714 --> 00:13:05,594
we need to

267
00:13:05,594 --> 00:13:07,274
get the new modifications done
as soon as possible.

268
00:13:09,874 --> 00:13:10,354
Miss An,

269
00:13:10,674 --> 00:13:11,794
Yaoyao and I will figure it out

270
00:13:12,114 --> 00:13:12,674
to speed it up.

271
00:13:12,994 --> 00:13:13,594
Don't worry.

272
00:13:16,034 --> 00:13:16,914
Speaking of which,

273
00:13:17,154 --> 00:13:19,714
this time it was my carelessness

274
00:13:20,914 --> 00:13:22,874
that allowed hackers
to break through our firewall.

275
00:13:23,434 --> 00:13:24,794
I've added better maintenance

276
00:13:24,794 --> 00:13:27,274
on the original firewall

277
00:13:27,434 --> 00:13:28,674
and strengthened its management.

278
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:30,274
This time I will watch it all the way

279
00:13:30,994 --> 00:13:32,994
and won't let such a thing happen again.

280
00:13:33,994 --> 00:13:35,354
Why are you taking the responsibility?

281
00:13:35,354 --> 00:13:36,474
I didn't take any responsibility.

282
00:13:36,994 --> 00:13:37,994
We've been through so much

283
00:13:37,994 --> 00:13:39,474
along this way.

284
00:13:39,474 --> 00:13:40,674
Have we ever backed down?

285
00:13:40,674 --> 00:13:41,354
No.

286
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:42,714
We have all made it through, right?

287
00:13:43,674 --> 00:13:44,474
All right.

288
00:13:44,874 --> 00:13:47,234
Today is not
an error correction meeting.

289
00:13:47,554 --> 00:13:48,354
It's not your fault,

290
00:13:48,354 --> 00:13:49,154
nor is it your fault.

291
00:13:49,674 --> 00:13:50,994
We knew how to solve it now,

292
00:13:50,994 --> 00:13:51,594
right?

293
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:52,434
Come on.

294
00:13:52,594 --> 00:13:53,594
Let's all cheer up.

295
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:54,434
Okay.

296
00:13:59,354 --> 00:14:00,474
Gaishi Unparalleled.

297
00:14:00,794 --> 00:14:01,874
- Go for it.
- Go for it.

298
00:14:06,994 --> 00:14:07,794
Alright.

299
00:14:08,034 --> 00:14:09,114
Thank you for your support.

300
00:14:10,594 --> 00:14:10,994
Goodbye.

301
00:14:21,874 --> 00:14:22,434
An Ran,

302
00:14:22,874 --> 00:14:25,034
I think it's about these two days.

303
00:14:26,874 --> 00:14:28,674
What these two days?

304
00:14:29,594 --> 00:14:30,594
The proposal.

305
00:14:33,154 --> 00:14:34,994
I'll go to the bathroom
and tell you when I come back.

306
00:14:52,794 --> 00:14:53,234
Hi.

307
00:14:57,234 --> 00:14:57,874
What are you doing?

308
00:15:02,714 --> 00:15:03,474
You are hungry, right?

309
00:15:03,874 --> 00:15:04,914
I'll make you lunch.

310
00:15:22,274 --> 00:15:22,914
Well.

311
00:15:23,754 --> 00:15:25,354
Isn't it too soon?

312
00:15:26,754 --> 00:15:27,754
How is it too soon?

313
00:15:28,754 --> 00:15:29,394
Think about it,

314
00:15:29,874 --> 00:15:31,634
we've been through a lot,

315
00:15:31,634 --> 00:15:33,354
big and small,

316
00:15:33,354 --> 00:15:34,754
since we found Mr. Heisha for dubbing.

317
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:36,754
Isn't it hooliganism

318
00:15:36,994 --> 00:15:38,234
if it's not for the purpose of marriage?

319
00:15:41,594 --> 00:15:44,234
Well, it's not exactly hooliganism.

320
00:15:44,754 --> 00:15:46,514
After all, our company

321
00:15:46,514 --> 00:15:47,874
is in trouble right now.

322
00:15:48,394 --> 00:15:49,994
Those are all excuses.

323
00:15:50,994 --> 00:15:54,594
Besides, we're in
the sweet period right now, aren't we?

324
00:15:54,794 --> 00:15:55,514
The timing

325
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:56,514
is just right.

326
00:15:59,234 --> 00:15:59,874
A few days ago,

327
00:16:00,114 --> 00:16:01,874
I heard the silly Hu Yingjun

328
00:16:01,874 --> 00:16:03,394
calling a jewelry store

329
00:16:04,674 --> 00:16:06,394
and sneaking around.

330
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,114
He can't escape my penetrating eyes.

331
00:16:13,074 --> 00:16:14,194
Hu Yingjun?

332
00:16:16,594 --> 00:16:17,034
Right.

333
00:16:18,474 --> 00:16:19,514
Who else could it be?

334
00:16:21,754 --> 00:16:22,354
An Ran,

335
00:16:22,394 --> 00:16:24,114
I've reformed now.

336
00:16:28,674 --> 00:16:29,994
I think if it's Hu Yingjun,

337
00:16:29,994 --> 00:16:31,274
you shouldn't be reserved.

338
00:16:31,274 --> 00:16:32,394
You should hurry up.

339
00:16:32,754 --> 00:16:33,474
Right?

340
00:16:37,274 --> 00:16:40,274
But what if I agree to him too soon,

341
00:16:40,674 --> 00:16:42,034
and he will not cherish it?

342
00:16:43,874 --> 00:16:44,874
That's possible.

343
00:16:49,114 --> 00:16:49,914
Then think about it,

344
00:16:50,154 --> 00:16:51,994
do you really want to marry him?

345
00:17:06,874 --> 00:17:08,634
What are you hesitating for then?

346
00:17:12,394 --> 00:17:13,874
It drove me crazy
that you only said half of it.

347
00:17:14,354 --> 00:17:16,674
I haven't fully confirmed it yet.

348
00:17:21,154 --> 00:17:22,994
I want to see

349
00:17:23,354 --> 00:17:24,674
what surprise can this silly guy bring.

350
00:17:27,394 --> 00:17:28,154
But An Ran.

351
00:17:28,274 --> 00:17:29,154
You two

352
00:17:29,154 --> 00:17:31,154
get the important things done first
in the next few days.

353
00:17:31,154 --> 00:17:32,674
Right now, for us,

354
00:17:32,794 --> 00:17:34,274
the company comes first.

355
00:17:35,274 --> 00:17:35,754
Okay.

356
00:17:36,234 --> 00:17:37,394
Lend me your guy for several days.

357
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,114
Approved.

358
00:17:57,634 --> 00:17:58,354
A few days ago,

359
00:17:58,594 --> 00:18:00,354
I heard the silly Hu Yingjun

360
00:18:00,354 --> 00:18:01,874
calling a jewelry store,

361
00:18:03,354 --> 00:18:04,874
and sneaking around.

362
00:18:05,394 --> 00:18:07,394
He can't escape my penetrating eyes.

363
00:18:19,274 --> 00:18:19,874
An Ran,

364
00:18:21,674 --> 00:18:22,994
what I want to tell you is

365
00:18:25,034 --> 00:18:28,474
being with you is something
I've already determined.

366
00:18:29,394 --> 00:18:31,034
No matter when we get married

367
00:18:31,914 --> 00:18:33,274
or have children,

368
00:18:33,874 --> 00:18:35,154
I respect your choices.

369
00:18:36,874 --> 00:18:37,754
I'm with you

370
00:18:37,754 --> 00:18:38,874
with no other purpose.

371
00:18:40,394 --> 00:18:41,274
I just want to

372
00:18:42,634 --> 00:18:44,874
have you for as long as I can.

373
00:18:48,154 --> 00:18:49,754
(This fool is not really waiting for me)

374
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:51,514
(to propose to him, is he?)

375
00:18:52,754 --> 00:18:54,874
(He can't be duller
than Hu Yingjun, can he?)

376
00:19:00,034 --> 00:19:01,394
(Miss An, are you busy?)

377
00:19:13,514 --> 00:19:14,634
(Yes.)

378
00:19:26,914 --> 00:19:28,234
Relax.

379
00:19:28,514 --> 00:19:31,154
Isn't this much simpler than
attracting investments and making money?

380
00:19:34,914 --> 00:19:35,994
It's not the same.

381
00:19:36,514 --> 00:19:37,874
It is hard to attract investments,

382
00:19:37,874 --> 00:19:39,274
but it only affects us.

383
00:19:39,874 --> 00:19:41,394
The Anti-Cyber Attack Alliance

384
00:19:41,474 --> 00:19:43,594
affects more
small and medium-sized companies.

385
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:46,754
So by your logic,

386
00:19:47,154 --> 00:19:48,394
I, Hu Yingjun,

387
00:19:48,874 --> 00:19:50,754
am also doing a great cause.

388
00:19:54,754 --> 00:19:55,634
But An Ran,

389
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:56,994
well,

390
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,514
no company has done this before.

391
00:19:59,874 --> 00:20:01,914
Businessmen only focus on profit.

392
00:20:01,914 --> 00:20:03,874
Will they really ally with us sincerely?

393
00:20:04,514 --> 00:20:06,514
Don't end up, after all the efforts,

394
00:20:06,514 --> 00:20:07,754
being the one who stands out

395
00:20:07,914 --> 00:20:08,754
and gets no thanks.

396
00:20:09,514 --> 00:20:11,514
That's why we need someone

397
00:20:11,514 --> 00:20:12,874
to be the first one to stand out

398
00:20:13,154 --> 00:20:15,634
and prove to everyone that
only by uniting can we find a way out.

399
00:20:16,634 --> 00:20:18,394
Think about it, over the years,

400
00:20:18,394 --> 00:20:20,394
so many companies have been ruined
by unfair competition.

401
00:20:20,514 --> 00:20:22,034
Bad money drives out good.

402
00:20:22,034 --> 00:20:23,154
If it continues like this,

403
00:20:23,274 --> 00:20:25,114
the whole industry will become murky.

404
00:20:25,674 --> 00:20:26,794
How to realize dreams?

405
00:20:26,994 --> 00:20:28,034
How to ensure quality content?

406
00:20:30,274 --> 00:20:30,874
I see.

407
00:20:32,154 --> 00:20:33,994
Instead of sitting
and waiting for death,

408
00:20:34,154 --> 00:20:34,874
we should

409
00:20:35,394 --> 00:20:36,274
take the initiative.

410
00:20:36,514 --> 00:20:37,274
Exactly.

411
00:20:38,034 --> 00:20:40,274
No one wants to be
a lamb to the slaughter.

412
00:20:40,754 --> 00:20:42,994
When everyone has a common demand,

413
00:20:43,274 --> 00:20:44,874
as long as one person believes in us,

414
00:20:44,874 --> 00:20:47,154
a hundred people will believe in us.

415
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:50,514
Hu Yingjun,

416
00:20:50,634 --> 00:20:52,394
you're really going to
honor your ancestors.

417
00:20:52,874 --> 00:20:53,874
Alright.

418
00:20:53,874 --> 00:20:55,034
Sit tight then.

419
00:20:55,034 --> 00:20:56,754
Gaishi Unparalleled, ready?

420
00:20:57,154 --> 00:20:59,234
- Accelerate.
- Go.

461
00:23:45,938 --> 00:23:46,698
and still watching.

462
00:23:46,938 --> 00:23:47,698
They are tough.

463
00:23:50,058 --> 00:23:50,698
Nervous?

464
00:23:55,578 --> 00:23:56,218
Yes.

465
00:23:59,178 --> 00:24:00,098
We'll make it.

466
00:24:12,058 --> 00:24:12,578
Mr. Chen.

467
00:24:13,058 --> 00:24:13,578
Everyone,

468
00:24:14,818 --> 00:24:16,698
this is Mr. Hu from Gaishi Unparalleled

469
00:24:17,178 --> 00:24:18,338
and the other one is

470
00:24:18,338 --> 00:24:20,818
the one who called us here, Miss An.

471
00:24:23,698 --> 00:24:24,458
Hello everyone,

472
00:24:25,058 --> 00:24:25,938
I am An Ran.

473
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:28,338
What I am experiencing now

474
00:24:28,338 --> 00:24:30,578
is what you
have experienced before, cyber attacks.

475
00:24:30,938 --> 00:24:33,458
I called you all here today

476
00:24:33,938 --> 00:24:36,458
to figure out

477
00:24:36,938 --> 00:24:38,938
how to prevent such things
from happening again.

478
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:47,098
I know

479
00:24:47,818 --> 00:24:49,178
you all have many doubts,

480
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:50,578
but I believe

481
00:24:50,578 --> 00:24:52,578
we can sit down and discuss it slowly.

482
00:24:52,938 --> 00:24:53,458
Yes.

483
00:24:53,818 --> 00:24:54,458
Everyone,

484
00:24:55,178 --> 00:24:56,578
why don't we hear what Miss An thinks?

485
00:24:59,098 --> 00:24:59,578
Alright,

486
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:00,458
let's sit then.

487
00:25:01,338 --> 00:25:02,058
Let's sit.

488
00:25:55,818 --> 00:25:56,818
Ms. Qingqing has reposted

489
00:25:56,818 --> 00:25:57,978
our apology statement.

490
00:25:58,698 --> 00:26:00,938
Oaks Literature has also reposted it.

491
00:26:01,058 --> 00:26:02,218
Let me read it to you.

492
00:26:02,338 --> 00:26:03,818
The feedback in the forum now

493
00:26:03,818 --> 00:26:05,058
is mostly positive.

494
00:26:05,578 --> 00:26:07,938
JS Sound Art Studio
seems to have a good attitude.

495
00:26:07,938 --> 00:26:08,938
The author also reposted it.

496
00:26:09,058 --> 00:26:10,178
They should have talked it out.

497
00:26:10,778 --> 00:26:11,698
There's one more.

498
00:26:12,298 --> 00:26:13,338
I knew that Mr. Heisha

499
00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:14,698
would handle this matter well.

500
00:26:15,058 --> 00:26:16,938
Luckily, Mr. Heisha comes back.

501
00:26:17,058 --> 00:26:18,978
Otherwise, we wouldn't know
whose audiobook to listen to.

502
00:26:25,178 --> 00:26:26,578
Mr. Heisha,

503
00:26:27,178 --> 00:26:28,178
congratulations on your comeback.

504
00:26:58,658 --> 00:26:59,218
Hu Yingjun,

505
00:26:59,658 --> 00:27:01,298
was what I just said professional?

506
00:27:02,938 --> 00:27:04,098
You were so cool.

507
00:27:06,778 --> 00:27:09,178
Finally, we established the alliance.

508
00:27:10,658 --> 00:27:12,658
I have to draft the alliance charter
when I go back.

509
00:27:14,196 --> 00:27:15,058
Well,

510
00:27:15,058 --> 00:27:17,818
don't look to me for this kind of work.

511
00:27:17,818 --> 00:27:19,178
Why would I look for you?

512
00:27:19,178 --> 00:27:20,818
You hardly know any words.

513
00:27:26,698 --> 00:27:28,338
(Due to the negligence of
copyright verification,)

514
00:27:28,778 --> 00:27:29,818
(we have not yet obtained)

515
00:27:29,818 --> 00:27:31,578
(the audiobook production rights
for Lovely Moonlight,)

516
00:27:31,938 --> 00:27:32,938
(but recorded the audiobook)

517
00:27:32,938 --> 00:27:34,298
(Apology Statement)
(with Southern Lights.)

518
00:27:34,818 --> 00:27:36,458
(For this, we feel deeply guilty.)

519
00:27:36,938 --> 00:27:38,538
(To make up for our negligence,)

520
00:27:38,818 --> 00:27:40,538
(JS Sound Art Studio
has decided to purchase)

521
00:27:40,538 --> 00:27:42,458
(the full copyright of
Lovely Moonlight,)

522
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:44,098
(and have Heisha re-dub it.)

523
00:27:44,658 --> 00:27:46,058
(At the same time, we strongly condemn)

524
00:27:46,058 --> 00:27:48,778
(the disregard of copyright ownership
by Southern Lights,)

525
00:27:48,938 --> 00:27:50,458
(and their disregard
for the rights of others.)

526
00:27:51,178 --> 00:27:52,938
(Thank you for
your supervision and criticism.)

527
00:27:53,178 --> 00:27:54,938
(From all members of
JS Sound Art Studio.)

528
00:27:58,698 --> 00:28:00,338
Who is that up ahead?

529
00:28:00,338 --> 00:28:03,458
Why is there a stone standing there?

530
00:28:18,818 --> 00:28:20,218
Mr. Heisha,

531
00:28:20,458 --> 00:28:21,338
long time no see.

532
00:28:21,818 --> 00:28:22,458
What's going on?

533
00:28:22,538 --> 00:28:23,938
Now you come here to pick her up?

534
00:28:23,938 --> 00:28:25,058
Why not just pick her up

535
00:28:25,058 --> 00:28:26,058
at the meeting place next time

536
00:28:26,058 --> 00:28:26,938
before I send her back?

537
00:28:27,818 --> 00:28:28,578
An Ran,

538
00:28:28,858 --> 00:28:30,178
where did you find the driver?

539
00:28:30,178 --> 00:28:31,058
Why does he talk so much?

540
00:28:31,578 --> 00:28:33,338
I found him on a random app.

541
00:28:33,338 --> 00:28:34,578
He probably didn't receive training.

542
00:28:34,938 --> 00:28:35,938
You're an ingrate.

543
00:28:36,058 --> 00:28:36,818
To send you back,

544
00:28:36,818 --> 00:28:38,338
I have my darling Mengyao waiting.

545
00:28:38,578 --> 00:28:39,538
Alright, driver,

546
00:28:39,538 --> 00:28:40,578
the person has been dropped off.

547
00:28:40,578 --> 00:28:41,418
Go pick up the next order.

548
00:28:41,698 --> 00:28:42,178
Alright.

549
00:28:42,458 --> 00:28:43,338
Give me five stars.

550
00:28:43,338 --> 00:28:45,418
Yingjun's car service
is at your service.

551
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:49,178
Stay safe.

552
00:28:49,458 --> 00:28:49,938
Bye.

553
00:28:58,578 --> 00:29:00,458
You look happy today.

554
00:29:01,458 --> 00:29:02,818
I made a successful comeback
this afternoon.

555
00:29:02,938 --> 00:29:03,658
Did you see it?

556
00:29:04,698 --> 00:29:06,218
I saw it on the way back.

557
00:29:06,458 --> 00:29:07,938
Congratulations, Mr. Heisha.

558
00:29:08,698 --> 00:29:09,578
How about you?

559
00:29:10,698 --> 00:29:12,818
We took the most crucial step today.

560
00:29:13,298 --> 00:29:14,578
Although there's still a distance

561
00:29:14,578 --> 00:29:15,538
to the game being back online,

562
00:29:15,978 --> 00:29:18,418
I feel victory is not far away.

563
00:29:32,218 --> 00:29:33,578
Here, let me carry you.

564
00:29:34,178 --> 00:29:35,418
Thanks, bro.

565
00:29:40,098 --> 00:29:40,858
Are you tired?

566
00:29:41,098 --> 00:29:41,698
No.

567
00:29:47,058 --> 00:29:47,698
Hey, beauty.

568
00:29:53,578 --> 00:29:54,578
Don't flirt with me.

569
00:29:54,578 --> 00:29:56,178
My boyfriend is coming
to pick me up soon.

570
00:29:57,578 --> 00:29:58,818
What a coincidence.

571
00:29:59,578 --> 00:30:01,938
My girlfriend says the same thing.

572
00:30:05,978 --> 00:30:07,698
You've worked hard.

573
00:30:07,698 --> 00:30:08,818
Not at all.

574
00:30:08,818 --> 00:30:09,578
How was it?

575
00:30:09,578 --> 00:30:10,338
Did it go smoothly?

576
00:30:10,818 --> 00:30:11,578
Very smoothly.

577
00:30:12,338 --> 00:30:12,938
That's good.

578
00:30:12,938 --> 00:30:13,978
Get in the car and wait for me.

579
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:14,538
I go buy some water.

580
00:30:14,538 --> 00:30:15,778
I've been thirsty all afternoon.

581
00:30:16,218 --> 00:30:17,898
All afternoon?

582
00:30:18,058 --> 00:30:19,218
You've worked hard, baby.

583
00:30:20,818 --> 00:30:21,698
Watch your head.

584
00:30:23,938 --> 00:30:24,338
Wait for me.

585
00:30:24,498 --> 00:30:25,098
Hurry up.

586
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:40,818
He was so busy,

587
00:30:40,938 --> 00:30:42,698
but he still had time to buy me a gift.

588
00:30:55,338 --> 00:30:56,458
A ring.

589
00:30:59,338 --> 00:31:00,938
It must be a proposal ring.

590
00:31:04,938 --> 00:31:05,338
No,

591
00:31:05,938 --> 00:31:06,658
Bai Mengyao.

592
00:31:06,658 --> 00:31:07,938
Calm down.

593
00:31:21,578 --> 00:31:22,338
You're back.

594
00:31:27,298 --> 00:31:27,818
Have some water.

595
00:31:28,338 --> 00:31:29,098
Thank you.

596
00:31:31,338 --> 00:31:31,978
Did you open it?

597
00:31:32,858 --> 00:31:34,058
No, no.

598
00:31:34,458 --> 00:31:35,338
This is someone else's.

599
00:31:47,058 --> 00:31:48,458
Let's go.

600
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:54,658
Caught him.

601
00:31:54,658 --> 00:31:55,578
Seven Star Radiant Sword.

602
00:32:01,938 --> 00:32:02,938
I need to go home.

603
00:32:03,818 --> 00:32:04,458
Why?

604
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:08,578
I need to use the bathroom.

605
00:32:08,938 --> 00:32:10,178
There's a bathroom in my house.

606
00:32:13,458 --> 00:32:14,818
I'd rather go home to use it.

607
00:32:15,698 --> 00:32:16,698
What about moving to my place?

608
00:32:30,418 --> 00:32:31,618
Let's talk about this later.

609
00:32:42,138 --> 00:32:43,418
Bai Mengyao, I have diarrhea.

610
00:32:44,418 --> 00:32:46,578
You're reporting diarrhea to me
in the middle of the night?

611
00:32:46,938 --> 00:32:47,658
No, no.

612
00:32:47,818 --> 00:32:49,818
I almost had diarrhea
at Yan Yue's house.

613
00:32:49,818 --> 00:32:51,538
Get to the point, miss.

614
00:32:51,538 --> 00:32:52,698
The point is that right now,

615
00:32:52,698 --> 00:32:54,418
I can't use the bathroom
at Yan Yue's house yet.

616
00:32:54,418 --> 00:32:55,138
And he just

617
00:32:55,138 --> 00:32:56,858
invited me to move in with him.

618
00:32:57,658 --> 00:32:58,418
Is that true?

619
00:32:58,418 --> 00:32:59,338
What do you think?

620
00:32:59,658 --> 00:33:00,858
I

621
00:33:03,418 --> 00:33:04,378
have no thoughts.

622
00:33:04,378 --> 00:33:05,418
I think we haven't been together

623
00:33:05,418 --> 00:33:07,178
for a long time.

624
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:09,418
It's been a long time.
What age are we in?

625
00:33:09,418 --> 00:33:10,618
Platonic love?

626
00:33:12,138 --> 00:33:13,938
That's not the point.

627
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:15,658
All in all,

628
00:33:16,218 --> 00:33:17,538
what should I do

629
00:33:17,538 --> 00:33:18,618
in situations like this?

630
00:33:19,418 --> 00:33:21,178
What's the big deal?
Everyone needs to poop.

631
00:33:21,418 --> 00:33:22,938
Doesn't Yan Yue have diarrhea?

632
00:33:26,858 --> 00:33:27,338
Well,

633
00:33:27,898 --> 00:33:29,218
seriously,

634
00:33:29,418 --> 00:33:30,978
should I move in?

635
00:33:30,978 --> 00:33:32,618
You'll have to decide that yourself.

636
00:33:32,618 --> 00:33:33,938
Anyway, when I'm in a relationship,

637
00:33:33,938 --> 00:33:35,698
I don't need any independent space.

638
00:33:35,698 --> 00:33:37,138
I feel the longer we can be together,

639
00:33:37,138 --> 00:33:38,138
the longer we should be.

640
00:33:38,138 --> 00:33:40,698
I guess I'm just used to it.

641
00:33:41,298 --> 00:33:42,978
Isn't it perfect to change that?

642
00:33:46,338 --> 00:33:47,138
Let's not talk about this.

643
00:34:03,178 --> 00:34:03,938
Yan Yue,

644
00:34:05,298 --> 00:34:07,618
are we really going to enter this stage?

645
00:34:08,658 --> 00:34:09,618
Why not?

646
00:34:12,378 --> 00:34:13,938
I feel like we...

647
00:34:13,938 --> 00:34:16,058
I've seen you without makeup.

648
00:34:18,578 --> 00:34:20,378
I know what you look like

649
00:34:20,378 --> 00:34:21,618
when you're drunk.

650
00:34:22,178 --> 00:34:24,698
I know your parents and friends.

651
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:26,098
What are you worried about?

652
00:34:28,098 --> 00:34:29,178
There's a lot.

653
00:34:29,338 --> 00:34:30,058
For example,

654
00:34:30,058 --> 00:34:31,778
you have to take out the trash on time,
while I am...

655
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:32,818
Sloppy?

656
00:34:33,218 --> 00:34:34,618
I already know that.

657
00:34:36,618 --> 00:34:37,178
Alright.

658
00:34:37,178 --> 00:34:38,938
Just say I'm sloppy, okay?

659
00:34:39,378 --> 00:34:39,898
But...

660
00:34:42,178 --> 00:34:43,338
There are other things.

661
00:34:43,338 --> 00:34:44,578
Like, you don't eat spicy food,

662
00:34:44,578 --> 00:34:46,098
and I can't live without it, right?

663
00:34:46,218 --> 00:34:47,858
It's not appropriate.

664
00:34:48,098 --> 00:34:48,858
Isn't it?

665
00:34:49,938 --> 00:34:51,938
What are these problems, Miss An?

666
00:34:52,098 --> 00:34:54,698
As you live next door to me now,

667
00:34:54,818 --> 00:34:56,058
I can't charge you rent.

668
00:34:56,298 --> 00:34:57,458
But if I don't charge you rent,

669
00:34:57,938 --> 00:34:59,338
you feel guilty.

670
00:34:59,578 --> 00:35:01,458
Why do you know I feel guilty?

671
00:35:03,098 --> 00:35:04,338
For resource integration,

672
00:35:04,338 --> 00:35:05,618
energy saving and cost reduction,

673
00:35:06,898 --> 00:35:07,818
great to work with you.

674
00:35:12,138 --> 00:35:13,138
Great to work with you.

675
00:35:13,138 --> 00:35:15,658
But I need to
set some ground rules with you.

676
00:35:15,978 --> 00:35:16,898
Okay, okay.

677
00:35:16,898 --> 00:35:18,178
I get it, my lady.

678
00:35:18,178 --> 00:35:19,338
Go out and rest.

679
00:35:19,418 --> 00:35:20,378
Leave this to me.

680
00:36:05,138 --> 00:36:06,178
Dear,

681
00:36:07,898 --> 00:36:08,698
are you busy?

682
00:36:12,898 --> 00:36:13,458
Yes.

683
00:36:28,578 --> 00:36:31,378
Your detergent smells so good.

684
00:36:35,418 --> 00:36:36,698
Can I share the link?

685
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:42,218
What are you going to trade for it?

686
00:36:53,698 --> 00:36:54,778
