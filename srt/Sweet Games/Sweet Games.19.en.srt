24

You ask so many questions.

25
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:51,850
Well,

26
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:53,330
can I pursue you?

27
00:01:59,050 --> 00:01:59,770
No.

28
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,130
Why?

29
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,690
If you have a girlfriend,

30
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,410
why are you here alone?

31
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:08,970
Moreover,

32
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,690
if you've broken up,

33
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,330
why can't I pursue you?

34
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:14,890
No reason.

35
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,530
I said no.

36
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,850
So, you're not done with her?

37
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:22,570
Of course not.

38
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:31,770
Dude, you finally woke up.

39
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:32,730
Hold on.

40
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,250
So, you're saying

41
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,570
you two have broken up,

42
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,610
but in your heart,

43
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,290
she is still your girlfriend?

44
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:48,730
Yes.

45
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,010
If you love her so much,

46
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,010
what are you doing here?

47
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:59,250
Are you sure you're okay?

I'm fine.

Thank you.

00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:10,850
You may leave.

(can give everyone a demonstration.)

(right?)

(Yes.)

65
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:45,450
Give me the remote.

66
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,970
I didn't say anything.

67
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:48,370
Come on.

68
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:51,570
Give it to me.

69
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:53,730
Here.

70
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:54,290
Give it to me.

71
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,330
Snatch it if you can.

72
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:42,370
(An Ran, can we talk face to face?)

73
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:46,770
(Don't worry.)

00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:48,050
(About work.)

75
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,010
(I'll decide the place.)

00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,730
We are partners now.

77
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:06,850
Why can't we find

78
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,170
a better place to eat?

79
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,170
What would you like to eat?

80
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:16,570
I'm not hungry.

81
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:18,290
Sir.

82
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,450
Stir-fried noodles

83
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,330
and five skewers.

84
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:25,970
Alright, anything else?

85
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:27,450
Two bottles of Coke.

86
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,450
Okay, wait a moment.

87
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:34,330
So,

88
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,850
what's the matter?

89
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,970
I heard
you're surveying the acquisitions

90
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,050
of Gaishi Group over the last decade.

91
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:47,050
I must find out
who is behind it all, right?

92
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:48,930
Do you have to

93
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,490
make things this complicated?

94
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,650
I'm solving problems.

95
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,610
In fact, the best solution now is

96
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,730
to cooperate with a big company.

97
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:01,170
Buying its servers
is the most direct solution.

98
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,370
If you keep doing this,

99
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,730
things will get bigger.

100
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:07,730
Don't you want to come back?

101
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:10,610
Cooperating with a big company

102
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,610
means giving up Fragment Time Boyfriend.

103
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,850
An Ran, you should be very clear.

104
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,050
It's not the first time hacker attacks

105
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,730
in this industry have happened.

106
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:25,290
With your current strength,
you're insignificant.

107
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,050
It's hard to deal with it.

108
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,290
How about this?

109
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:30,610
You leave it to me.

110
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:31,490
Wait.

111
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,050
Can you give me some more time?

112
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,050
Yes, I can.

113
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,810
That's why I asked you out.

114
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:37,490
You should know

115
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,290
if you continue like this,

116
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,170
the head office will lose patience.

117
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,050
I'm giving you some advice

118
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,610
as a friend.

119
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,410
I've heard about Heisha and you.

120
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:56,370
Wait a minute.

121
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,610
No private matters today.

122
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,170
Here you go.

123
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,410
Thank you.

124
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:07,890
Come on.

125
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:09,410
I can open mine.

126
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:22,970
Actually,

127
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,810
we are very close to the truth.

128
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,290
If we find the person behind this,

129
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,290
it will be beneficial for me,

130
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:32,810
this industry,

131
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:36,050
and even Lansheng.

132
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:40,490
Now it's just a temporary sacrifice
of Fragment Time Boyfriend.

133
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:44,610
I will make this sacrifice worthwhile.

134
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:52,610
Okay.

135
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:54,930
Since you've said so,

136
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:56,970
I respect your decision.

137
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,730
Actually, I just wanted to remind you.

138
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:01,530
Lansheng is running out of patience.

139
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:03,850
Whatever decision you want to make,

140
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,530
act as fast as you can.

141
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,730
I can't favor you at work.

142
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,610
In private, I can only advise you.

143
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,730
But if you need the investment company
to do anything,

144
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:19,610
just let me know. I'll find a way.

145
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,210
Mr. Pei is more like a human now.

146
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:31,410
Alright.

147
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:33,970
You take your time. I'll go.

148
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:37,290

look like?

He's quite handsome.

158
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:08,410
But it's a pity.

159
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,130
Huh?

00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:18,512

What?

166
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,170
Why aren't you taking the initiative?

167
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:35,730
Yeah, director.

168

No,

169
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:38,810
I mean

234
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:14,730
Let me introduce him to you.

Congratulations to Bluebird

242
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,530
as the Best Animated Short Film.

243
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,850
We did it.

244
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,290
Our efforts were not in vain.

245
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:50,850
I told you we could do it.

246
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:51,290
Right?

247
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:52,730
Yes, we can.

248
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,930
Let's celebrate tonight.

249
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:55,970
Of course.

250
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:56,610
Where to go?

251
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:57,170
Let's go.

252
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,530
I think

253
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,210
I should tell you.

254
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,810
Fragment Time Boyfriend was hacked.

255
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,410
To protect the players' rights,

256
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:06,610
An Ran stood up to Lansheng
and got suspended.

257
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:14,930
Bluebird was nominated
in an animation competition,

258
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,570
for outstanding work.

259
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,930
It caused widespread discussion
in the school.

260
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,930
As the director and producer,

261
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:23,450
do you have any thoughts

262
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:24,610
to share with the students?

263
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,930
There are no shortcuts in animation.

264
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,170
Just work hard.

265
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,850
Actually, I noticed

266
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,530
you only used one voice actor,

267
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,330
but there are eight characters
in the work.

268
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:35,690
Yes.

269
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:37,050
So, I'm very curious

270
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,450
who is this mysterious voice actor?

271
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:40,930
No comment.

272
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:43,090
But, you can ask me

273
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:44,610
what type of boy I like.

274
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:46,410
I'd be happy to tell you.

275
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:59,312
(Flight ticket purchasing platform)

276
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:15,330
Hello?

277
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:17,090
Hey, Yan Yue, where are you?

278
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,570
Bluebird got a nomination.
Let's celebrate tonight.

279
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:21,170
Congratulations.

280
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:22,930
Why is it so noisy?

281
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:23,570
Where are you?

282
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:25,410
I'm leaving.

283
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:27,330
Where are you going?

284
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:29,930
I'm going back to do a big thing.

285
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:33,050
Hello?

286
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:59,450
(From Jiang Shan's gossip group)
(Is this short film voiced by Heisha?)

287
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:01,090
(We all think it's his voice.)

288
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:07,090
(Is Miss Jasmine still living in the town?)

289
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:10,530
(I was entrusted by someone
from the other side of the sea)

290
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:13,930
(to give her something called longing.)

291
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:18,330
(If the wish I owe you is not fulfilled,)

292
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:21,330
I will always be by your side.

293
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:24,170
I'm at your service.

294
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:25,610
But,

295
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,410
you'd better think
about what wish to make.

296
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:30,970
(Don't waste the rare opportunity.)

Who let you come back?

300
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:14,410
Can you leave or return
whenever you want?

301
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,690
I sent you off when you left,

302
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:17,690
and I have to pick you up now.

303
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,930
You owe me a big favor.

304
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,690

305
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:23,330
Please.

306
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,810
When did you ever think about work?

307
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:26,570
When did you ever think about my studio?

308
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:28,330
You came back for An Ran, didn't you?

309
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:30,930
Do you expect I come back for you?

310
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:37,410
I can't believe this.

(Do you like Heisha or the prince?)

316
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:24,208
(I prefer the knight Heisha...)

317
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:38,410
(Excuse me. Can I ask)

318
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:40,450
where is the book Disaster Star Lovers?

319
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:42,410
You can check that shelf over there.

320
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:43,930
Okay, thank you.

321
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:58,330
Excuse me?

322
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:02,330
Excuse me?

(Do you prefer Heisha or the prince?)

(Can the princess
and Heisha be together?)

(I believe)

352

and Heisha will be together.)

(But she worked hard)

455
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:58,890
