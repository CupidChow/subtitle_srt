Time to eat.
Tian Xin, help me divide it.

41
00:03:11,563 --> 00:03:12,843
- Okay.
- Thank you.

42
00:03:13,403 --> 00:03:15,163
Come on, time to eat.

43
00:03:15,843 --> 00:03:19,003
- Chairman.
- Two thousand and twenty. Keep going.

44
00:03:37,683 --> 00:03:40,763
Alright, the beta version
is officially online.

45
00:03:42,043 --> 00:03:44,323
Next we just need to wait
for the favorable rates now.

46
00:03:52,603 --> 00:03:55,243
So what should we eat tonight?

47
00:03:56,243 --> 00:03:58,043
Didn't we just eat?

48
00:03:58,603 --> 00:04:00,043
Let's have one more.

49
00:04:00,443 --> 00:04:03,403
Otherwise I'm afraid
we won't make it through the night.

50
00:04:06,883 --> 00:04:09,163
I'm going home to draw, okay?

51
00:04:10,163 --> 00:04:11,443
If you have any news for me,

52
00:04:11,763 --> 00:04:13,163
call me. Call me.

53
00:04:14,403 --> 00:04:17,523
- Mengyao.
- She's like this when she's nervous.

54
00:04:23,043 --> 00:04:25,123
Well... two bosses.

55
00:04:25,403 --> 00:04:27,683
- Since you both are watching me...
- We're not looking at you.

56
00:04:28,323 --> 00:04:29,323
Fine then.

57
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:33,683
S-S-Should I close this page?

58
00:04:33,683 --> 00:04:35,123
Because the result might not come out

59
00:04:35,123 --> 00:04:37,243
until the beta testing completes.

60
00:04:37,603 --> 00:04:39,323
- Close it.
- Don't.

61
00:04:40,963 --> 00:04:45,963
T-T-Then I'll leave for you two
to keep an eye on it.

62
00:05:01,243 --> 00:05:02,403
Don't be nervous.

63
00:05:02,523 --> 00:05:03,963
What's there to look at?

64
00:05:04,483 --> 00:05:05,883
I'm not nervous.

65
00:05:05,883 --> 00:05:07,243
Everyone, don't be nervous.

66
00:05:07,563 --> 00:05:10,563
It might not finish soon.
You can just do what you need to do.

67
00:05:10,563 --> 00:05:11,963
Look, you've rubbed it too much.

68
00:05:12,763 --> 00:05:13,603
Don't be nervous.

69
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,923
What should we eat? What's this?

70
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:28,563
(Our beta version is officially online.)

71
00:05:42,923 --> 00:05:45,723
(Once the beta testing is over
and I successfully get the investment,)

72
00:05:45,923 --> 00:05:48,243
(I'll change the rent from
one deposit with three payments)

73
00:05:48,243 --> 00:05:50,283
(to one deposit with one-year payment.)

74
00:06:05,725 --> 00:06:08,243
(An Ran)

75
00:06:16,403 --> 00:06:19,923
How're things between
that friend of yours

76
00:06:19,923 --> 00:06:21,243
and his goddess?

77
00:06:23,723 --> 00:06:24,963
I want to confess my feelings.

78
00:06:28,883 --> 00:06:30,083
Bro, are you serious?

79
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:35,923
Y-Y-You don't need to
keep watching how things go,

80
00:06:36,243 --> 00:06:40,523
or play cat and mouse with her,
or make sure that she's into you?

81
00:06:40,603 --> 00:06:42,683
Put away your greasy thoughts.

82
00:06:43,563 --> 00:06:46,803
Besides, it's not like I have only
had feeling for her for a day or two.

83
00:06:47,763 --> 00:06:50,963
Bro, having feeling and being together
are two different things, okay?

84
00:06:51,243 --> 00:06:52,203
Didn't you say

85
00:06:52,363 --> 00:06:54,963
that she's very different
from that person in your memory?

86
00:06:59,803 --> 00:07:00,803
It is different.

87
00:07:02,483 --> 00:07:04,083
When I first met her,

88
00:07:04,443 --> 00:07:05,523
I was very curious

89
00:07:06,243 --> 00:07:07,363
that how she changed so much.

90
00:07:08,883 --> 00:07:12,923
Slowly, I also found the new her
very attractive.

91
00:07:14,243 --> 00:07:17,283
Later on, she said
that she didn't want to date anyone.

92
00:07:17,923 --> 00:07:21,083
So I thought
that I shouldn't bother her anymore.

93
00:07:21,923 --> 00:07:24,923
But recently,
I learned a lot about her past.

94
00:07:25,643 --> 00:07:28,043
It turned out that she's had
a very tough time over the years.

95
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:33,043
That's why I can't be indifferent
to her anymore.

96
00:07:34,283 --> 00:07:35,323
I want to protect her.

97
00:07:37,443 --> 00:07:41,203
Even if she rejects me,
I still want to tell her.

98
00:07:43,523 --> 00:07:44,403
What do you think?

99
00:07:46,323 --> 00:07:50,963
I... Since you've thought it through,

100
00:07:51,843 --> 00:07:54,763
I'll just wait for the good news.

101
00:07:55,163 --> 00:07:57,563
How do you plan to confess to her then?

102
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,963
Do you want me to give you some tips?

103
00:08:00,363 --> 00:08:01,243
Just eat your food.

104
00:08:23,563 --> 00:08:26,363
- An Ran, you...
- You...

105
00:08:29,803 --> 00:08:30,803
- You go first.
- You go first.

106
00:08:32,883 --> 00:08:33,883
Then I'll go first.

107
00:08:35,043 --> 00:08:37,643
We haven't seen each other for days.

108
00:08:39,283 --> 00:08:41,803
So, how's your beta testing going?

109
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:45,763
The results will be out in two days.
How about you?

110
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,243
What have you been doing these days?

111
00:08:49,723 --> 00:08:52,243
Before confessing,
you need to develop the story

112
00:08:52,443 --> 00:08:53,483
with sweet talk and stuff like that.

113
00:08:53,603 --> 00:08:54,963
No girl dislikes that.

114
00:08:55,723 --> 00:08:56,443
Waiting for your orders.

115
00:09:00,243 --> 00:09:01,643
You never asked me to help recording

116
00:09:01,843 --> 00:09:03,363
or to fix pipes.

117
00:09:04,123 --> 00:09:05,203
There's nothing for me to do.

118
00:09:14,883 --> 00:09:17,083
- What?
- You should come back now.

119
00:09:17,203 --> 00:09:19,323
They're in a hurry
to release a new episode tonight.

120
00:09:19,323 --> 00:09:20,363
Come back to record it.

121
00:09:20,923 --> 00:09:22,763
I don't want to go. I'm tired.

122
00:09:28,363 --> 00:09:29,883
Don't be capricious.

123
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,443
Go help Nan.

124
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:36,283
It's too late. I don't want to go.

125
00:09:36,803 --> 00:09:39,603
Nan has no choice. You should go.

126
00:09:42,363 --> 00:09:46,123
What about you?
Is there anything you need my help with?

127
00:09:48,363 --> 00:09:51,083
I can prioritize your work.

128
00:09:53,043 --> 00:09:55,643
(How can you be so slick
at such a young age?)

129
00:10:00,923 --> 00:10:01,923
Hurry up and go.

130
00:10:04,243 --> 00:10:05,803
Then I... am leaving.

131
00:11:31,763 --> 00:11:34,003
(An Ran, are you busy today?)

132
00:11:38,243 --> 00:11:40,043
(The beta testing is about to be done.)

133
00:11:40,043 --> 00:11:42,003
(It's fine today. What's up, landlord?)

134
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:44,923
(Come for dinner after work.)

135
00:11:52,323 --> 00:11:54,683
An Ran, this is for you.

136
00:12:07,403 --> 00:12:08,363
Is it too formal?

137
00:12:47,003 --> 00:12:51,043
Hello, why are you suddenly
inviting me for dinner today?

138
00:12:51,443 --> 00:12:52,683
You seem to work too hard recently.

139
00:12:58,723 --> 00:12:59,923
Yan Yue,

140
00:13:00,923 --> 00:13:02,243
why are you so nice?

141
00:13:02,883 --> 00:13:04,163
I just made some casual preparation.

142
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,803
This is so impressive.

143
00:13:07,763 --> 00:13:09,003
I don't know if you like the taste.

144
00:13:09,283 --> 00:13:11,363
Can't believe you know
how to cook Western food.

145
00:13:12,403 --> 00:13:14,043
I'll start eating.

146
00:13:20,563 --> 00:13:23,963
- Is it good?
- So good.

147
00:13:25,683 --> 00:13:27,243
You're even wearing a suit.

148
00:13:28,563 --> 00:13:30,043
I just put on something casually.

149
00:13:30,923 --> 00:13:34,163
- You look good in a suit.
- Not bad.

150
00:13:41,203 --> 00:13:43,243
An Ran, are you very busy now?

151
00:13:43,243 --> 00:13:44,483
You can say it. I am listening.

152
00:13:46,003 --> 00:13:48,003
Try this shrimp. It's very fresh.

153
00:13:49,683 --> 00:13:50,803
Thank you. Thank you.

154
00:14:00,203 --> 00:14:03,683
- An Ran.
- Yan Yue, the favorable rates are coming out.

155
00:14:15,283 --> 00:14:16,603
Eighty-two percent.

156
00:14:16,883 --> 00:14:18,923
Yan Yue, eighty- two percent.

157
00:14:19,923 --> 00:14:20,923
Give me five.

158
00:14:22,523 --> 00:14:23,923
I'm so happy.

159
00:14:27,243 --> 00:14:28,003
An Ran,

160
00:14:30,923 --> 00:14:33,723
I-I-I want to...

161
00:14:36,123 --> 00:14:37,443
It's okay.
You can pick up the call first.

162
00:14:42,443 --> 00:14:43,723
- Hello.
- An Ran.

163
00:14:44,163 --> 00:14:46,363
- Can you come to Lansheng now?
- What happened?

164
00:14:47,163 --> 00:14:48,883
I think there's a problem
with your beta testing.

165
00:14:49,323 --> 00:14:50,483
Can you come over and talk about it?

166
00:14:55,643 --> 00:14:57,243
- Yan Yue.
- An Ran.

167
00:14:57,603 --> 00:14:58,803
I need to go to Lansheng now.

168
00:15:01,563 --> 00:15:02,723
Then you should go.

169
00:15:03,643 --> 00:15:05,163
- You...
- It's okay.

170
00:15:05,243 --> 00:15:06,483
We can eat together next time.

171
00:15:07,243 --> 00:15:08,563
I'm so sorry.

172
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,363
It's really delicious.

173
00:15:13,043 --> 00:15:14,123
Be safe.

174
00:15:26,683 --> 00:15:29,923
An Ran, I know
you guys worked very hard,

175
00:15:30,683 --> 00:15:31,843
but unfortunately,

176
00:15:32,003 --> 00:15:33,483
the results of your beta testing

177
00:15:33,803 --> 00:15:35,363
did not meet
the investment requirements.

178
00:15:37,443 --> 00:15:38,683
Didn't our favorable rate

179
00:15:38,683 --> 00:15:40,603
already exceed eighty percent?

180
00:15:41,683 --> 00:15:43,163
It did exceed eighty percent,

181
00:15:43,763 --> 00:15:45,283
but the number of participants
is not enough.

182
00:15:45,803 --> 00:15:48,363
You didn't even reach the minimum
number based on our standards.

183
00:15:48,363 --> 00:15:50,043
The board is now very skeptical

184
00:15:50,403 --> 00:15:53,043
of whether Gaishi Unparalleled has
the ability to operate independently.

185
00:15:54,563 --> 00:15:56,163
Number of participants.

186
00:16:04,203 --> 00:16:05,203
So this is the case.

187
00:16:06,283 --> 00:16:09,003
Nowadays players have increasingly
high demands for games.

188
00:16:09,403 --> 00:16:11,043
So Lansheng has more strict standards

189
00:16:11,043 --> 00:16:12,443
and requirements for new companies,

190
00:16:12,643 --> 00:16:14,163
when it comes to collaboration.

191
00:16:14,643 --> 00:16:15,483
Taking into consideration

192
00:16:15,483 --> 00:16:16,803
that not every single
game development team

193
00:16:16,803 --> 00:16:18,483
can meet the standard at once,

194
00:16:18,723 --> 00:16:20,043
I've already fought for

195
00:16:20,043 --> 00:16:21,443
a second beta testing opportunity
for you.

196
00:16:21,923 --> 00:16:25,003
If the second beta testing
still can't meet the standard,

197
00:16:25,483 --> 00:16:26,683
then I'm afraid

198
00:16:27,163 --> 00:16:30,803
that Lansheng will have to
pause this collaboration project.

199
00:16:32,843 --> 00:16:35,123
An Ran, let me remind you

200
00:16:35,603 --> 00:16:38,483
that dubbing in these kinds of games
is very important.

201
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,683
I am afraid that having only one Heisha

202
00:16:41,363 --> 00:16:43,123
is far from enough.

203
00:16:45,683 --> 00:16:47,963
Even a voice actor
with a million fans is not enough?

204
00:16:49,043 --> 00:16:50,803
Don't overestimate
the level of popularity,

205
00:16:51,323 --> 00:16:54,683
as there are many voice actors
with quite a lot of fans.

206
00:16:55,203 --> 00:16:56,083
But you should know

207
00:16:56,483 --> 00:16:58,603
that your game is not just targeting

208
00:16:58,603 --> 00:17:00,243
at those one million fans.

209
00:17:01,923 --> 00:17:04,243
Then who do you think would be capable?

210
00:17:09,923 --> 00:17:11,803
I think Zhou Qing is very good,

211
00:17:12,363 --> 00:17:13,443
who is highly known to the public.

212
00:17:13,443 --> 00:17:15,283
Only such veteran voice actor

213
00:17:15,283 --> 00:17:16,643
can attract more people.

214
00:17:17,883 --> 00:17:20,123
Alright, I see.

215
00:17:30,136 --> 00:17:33,179

219
00:18:11,283 --> 00:18:12,323
Just happened to pass by.

220
00:18:15,123 --> 00:18:17,243
How was your meeting? Did it go well?

221
00:18:20,203 --> 00:18:21,163
It failed.

222
00:18:21,603 --> 00:18:22,883
Didn't the favorable rate
meet the standard?

223
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,483
They said there weren't enough
participants during our beta testing

224
00:18:25,683 --> 00:18:26,723
so that we need to test again.

225
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,563
Don't worry. I'll find a way.

226
00:18:33,683 --> 00:18:35,203
There won't be any other problems

227
00:18:35,563 --> 00:18:36,763
after it's resolved, right?

228
00:18:38,323 --> 00:18:39,803
The rest does not matter that much.

229
00:18:42,243 --> 00:18:44,123
Okay, let's work hard together.

230
00:18:46,483 --> 00:18:47,963
I need to go back to the company first.

231
00:18:48,283 --> 00:18:49,123
Let me drop you off.

Then I'll go back to the company first.

238
00:19:28,883 --> 00:19:29,483
Go ahead.

239
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:44,123
Bye.

240
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:23,323
Well, in addition to favorable rate,

241
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:24,603
there's also the number of participants.

242
00:20:24,763 --> 00:20:25,683
Why didn't they say it earlier?

243
00:20:25,883 --> 00:20:27,563
They are making things difficult
for us on purpose.

244
00:20:28,963 --> 00:20:30,563
I didn't know he was like this
when we were in college.

245
00:20:31,443 --> 00:20:33,003
It's not unexpected.

246
00:20:34,283 --> 00:20:35,443
Mind your position.

247
00:20:40,563 --> 00:20:41,483
Miss An,

248
00:20:42,363 --> 00:20:44,563
what should we do now?

249
00:20:46,123 --> 00:20:48,843
I know that everyone
is upset about it now,

250
00:20:49,363 --> 00:20:50,563
but during all this time,

251
00:20:50,563 --> 00:20:52,883
haven't we overcome
many difficulties already?

252
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,323
What we need is

253
00:20:55,323 --> 00:20:57,163
to complete our own part well.

254
00:20:58,003 --> 00:20:59,203
You two should think about

255
00:20:59,203 --> 00:21:01,963
how to promote through live streaming.

256
00:21:02,283 --> 00:21:03,563
We can also find some

257
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:04,963
suitable gaming forums,

258
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:07,323
and ask people to
post some promotion posts,

259
00:21:07,323 --> 00:21:08,563
as well as give out some free gifts.

260
00:21:08,963 --> 00:21:11,123
In one word, we need to think of
more ways to increase traffic.

261
00:21:11,723 --> 00:21:12,963
Okay, no problem.

262
00:21:13,043 --> 00:21:15,803
In addition,
since we have obtained more time,

263
00:21:15,963 --> 00:21:19,523
Changfeng, Peng,
you can use the time to update

264
00:21:19,523 --> 00:21:20,923
our backend and pages

265
00:21:20,923 --> 00:21:24,323
and make our game smoother
during the next test,

266
00:21:24,923 --> 00:21:27,123
to enhance players' experience.

267
00:21:27,923 --> 00:21:29,003
Okay, understood.

268
00:21:30,363 --> 00:21:31,483
Thank you everyone for your hard work.

269
00:21:39,603 --> 00:21:41,443
What do you want to eat tonight?
My treat.

270
00:21:41,763 --> 00:21:44,123
Seafood! Seafood will not make you fat.

271
00:21:44,123 --> 00:21:45,603
- What else?
- Seafood sounds good.

272
00:21:45,803 --> 00:21:47,083
Go ahead and order, hurry up.

273
00:21:53,883 --> 00:21:57,043
Yeah. You can just mention it
briefly during the live streaming

274
00:21:57,563 --> 00:21:58,803
that our new game,

275
00:21:58,803 --> 00:22:00,083
Fragment Time Boyfriend

276
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:01,603
is fantastic.

277
00:22:01,723 --> 00:22:03,363
We've researched

278
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:04,723
the market situation and its future.

279
00:22:06,763 --> 00:22:07,923
Thank you. It is working now.

280
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:10,403
I just need a little time.

281
00:22:10,683 --> 00:22:13,163
Ten minutes from Zhou Qing
would be enough.

282
00:22:13,683 --> 00:22:15,923
Yes, every role in our project

283
00:22:15,923 --> 00:22:17,283
is very unique.

284
00:22:17,723 --> 00:22:20,003
Sorry, Zhou Qing has been
a bit busy recently

285
00:22:20,163 --> 00:22:21,283
and the time cannot match the schedule.

286
00:22:21,563 --> 00:22:22,483
Hello, I...

287
00:22:36,803 --> 00:22:37,483
Wake up.

288
00:22:43,163 --> 00:22:43,723
Wake up.

289
00:22:59,163 --> 00:23:00,643
- Mr. Heisha.
- Yingjun.

290
00:23:01,363 --> 00:23:02,643
Changfeng, come and take something.

291
00:23:03,283 --> 00:23:05,163
Mr. Heisha is here.
Thank you, Mr. Heisha.

292
00:23:05,723 --> 00:23:06,763
Please distribute to everyone.

293
00:23:08,243 --> 00:23:10,163
Mr. Heisha is treating
everyone with coffee.

294
00:23:12,163 --> 00:23:13,163
Thank you.

295
00:23:13,723 --> 00:23:15,523
How is the preparation
for the second round testing?

296
00:23:17,243 --> 00:23:18,923
Turned out you're not popular enough,

297
00:23:19,283 --> 00:23:20,643
so that the investor
insists on bringing in

298
00:23:20,643 --> 00:23:22,403
a few more famous voice actors.

299
00:23:23,683 --> 00:23:25,283
She is almost collapsing.

300
00:23:28,643 --> 00:23:29,883
No, no, no. Sorry.

301
00:23:30,003 --> 00:23:32,603
We just want to cooperate with you.

302
00:23:32,643 --> 00:23:34,003
Who are you planning to invite then?

303
00:23:34,963 --> 00:23:38,123
Zhou... Green? Zhou Yellow?

304
00:23:38,123 --> 00:23:39,003
Zhou Qing?
[*Qing means cyan in Chinese]

305
00:23:39,123 --> 00:23:40,163
Yes! Zhou Qing.

306
00:23:41,763 --> 00:23:43,963
Bro, I think you're
much better than him,

307
00:23:44,283 --> 00:23:45,283
but you're just too low-key.

308
00:23:45,483 --> 00:23:47,243
If you had shown your handsome face

309
00:23:47,243 --> 00:23:49,003
to the public earlier,

310
00:23:49,883 --> 00:23:51,683
you would have been
a top-tier voice actor by now.

311
00:23:51,683 --> 00:23:53,363
And we need to worry nothing about
Zhou Qing or others.

312
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:56,843
- Mr. Hu, would you like a drink?
- You go first.

313
00:24:16,443 --> 00:24:18,003
So, there will not be any other problems

314
00:24:18,163 --> 00:24:19,403
after it is resolved, right?

315
00:24:21,123 --> 00:24:22,643
The rest does not matter that much.

316
00:25:10,803 --> 00:25:12,243
Thank you for dropping me off today.

317
00:25:12,923 --> 00:25:14,163
Rest early.

318
00:25:17,123 --> 00:25:21,883
An Ran, don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

319
00:25:25,483 --> 00:25:27,163
- Good night.
- Good night.

320
00:25:45,656 --> 00:25:49,599
(Zhou Qing Studio)

321
00:25:51,603 --> 00:25:53,123
Look at you.

322
00:25:53,283 --> 00:25:56,523
You don't come to visit me often.

323
00:25:57,123 --> 00:25:59,643
Come on, try this tea I brought back
from Yunnan last month.

324
00:25:59,643 --> 00:26:01,723
It's very fragrant, here.

325
00:26:06,403 --> 00:26:07,483
How does it taste? Is it good?

326
00:26:09,483 --> 00:26:11,523
If you had come to our studio back then,

327
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:15,403
- wouldn't we have tea every day?
- Yes.

328
00:26:16,723 --> 00:26:19,003
By the way,
I've told Jiang Shan many times

329
00:26:19,283 --> 00:26:20,203
to invite you to participate in

330
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:21,803
the second season of We Who Love Voices.

331
00:26:22,523 --> 00:26:25,483
Any thoughts?
Still not willing to show your face?

332
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:34,003
Mr. Zhou, actually, I came today

333
00:26:35,123 --> 00:26:36,763
because there's something
I need your help with.

334
00:26:37,843 --> 00:26:39,283
Hi everyone, as you can see,

335
00:26:39,283 --> 00:26:40,723
this game is called

336
00:26:40,723 --> 00:26:42,003
"Fragment Time Boyfriend".

337
00:26:42,003 --> 00:26:43,923
The task I am currently doing

338
00:26:43,923 --> 00:26:45,523
is Gu Chengzhou's side quest.

339
00:26:45,523 --> 00:26:47,763
Personally, I think its interactivity
and gaming experience

340
00:26:47,763 --> 00:26:49,003
are very good.

341
00:26:49,243 --> 00:26:50,363
Those who are interested,

342
00:26:50,363 --> 00:26:51,883
can click the tap of the link
in the upper right corner

343
00:26:51,883 --> 00:26:53,003
to download.

344
00:26:53,283 --> 00:26:55,283
Let's look at the download page.

345
00:26:55,283 --> 00:26:57,083
Once you enter this game page,

346
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:59,043
you can see
that the art design of our game

347
00:26:59,043 --> 00:27:02,083
is really very good,

348
00:27:02,283 --> 00:27:04,523
and it feels very realistic.

349
00:27:04,563 --> 00:27:06,603
It feels like you're really in love.

350
00:27:06,603 --> 00:27:09,283
This is the most popular
female host you found?

351
00:27:09,883 --> 00:27:12,403
Why isn't the number
of online viewers increasing?

352
00:27:13,843 --> 00:27:16,763
And its interactivity
and gaming experience are really strong.

353
00:27:16,763 --> 00:27:18,283
- This light is so bright.
- I would recommend it to you.

354
00:27:18,283 --> 00:27:20,123
- Go download it.
- It consumes power.

355
00:27:20,123 --> 00:27:21,843
Sisters, what are you waiting for?

356
00:27:21,923 --> 00:27:23,083
Hurry up and go!

357
00:27:28,083 --> 00:27:28,723
Miss An.

358
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:40,563
You can download our game first
and take a look.

359
00:27:40,563 --> 00:27:42,363
Our current game

360
00:27:42,363 --> 00:27:43,843
"Fragment Time Boyfriend"...

361
00:27:44,203 --> 00:27:45,403
I'll do it. You can take a break.

362
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:46,923
Okay.

363
00:27:56,963 --> 00:27:58,163
Are you there, baby?

364
00:28:02,003 --> 00:28:04,603
Have you played
"Fragment Time Boyfriend" today?

365
00:28:06,403 --> 00:28:12,203
Do you prefer Gu Chengzhou or me?

366
00:28:16,683 --> 00:28:18,563
Twenty-five hours a day.

367
00:28:19,843 --> 00:28:21,643
- Five hundred people now.
- An extra hour for love.

368
00:28:21,643 --> 00:28:22,803
How can it rise so fast?

369
00:28:22,803 --> 00:28:23,803
It's going up.

370
00:28:24,963 --> 00:28:26,403
Isn't such a life

371
00:28:27,603 --> 00:28:29,083
good?

372
00:28:31,123 --> 00:28:32,203
Today it's me.

373
00:28:33,363 --> 00:28:38,483
Perhaps tomorrow,
it will be Gu Chengzhou.

374
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:41,523
If you haven't played
our "Fragment Time Boyfriend"...

375
00:28:42,483 --> 00:28:43,563
It does have some effect.

376
00:28:45,083 --> 00:28:45,923
Either

377
00:28:47,243 --> 00:28:48,563
you are in love,

378
00:28:48,563 --> 00:28:49,523
or

379
00:28:49,523 --> 00:28:51,523
- It finally increased.
- you don't understand love yet.

380
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:52,803
Can't believe this is working.

381
00:28:53,803 --> 00:28:55,163
Whether you're in love

382
00:28:55,163 --> 00:28:56,403
or don't know how to,

383
00:28:57,243 --> 00:28:58,963
- our "Fragment Time Boyfriend"...
- Miss An.

384
00:28:58,963 --> 00:28:59,803
Should we send a gift?

385
00:29:00,043 --> 00:29:02,323
- Yes, yes. Send a...
- Someone has already sent a gift?

386
00:29:02,723 --> 00:29:04,083
So, what are you waiting for?

387
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,043
- Two thousand and five now.
- You can always find...

388
00:29:07,043 --> 00:29:09,123
Mr. Hu is quite impressive.

389
00:29:11,003 --> 00:29:12,883
If you haven't found him,

390
00:29:13,243 --> 00:29:15,403
then quickly download

391
00:29:15,403 --> 00:29:16,603
"Fragment Time Boyfriend".

392
00:29:17,043 --> 00:29:20,283
Let Gu Chengzhou or me

393
00:29:21,123 --> 00:29:23,283
spend such a night with you.

394
00:29:24,043 --> 00:29:24,923
Our "Fragment Time Boyfriend"...

395
00:29:24,923 --> 00:29:25,963
Alright, I'm going home first.

396
00:29:25,963 --> 00:29:27,923
- Too sleepy.
- Okay.

397
00:29:28,843 --> 00:29:30,843
- Be careful on the way.
- Okay.

398
00:29:31,043 --> 00:29:32,323
Do you want me

399
00:29:32,963 --> 00:29:35,403
to give you a hug like Gu Chengzhou?

400
00:29:36,243 --> 00:29:37,843
So, what are you waiting for?

401
00:29:38,523 --> 00:29:40,003

402
00:29:40,003 --> 00:29:41,003

Great news.

444
00:33:16,323 --> 00:33:18,323
This morning, about eight voice actors

445
00:33:18,323 --> 00:33:19,723
all posted on social media,

446
00:33:19,723 --> 00:33:21,643
promoting "Fragment Time Boyfriend".

447
00:33:21,643 --> 00:33:24,403
Look, fans on our official account
have risen by tens of thousands.

448
00:33:24,643 --> 00:33:27,643
- Have they gone mad?
- That's not even the best part.

449
00:33:27,643 --> 00:33:30,043
I saw the most recent post of Zhou Qing,

450
00:33:30,523 --> 00:33:32,763
stating that if people
all support our game,

451
00:33:32,763 --> 00:33:34,763
he'll join our dubbing team instantly.

452
00:33:35,283 --> 00:33:36,283
I can't believe it.

453
00:33:36,283 --> 00:33:38,363
Didn't Zhou Qing reject our calls?

454
00:33:38,603 --> 00:33:40,003
His account must've been hacked.

455
00:33:41,003 --> 00:33:42,723
Come on, Miss An.
How did you get Zhou Qing?

456
00:33:48,883 --> 00:33:49,883
Yingjun,

457
00:33:51,603 --> 00:33:52,483
thank you for your hard work.

458
00:33:53,123 --> 00:33:54,283
How much money did you spend on this?

459
00:33:54,283 --> 00:33:55,563
Did you spend all your savings?

460
00:33:57,123 --> 00:34:00,763
It wasn't me.
How can I have that much money?

461
00:34:01,763 --> 00:34:04,403
I even have to steal snacks
from Tian Xin. Try some.

462
00:34:08,163 --> 00:34:09,083
Give it back to me.

463
00:34:09,323 --> 00:34:10,523
If Zhou Qing joins our promotion

464
00:34:10,523 --> 00:34:12,003
for Fragment Time Boyfriend,

465
00:34:12,243 --> 00:34:14,163
we will completely
go viral online, right?

466
00:34:14,603 --> 00:34:15,403
What are you talking about?

467
00:34:15,403 --> 00:34:18,243
Zhou Qing is nothing
compared to our Mr. Heisha.

468
00:34:18,243 --> 00:34:19,483
I don't care if he's Heisha or what,

469
00:34:19,803 --> 00:34:22,083
- as long as he can promote us.
- Remember your position.

470
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:22,763
An Ran,

471
00:34:25,123 --> 00:34:27,243
don't worry. Everything will be fine.

00:34:51,643 --> 00:34:52,403
(What?)

474
00:34:56,403 --> 00:35:00,403

from those famous people and Zhou Qing?)

475
00:35:02,323 --> 00:35:03,523
(Just a piece of cake.)

476
00:35:09,163 --> 00:35:12,043
(If you want to thank me,
just clean the trash in the yard.)

477
00:35:32,243 --> 00:35:33,363
Hello, Miss Lan.

478
00:35:33,843 --> 00:35:36,563
