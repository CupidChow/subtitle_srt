24
00:01:49,554 --> 00:01:50,034
Hello, bro.

25
00:01:50,394 --> 00:01:51,554
About the press release,

26
00:01:52,234 --> 00:01:54,194
we have all the relevant filings
for today's event.

27
00:01:54,674 --> 00:01:55,754
Go and fetch the equipment.

28
00:01:56,314 --> 00:01:56,954
Right, right.

29
00:01:57,674 --> 00:01:59,554
Yan Yue, remember to
walk the stage later.

30
00:01:59,754 --> 00:02:00,194
Okay.

31
00:02:01,234 --> 00:02:02,394
How could I not trust you?

32
00:02:02,394 --> 00:02:04,674
A heavy bird poop rain
started in the sky.

33
00:02:05,194 --> 00:02:06,674
Two fleeing birds

34
00:02:06,834 --> 00:02:09,194
took shelter in a large green box.

35
00:02:10,194 --> 00:02:10,834
Oh, no.

38
00:02:15,754 --> 00:02:16,754
Have some water.

39
00:02:23,914 --> 00:02:24,674
Are you nervous?

40
00:02:26,074 --> 00:02:26,634
A little bit.

42
00:02:33,914 --> 00:02:34,594
You can do it.

43
00:02:37,354 --> 00:02:38,594
Let's go on stage together later.

44
00:02:40,634 --> 00:02:41,394
Me?

45
00:02:42,394 --> 00:02:43,194
Is that appropriate?

46
00:02:47,794 --> 00:02:49,354
I want to stand with you.

47
00:03:08,754 --> 00:03:10,194
Good afternoon, kids.

48
00:03:10,194 --> 00:03:13,074
Hello, brother.

49
00:03:13,914 --> 00:03:14,634
Hello, everyone.

50
00:03:15,034 --> 00:03:16,314
My name is Heisha

51
00:03:16,314 --> 00:03:17,914
and I'm a voice-over artist.

52
00:03:18,474 --> 00:03:19,474
Today, I'm honored

53
00:03:19,474 --> 00:03:21,074
to host such an exhibition

54
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,194
and meet all of you.

55
00:03:22,514 --> 00:03:25,954
I've always been involved in
movie-related programs.

56
00:03:26,514 --> 00:03:28,034
Any children here have heard movies?

57
00:03:28,034 --> 00:03:28,794
Raise your hands.

58
00:03:28,914 --> 00:03:31,474
I have.

59
00:03:32,594 --> 00:03:34,194
You kids are all so amazing.

60
00:03:34,794 --> 00:03:35,634
Not long ago,

61
00:03:35,634 --> 00:03:37,234
I met a little boy like you

62
00:03:37,234 --> 00:03:39,234
who loves watching cartoons.

63
00:03:39,914 --> 00:03:41,594
I told him a whole story,

64
00:03:41,594 --> 00:03:43,074
and he was very happy.

65
00:03:43,794 --> 00:03:45,754
So, today I also want to

66
00:03:45,914 --> 00:03:47,594
tell you a cartoon.

67
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:48,754
Would you like to hear it?

68
00:03:48,754 --> 00:03:50,794
Yes.

69
00:03:51,354 --> 00:03:52,914
Then today, I'll tell you a story

70
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:55,074
about a small bird fighting an eagle.

71
00:03:55,394 --> 00:03:56,194
Sounds good?

72
00:03:56,354 --> 00:03:58,314
Great.

73
00:04:02,594 --> 00:04:03,794
This exhibition will be held

74
00:04:03,794 --> 00:04:05,314
every week from now on.

75
00:04:05,314 --> 00:04:06,594
It will bring you

76
00:04:06,594 --> 00:04:08,794
a very exciting movie each week.

77
00:04:09,194 --> 00:04:10,634
I hope you

78
00:04:10,634 --> 00:04:12,474
have a fun afternoon today.

79
00:04:19,074 --> 00:04:20,834
Bird dad and bird mom,

80
00:04:20,834 --> 00:04:22,794
hand in hand, flew into the blue sky.

81
00:04:23,354 --> 00:04:25,234
(A Bird's Journey)
Flying on the cloud,

82
00:04:25,234 --> 00:04:27,314
they started to dance gracefully.

83
00:04:27,754 --> 00:04:30,474
The eagle dove down from the cloud.

84
00:04:30,954 --> 00:04:32,074
The leading bird said,

85
00:04:33,234 --> 00:04:33,834
"Oh no."

86
00:04:35,394 --> 00:04:38,754
"The eagle caught a poor little bird."

87
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:43,794
A heavy bird poop rain
started in the sky.

88
00:04:44,594 --> 00:04:47,034
Two birds, clutching their heads,
looked for cover everywhere.

89
00:04:48,034 --> 00:04:50,474
They hid in a green box.

90
00:04:51,754 --> 00:04:53,474
Kids, you should also hide quickly.

91
00:04:58,514 --> 00:04:59,634
Xiao Yi was on his way.

92
00:05:00,754 --> 00:05:03,354
He walked alone
on the path to the hill.

93
00:05:04,354 --> 00:05:06,234
He jumped onto a small stone.

94
00:05:07,194 --> 00:05:08,314
But in front of him

95
00:05:08,314 --> 00:05:11,074
was a tall and steep mountain.

96

=Episode 24=
(The Small Matter of Marriage)

97
00:07:00,234 --> 00:07:01,434
You're awake, little lazy cat.

98
00:07:12,154 --> 00:07:12,674
What's wrong?

99
00:07:16,234 --> 00:07:16,994
Had a nightmare?

100
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:20,914
It's okay.

101
00:07:22,474 --> 00:07:23,474
I'm right next to you.

102
00:07:32,154 --> 00:07:33,714
Hu Yingjun and Bai Mengyao
are almost here.

103
00:07:34,594 --> 00:07:35,594
So early?

104
00:07:37,794 --> 00:07:38,714
Hurry up and get ready.

105
00:07:43,874 --> 00:07:47,274
We've been waiting for a long time,
and you're not even ready yet.

106
00:07:48,154 --> 00:07:49,594
You haven't even changed your clothes.

107
00:07:50,154 --> 00:07:51,874
Why did you two come so early
to pick us up?

108
00:07:52,274 --> 00:07:53,914
To try on wedding dresses.

109
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:54,994
Did you forget?

110
00:07:57,474 --> 00:07:58,474
Piggy.

111
00:07:59,274 --> 00:08:01,034
How could you
forget something so important?

112
00:08:01,034 --> 00:08:02,594
Both of you are about to get married.

113
00:08:03,034 --> 00:08:05,154
We don't even know
how to prepare for the marriage.

114
00:08:05,594 --> 00:08:06,714
Have you decided on the ceremony?

115
00:08:07,714 --> 00:08:08,914
Have you found a hall?

116
00:08:10,034 --> 00:08:10,994
What about the procedure?

117
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,714
Wait, the day is around the corner.

118
00:08:14,714 --> 00:08:16,034
You don't even have a plan.

119
00:08:16,034 --> 00:08:17,154
Aren't you two in a hurry?

120
00:08:17,594 --> 00:08:18,154
Right.

121
00:08:18,274 --> 00:08:19,274
You two aren't in a hurry.

122
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,874
Your parents aren't in a hurry either.

123
00:08:22,714 --> 00:08:23,354
Right.

124
00:08:24,914 --> 00:08:25,714
They're not participating.

125
00:08:26,474 --> 00:08:27,914
They let us have free rein.

126
00:08:30,674 --> 00:08:32,874
What best parents do you have?

127
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:35,034
My parents would love to
drag everyone in Bowen

128
00:08:35,034 --> 00:08:35,994
to attend.

129
00:08:35,994 --> 00:08:37,274
Have a feast
for three days and three nights.

130
00:08:37,274 --> 00:08:38,714
They must make the news headlines.

131
00:08:39,594 --> 00:08:41,274
Sounds like you could get married.

132
00:08:53,594 --> 00:08:54,794
What's wrong with your eyes?

133
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:57,554
An Ran, what's wrong with your eyes?

134
00:08:58,234 --> 00:08:58,794
Let me see.

135
00:09:00,114 --> 00:09:00,914
Your eyes?

136
00:09:02,434 --> 00:09:03,794
Let's go, Bai Mengyao. Try on the dress.

137
00:09:05,594 --> 00:09:07,114
You should change your clothes first.

138
00:09:07,874 --> 00:09:08,594
What's wrong?

139
00:09:11,234 --> 00:09:11,914
Did she have a stroke?

140
00:09:14,674 --> 00:09:15,714
This one looks pretty good.

141
00:09:15,714 --> 00:09:16,674
Good.

142
00:09:17,034 --> 00:09:18,594
That veil looks really good.

143
00:09:18,714 --> 00:09:19,434
Yes.

144
00:09:19,714 --> 00:09:21,034
It's full of diamonds.

145
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:22,234
So shiny.

146
00:09:26,234 --> 00:09:27,594
This champagne color one
is not bad either.

147
00:09:27,594 --> 00:09:28,674
This one looks good too.

148
00:09:29,794 --> 00:09:31,474
An Ran, which one do you like?

149
00:09:33,354 --> 00:09:34,914
I can't decide.

150
00:09:37,794 --> 00:09:39,594
This one looks pretty good.

151
00:09:43,914 --> 00:09:44,354
Yan Yue.

152
00:09:45,914 --> 00:09:46,914
Do you like this one?

153
00:09:48,474 --> 00:09:49,474
I think this one looks very nice.

154
00:09:50,794 --> 00:09:51,354
Do you like it?

155
00:09:54,674 --> 00:09:56,234
Hu Yingjun, I saw one
that is particularly beautiful.

156
00:09:56,234 --> 00:09:56,794
Come on now.

157
00:09:57,794 --> 00:09:58,434
Quickly.

158
00:10:02,474 --> 00:10:03,034
Yan Yue.

159
00:10:04,234 --> 00:10:05,674
Do I look good in this?

160
00:10:06,874 --> 00:10:07,474
Yes.

161
00:10:08,114 --> 00:10:08,794
Then I'll go try it on.

162
00:10:09,554 --> 00:10:10,034
Okay.

163
00:10:24,354 --> 00:10:25,914
How time flies.

164
00:10:26,874 --> 00:10:29,554
It feels like our school days
were just yesterday.

165
00:10:31,114 --> 00:10:32,114
Back then,

166
00:10:32,354 --> 00:10:35,114
I didn't like to talk or dress up.

167
00:10:36,554 --> 00:10:37,914
While you

168
00:10:39,034 --> 00:10:40,914
were a beauty that everyone adored.

169
00:10:42,594 --> 00:10:43,554
I still remember

170
00:10:43,794 --> 00:10:45,114
the first time we met,

171
00:10:46,114 --> 00:10:47,674
you held my hand like this and said,

172
00:10:48,354 --> 00:10:49,474
"I admire your painting."

173
00:10:49,474 --> 00:10:50,674
"You admire my painting too."

174
00:10:51,794 --> 00:10:53,114
"Let's exchange ideas."

175
00:10:57,354 --> 00:10:59,594
Now you're getting married.

176
00:11:00,594 --> 00:11:04,354
I feel like my mission is accomplished.

177
00:11:05,674 --> 00:11:07,234
What mission?

178
00:11:07,674 --> 00:11:08,594
After I get married,

179
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:10,794
it's still us, right?

180
00:11:11,674 --> 00:11:14,554
And, if you're bullied in the future,

181
00:11:14,914 --> 00:11:16,914
Yan Yue and I will back you up.

182
00:11:22,234 --> 00:11:23,474
Why are you crying?

183
00:11:23,594 --> 00:11:24,794
No crying.

184
00:11:26,794 --> 00:11:27,554
Stop being melodramatic.

185
00:11:27,914 --> 00:11:28,594
Change now.

186
00:11:28,594 --> 00:11:30,034
The groom is still waiting outside.

187
00:11:30,554 --> 00:11:31,034
Excuse me.

188
00:12:12,994 --> 00:12:13,594
Does it look good?

189
00:12:15,114 --> 00:12:15,594
Yes.

190
00:12:39,914 --> 00:12:40,674
Look.

191
00:12:41,354 --> 00:12:42,234
Looking good today.

192
00:12:44,594 --> 00:12:45,914
Why are you so handsome?

193
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,474
Alright. Go change into the next one.

194
00:12:49,794 --> 00:12:50,914
I'm going to change into the next one.

195
00:13:03,914 --> 00:13:05,154
She has left.

196
00:13:07,594 --> 00:13:10,114
Today's Ran is the version
I've never seen before.

197
00:13:21,794 --> 00:13:22,594
When will someone

198
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:23,994
allow his girlfriend

199
00:13:24,354 --> 00:13:25,794
to wear her dream wedding dress?

200
00:13:26,794 --> 00:13:27,914
What is a surprise?

201
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:31,794
A surprise is to
suppress this matter to the bottom,

202
00:13:31,794 --> 00:13:32,914
then suddenly it explodes.

203
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,114
By then, it'll be both surprising
and pleasant, right?

204
00:13:36,674 --> 00:13:38,034
Then I'm looking forward to
someone's surprise.

205
00:13:51,674 --> 00:13:53,794
What to do? It's already dark.

206
00:13:55,354 --> 00:13:56,354
I think

207
00:13:56,354 --> 00:13:57,914
your ideas

208
00:13:57,914 --> 00:13:59,354
are too fanciful.

209
00:13:59,354 --> 00:14:00,914
We have to be practical.

210
00:14:02,114 --> 00:14:04,914
An Ran, first of all,
decide on a general direction.

211
00:14:05,234 --> 00:14:07,914
This ceremony is nothing more than
Chinese style, Western style,

212
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:09,354
or a combination of Chinese and Western.

213
00:14:10,114 --> 00:14:11,794
Think about which one you like.

214
00:14:13,794 --> 00:14:14,554
Which one do you like?

215
00:14:16,354 --> 00:14:17,554
I like whichever one you like.

216
00:14:18,234 --> 00:14:18,874
Whichever?

217
00:14:19,594 --> 00:14:20,234
It's up to you.

218
00:14:22,354 --> 00:14:24,034
But now,

219
00:14:24,474 --> 00:14:27,034
we have just over a week
until our wedding.

220
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:30,034
Do we have time
to find a suitable restaurant?

221
00:14:31,794 --> 00:14:32,794
But we don't have to

222
00:14:32,794 --> 00:14:34,794
hold our wedding at a hotel,
like the traditional format.

223
00:14:35,234 --> 00:14:35,874
What do you think?

224
00:14:38,874 --> 00:14:39,994
Do you have any other ideas?

225
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:42,034
Enough, you two.

226
00:14:42,234 --> 00:14:43,554
Stop showing off your love.

227
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:44,874
The wedding is next week.

228
00:14:44,874 --> 00:14:45,994
We need to decide quickly.

229
00:14:50,594 --> 00:14:51,234
Any ideas?

230
00:14:53,674 --> 00:14:54,674
No, no.

231
00:14:55,114 --> 00:14:56,114
Say it.

232
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:56,714
No, no.

233
00:14:56,714 --> 00:14:57,594
Really no.

234
00:14:59,034 --> 00:15:00,594
Bai Mengyao, can't you control him?

235
00:15:01,154 --> 00:15:02,274
Look at him.

236
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:03,234
Leave him alone.

237
00:15:05,594 --> 00:15:06,474
No, for real.

238
00:15:06,474 --> 00:15:06,914
Yes, you have.

239
00:15:06,914 --> 00:15:08,674
You just don't want to use it on us.

240
00:15:17,154 --> 00:15:17,874
(Good evening, everyone.)

241
00:15:18,754 --> 00:15:20,594
(Welcome to Heisha Time.)

242
00:15:21,474 --> 00:15:22,394
(I am Heisha.)

243
00:15:23,394 --> 00:15:24,354
(Every night at 10 o'clock,)

244
00:15:24,754 --> 00:15:26,874
(let's share a good movie.)

245
00:15:27,754 --> 00:15:29,674
(Make friends through voice.)

246
00:15:29,674 --> 00:15:31,504
(Heisha Time)

247
00:15:31,794 --> 00:15:34,594
Attending friends' weddings,

248
00:15:35,154 --> 00:15:37,474
Charles and Carrie lived their own life.

249
00:15:38,154 --> 00:15:39,794
In others' vows of love,

250
00:15:39,994 --> 00:15:41,874
they fall in love
and say goodbye time after time.

251
00:15:42,994 --> 00:15:44,154
Why do people get married?

252
00:15:44,634 --> 00:15:45,914
The answer is actually very simple.

253
00:15:46,914 --> 00:15:49,594
Just as Carrie answered
at her own wedding.

254
00:15:50,354 --> 00:15:51,754
Love is the answer.

255
00:15:52,474 --> 00:15:53,674
You know it well.

256
00:15:55,474 --> 00:15:56,754
When you're no longer afraid

257
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:58,754
to love someone for a long time.

258
00:15:59,674 --> 00:16:00,994
When you can't wait,

259
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:03,474
and already want to spend
the rest of your life with them,

260
00:16:05,354 --> 00:16:07,474
then say, you do.

261
00:16:08,274 --> 00:16:10,354
Say, "I do".

262
00:16:35,274 --> 00:16:36,474
Is this true?

263
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:37,754
You also received the message?

264
00:16:44,674 --> 00:16:45,274
Does it hurt?

265
00:16:49,674 --> 00:16:50,914
I need to think carefully
about what to buy.

266
00:16:50,914 --> 00:16:51,514
Buy a bag.

267
00:16:51,754 --> 00:16:52,474
Miss An.

268
00:16:52,474 --> 00:16:52,914
Miss An.

269
00:16:59,154 --> 00:16:59,794
Today

270
00:17:00,474 --> 00:17:01,874
is a day of harvest.

271
00:17:03,754 --> 00:17:04,594
This money

272
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:06,754
is the project bonus

273
00:17:06,754 --> 00:17:07,674
for Fragment Time Boyfriend.

274
00:17:13,154 --> 00:17:15,754
It's also the biggest bonus

275
00:17:15,754 --> 00:17:17,874
you've received
since joining Gaishi Unparalleled.

276
00:17:24,634 --> 00:17:25,874
Thank you all for your persistence.

277
00:17:27,754 --> 00:17:28,354
Thank you.

278
00:17:28,754 --> 00:17:30,914
Thank you, Miss An.

279
00:17:37,154 --> 00:17:39,154
Where are we going to
take wedding photos?

280
00:17:39,674 --> 00:17:40,754
You'll know when we get there.

281
00:17:41,914 --> 00:17:43,874
So mysterious.

282
00:17:43,874 --> 00:17:45,634
Definitely up to something.

283
00:17:46,754 --> 00:17:47,754
Are you afraid I'll sell you?

284
00:17:49,154 --> 00:17:50,354
Would you dare?

285
00:17:51,594 --> 00:17:53,234
Even if I wanted to, it wouldn't work.

286
00:17:53,274 --> 00:17:56,274
Who else in this world
wants you besides me?

287
00:17:58,594 --> 00:18:00,754
Then you've found a treasure.

288
00:18:01,474 --> 00:18:02,354
Indeed.

289
00:18:09,674 --> 00:18:11,794
This road leads to Bowen University.

290
00:18:13,274 --> 00:18:13,994
How is it?

291
00:18:14,354 --> 00:18:15,754
The wedding photo location.

292
00:18:16,114 --> 00:18:16,794
Do you like it?

293
00:18:18,034 --> 00:18:21,474
Yan Yue, when did you
become so romantic?

294
00:18:21,874 --> 00:18:22,514
Stop it.

295
00:19:17,394 --> 00:19:19,754
Every angle of you is perfect.

296
00:19:19,754 --> 00:19:20,914
Are you talking about yourself?

297
00:19:21,674 --> 00:19:23,154
These photos

298
00:19:24,514 --> 00:19:25,514
bring back so many memories.

299
00:19:26,754 --> 00:19:27,354
Yes.

300
00:19:27,994 --> 00:19:30,114
All places where we've left
our footprints.

301
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:31,634
It's a pity

302
00:19:31,634 --> 00:19:33,394
that I didn't know you back then.

303
00:19:34,274 --> 00:19:34,914
It's okay.

304
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:36,594
Now is just right.

305
00:19:49,394 --> 00:19:50,154
Hurry up.

306
00:19:50,154 --> 00:19:51,674
You're so dilly-dally.

307
00:19:51,674 --> 00:19:52,394
Let's go, Rui.

308
00:19:53,754 --> 00:19:54,274
Mr. Hu,

309
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:55,634
why are you here?

310
00:19:56,394 --> 00:19:58,874
Aren't you preparing
for the wedding with Miss An?

311
00:20:00,394 --> 00:20:02,994
I came to hear your work reports

312
00:20:03,274 --> 00:20:05,154
and see how Fragment Time Boyfriend

313
00:20:05,154 --> 00:20:06,634
has been doing since its launch.

314
00:20:07,274 --> 00:20:07,914
I'll start.

315
00:20:08,394 --> 00:20:10,994
Our comment count
has now exceeded ten thousand.

316
00:20:10,994 --> 00:20:14,914
And, the rate of positive feedback
has reached a high of 86 percent.

317
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,154
The number of downloads
is also steadily increasing.

318
00:20:17,154 --> 00:20:18,154
Consistently in the top three.

319
00:20:18,514 --> 00:20:19,674
The launch plan for the overseas version

320
00:20:19,674 --> 00:20:20,994
is also in progress.

321
00:20:21,394 --> 00:20:22,874
The initial draft of the event is done.

322
00:20:23,394 --> 00:20:25,394
The financial operations
are going smoothly.

323
00:20:25,914 --> 00:20:26,634
Nice.

324
00:20:27,634 --> 00:20:29,514
I declare,

325
00:20:29,754 --> 00:20:32,634
from tomorrow, Gaishi Unparalleled will

326
00:20:34,154 --> 00:20:35,154
have a four-day holiday.

327
00:20:35,914 --> 00:20:36,514
Why?

328
00:20:37,634 --> 00:20:39,034
Actually, I came here today

329
00:20:39,034 --> 00:20:41,394
to invite you
on behalf of the bride and groom.

330
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:42,154
Here you are.

331
00:20:42,594 --> 00:20:43,154
Here.

332
00:20:44,274 --> 00:20:46,594
You all must attend.

333
00:20:48,034 --> 00:20:50,394
Time flies so quickly.

334
00:20:50,994 --> 00:20:52,674
I didn't expect

335
00:20:52,674 --> 00:20:55,514
the wedding of Miss An
and Mr. Heisha to come so soon.

336
00:20:56,274 --> 00:20:57,034
Yes.

337
00:20:57,394 --> 00:20:59,994
Fortunately, our company
is gradually getting back on track.

338
00:20:59,994 --> 00:21:00,794
This allows them

339
00:21:00,794 --> 00:21:02,154
to prepare for their wedding with ease.

340
00:21:03,914 --> 00:21:04,634
Well,

341
00:21:04,994 --> 00:21:07,914
what are you going to wear that day?

342
00:21:09,874 --> 00:21:11,634
Oh please, just wear this outfit.

343
00:21:11,994 --> 00:21:13,154
Have Tian Xin and Mengyao

344
00:21:13,154 --> 00:21:14,154
give you a couple of facial masks

345
00:21:14,154 --> 00:21:14,994
and apply them.

346
00:21:15,514 --> 00:21:15,794
Okay.

347
00:21:15,794 --> 00:21:16,674
Thank you.

348
00:21:16,674 --> 00:21:17,994
Alright, I'm to deliver the invitation.

349
00:21:17,994 --> 00:21:18,634
Time to leave.

350
00:21:18,634 --> 00:21:19,274
Goodbye, Mr. Hu.

351
00:21:19,274 --> 00:21:19,994
Clock off.

352
00:21:19,994 --> 00:21:21,154
Let me turn off the lights.

353
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:21,914
I'll do it today.

354
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:22,914
- Off work, Tian Xin.
- Let's go.

355
00:21:23,154 --> 00:21:24,674
Okay, goodbye, Mr. Hu.

356
00:21:24,674 --> 00:21:25,154
Goodbye.

357
00:21:48,496 --> 00:21:51,908
(Yan Yue and An Ran's Wedding Invitation)
(Wedding Time: 11:28, November 13, 2022)

358
00:21:58,448 --> 00:22:01,008
(Wedding Vows)

359
00:22:06,154 --> 00:22:07,634
I was surprised to find

360
00:22:07,634 --> 00:22:11,154
I'm meeting your friends
for the first time.

361
00:22:41,634 --> 00:22:42,874
What are you writing?

362
00:22:45,154 --> 00:22:45,674
Nothing.

363
00:22:48,154 --> 00:22:49,754
So secretive.

364
00:22:49,754 --> 00:22:50,634
Can I have a look?

365
00:22:50,634 --> 00:22:51,634
Really nothing.

366
00:22:52,394 --> 00:22:53,394
Have you showered?

367
00:22:53,674 --> 00:22:54,754
Your hair hasn't dried yet, has it?

368
00:22:55,394 --> 00:22:56,394
Let me help you dry your hair.

369
00:22:56,914 --> 00:22:58,154
Do you know how to do it?

370
00:22:58,154 --> 00:22:59,994
Yes, I've done it before.

371
00:23:00,274 --> 00:23:00,994
You've done it before?

372
00:23:01,394 --> 00:23:02,634
I used to dry my mom's hair.

373
00:23:02,634 --> 00:23:03,874
I used to dry my mom's hair.

374
00:23:03,874 --> 00:23:04,394
Let's go.

375
00:23:04,394 --> 00:23:05,194
No peeking, huh?

376
00:23:05,194 --> 00:23:05,714
Let's go.

377
00:23:44,394 --> 00:23:45,114
Thank you.

378
00:23:47,994 --> 00:23:49,634
I'll dry your hair every day from now.

379
00:23:51,154 --> 00:23:52,114
How time flies.

380
00:23:52,874 --> 00:23:54,354
We're getting married tomorrow.

381
00:23:57,754 --> 00:23:58,754
Tomorrow is the day.

382
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:07,874
What's wrong?

383
00:24:10,154 --> 00:24:11,154
I'm nervous.

384
00:24:14,634 --> 00:24:15,634
Relax.

385
00:24:16,274 --> 00:24:17,114
I'm here.

386
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,594
This feels so good.

387
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:53,874
Fewer people, more comfort.

388
00:25:54,274 --> 00:25:55,794
I want to have a wedding like this.

389
00:25:55,794 --> 00:25:56,674
Right.

390
00:25:56,674 --> 00:25:57,674
Miss An only planned

391
00:25:57,674 --> 00:25:59,394
such a small-scale wedding for you.

392
00:25:59,594 --> 00:26:00,514
That's not true.

393
00:26:00,634 --> 00:26:02,154
I heard from Miss An

394
00:26:02,154 --> 00:26:04,474
that she doesn't like weddings
with too many people.

395
00:26:04,754 --> 00:26:06,874
So, Mr. Heisha held

396
00:26:06,874 --> 00:26:07,914
a small wedding.

397
00:26:07,914 --> 00:26:09,914
Just to make us have more fun.

398
00:26:10,114 --> 00:26:11,474
Isn't this my favorite tea?

399
00:26:11,474 --> 00:26:12,154
Mengyao.

400
00:26:12,274 --> 00:26:12,914
Look,

401
00:26:12,914 --> 00:26:13,994
they prepared tea for Wu,

402
00:26:13,994 --> 00:26:15,394
and snacks for you.

403
00:26:15,514 --> 00:26:16,514
And they even took care of Peng.

404
00:26:16,514 --> 00:26:17,634
Mr. Heisha has put in a lot of effort.

405
00:26:17,754 --> 00:26:19,154
Because he is Mr. Heisha.

406
00:26:19,154 --> 00:26:21,234
Otherwise, you would
still be babbling on and on?

407
00:26:21,274 --> 00:26:22,514
Eat and close your mouth.

408
00:26:23,794 --> 00:26:25,394
You guys,

409
00:26:25,874 --> 00:26:26,914
when are you getting married?

410
00:26:26,914 --> 00:26:28,154
Let me get involved too.

411
00:26:28,874 --> 00:26:30,154
Shouldn't you be the first one?

412
00:26:31,274 --> 00:26:31,994
If you're waiting for me,

413
00:26:31,994 --> 00:26:34,594
you'll be waiting a thousand years.

414
00:26:36,154 --> 00:26:38,034
What do you think?
Are you interested in our project?

415
00:26:38,394 --> 00:26:40,274
Look what I have done today.

416
00:26:40,274 --> 00:26:41,594
Give us a boost.

417
00:26:42,154 --> 00:26:43,514
Hu Yingjun.

418
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:46,274
You're the best man
and you're having such a good time here.

419
00:26:46,274 --> 00:26:47,114
- Ouch.
- What are you doing?

420
00:26:47,114 --> 00:26:47,874
Let go.

421
00:26:47,874 --> 00:26:48,994
The newlyweds are about to enter.

422
00:26:48,994 --> 00:26:49,994
The rings.

423
00:26:50,394 --> 00:26:51,234
Here.

424
00:26:51,274 --> 00:26:51,994
Where are they?

425
00:26:54,034 --> 00:26:54,754
Here.

426
00:26:58,874 --> 00:26:59,994
I'm so nervous.

427
00:27:00,274 --> 00:27:01,874
Relax.

428
00:27:02,114 --> 00:27:02,994
What am I nervous about?

429
00:27:04,874 --> 00:27:05,514
Perfect.

430
00:27:06,154 --> 00:27:06,634
Relax.

431
00:27:06,634 --> 00:27:07,234
Relax.

432
00:27:07,234 --> 00:27:08,274
Relax.

433
00:27:10,274 --> 00:27:10,754
Shan,

434
00:27:11,394 --> 00:27:12,994
when will you get one for our company?

435
00:27:12,994 --> 00:27:13,634
You pay.

436
00:27:13,754 --> 00:27:14,874
You're the boss.

437
00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:16,154
Go away.

438
00:27:17,234 --> 00:27:17,874
Go away.

439
00:27:20,634 --> 00:27:22,154
The newlyweds are here. Change the song.

440
00:28:17,754 --> 00:28:19,154
Today is a big day.

441
00:28:19,154 --> 00:28:19,994
Let me say a few words.

442
00:28:20,634 --> 00:28:23,034
First, thank you Yan Yue and An Ran

443
00:28:23,154 --> 00:28:25,154
for preparing

444
00:28:25,154 --> 00:28:26,154
such a warm wedding.

445
00:28:26,274 --> 00:28:29,154
Instead of saying
we came to their wedding,

446
00:28:29,154 --> 00:28:31,154
it's better to say they gave us a chance

447
00:28:31,154 --> 00:28:32,274
to get together.

448
00:28:32,274 --> 00:28:32,994
I am honored

449
00:28:32,994 --> 00:28:35,114
to be a witness for both of them.

450
00:28:35,514 --> 00:28:37,154
Next, let's have the couple
say a few words.

451
00:28:37,754 --> 00:28:39,154
Okay.

452
00:28:42,594 --> 00:28:43,794
I didn't know there was this part.

453
00:28:43,794 --> 00:28:45,634
I thought it was a little gathering.

454
00:28:45,634 --> 00:28:46,274
It's okay.

455
00:28:48,474 --> 00:28:50,754
I want to thank you

456
00:28:50,754 --> 00:28:52,754
for attending our little wedding today.

457
00:28:53,354 --> 00:28:54,994
The reason we chose this format

458
00:28:55,394 --> 00:28:56,874
is to share our happiness

459
00:28:57,394 --> 00:28:58,514
with everyone.

460
00:28:59,354 --> 00:29:00,634
Because everyone here

461
00:29:00,634 --> 00:29:01,754
is the most important person

462
00:29:02,114 --> 00:29:04,594
in An Ran's and my life and work.

463
00:29:05,154 --> 00:29:06,114
Your presence

464
00:29:06,114 --> 00:29:08,034
is very important to us.

465
00:29:08,034 --> 00:29:10,754
- Bravo!
- Good!

466
00:29:11,274 --> 00:29:11,994
Next,

467
00:29:12,994 --> 00:29:14,154
please allow me

468
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:16,274
to say a few words to my wife.

469
00:29:27,674 --> 00:29:28,234
An Ran,

470
00:29:29,874 --> 00:29:31,154
before I met you,

471
00:29:32,034 --> 00:29:33,874
my life couldn't be without music.

472
00:29:34,994 --> 00:29:36,394
When disputes occurred,

473
00:29:36,394 --> 00:29:37,634
I could only choose to escape.

474
00:29:38,634 --> 00:29:40,634
(I was used to being shackled)

475
00:29:40,634 --> 00:29:42,274
(in my own world
by a pair of headphones.)

476
00:29:44,354 --> 00:29:46,234
I thought I was living happily,

477
00:29:46,514 --> 00:29:47,514
free,

478
00:29:47,514 --> 00:29:48,754
and fulfilled.

479
00:29:49,594 --> 00:29:51,154
Until one day I realized

480
00:29:52,114 --> 00:29:53,754
that after falling in love with someone,

481
00:29:54,514 --> 00:29:56,874
all those noisy sounds will disappear.

482
00:29:58,114 --> 00:30:00,794
And the most beautiful sounds
will form melodies.

483
00:30:02,354 --> 00:30:04,994
The perfection you gave me

484
00:30:05,474 --> 00:30:07,674
is a shore I can't reach by myself.

485
00:30:09,034 --> 00:30:11,794
Meeting you and knowing you again,

486
00:30:12,874 --> 00:30:13,634
I found

487
00:30:14,274 --> 00:30:15,354
I still have

488
00:30:15,354 --> 00:30:17,514
the butterflies in my stomach
when I first met you.

489
00:30:19,874 --> 00:30:21,034
(You seem to always)

490
00:30:21,354 --> 00:30:23,234
(be the goddess of my campus days.)

491
00:30:24,394 --> 00:30:26,634
(So sunny, so beautiful.)

492
00:30:30,154 --> 00:30:30,874
Thank you.

493
00:30:32,234 --> 00:30:33,914
(Thank you for constantly blocking)

494
00:30:33,914 --> 00:30:34,994
(those unpleasant things for me.)

495
00:30:36,474 --> 00:30:37,394
(Thank you for dragging)

496
00:30:37,394 --> 00:30:38,994
(the boy hidden in the headphones cave)

497
00:30:39,794 --> 00:30:41,154
(into the sunlight.)

498
00:30:47,994 --> 00:30:49,514
In the future,

499
00:30:50,674 --> 00:30:52,274
I want to grow old with you.

500
00:30:53,674 --> 00:30:55,114
(I want to embrace your body,)

501
00:30:56,274 --> 00:30:57,474
(your heart,)

502
00:30:58,274 --> 00:30:59,514
(your dreams,)

503
00:31:00,594 --> 00:31:03,274
(your past, present,)

504
00:31:03,914 --> 00:31:04,874
(and future.)

505
00:31:09,794 --> 00:31:10,394
An Ran,

506
00:31:12,274 --> 00:31:14,154
would you let me stand by your side?

507
00:31:19,154 --> 00:31:20,514
What should I say?

508
00:31:21,994 --> 00:31:23,274
Yes, I would.

509
00:31:23,274 --> 00:31:24,914
Of course, I do.

00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:41,754
♪Since the moment you looked at me♪

511
00:31:41,754 --> 00:31:43,394
I never thought

512
00:31:44,274 --> 00:31:46,634
that I could become someone's strength.

513
00:31:47,794 --> 00:31:49,594
I always thought

514
00:31:49,594 --> 00:31:51,514
that life is a battle one fights alone.

515
00:31:52,354 --> 00:31:53,034
Yan Yue,

516
00:31:54,034 --> 00:31:54,994
thank you

517
00:31:55,874 --> 00:31:57,514
(for resolutely walking towards me.)

518
00:31:59,234 --> 00:32:01,514
(There is a kind of
heroism in this world)

519
00:32:02,474 --> 00:32:04,754
knowing that marriage is hard,

520
00:32:05,274 --> 00:32:07,634
yet still longing for it.

521
00:32:08,874 --> 00:32:11,754
Now I finally understand this heroism

522
00:32:12,634 --> 00:32:13,794
because of you.

523
00:32:15,994 --> 00:32:18,874
(Because of your love and tolerance,)

524
00:32:19,714 --> 00:32:21,994
(I finally have this courage.)

525

(Whether our future is dark or bright,)

00:32:26,394 --> 00:32:28,794
I am willing to forge ahead with you.

527
00:32:34,234 --> 00:32:34,954
Mr. Yan,

528
00:32:35,874 --> 00:32:38,194
would you exchange our missed youth

529
00:32:38,434 --> 00:32:40,274
for a lifetime of companionship?

530
00:32:41,714 --> 00:32:42,434
I do.

Next,

549
00:34:00,714 --> 00:34:03,194
generally speaking,
it is a fair competition.

550
00:34:04,794 --> 00:34:09,434
But today I want to give the bouquet

551
00:34:19,234 --> 00:34:20,114
to Bai Mengyao.

552
00:34:24,474 --> 00:34:25,434
Miss Bai,

553
00:34:25,994 --> 00:34:28,914
we've known each other
for almost ten years.

554
00:34:30,194 --> 00:34:33,434
We've seen each other's ugliest,
most embarrassing,

555
00:34:33,434 --> 00:34:34,874
and most slovenly states.

556
00:34:38,154 --> 00:34:40,154
At the same time, we've also witnessed

557
00:34:40,434 --> 00:34:42,394
the ups and downs along the way,

558
00:34:43,194 --> 00:34:44,674
struggling for dreams,

559
00:34:44,914 --> 00:34:46,514
and enjoying love.

560
00:34:47,474 --> 00:34:49,034
Today I have another wish.

561
00:34:50,194 --> 00:34:51,754
I hope my Miss Bai

562
00:34:52,714 --> 00:34:55,594
can have her own happiness.

563
00:34:58,634 --> 00:34:59,274
An Ran.

564
00:35:03,194 --> 00:35:04,434
Bai Mengyao!

565
00:35:13,434 --> 00:35:15,194
Cool, Mr. Hu.

566
00:35:17,114 --> 00:35:17,714
Bai Mengyao,

567
00:35:18,874 --> 00:35:19,874
will you marry me?

568
00:35:22,594 --> 00:35:23,234
Say yes.

569
00:35:25,914 --> 00:35:26,674
Say yes.

570
00:35:27,634 --> 00:35:28,714
I do.

571
00:35:29,434 --> 00:35:30,274
Great.

572
00:35:47,994 --> 00:35:50,434
Thank you for your assistance.

573
00:35:53,874 --> 00:35:54,714
Nice surprise.

574
00:35:54,714 --> 00:35:55,234
Good.

575
00:35:55,234 --> 00:35:56,434
This is your big move?

576
00:36:14,914 --> 00:36:17,994
Happy wedding.

577
00:36:35,114 --> 00:36:37,434
(Although we become exhausted
and even numb occasionally)

578
00:36:37,434 --> 00:36:40,234
(from diligent work every day,)

579
00:36:41,354 --> 00:36:43,754
(life will still bring
some unexpected surprises)

580
00:36:43,954 --> 00:36:45,954
(at some point.)

581
00:36:47,274 --> 00:36:49,714
(Although there is no
extra hour in reality,)

582
00:36:50,354 --> 00:36:52,714
(those moments hidden
in the fragmented time)

583
00:36:53,114 --> 00:36:55,274
(are enough to
continue our past regrets)

584
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:57,474
(into sweet love.)

585
00:36:58,874 --> 00:37:00,394
(Because of this beautiful love,)

586
00:37:01,194 --> 00:37:05,954
(our life becomes
lively and exciting again.)
