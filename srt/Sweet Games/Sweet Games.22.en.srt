Okay, let's get to the point.

your benefits
after you join our company.

128
00:07:40,106 --> 00:07:41,626
I know that Gaishi Unparalleled

We think

132
00:07:45,346 --> 00:07:47,106
you are a rare talent.

133
00:07:47,346 --> 00:07:48,786
A company with such a scale

134
00:07:48,986 --> 00:07:49,866
can develop

135
00:07:49,866 --> 00:07:51,506
a successful game

136
00:07:51,626 --> 00:07:52,746
like Time Boyfriend.

137
00:07:52,946 --> 00:07:55,226
I think, as the only programmer
in Gaishi Unparalleled,

138
00:07:55,546 --> 00:07:57,746
you are indispensable.

139
00:07:58,106 --> 00:07:59,906
Yes, now Gaishi Unparalleled

140
00:07:59,906 --> 00:08:01,746
made some achievements.

141
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:04,426
But in terms of resources and benefits,

142
00:08:04,546 --> 00:08:05,666
it can't rival

143
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:06,666
large companies like us.

144
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:07,986
I see.

145
00:08:09,186 --> 00:08:10,426
So, how much do you offer me?

146
00:08:10,946 --> 00:08:12,186
I am willing to offer you

147
00:08:12,186 --> 00:08:14,506
three times your current salary.

148
00:08:15,306 --> 00:08:15,666
How much?

149
00:08:15,946 --> 00:08:16,666

151
00:08:17,866 --> 00:08:18,626
Three times?

152
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:19,746
What do you think?

153
00:08:29,865 --> 00:08:35,920
(We are together again.)
(Make persistent efforts and unite as one!)

154
00:08:46,306 --> 00:08:47,106
Come on. Hug.

155
00:08:47,546 --> 00:08:48,208
Don't be too formal.

159
00:08:52,306 --> 00:08:52,866
Okay.

160
00:08:52,986 --> 00:08:53,426
Yes, yes.

161
00:08:54,186 --> 00:08:55,426

Let's take a break,

164
00:09:00,786 --> 00:09:01,426
and continue later.

165
00:09:02,026 --> 00:09:02,626
Rest over there.

166
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:03,666
It's cooler over there.

167
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:04,106
Okay.

168
00:09:06,106 --> 00:09:06,986
Take a break.

169
00:09:08,186 --> 00:09:08,786
Have some water.

170
00:09:10,066 --> 00:09:10,426
Thanks.

171
00:09:13,746 --> 00:09:16,186
You told me
you're a freelance photographer.

172
00:09:16,186 --> 00:09:16,866
Like this?

173
00:09:19,066 --> 00:09:19,786
I can take my time.

174
00:09:20,306 --> 00:09:21,186
I've just started.

175
00:09:23,786 --> 00:09:24,306
Changfeng,

176
00:09:24,946 --> 00:09:26,186
I want to make a dating game.

178
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:30,666

179
00:09:31,306 --> 00:09:31,786
Right.

180
00:09:32,546 --> 00:09:33,186
Do you want to join me?

181
00:09:38,426 --> 00:09:38,786
No.

182
00:09:40,866 --> 00:09:41,946
Why?

183
00:09:42,426 --> 00:09:44,346
You're a computer science top student
from Bowen University.

184
00:09:46,226 --> 00:09:47,346
With just the two of us,

185
00:09:48,106 --> 00:09:48,786
how can we make it?

186
00:09:49,546 --> 00:09:50,626
You don't need to worry about that.

187
00:09:50,866 --> 00:09:52,746
I'm currently working
at Peng Ying's company.

188
00:09:53,106 --> 00:09:55,306
We'll have the workforce,
a team, and resources.

189
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:56,546
More importantly,

190
00:09:56,786 --> 00:09:58,306
as long as we get approved
on the kick-off meeting,

191
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,586
we'll have ample funding

192
00:09:59,586 --> 00:10:00,786
for our Time Boyfriend.

193
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,186
But being an office worker is boring.

194
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:09,426
You know me.

195
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,346
I'm a chatterbox,

196
00:10:12,506 --> 00:10:13,426
and not good at communicating,

197
00:10:13,866 --> 00:10:15,106
let alone getting along with colleagues.

198
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:16,546
Forget it.

199
00:10:16,786 --> 00:10:18,186
Come on.

200
00:10:18,426 --> 00:10:21,106
You have a sharp tongue
but are soft-hearted.

201
00:10:21,986 --> 00:10:22,546
Did you forget

202
00:10:22,866 --> 00:10:23,946
back in our university days,

203
00:10:24,066 --> 00:10:25,306
when I organized your photo exhibition,

204
00:10:25,866 --> 00:10:27,506
what you said to me?

205
00:10:32,306 --> 00:10:33,106
I'd say

206
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:35,546
that period

207
00:10:36,506 --> 00:10:37,626
was definitely the most fulfilling

208
00:10:37,626 --> 00:10:38,866
period of my life.

209
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,106
Let's play together again,

210
00:10:43,626 --> 00:10:44,706
like when we were in school.

211
00:10:50,306 --> 00:10:50,786
I have to go.

212
00:10:51,866 --> 00:10:52,986
You haven't promised me yet.

213
00:10:57,306 --> 00:10:57,866
Yes.

214
00:10:58,306 --> 00:10:59,306
Let's continue.

215
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,106
We're here.

216
00:11:09,626 --> 00:11:10,306
Not bad.

217
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:11,866
The equipment isn't bad.

218
00:11:11,986 --> 00:11:13,306
We're in this area.

219
00:11:18,546 --> 00:11:20,426
This is our team.

220
00:11:21,186 --> 00:11:21,786
Just the two of us?

221
00:11:22,426 --> 00:11:23,986
No. There is also...

222
00:11:25,186 --> 00:11:25,666
Perfect timing.

223
00:11:26,626 --> 00:11:27,106
Good morning.

224
00:11:27,306 --> 00:11:27,626
Hello.

225
00:11:27,866 --> 00:11:28,546
Wu.

226
00:11:29,066 --> 00:11:30,546
Our company's finance manager.

227
00:11:31,306 --> 00:11:31,786
The god of wealth.

228
00:11:32,306 --> 00:11:34,186
He decides whether we
make or lose money.

229
00:11:34,786 --> 00:11:35,746
Hello, hello.

230
00:11:36,506 --> 00:11:37,346
- Changfeng.
- Wu.

231
00:11:38,106 --> 00:11:38,666
Pleasure.

232
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:39,986
I'll leave you. I have to go.

233
00:11:40,186 --> 00:11:40,546
Okay.

234
00:11:40,546 --> 00:11:40,986
Alright.

235
00:11:41,786 --> 00:11:42,106
Bye.

236
00:11:42,426 --> 00:11:42,786
Bye.

237
00:11:46,186 --> 00:11:48,546
Where did you dig up this veteran

238
00:11:48,546 --> 00:11:49,546
from a large enterprise?

239
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:50,186
Impressive, huh?

240
00:11:51,066 --> 00:11:51,666
So, Miss An,

241
00:11:52,066 --> 00:11:53,746
where are you planning

242
00:11:54,186 --> 00:11:55,226
to seat me, the programmer?

243
00:11:56,306 --> 00:11:57,546
This is my desk.

244
00:11:58,106 --> 00:11:58,866
You can sit here.

245
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:00,506
Okay.

246
00:12:01,066 --> 00:12:01,666
I'm all yours.

247
00:12:02,426 --> 00:12:04,066
Fragment Time Boyfriend,

248
00:12:04,186 --> 00:12:05,986
as a dating game,

249
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:09,746
(In-depth research)
was inspired by our dating experiences,

250
00:12:10,786 --> 00:12:12,546
and it's based on real cases

251
00:12:12,546 --> 00:12:14,666
from research and interviews.

252
00:12:14,946 --> 00:12:18,106
Our aim is to create a complex

253
00:12:18,186 --> 00:12:20,546
and diverse male protagonist.

254
00:12:21,746 --> 00:12:24,866
He won't mindlessly spout sweet lines

255
00:12:25,106 --> 00:12:28,506
but aims for emotional touch
that reaches deep into

256
00:12:28,506 --> 00:12:29,506
the player's heart,

257
00:12:30,306 --> 00:12:31,866
providing heartwarming companionship.

258
00:12:35,186 --> 00:12:35,666
That's all?

259
00:12:38,306 --> 00:12:40,106
Ms. Peng, we've also prepared

260
00:12:40,106 --> 00:12:41,266
a paper version of the project proposal.

261
00:12:41,266 --> 00:12:43,146
It contains details
not yet covered in the presentation.

262
00:12:43,146 --> 00:12:44,026
You might want to take a look.

263
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:47,186
Let's stop here for today.

264
00:12:48,546 --> 00:12:49,186
Ms. Peng.

265
00:12:49,786 --> 00:12:50,426
Ms. Peng.

266
00:12:50,786 --> 00:12:51,346
This...

267
00:12:52,306 --> 00:12:53,106
T-This...

268
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:54,066
Coffee.

269
00:12:54,546 --> 00:12:55,746
Mocha with no ice.

270
00:12:57,786 --> 00:12:58,666
Who's her?

271
00:12:59,426 --> 00:13:00,106
And yours.

272
00:13:00,426 --> 00:13:00,746
Thank you.

273
00:13:01,306 --> 00:13:01,746
You.

274
00:13:04,106 --> 00:13:05,066
This isn't mine.

275
00:13:10,306 --> 00:13:10,986
Ms. Peng.

276
00:13:12,546 --> 00:13:13,306
Sorry,

277
00:13:14,986 --> 00:13:16,426
this should be yours.

278
00:13:19,986 --> 00:13:20,666
Ms. Peng.

279
00:13:21,866 --> 00:13:22,346
Well,

280
00:13:22,546 --> 00:13:24,306
any other things you need to buy today?

281
00:13:24,986 --> 00:13:25,666
Not for now.

282
00:13:26,866 --> 00:13:28,546
Any other work then?

283
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,066
I can do anything.

284
00:13:31,506 --> 00:13:32,946
If you can't even
handle this small task,

285
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:34,546
do you think

286
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:37,306
you're capable for other tasks?

287
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:40,226
Ying.

288
00:13:41,186 --> 00:13:41,746
Ying.

289
00:13:42,946 --> 00:13:44,946
Well, could I

290
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:48,106
borrow her for planning?

291
00:13:48,986 --> 00:13:49,786
Didn't she just

292
00:13:49,786 --> 00:13:51,666
get promoted from planning intern?

293
00:13:51,866 --> 00:13:54,946
If she could join
my team for planning...

294
00:13:55,186 --> 00:13:56,226
Could you lend her to me?

295
00:13:56,226 --> 00:13:57,106
That would be great.

296
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:00,866
Then follow An Ran.

297
00:14:02,306 --> 00:14:02,946
Thank you, Ying.

298
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:04,186
Thank you.

299
00:14:10,186 --> 00:14:12,066
So you're the new planner, Tian Xin?

300
00:14:12,946 --> 00:14:14,866
How do you know my name is Tian Xin?

301
00:14:15,426 --> 00:14:17,306
You introduced yourself
on the day you got promoted.

302
00:14:17,946 --> 00:14:18,626
Right.

303
00:14:20,306 --> 00:14:21,306
Let me introduce.

304
00:14:21,746 --> 00:14:23,546
Although our team is small,

305
00:14:23,986 --> 00:14:25,866
with you joining us as a planner,

306
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:27,426
we just need to hire a designer,

307
00:14:27,426 --> 00:14:29,746
and we can start our pre-production.

308
00:14:30,426 --> 00:14:31,866
I was outside the door,

309
00:14:31,866 --> 00:14:33,186
and I heard your presentation.

310
00:14:33,546 --> 00:14:34,546
I think

311
00:14:34,546 --> 00:14:36,306
your Fragment Time Boyfriend project

312
00:14:36,306 --> 00:14:37,306
is very interesting.

313
00:14:37,426 --> 00:14:38,306
As long as you don't mind,

314
00:14:38,306 --> 00:14:39,306
I can join immediately.

315
00:14:39,426 --> 00:14:40,186
You like it?

316
00:14:41,426 --> 00:14:42,106
That's great.

317
00:14:42,426 --> 00:14:43,226
Changfeng, come here.

318
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:46,306
Let me introduce you.

319
00:14:46,426 --> 00:14:47,626
Our programmer, Changfeng.

320
00:14:47,866 --> 00:14:48,506
N-Nice to meet you.

321
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:49,506
Nice to meet you.

322
00:14:50,626 --> 00:14:52,306
Let me formally introduce myself.

323
00:14:52,546 --> 00:14:53,066
My name is...

324
00:14:53,306 --> 00:14:53,986
An Ran.

325
00:14:56,306 --> 00:14:57,186
Welcome to join us.

326
00:15:33,426 --> 00:15:35,186
Ying, could you tell me

327
00:15:35,466 --> 00:15:36,266
what's lacking

328
00:15:36,266 --> 00:15:37,586
in our project?

329
00:15:37,586 --> 00:15:38,386
We can change it.

330
00:15:38,386 --> 00:15:39,586
We can adjust.

331
00:15:40,186 --> 00:15:42,226
This is a collective assessment
by the project department.

332
00:15:42,706 --> 00:15:44,186
The Fragment Time Boyfriend project

333
00:15:44,186 --> 00:15:45,706
did not meet
the company's project criteria.

334
00:15:46,106 --> 00:15:47,106
Please accept the reality.

335
00:15:49,946 --> 00:15:50,746
Can't you really

336
00:15:50,746 --> 00:15:52,066
give us another chance?

337
00:15:54,306 --> 00:15:54,826
An Ran,

338
00:15:56,986 --> 00:15:58,306
you're wasting time.

339
00:16:26,426 --> 00:16:27,426
I'm sorry.

340
00:16:28,986 --> 00:16:30,706
I failed to get our project approved.

341
00:16:31,426 --> 00:16:33,226
Please, don't say that, Ran.

342
00:16:33,946 --> 00:16:36,706
Maybe we really didn't do well enough.

343
00:16:37,106 --> 00:16:38,826
It's this stupid company
that has no vision,

344
00:16:39,586 --> 00:16:40,746
only wanting to make a quick buck,

345
00:16:41,746 --> 00:16:43,666
with no patience
to create quality content.

346
00:16:44,066 --> 00:16:45,226
It's only been a short time,

347
00:16:45,586 --> 00:16:46,706
and they're rushing for a result.

348
00:16:47,946 --> 00:16:48,866
What can we do?

349
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,706
There are loads of good projects
aborted by the company in recent years.

350
00:16:54,706 --> 00:16:55,986
It's so pitiful to give up like this.

351
00:16:56,986 --> 00:16:57,586
I can't accept this.

352
00:16:58,706 --> 00:16:59,666
Me neither.

353
00:17:00,466 --> 00:17:01,706
It's not easy for me to feel

354
00:17:01,706 --> 00:17:02,666
that I have done

355
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:03,946
some meaningful work.

356
00:17:08,946 --> 00:17:10,346
I am prepared to go it alone.

357
00:17:13,186 --> 00:17:14,226
Time Boyfriend.

358
00:17:14,986 --> 00:17:16,186
I won't give up on it.

359
00:17:17,946 --> 00:17:20,466
There are more game companies
besides hers.

360
00:17:20,866 --> 00:17:22,946
I can go from door to door
to distribute materials

361
00:17:23,226 --> 00:17:24,186
and absorb investments.

362
00:17:24,466 --> 00:17:26,866
It's better than giving up like this.

363
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:29,706
Of course, you can continue to stay
in the company,

364
00:17:30,226 --> 00:17:32,186
where you can enjoy a stable income.

365
00:17:33,946 --> 00:17:34,666
I hope...

366
00:17:36,106 --> 00:17:38,706
If you still want to make this game,

367
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,586
I hope you can give me a chance.

368
00:17:45,586 --> 00:17:47,226
Let us try again.

369
00:18:03,946 --> 00:18:04,666
I don't want to be

370
00:18:05,106 --> 00:18:05,946
a cog in the machine.

371
00:18:06,746 --> 00:18:08,186
Time Boyfriend hasn't started yet.

372
00:18:08,946 --> 00:18:09,826
If you leave,

373
00:18:10,946 --> 00:18:11,706
where do we go?

374
00:18:11,706 --> 00:18:12,426
What are we doing here?

375
00:18:12,826 --> 00:18:13,346
That's right.

376
00:18:13,946 --> 00:18:15,066
Without you,

377
00:18:15,546 --> 00:18:16,706
I would still be running errands.

378
00:18:17,066 --> 00:18:18,586
I must go with you.

379
00:18:19,706 --> 00:18:20,346
Count me in too.

380
00:18:21,946 --> 00:18:22,746
Wu, you...

381
00:18:24,066 --> 00:18:26,186
I am your god of wealth, right?

382
00:18:26,946 --> 00:18:27,466
Without me,

383
00:18:28,226 --> 00:18:28,866
what do you do?

384
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:32,226
No, Wu,

385
00:18:32,226 --> 00:18:34,186
you already have a stable job now.

386
00:18:34,186 --> 00:18:34,986
Going it alone with us

387
00:18:35,586 --> 00:18:37,346
might not be better than before.

388
00:18:38,586 --> 00:18:39,466
In such a company,

389
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:40,866
there's no room for promotion.

390
00:18:41,306 --> 00:18:42,826
I will do job-hopping
in a couple of years, anyway.

391
00:18:43,226 --> 00:18:43,866
Furthermore,

392
00:18:44,426 --> 00:18:45,946
don't you allow a finance person like me

393
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:47,986
to also have a passion
for Time Boyfriend?

394
00:18:53,946 --> 00:18:55,186
Then our little team

395
00:18:55,466 --> 00:18:56,346
is officially established.

396
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:57,946
Come.

397
00:18:58,986 --> 00:18:59,666
Let's have a drink.

398
00:19:00,066 --> 00:19:00,426
Okay.

399
00:19:00,426 --> 00:19:00,946
Remember,

400
00:19:01,346 --> 00:19:02,866
we got the company fired.

401
00:19:02,946 --> 00:19:03,186
Yes.

402
00:19:03,186 --> 00:19:03,826
That's right.

403
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:05,466
We are starting a business.

404
00:19:06,226 --> 00:19:06,586
- Go.
- Go.

405
00:19:06,586 --> 00:19:07,186
- Go.
- Go.

406
00:19:07,186 --> 00:19:07,586
Come on.

407
00:19:12,226 --> 00:19:12,946
You guys continue.

408
00:19:12,946 --> 00:19:13,746
I'll go order some more.

409
00:19:13,746 --> 00:19:14,426
Okay.

410
00:19:17,586 --> 00:19:18,706
Waiter, order.

411
00:19:30,546 --> 00:19:30,946
Well,

412
00:19:31,226 --> 00:19:32,706
what do you want to order?

413
00:19:33,106 --> 00:19:34,466
Are you an art student?

414
00:19:39,466 --> 00:19:40,666
Are you really a waiter?

415
00:19:43,466 --> 00:19:45,066
Let me introduce myself to you.

416
00:19:45,066 --> 00:19:46,346
I am a game developer

417
00:19:46,466 --> 00:19:48,106
and we just started our business today.

418
00:19:48,346 --> 00:19:49,746
This is our team.

419
00:19:50,986 --> 00:19:52,866
I'm a light drinker?

420
00:19:53,106 --> 00:19:54,266
Yes.

421
00:19:55,186 --> 00:19:57,066
They're not usually like this.

422
00:19:58,306 --> 00:19:59,666
We're in need of a designer.

423
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:01,066
Would you like to join us?

424
00:20:03,946 --> 00:20:05,186
What do you want to order?

425
00:20:06,106 --> 00:20:06,586
Here's the thing.

426
00:20:06,586 --> 00:20:08,586
We're developing a dating game.

427
00:20:08,866 --> 00:20:10,706
The requirements for the designer
are very stringent.

428
00:20:10,946 --> 00:20:13,066
We need a very handsome boy.

429
00:20:13,226 --> 00:20:15,226
And he is also very charming.

430
00:20:15,346 --> 00:20:16,866
I believe we can definitely do it.

431
00:20:16,866 --> 00:20:17,866
I have a lot of confidence.

432
00:20:18,106 --> 00:20:19,226
In fact, the salary

433
00:20:19,226 --> 00:20:20,426
is negotiable.

434
00:20:20,466 --> 00:20:21,426
What's more,

435
00:20:21,426 --> 00:20:22,706
we can share the profit.

436
00:20:22,866 --> 00:20:23,706
What's your name?

437
00:20:23,706 --> 00:20:24,426
Could you possibly...

438
00:20:28,986 --> 00:20:30,946
We are not scammers.

439
00:20:30,946 --> 00:20:31,706
Good buddy.

440
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:34,186
Good buddy.

441
00:20:36,706 --> 00:20:37,346
We look like ones.

I've been sneezing all day.

458
00:21:37,066 --> 00:21:38,226
I feel like someone's out to get me.

459
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:40,226
What's the matter?

460
00:21:42,546 --> 00:21:43,426
I've gone solo.

462
00:21:46,986 --> 00:21:48,346

00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:53,466
you've only just perked up.

466
00:21:53,466 --> 00:21:54,346
What happened again?

467
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:55,826
Didn't you say you wanted
to develop games?

468
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:56,826
It's over now?

469
00:21:57,426 --> 00:21:59,586
Please. I'm invincibly perky, okay?

470
00:21:59,586 --> 00:22:00,466
If I don't leave,

471
00:22:00,466 --> 00:22:01,746
my game will be over.

472
00:22:02,586 --> 00:22:03,586
So why did you look for me?

473
00:22:04,826 --> 00:22:05,306
Just say it.

474
00:22:06,346 --> 00:22:06,746
Look,

475
00:22:07,226 --> 00:22:09,106
the milk tea shop you invested in
after graduation

476
00:22:09,346 --> 00:22:09,826
lost money.

477
00:22:10,346 --> 00:22:11,586
The massage shop fell down.

478
00:22:11,586 --> 00:22:13,066
The laundry shop was sold cheaply.

479
00:22:13,946 --> 00:22:14,706
It doesn't matter.

480
00:22:15,226 --> 00:22:15,826
What matters is

481
00:22:16,226 --> 00:22:18,106
there is still an opportunity
in front of you now.

482
00:22:18,706 --> 00:22:21,826
I have a professional gaming team.

483
00:22:22,226 --> 00:22:22,746
Invest in me.

484
00:22:25,426 --> 00:22:26,066
But...

485
00:22:26,106 --> 00:22:27,546
No buts.

486
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:29,186
Whatever you invest in, you lose.

487
00:22:29,346 --> 00:22:31,466
If you're not investing,
you're being fooled by girls.

488
00:22:32,346 --> 00:22:34,066
Isn't it nice to do business with me?

489
00:22:34,426 --> 00:22:35,546
Let me finish.

490
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:36,826
After graduation,

491
00:22:36,826 --> 00:22:38,186
why are you getting
more and more irritable?

492
00:22:38,186 --> 00:22:39,466
You used to be so gentle.

493
00:22:39,466 --> 00:22:40,226
Okay, get to the point.

494
00:22:40,586 --> 00:22:40,986
Alright.

495
00:22:41,826 --> 00:22:42,666
The point is,

496
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:45,346
it's not that I can't invest in you.

497
00:22:51,106 --> 00:22:52,826
But my startup fund

498
00:22:53,186 --> 00:22:54,426
is just a little bit left.

499
00:22:55,106 --> 00:22:56,946
I don't know if it's enough
to start a gaming company.

500
00:22:57,306 --> 00:22:58,306
And my mom said,

501
00:22:58,306 --> 00:23:00,066
if this little bit is all gone,

502
00:23:00,586 --> 00:23:02,226
then I'll completely lose my freedom.

503
00:23:02,426 --> 00:23:04,306
Then forget about my career choice

504
00:23:04,306 --> 00:23:04,746
and investment.

505
00:23:04,746 --> 00:23:06,586
I'll have to hand over
even the right to marriage.

506
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:08,826
Are you confident?

507
00:23:12,426 --> 00:23:13,066
Yes.

508
00:23:18,826 --> 00:23:19,226
Okay.

509
00:23:31,546 --> 00:23:31,946
How about it?

510
00:23:32,426 --> 00:23:34,546
The angel investor, my mom,
generously sponsored.

511
00:23:35,306 --> 00:23:36,866
You've seen the conditions here.

512
00:23:38,066 --> 00:23:39,066
There's another one over there.

513
00:23:39,106 --> 00:23:39,666
Right there.

514
00:23:40,346 --> 00:23:41,466
Everybody, let's make do here.

515
00:23:41,946 --> 00:23:44,306
Hu Yingjun, you're so capable.

516
00:23:44,426 --> 00:23:46,546

So starting from today,

521
00:23:53,746 --> 00:23:55,826
we're all brothers and sisters.

537
00:24:42,586 --> 00:24:43,586
We're not making any profit.

538
00:24:44,346 --> 00:24:45,586
I've done my research.

539
00:24:45,746 --> 00:24:47,426
Goods from second-hand shops
are a lot cheaper.

540
00:24:48,066 --> 00:24:49,346
This is our price.

541
00:24:49,546 --> 00:24:50,426
It can't go any lower.

542
00:24:50,826 --> 00:24:51,746

00:25:12,986 --> 00:25:13,866

548
00:25:14,786 --> 00:25:15,906
He's been here twice.

549
00:25:16,226 --> 00:25:17,906
Last time he was considering
whether to sell or not.

554

Okay, 1,000 it is.

555

00:26:12,826 --> 00:26:13,466
I'm short of money.

568
00:26:21,586 --> 00:26:23,066
Are you sure you want to sell this time?

569
00:26:28,226 --> 00:26:29,986
Boss, he's not selling.

570
00:26:30,426 --> 00:26:31,746
I'll buy it. 1,500 yuan.

571
00:26:31,746 --> 00:26:34,576
(Jietong Computer)

572
00:26:34,586 --> 00:26:35,506
Alas.

573
00:26:37,226 --> 00:26:37,946
Thank you,

574
00:26:38,866 --> 00:26:39,746
but don't bother.

575
00:26:40,826 --> 00:26:41,706
I have a condition.

576
00:26:42,586 --> 00:26:44,586
Draw a picture for me later.

577
00:26:44,826 --> 00:26:45,866
If I'm satisfied,

578
00:26:46,346 --> 00:26:47,346
I'll buy it for 1,500 yuan.

579
00:27:21,826 --> 00:27:22,346
I'm done.

580
00:27:26,226 --> 00:27:27,186
You can actually produce

581
00:27:27,186 --> 00:27:28,706
such a good piece so soon.

582
00:27:30,546 --> 00:27:31,826
You're the one I'm looking for.

583
00:27:33,426 --> 00:27:36,146
I don't even know you.

584
00:27:40,866 --> 00:27:41,866
Let me introduce myself.

585
00:27:42,186 --> 00:27:42,826
My name is An Ran.

586
00:27:43,346 --> 00:27:44,346
I make games.

587
00:27:45,186 --> 00:27:46,866
Our team is developing

588
00:27:47,186 --> 00:27:48,586
a romance game for women

589
00:27:48,826 --> 00:27:50,466
and we're currently
in desperate need of a designer.

590
00:27:51,426 --> 00:27:51,826
How's it?

591
00:27:52,186 --> 00:27:53,346
Are you interested in joining us?

592
00:27:58,546 --> 00:28:00,226
If you really need money,

593
00:28:00,586 --> 00:28:01,426
I can advance you

594
00:28:01,426 --> 00:28:02,666
three months' salary.

595
00:28:04,546 --> 00:28:05,346
I can tell

596
00:28:05,586 --> 00:28:06,746
you really love drawing.

597
00:28:07,466 --> 00:28:08,346
Otherwise,

598
00:28:08,466 --> 00:28:10,666
when you were selling your tablet,

599
00:28:10,666 --> 00:28:11,346
you wouldn't

600
00:28:11,826 --> 00:28:12,826
have hesitated so much.

601
00:28:16,346 --> 00:28:19,066
Actually, I also studied fine arts.

602
00:28:19,466 --> 00:28:20,586
I can see

603
00:28:20,586 --> 00:28:22,346
how strong your fundamentals are.

604
00:28:24,066 --> 00:28:25,066
More importantly,

605
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:26,746
I can feel

606
00:28:27,186 --> 00:28:29,586
your wonderful imagination
of the whole world.

607
00:28:32,546 --> 00:28:34,226
Your talent can't be hidden.

608
00:28:34,586 --> 00:28:36,066
You must also want to

609
00:28:36,066 --> 00:28:37,586
make drawing your profession, right?

610
00:28:40,066 --> 00:28:41,586
Actually, we really want

611
00:28:41,866 --> 00:28:42,826
to have

612
00:28:43,066 --> 00:28:44,986
an artist as talented as you.

613
00:28:46,426 --> 00:28:46,826
How's it?

614
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:49,186
Give it a try?

615
00:28:57,706 --> 00:28:59,306
Peng, you are a guest today.

616
00:29:00,826 --> 00:29:02,746
From today on,
he will always be a guest.

617
00:29:03,346 --> 00:29:04,066
Peng, well done.

618
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:05,546
Take your time.

619
00:29:06,946 --> 00:29:07,946
Thanks, boss.

620
00:29:08,586 --> 00:29:09,066
First,

621
00:29:09,426 --> 00:29:10,866
let us welcome our new member,

622
00:29:11,066 --> 00:29:12,346
the designer Peng.

623
00:29:12,586 --> 00:29:13,306
Welcome.

624
00:29:13,426 --> 00:29:13,826
Welcome.

625
00:29:15,826 --> 00:29:17,106
Then I formally announce

626
00:29:17,346 --> 00:29:18,826
our Gaishi Unparalleled

627
00:29:19,066 --> 00:29:20,226
officially sets sail.

628
00:29:24,706 --> 00:29:26,306
Now it's my turn to say a few words.

629
00:29:27,186 --> 00:29:28,226
Anyway, our Gaishi Unparalleled

630
00:29:28,346 --> 00:29:29,226
is like playing a game.

631
00:29:29,826 --> 00:29:31,066
We fight monsters together,

632
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:32,346
open treasure chests together,

633
00:29:32,346 --> 00:29:34,586
and help each other
when there are difficulties.

634
00:29:34,746 --> 00:29:35,546
In short,

635
00:29:35,586 --> 00:29:36,826
no one is allowed to fall behind.

636
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:37,586
Any questions?

637
00:29:37,826 --> 00:29:38,706
No.

638
00:29:38,706 --> 00:29:39,306
Here we go.

639
00:29:39,586 --> 00:29:41,346
Come on.

640
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:41,746
Cheers.

641
00:29:49,106 --> 00:29:50,586
Do you think our company can go public?

642
00:29:51,066 --> 00:29:51,946
No problem.

643
00:29:52,306 --> 00:29:52,866
Miss An is the best.

644
00:29:53,746 --> 00:29:55,586
Then I need to
watch the accounts carefully.

645
00:29:57,106 --> 00:29:58,066
I want to make money.

646
00:30:00,066 --> 00:30:00,586
What did you say?

647
00:30:00,586 --> 00:30:01,426
Louder. I can't hear it.

648
00:30:04,586 --> 00:30:06,746
I want to make money. A lot of money.

649
00:30:06,826 --> 00:30:07,226
Good.

650
00:30:07,466 --> 00:30:07,946
That's right.

651
00:30:11,066 --> 00:30:11,466
Peng,

652
00:30:12,346 --> 00:30:13,066
are you short of money?

653
00:30:14,106 --> 00:30:15,186
Are you? Why?

654
00:30:17,706 --> 00:30:20,666
I haven't paid off my student loans yet.

655
00:30:22,066 --> 00:30:22,586
Peng,

656
00:30:23,586 --> 00:30:24,306
leave it to me.

657
00:30:24,746 --> 00:30:25,706
What do you mean by that?

658
00:30:26,066 --> 00:30:26,826
Leave it to An Ran.

659
00:30:27,066 --> 00:30:27,466
Ran.

660
00:30:27,546 --> 00:30:28,106
- Yes.
- Ran.

661
00:30:28,946 --> 00:30:31,066
Now we have an office,

662
00:30:31,306 --> 00:30:32,866
and we have a full team.

663
00:30:33,826 --> 00:30:34,986
I'm very confident.

664
00:30:35,186 --> 00:30:36,346
I believe Peng's

665
00:30:36,346 --> 00:30:37,986
and all our wishes

666
00:30:38,106 --> 00:30:39,066
will come true.

667
00:30:40,346 --> 00:30:41,586
Our game will sell well.

668
00:30:41,826 --> 00:30:43,066
It will definitely happen.

669
00:30:43,346 --> 00:30:44,066
Come on.

670
00:30:44,466 --> 00:30:45,226
Wait a minute.

671
00:30:46,106 --> 00:30:46,826
Miss An.

672
00:30:47,466 --> 00:30:48,946
Yeah, An Ran, have a drink.

673
00:30:49,106 --> 00:30:49,706
I pour for you.

674
00:30:49,706 --> 00:30:50,226
No.

675
00:30:50,546 --> 00:30:52,586
Drinking with glass
is not her style.

676
00:30:52,866 --> 00:30:53,306
Come on.

677
00:30:55,066 --> 00:30:55,826
Miss An.

678
00:30:56,586 --> 00:30:57,706
I'll show my ambitions today.

679
00:30:58,866 --> 00:30:59,826
Take care.

680
00:31:00,226 --> 00:31:00,746
Careful.

681
00:31:01,066 --> 00:31:01,866
Drink the bottle of it.

682
00:31:02,826 --> 00:31:05,066
Gaishi Unparalleled, go for it!

683
00:31:05,066 --> 00:31:06,466
- Go for it!
- Go for it!

684
00:31:06,466 --> 00:31:07,066
Drink it all.

685
00:31:07,586 --> 00:31:08,346
Come on.

686
00:31:26,066 --> 00:31:27,826
Sorry, you misunderstood.

687
00:31:28,666 --> 00:31:30,986
I have no intention of
leaving Gaishi Unparalleled.

688
00:31:31,666 --> 00:31:33,066
I'm just a finance person.

689
00:31:33,346 --> 00:31:34,546
Poaching me won't be of any use.

690
00:31:34,986 --> 00:31:35,706
I'm sorry,

691
00:31:36,346 --> 00:31:38,586
but I still want to stay
at the company with Miss An.

692
00:31:39,066 --> 00:31:40,226
You probably

693
00:31:40,426 --> 00:31:42,186
don't quite understand
my relationship with Miss An.

694
00:31:42,586 --> 00:31:45,346
I will absolutely not leave
Gaishi Unparalleled.

695
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,226
I have good news for you.

696
00:32:10,546 --> 00:32:11,546
Gaishi Unparalleled

697
00:32:11,546 --> 00:32:13,466
has received a new investment.

698
00:32:21,826 --> 00:32:22,306
What...

699
00:32:23,266 --> 00:32:24,026
What's wrong?

700
00:32:25,106 --> 00:32:25,706
An Ran,

701
00:32:26,586 --> 00:32:29,546
there's something I must tell you.

702
00:32:31,306 --> 00:32:32,306
Is it that serious?

703
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:34,266
Look.

704
00:32:35,666 --> 00:32:38,306
(Job Invitation)
A company offers three times the salary.

705
00:32:39,546 --> 00:32:40,786
You must cherish me.

706
00:32:42,346 --> 00:32:44,266
Someone wants to poach you
with three times the salary?

707
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:47,026
Me too.

708
00:32:48,026 --> 00:32:48,586
And me.

709
00:32:49,106 --> 00:32:50,186
Me as well.

710
00:32:56,706 --> 00:32:57,506
You guys

711
00:32:59,506 --> 00:33:00,106
accepted?

712
00:33:10,106 --> 00:33:11,186
Mr. Hu.

713
00:33:12,946 --> 00:33:13,426
Scared?

714
00:33:13,426 --> 00:33:14,506
What do you think we are?

715
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:19,266
But I did meet with them at noon

716
00:33:19,546 --> 00:33:20,506
and chatted a bit.

717
00:33:21,026 --> 00:33:23,106
I think it's very likely Gaishi Group.

718
00:33:23,746 --> 00:33:24,186
Right, right.

719
00:33:24,466 --> 00:33:25,226
I also think so.

720
00:33:25,746 --> 00:33:27,786
He also knew a lot about
our previous situation.

721
00:33:28,546 --> 00:33:29,946
He must have been
in cahoots with Gaishi Group.

722
00:33:33,266 --> 00:33:33,706
Peng,

723
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:34,866
did you?

724
00:33:36,026 --> 00:33:36,426
What?

725
00:33:41,266 --> 00:33:42,066
It's okay, Peng.

726
00:33:42,546 --> 00:33:43,746
That you didn't receive an email

727
00:33:43,986 --> 00:33:45,346
doesn't mean you're not excellent.

728
00:33:45,506 --> 00:33:47,186
Look, I didn't receive an email either,

729
00:33:47,426 --> 00:33:47,826
right?

730
00:33:51,248 --> 00:33:53,820
(Job Invitation)

731
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:57,946
To thank you all for your love,

732
00:33:58,226 --> 00:33:59,466
tomorrow happens to be Friday,

733
00:34:00,466 --> 00:34:02,266
and we need to start preparing for
the launch next week,

734
00:34:02,746 --> 00:34:04,666
so why don't we take a break this week?

735
00:34:04,666 --> 00:34:05,706
Great, great.

736
00:34:05,706 --> 00:34:06,866
Thank you, Miss An.

737
00:34:08,026 --> 00:34:08,786
Wu,

738
00:34:09,106 --> 00:34:11,026
you're not leaving
for three times the salary, right?

739
00:34:11,026 --> 00:34:11,586
No, no.

740
00:34:11,586 --> 00:34:12,026
Rui.

741
00:34:13,066 --> 00:34:13,986
Hurry up and pack your things.

742
00:34:13,986 --> 00:34:14,666
What are you waiting for?

743
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:16,306
The holiday has begun.

744
00:34:24,306 --> 00:34:25,026
(Mr. Heisha,)

745
00:34:25,026 --> 00:34:26,546
(we had a clear agreement before.)

746
00:34:26,786 --> 00:34:27,986
(It's a simple matter.)

747
00:34:27,986 --> 00:34:30,066
(If you just turn a blind eye,
it will be resolved.)

748
00:34:30,946 --> 00:34:32,146
(If I have to follow the program's)

749
00:34:32,146 --> 00:34:33,506
(voting arrangement,)

750
00:34:33,866 --> 00:34:34,426
(I can't do it.)

751
00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:35,186
(No, no.)

752
00:34:35,186 --> 00:34:36,066
(It's not that exaggerated.)

753
00:34:36,066 --> 00:34:37,266
(Just follow the script.)

754
00:34:37,586 --> 00:34:38,866
(Our script is very clear.)

755
00:34:38,866 --> 00:34:40,266
(Just read it as it is, right?)

756
00:34:40,266 --> 00:34:40,506
(So...)

757
00:34:40,986 --> 00:34:41,626
(So simple.)

758
00:34:41,626 --> 00:34:43,026
(This is a competitive show.)

759
00:34:43,826 --> 00:34:45,786
(I can only vote
according to the rules of the show,)

760
00:34:46,026 --> 00:34:47,306
(for the audience and the contestants.)

761
00:34:47,306 --> 00:34:47,746
(Yes.)

762
00:34:47,746 --> 00:34:48,506
(But)

763
00:34:48,506 --> 00:34:50,226
(we have discussed this many times,)

764
00:34:50,226 --> 00:34:50,706
(haven't we?)

765
00:34:50,826 --> 00:34:52,266
(Don't make it difficult for me.)

766
00:34:52,266 --> 00:34:53,706
(Please don't put me
in a difficult position.)

767
00:34:53,706 --> 00:34:55,746
(It's hard for me
to explain to the higher-ups.)

768
00:34:56,146 --> 00:34:56,826
(Don't hassle me.)

769
00:34:56,826 --> 00:34:57,626
What are you watching?

770
00:34:58,666 --> 00:34:59,306
(Mr. Heisha.)

771
00:34:59,506 --> 00:35:01,106
Have you seen this video?

772
00:35:01,506 --> 00:35:02,506
(So, are you paying for this?)

773
00:35:03,266 --> 00:35:04,546
The comments are all speaking for you.

774
00:35:04,546 --> 00:35:05,626
(We've invited so many guests.)

775
00:35:06,706 --> 00:35:08,186
(I'm sorry, but I can't help you.)

776
00:35:13,506 --> 00:35:14,026
What happened?

777
00:35:17,946 --> 00:35:18,666
I'm so happy.

778
00:35:20,866 --> 00:35:22,066
I feel like everything

779
00:35:22,786 --> 00:35:23,586
is getting better.

780
00:35:29,266 --> 00:35:31,746
Oh, for the character
you were supposed to dub,

781
00:35:31,746 --> 00:35:34,266
Mr. Jiang Shan has done it for you.

782
00:35:35,026 --> 00:35:35,986
However,

783
00:35:36,586 --> 00:35:38,106
we have added

784
00:35:38,106 --> 00:35:39,946
a character that grows with the player.

785
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:42,586
I want you to dub it.

786
00:35:44,426 --> 00:35:45,506
Work overtime again?

787
00:35:46,346 --> 00:35:47,506
I'm serious.

788
00:35:48,706 --> 00:35:50,266
I've been thinking recently,

789
00:35:51,186 --> 00:35:52,266
in fact, in this world,

790
00:35:52,266 --> 00:35:53,746
there is no truly perfect person.

791
00:35:54,266 --> 00:35:55,546
When two people are together,

792
00:35:56,266 --> 00:35:58,106
they have to accept
each other's imperfections,

793
00:35:58,666 --> 00:36:01,026
accompany each other

794
00:36:02,186 --> 00:36:03,306
and then grow together.

795
00:36:06,266 --> 00:36:07,186
This should be

796
00:36:07,186 --> 00:36:08,426
the most important thing

797
00:36:08,586 --> 00:36:09,706
in Fragment Time Boyfriend.

798
00:36:13,746 --> 00:36:15,586
Miss An Ran speaks really well.

799
00:36:16,866 --> 00:36:17,506
But

800
00:36:20,106 --> 00:36:20,986
I still don't want to dub it.

801
00:36:23,466 --> 00:36:25,466
Dear Heisha,

802
00:36:25,466 --> 00:36:26,226
look at you now.

803
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:28,026
You're so in love.

804
00:36:28,026 --> 00:36:29,346
Why don't you help dub it?

805
00:36:29,706 --> 00:36:30,266
Yeah,

806
00:36:30,506 --> 00:36:32,066
I am so in love,

807
00:36:32,586 --> 00:36:33,986
so where do I have time to work?

808
00:36:34,266 --> 00:36:35,946
Are you hungry?
I'll make you something to eat.

809
00:36:35,946 --> 00:36:36,786
You have to do it.

810
00:36:37,186 --> 00:36:38,586
We've already decided on the plan.

811
00:36:38,786 --> 00:36:40,226
I will go to Nan tomorrow.

812
00:36:41,986 --> 00:36:42,986
Then you tell him

813
00:36:43,066 --> 00:36:44,266
that Heisha has not agreed yet.

814
00:36:45,946 --> 00:36:46,346
Alright,

815
00:36:46,946 --> 00:36:47,986
I will go beg him.

816
00:36:49,186 --> 00:36:49,946
You beg him?

817
00:36:50,306 --> 00:36:51,266
You need to beg me.

818
00:36:52,066 --> 00:36:52,946
Will begging you work?

819
00:36:52,946 --> 00:36:53,586
Of course.

820
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:54,506
Begging me is useful.

821
00:36:55,186 --> 00:36:55,906
I will agree.

822
00:36:55,906 --> 00:36:57,066
You won't.

823
00:37:01,426 --> 00:37:03,026
Anyway, the overall promotion plan

824
00:37:03,026 --> 00:37:03,866
is like this.

825
00:37:04,266 --> 00:37:05,346
Good. What do you think?

826
00:37:05,466 --> 00:37:05,866
Sure.

827
00:37:06,586 --> 00:37:07,226
Wait a minute.

828
00:37:08,666 --> 00:37:09,266
What are you here for?

829
00:37:10,546 --> 00:37:10,986
What?

830
00:37:11,026 --> 00:37:11,546
For Miss An.

831
00:37:11,586 --> 00:37:12,466
For what?

832
00:37:12,506 --> 00:37:13,026
For something.

833
00:37:13,026 --> 00:37:14,026
Did you make an appointment?

834
00:37:14,026 --> 00:37:14,586
Did you?

835
00:37:14,586 --> 00:37:14,986
An Ran.

836
00:37:15,026 --> 00:37:15,586
If you...

837
00:37:19,866 --> 00:37:20,866
Let's talk elsewhere.

838
00:37:21,106 --> 00:37:21,666
