that moment of heart flip.)

00:02:04,326 --> 00:02:06,806
(telling her those three words,
"I love you.")

(Let's Be Together Then)

36
00:02:30,686 --> 00:02:31,806
I really didn't expect

37
00:02:32,126 --> 00:02:34,566
that someone would say
our game is not sweet enough.

38
00:02:34,806 --> 00:02:35,806
No way.

39
00:02:35,806 --> 00:02:38,126
It's not sweet?
I'm nearly choked by the sweetness.

40
00:02:38,646 --> 00:02:40,646
I think the players' doubts make sense.

41
00:02:40,926 --> 00:02:44,486
After all, looking around,
there's a room full of singles.

42
00:02:45,046 --> 00:02:45,966
So pitiful.

43
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:48,486
Who are you calling pitiful?
You're not pitiful?

44
00:02:48,966 --> 00:02:51,766
You're pitiful.
Can you be on par with me?

45
00:02:52,326 --> 00:02:53,886
Mr. Hu, Mr. Hu.

46
00:02:54,046 --> 00:02:56,566
You see, our work

47
00:02:56,566 --> 00:02:59,406
is almost done. We only have to
wait for the favorable rate now.

48
00:03:00,006 --> 00:03:02,806
What about letting us go back and rest?

49
00:03:05,606 --> 00:03:06,766
Changfeng is right.

50
00:03:08,366 --> 00:03:10,966
You have been working hard indeed.

51
00:03:10,966 --> 00:03:14,046
Now, put down your work
and hurry back home.

52
00:03:14,046 --> 00:03:14,926
- Weekend...
- Thank you, boss.

53
00:03:14,926 --> 00:03:16,966
- I haven't done my words.
- Thank you, boss.

54
00:03:17,366 --> 00:03:19,926
- Wu.
- Sorry. Wait for me.

55
00:03:33,486 --> 00:03:34,606
Why are you sitting here?

56
00:03:36,366 --> 00:03:38,046
Everyone has been hardworking recently.

57
00:03:38,366 --> 00:03:39,766
So, I let them go.

58
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,166
The weekend starts now.

59
00:03:42,486 --> 00:03:44,326
As for the favorable rate,
let's leave it to fate.

60
00:03:44,966 --> 00:03:46,046
Then why haven't you left yet?

61
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:51,766
I was thinking of
having Miss An buy me a drink.

62
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,046
Let's go. My treat.

63
00:03:55,366 --> 00:03:58,046
So straightforward? Let's go.

64
00:04:03,886 --> 00:04:06,206
The last time you treated me...

65
00:04:06,606 --> 00:04:07,766
It was the last time.

66
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,886
Well said. Such nonsense.

67
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:14,166
Was it that time

68
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,446
when you cheated me into investing?

69
00:04:16,886 --> 00:04:18,366
No. I paid that time too.

70
00:04:18,526 --> 00:04:21,646
- It doesn't matter. Come on.
- Cheers.

71
00:04:28,126 --> 00:04:29,006
Where are you two now?

72
00:04:29,006 --> 00:04:30,126
Hurry up.

73
00:04:41,646 --> 00:04:42,486
Miser An,

74
00:04:44,086 --> 00:04:44,966
tell me,

75
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,486
why did we have to choose to
start a business back then?

76
00:04:48,766 --> 00:04:51,046
If you hadn't broken up with that one,

77
00:04:51,446 --> 00:04:52,646
wouldn't a rich lady life

78
00:04:52,646 --> 00:04:53,766
be pretty comfortable?

79
00:04:54,366 --> 00:04:56,206
Then why didn't you choose

80
00:04:56,206 --> 00:04:57,646
the most comfortable path?

81
00:04:59,206 --> 00:05:00,326
No one can tell.

82
00:05:01,286 --> 00:05:01,966
Cheers.

83
00:05:07,486 --> 00:05:08,606
Tell me,

84
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:10,886
can we make it this time?

85
00:05:13,766 --> 00:05:16,486
Luck is what happens
when preparation meets opportunity.

86
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:19,806
I think

87
00:05:19,806 --> 00:05:22,886
we've been really tough these years.

88
00:05:23,726 --> 00:05:24,846
But being able to

89
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:28,166
continue this journey with you all,

90
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,406
I feel

91
00:05:31,886 --> 00:05:33,446
pretty good.

92
00:05:34,286 --> 00:05:37,366
I'm very happy and at ease.

93
00:05:39,286 --> 00:05:41,326
If this time we really
make Gaishi Unparalleled big,

94
00:05:41,606 --> 00:05:42,486
what are your plans?

95
00:05:43,206 --> 00:05:45,286
I have nothing. What plan could I have?

96
00:05:45,286 --> 00:05:46,406
Think about it. Think about it.

97
00:05:46,686 --> 00:05:48,446
I just think

98
00:05:49,806 --> 00:05:51,926
I hope I can

99
00:05:52,726 --> 00:05:55,006
face everything in life

100
00:05:55,206 --> 00:05:59,886
with ease and happiness.

101
00:06:01,526 --> 00:06:03,406
So you don't plan
to start a romantic relationship?

102
00:06:09,046 --> 00:06:12,406
Miser An, so happy that you are asleep?

103
00:06:22,926 --> 00:06:25,006
Timi.

104
00:06:30,326 --> 00:06:35,286
Hu Yingjun, why did you drink so much?

105
00:06:37,846 --> 00:06:41,086
An Ran, An Ran.

106
00:06:56,406 --> 00:06:58,006
Cheerful.

107
00:07:05,966 --> 00:07:06,806
Leave her alone.

108
00:07:06,806 --> 00:07:08,806
Let's continue it later.
I'll finish this game soon.

109
00:07:14,246 --> 00:07:15,686
An Ran, we're going home.

110
00:07:18,246 --> 00:07:19,206
Let's go, An Ran.

111
00:07:24,246 --> 00:07:26,126
- Watch the stair.
- Leaving?

112
00:07:28,246 --> 00:07:30,806
An Ran, what is...

113
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:33,206
- She's drunk.
- So soon?

114
00:07:33,646 --> 00:07:35,646
Didn't we agree on
a happy four-person gathering?

115
00:07:35,686 --> 00:07:37,246
Your combat power isn't up to par.

116
00:07:37,246 --> 00:07:38,246
Who are you talking about?

117
00:07:38,246 --> 00:07:39,366
You're the one not up to par.

118
00:07:39,366 --> 00:07:40,806
You let An Ran drink so much.

119
00:07:41,126 --> 00:07:42,806
You guys continue.
I'll take her home first.

120
00:07:42,806 --> 00:07:44,766
- Make sure you get her home safely.
- Okay.

121
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:48,806
- Be careful.
- Bye.

122
00:07:50,766 --> 00:07:52,326
Come on, continue.

123
00:07:52,326 --> 00:07:55,006
Come on. Why are you so late?

124
00:07:55,086 --> 00:07:56,326
You didn't arrive until one of us left.

125
00:07:56,486 --> 00:07:58,126
As An Ran is a light drinker,

126
00:07:58,126 --> 00:08:00,086
and you kept drinking with her,
how could she not get drunk?

127
00:08:00,126 --> 00:08:01,446
What? You want to take revenge for her?

128
00:08:01,446 --> 00:08:03,806
Go on. Stop talking nonsense.

129
00:08:15,886 --> 00:08:16,326
Cheers.

130
00:08:20,006 --> 00:08:21,446
One, two, three, four. At least four.

131
00:08:24,486 --> 00:08:25,246
Come on.

132
00:08:32,886 --> 00:08:34,366
We arrived. At the doorstep.

133
00:08:35,486 --> 00:08:36,766
So sleepy.

134
00:08:43,886 --> 00:08:45,326
Why can't I open it?

135
00:08:45,486 --> 00:08:46,646
This is my home.

136
00:08:46,886 --> 00:08:48,766
This isn't my home?

137
00:08:49,526 --> 00:08:51,566
This is your home.

138
00:08:52,126 --> 00:08:54,006
That's my home, right?

139
00:09:08,806 --> 00:09:11,246
Come on. I haven't fallen yet.

140
00:09:14,126 --> 00:09:16,006
I've always been curious.

141
00:09:17,246 --> 00:09:19,246
For someone like you
who are born with a silver spoon

142
00:09:19,886 --> 00:09:21,566
and work by fits and starts,

143
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:25,126
why are you willing to
work with An Ran until now?

144
00:09:25,926 --> 00:09:27,366
Can I be the same as them?

145
00:09:35,886 --> 00:09:39,006
Do you see it? The scar on my eyebrow.

146
00:09:44,326 --> 00:09:45,686
It's quite deep.

147
00:09:46,246 --> 00:09:47,566
I never noticed it before.

148
00:09:48,126 --> 00:09:52,126
How about it?
Is a man more handsome with a scar?

149
00:09:58,206 --> 00:10:02,126
Listen, An Ran and I
are childhood friends.

150
00:10:02,446 --> 00:10:05,806
As you know,
I am tall, handsome, and fair now.

151
00:10:06,686 --> 00:10:10,686
Why are you laughing?
Am I not tall, handsome, or fair?

152
00:10:11,006 --> 00:10:12,006
You

153
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:14,006
are just tall.

154
00:10:15,566 --> 00:10:18,566
But back then, I was just that tall.

155
00:10:19,566 --> 00:10:21,886
Look at An Ran's height now.

156
00:10:22,126 --> 00:10:24,326
Back then, she was
actually taller than me.

157
00:10:25,126 --> 00:10:26,326
We were both naughty.

158
00:10:26,686 --> 00:10:29,806
Naughty kids are prone to getting hurt.

159
00:10:30,446 --> 00:10:31,806
This is a remnant from that time.

160
00:10:32,246 --> 00:10:34,246
We were bullied
by the older kids in the alley.

161
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:36,886
I couldn't beat them down.

162
00:10:38,126 --> 00:10:39,566
But An Ran stood up for me.

163
00:10:42,566 --> 00:10:43,886
Even if she couldn't win,
she would still fight.

164
00:10:46,086 --> 00:10:48,206
I can imagine what she looked like.

165
00:10:51,566 --> 00:10:52,806
In my heart at that time,

166
00:10:56,246 --> 00:10:57,686
An Ran was like Ultraman.

167
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:09,126
Of course I have a way out.

168
00:11:11,886 --> 00:11:13,126
I can always go home
and live comfortably,

169
00:11:13,126 --> 00:11:14,126
being a rich kid, right?

170
00:11:15,246 --> 00:11:16,246
But An Ran can't.

171
00:11:18,006 --> 00:11:18,886
She has no way out.

172
00:11:21,246 --> 00:11:22,446
So I have to stand by her.

173
00:11:24,006 --> 00:11:25,126
I must support her.

174
00:11:35,246 --> 00:11:37,326
- What about you?
- What about me?

175
00:11:37,686 --> 00:11:38,886
Why did you come to Gaishi Unparalleled?

176
00:11:41,566 --> 00:11:43,126
Of course it's because of An Ran.

177
00:11:43,686 --> 00:11:45,446
An Ran asked me to help her.

178
00:11:45,446 --> 00:11:46,686
How could I possibly not come?

179
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:50,086
I'll show you

180
00:11:50,086 --> 00:11:51,446
my photo when I was in school

181
00:11:51,446 --> 00:11:53,566
before I went abroad.
Do you want to see it?

182
00:11:58,126 --> 00:12:00,086
Is it completely

183
00:12:00,246 --> 00:12:02,566
different from now?

184
00:12:03,246 --> 00:12:05,966
You were so good-looking back then.

185
00:12:06,206 --> 00:12:08,006
How did you end up like this?

186
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,126
Back then, I was highly shortsighted,

187
00:12:11,446 --> 00:12:12,486
so I wore glasses,

188
00:12:12,886 --> 00:12:14,446
(and I didn't know how to dress up.)

189
00:12:15,446 --> 00:12:17,926
(I lacked confidence in everything.)

190
00:12:18,086 --> 00:12:19,646
(I was always ready to give up.)

191
00:12:38,766 --> 00:12:41,086
Hello, do you need me?

192
00:12:42,126 --> 00:12:45,566
I-I saw your painting

193
00:12:46,006 --> 00:12:48,006
at the exhibition.

194
00:12:48,326 --> 00:12:49,686
I thought it was excellent.

195
00:12:50,246 --> 00:12:53,686
I've always failed to find
a student who paints in this style,

196
00:12:54,326 --> 00:12:56,446
so I wanted to learn about

197
00:12:57,006 --> 00:12:58,446
how you learned it.

198
00:12:58,886 --> 00:13:00,326
You like my painting?

199
00:13:01,126 --> 00:13:02,006
Thank you.

200
00:13:02,446 --> 00:13:03,566
What's your name?

201
00:13:04,886 --> 00:13:08,246
My name is Bai Mengyao.

202
00:13:09,886 --> 00:13:11,446
So you are Bai Mengyao?

203
00:13:11,886 --> 00:13:13,446
I also really like your paintings.

204
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:15,246
Really?

205
00:13:15,446 --> 00:13:16,566
Among the row at the exhibition,

206
00:13:16,566 --> 00:13:18,126
your painting was the first I noticed.

207
00:13:18,366 --> 00:13:20,366
You could produce such a personal style

208
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,246
just in your first year.

209
00:13:22,246 --> 00:13:24,006
Your talent is really strong.

210
00:13:24,326 --> 00:13:25,206
Thank you.

211
00:13:25,926 --> 00:13:28,366
(I didn't expect
to hit it off with An Ran)

212
00:13:28,886 --> 00:13:30,086
(and become friends with her.)

213
00:13:31,566 --> 00:13:34,486
(Back then, we often drew together.)

214
00:13:42,006 --> 00:13:44,886
Mengyao, Mengyao, here.

215
00:13:47,446 --> 00:13:48,806
I wasted all this.

216
00:13:49,446 --> 00:13:51,326
This brand of paint is expensive.

217
00:13:54,006 --> 00:13:54,446
Here.

218
00:13:54,806 --> 00:13:55,566
Use mine.

219
00:13:57,446 --> 00:13:58,246
Thank you, Ran.

220
00:13:58,566 --> 00:14:00,686
I'll return it to you
when I buy the same one as yours.

221
00:14:01,126 --> 00:14:02,246
It's just a tube of paint.

222
00:14:02,246 --> 00:14:03,446
Why are you so formal?

223
00:14:12,446 --> 00:14:13,126
Ran,

224
00:14:13,446 --> 00:14:14,446
actually,

225
00:14:14,566 --> 00:14:16,686
I received the admission letter
from a French school

226
00:14:16,686 --> 00:14:17,926
yesterday.

227
00:14:18,246 --> 00:14:19,126
Really?

228
00:14:19,686 --> 00:14:20,566
That's great!

229
00:14:22,806 --> 00:14:25,806
But why do you look so gloomy?

230
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:28,566
Isn't that school your dream school?

231
00:14:30,886 --> 00:14:33,566
I-I may not be able to go.

232
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:38,446
- Why?
- I didn't get a scholarship.

233
00:14:44,686 --> 00:14:47,446
So how much are you short now?

234
00:14:50,126 --> 00:14:52,806
My family helped me put together some,

235
00:14:53,686 --> 00:14:56,806
and I saved some these years,

236
00:14:57,366 --> 00:14:58,806
but I'm still tens of thousands short.

237
00:15:02,126 --> 00:15:03,886
I see. I've saved fifty thousand.

238
00:15:04,006 --> 00:15:05,086
Take it, alright?

239
00:15:06,806 --> 00:15:09,846
Ran, where did you get so much money?

240
00:15:10,806 --> 00:15:12,126
From previous competitions,

241
00:15:12,366 --> 00:15:14,206
and selling paintings.

242
00:15:14,606 --> 00:15:16,366
Not much. Just fifty thousand.

243
00:15:16,886 --> 00:15:18,126
I hope it can help you.

244
00:15:18,806 --> 00:15:19,806
No, no.

245
00:15:20,606 --> 00:15:22,486
How can I take your money?

246
00:15:22,486 --> 00:15:24,086
And you're about to graduate.

247
00:15:24,246 --> 00:15:25,886
What if you have an emergency?

248
00:15:27,606 --> 00:15:32,126
Forget it. As it's not mine,

249
00:15:33,006 --> 00:15:34,006
there's no use thinking about it.

250
00:15:34,886 --> 00:15:37,246
I won't think about it. I won't go.

251
00:15:42,446 --> 00:15:44,366
Mengyao, listen to me.

252
00:15:44,726 --> 00:15:46,886
Haven't you always dreamed of becoming

253
00:15:46,886 --> 00:15:47,966
a great painter?

254
00:15:49,206 --> 00:15:50,886
I think this trip to France

255
00:15:50,886 --> 00:15:52,846
is a very, very good opportunity.

256
00:15:53,246 --> 00:15:54,566
You're so talented.

257
00:15:54,686 --> 00:15:56,486
You can definitely progress soon.

258
00:15:57,366 --> 00:16:00,486
If you give up
due to a little difficulty,

259
00:16:00,966 --> 00:16:02,206
that would be a pity.

260
00:16:04,566 --> 00:16:07,806
But dreams are expensive.

261
00:16:09,206 --> 00:16:13,326
Someone like me can't afford it.

262
00:16:16,446 --> 00:16:18,606
Dreams indeed are expensive,

263
00:16:20,366 --> 00:16:21,366
but they're also worth it.

264
00:16:23,126 --> 00:16:26,006
You are worth it too.

265
00:16:30,206 --> 00:16:31,246
Is that true, Ran?

266
00:16:36,126 --> 00:16:37,086
For the fifty thousand,

267
00:16:37,086 --> 00:16:38,206
you take it first.

268
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:40,966
I think it should be enough
for half a year's living expenses.

269
00:16:43,606 --> 00:16:46,846
As for tuition, you can
apply for a study abroad loan.

270
00:16:47,086 --> 00:16:48,806
If there are various procedures,

271
00:16:48,846 --> 00:16:50,486
you can come to me.
I'm still here in the country.

272
00:16:51,726 --> 00:16:53,806
Cross the bridge when you come to it.

273
00:17:01,246 --> 00:17:04,446
Then I will definitely study hard

274
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:05,846
and work part-time.

275
00:17:06,006 --> 00:17:08,246
As soon as I find a way to make money,

276
00:17:08,366 --> 00:17:09,726
I will repay you first.

277
00:17:11,486 --> 00:17:12,366
Okay.

278
00:17:12,886 --> 00:17:15,606
Remember to come back
when you finish your study.

279
00:17:16,086 --> 00:17:17,126
When you have money,

280
00:17:17,366 --> 00:17:18,446
you could sponsor me.

281
00:17:18,806 --> 00:17:20,126
Buy me ten boxes of paint.

282
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:22,686
I'll buy you a hundred boxes.

283
00:17:23,566 --> 00:17:25,726
You just need to study

284
00:17:26,006 --> 00:17:27,006
and chase your dreams.

285
00:17:27,966 --> 00:17:29,886
If you have anything else,
just come to me anytime.

286
00:17:39,086 --> 00:17:41,246
At that time,
An Ran always encouraged me.

287
00:17:42,846 --> 00:17:46,486
It was a ray of light
when I was a nobody.

288
00:17:50,726 --> 00:17:54,606
By the way, before going to France,

289
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:57,606
I had never been in love.
Can you believe it?

290
00:17:58,086 --> 00:17:59,246
No way.

291
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:04,486
It's true. I had a crush
on a senior for four years.

292
00:18:04,886 --> 00:18:07,606
I didn't dare to say I liked him
until we graduated.

293
00:18:07,606 --> 00:18:09,086
I was afraid that he would say,

294
00:18:09,606 --> 00:18:10,726
he doesn't like me.

295
00:18:12,126 --> 00:18:13,606
We're quite alike in this respect.

296
00:18:14,366 --> 00:18:16,366
The people I like don't like me either.

297
00:18:16,726 --> 00:18:17,966
They just like my family's money.

298
00:18:19,606 --> 00:18:21,726
Are they blind?

299
00:18:21,966 --> 00:18:23,686
I'm so handsome,
but why don't they like me?

300
00:18:25,006 --> 00:18:31,126
Handsome? As for that, I didn't see it.

301
00:18:31,726 --> 00:18:32,966
But as for cuteness,

302
00:18:33,206 --> 00:18:35,126
I did see a bit today.

303
00:18:37,686 --> 00:18:38,366
Really?

304
00:18:46,366 --> 00:18:47,846
Come on. The last bite.

305
00:18:54,246 --> 00:18:54,966
Childish.

306
00:20:01,046 --> 00:20:04,966
(It's said dreams
are expensive in this city.)

307
00:20:06,006 --> 00:20:07,366
Look, what's this?

308
00:20:09,006 --> 00:20:11,566
(It's delicious,
and the pepper flavor is so strong.)

309
00:20:12,486 --> 00:20:15,486
(You bet. I'm really your fan.)

310
00:20:15,726 --> 00:20:17,686
(I know the origin of your name.)

311
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:21,726
(I can't. I haven't
finished my proposal yet.)

312
00:20:23,486 --> 00:20:24,406
In this universe,

313
00:20:24,406 --> 00:20:26,526
you own the twenty-fifth hour

314
00:20:26,526 --> 00:20:28,526
beyond the twenty-four hours.

315
00:20:29,326 --> 00:20:30,286
Are you alright?

316
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:35,886
Awesome. Awesome.

317
00:20:44,846 --> 00:20:50,846

00:25:50,406 --> 00:25:53,006
they can't stay
in the best moment forever.

366
00:25:53,326 --> 00:25:54,446
They always worry

367
00:25:54,806 --> 00:25:57,326
that it may turn bad again
the next second.

368
00:25:58,366 --> 00:25:59,246
I think

369
00:25:59,846 --> 00:26:01,006
I no longer have the energy

370
00:26:01,006 --> 00:26:03,246
to face the ups and downs in love,

371
00:26:03,846 --> 00:26:06,246
or a complete failure.

When did you go to bed last night?

384
00:27:02,126 --> 00:27:03,566
Don't mention it.

385
00:27:03,846 --> 00:27:05,846
I have meetings all day today.

386
00:27:05,966 --> 00:27:09,366
But Hu Yingjun still asked me
to have dinner tonight. How dare he?

387
00:27:09,366 --> 00:27:11,566
Just waiting for Yan Yue now.
Why hasn't he come yet?

388
00:27:14,206 --> 00:27:15,206
Yan Yue is coming?

389
00:27:17,086 --> 00:27:18,086
He didn't tell you?

390
00:27:21,686 --> 00:27:23,726
- You two...
- Where's Hu Yingjun?

391
00:27:26,326 --> 00:27:27,406
He went to the bathroom.

392
00:27:28,846 --> 00:27:30,086
You two came together?

393
00:27:36,206 --> 00:27:37,566
- There is something wrong with you.
- There is something wrong with you.

394
00:27:37,966 --> 00:27:39,086
- You go first.
- You go first.

395
00:27:40,046 --> 00:27:41,326
Alright, I'll say it.

396
00:27:41,806 --> 00:27:43,326
Actually, it's just that

397
00:27:44,326 --> 00:27:46,686
I suddenly feel that silly boy

398
00:27:47,406 --> 00:27:48,446
isn't that silly.

399
00:27:49,406 --> 00:27:51,966
He's quite cute and I can date him.

400
00:27:55,446 --> 00:27:58,086
You're actually going after Hu Yingjun?

401
00:27:58,566 --> 00:28:01,326
Wait, didn't you find him annoying?

402
00:28:02,326 --> 00:28:03,726
I just think,

403
00:28:04,566 --> 00:28:06,566
after these days staying with him,

404
00:28:07,086 --> 00:28:09,086
he's different from other guys I know.

405
00:28:09,406 --> 00:28:10,326
He is different indeed.

406
00:28:10,726 --> 00:28:12,206
- Do you know that feeling?
- I do.

407
00:28:12,206 --> 00:28:14,206
Believe it or not, in four days,

408
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:17,446
no, three days,

409
00:28:17,846 --> 00:28:18,846
I'll get him.

410
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,846
Well. Yaoyao, you have to be prepared.

411
00:28:21,846 --> 00:28:24,086
Hu Yingjun is not that easy to get.

412
00:28:24,566 --> 00:28:26,206
Wait for my good news in three days.

413
00:28:26,206 --> 00:28:27,966
- Alright.
- Okay.

414
00:28:28,326 --> 00:28:29,326
Let's not just talk about me.

415
00:28:29,566 --> 00:28:32,206
What about you? What happened?

416
00:28:34,966 --> 00:28:37,086
Nothing.

417
00:28:39,446 --> 00:28:41,606
You were so drunk that night.

418
00:28:41,606 --> 00:28:43,326
Something must have happened
when you got home.

419
00:28:46,566 --> 00:28:47,326
Tell me.

420
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:53,606
- Come on.
- That night.

421
00:28:54,326 --> 00:28:55,926
After I got home...

422
00:29:03,086 --> 00:29:04,446
Here's the story.

423
00:29:04,846 --> 00:29:05,806
Wait, An Ran,

424
00:29:06,046 --> 00:29:07,726
you're too heartless.

425
00:29:09,566 --> 00:29:10,606
I think

426
00:29:12,166 --> 00:29:14,206
I'm really not ready yet.

427
00:29:15,526 --> 00:29:17,446
Besides, how old is he?

428
00:29:17,446 --> 00:29:18,846
Has he thought it through?

429
00:29:20,086 --> 00:29:21,806
Actually, at first, I also thought

430
00:29:21,806 --> 00:29:22,846
Yan Yue was too young.

431
00:29:23,206 --> 00:29:25,686
But now I think, none of these matter.

432
00:29:26,086 --> 00:29:28,846
What matters is
whether you like him or not.

433
00:29:33,326 --> 00:29:36,526
- I don't know.
- How can you not know?

434
00:29:37,406 --> 00:29:38,806
Is this liking?

435
00:29:39,606 --> 00:29:41,686
Isn't this being together day and night?

436
00:29:43,966 --> 00:29:45,566
It's been a long time
since I fell for someone.

437
00:29:45,566 --> 00:29:46,846
I really have no idea.

438
00:29:47,806 --> 00:29:50,806
If you are uncertain,
you have to figure it out.

439
00:29:50,806 --> 00:29:53,526
An Ran, I'm waiting for you
to bloom anew.

440
00:29:53,806 --> 00:29:55,526
I'm not an iron tree.

441
00:29:55,966 --> 00:29:58,206
No, I really think...

442
00:29:59,166 --> 00:30:01,326
The bathroom is too small.
I queued for a long time.

443
00:30:04,326 --> 00:30:05,446
How many rounds did you play?

444
00:30:07,086 --> 00:30:09,326
No. What rounds? I didn't play.

445
00:30:10,086 --> 00:30:12,686
Why are you eating alone?
Order some more.

446
00:30:13,086 --> 00:30:15,406
Alright, what do you want to eat?
I'll order for you.

447
00:30:15,686 --> 00:30:18,486
- Anything is fine.
- Anything is the hardest to serve.

448
00:30:29,937 --> 00:30:35,606
(Yan Yue)

449
00:30:35,606 --> 00:30:38,406
- Hello?
- Is that Miss An Ran?

450
00:30:40,206 --> 00:30:41,046
Yes.

451
00:30:41,526 --> 00:30:43,966
Hello, this is
the Municipal People's Hospital.

452
00:30:44,646 --> 00:30:47,686
- Yan Yue had a car accident and is unconscious now.
- What?

453
00:30:53,166 --> 00:30:54,046
(Don't panic.)

454
00:30:54,526 --> 00:30:56,766
(Mr. Yan Yue is unconscious,
which might be transient.)

455
00:30:57,246 --> 00:31:00,046
(It's a temporary loss of consciousness
caused by the accident.)

456
00:31:00,406 --> 00:31:01,526
(But for the exact condition,)

457
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,926
(we need to do further examination.)

458
00:31:03,406 --> 00:31:05,006
(We need someone to sign
at the hospital.)

459
00:31:05,526 --> 00:31:07,126
(Since you're his most recent contact,)

460
00:31:07,406 --> 00:31:09,126
(could you please come over?)

461
00:31:24,446 --> 00:31:26,446
A boy who had a car accident
was taken in.

462
00:31:26,446 --> 00:31:28,726
His name is Yan Yue.
Could you help me check where he is?

463
00:31:29,206 --> 00:31:30,366
How is his condition?

464
00:31:30,606 --> 00:31:32,206
- He's in bed 37.
- Thank you.

465
00:31:37,806 --> 00:31:39,086
Where is bed 37?

466
00:31:39,566 --> 00:31:40,526
It's over there.

467
00:31:51,215 --> 00:31:53,447
(Beds 36 & 37)

468
00:32:06,366 --> 00:32:07,366
Son.

469
00:32:08,046 --> 00:32:10,166
Son, wake up.

470
00:32:10,646 --> 00:32:13,166
Son, son!

471
00:32:42,206 --> 00:32:43,006
An Ran.

472
00:33:14,046 --> 00:33:15,166
What happened to you?

473
00:33:16,046 --> 00:33:17,286
You scared me off.

474
00:33:21,046 --> 00:33:23,326
You scared me off.

475
00:33:30,406 --> 00:33:32,286
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't know.

476
00:33:32,806 --> 00:33:36,126
- It's okay.
- Why are you still laughing?

477
00:33:43,606 --> 00:33:45,566
Were you looking for me?

478
00:33:46,006 --> 00:33:47,526
Isn't that obvious?

479
00:33:49,766 --> 00:33:52,286
- What exactly happened?
- Nothing.

480
00:33:52,726 --> 00:33:56,326
I just kissed a car on the way.

481
00:33:57,606 --> 00:33:59,286
You still joked about it, huh?

482
00:33:59,606 --> 00:34:01,326
The doctor said you were unconscious.

483
00:34:01,726 --> 00:34:04,086
- Does it hurt?
- No.

484
00:34:04,326 --> 00:34:06,286
Are there any other injuries?

485
00:34:06,886 --> 00:34:09,086
Did you get your head checked?

486
00:34:09,086 --> 00:34:10,326
Are your legs injured?

487
00:34:10,566 --> 00:34:12,646
What about your ribs, and legs?

488
00:34:13,366 --> 00:34:15,286
Tell me where you're hurt.

489
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:17,046
If you're uncomfortable,
I'll come and keep you company.

490
00:34:17,086 --> 00:34:18,006
Be my girlfriend.

491
00:34:21,806 --> 00:34:24,526
I like you. I'm serious.

492
00:34:25,926 --> 00:34:27,326
