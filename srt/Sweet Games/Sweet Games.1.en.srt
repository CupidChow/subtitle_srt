(31 years old,)

(a once popular girl in school,)

27
00:02:02,114 --> 00:02:04,114
(an entrepreneur in a small city.)

28

getting up early to dress up.)

(She takes a shower and curls her hair,)

30
00:02:08,834 --> 00:02:10,394
(keeping herself busy.)

31
00:02:11,034 --> 00:02:13,674
(But being decent matters
more than anything else.)

32
00:02:18,554 --> 00:02:20,954
(She always gets anxious
before meeting clients)

33
00:02:21,394 --> 00:02:23,754
(and finds relief
by putting her hands into rice.)

34
00:02:24,234 --> 00:02:26,914
(She dreams of being a composed person.)

35
00:02:26,914 --> 00:02:28,034
Hello.

36
00:02:28,074 --> 00:02:29,074
(She can act.)

37
00:02:30,634 --> 00:02:31,514
Sorry.

38
00:02:32,914 --> 00:02:34,514
(She pretends to be strong,)

39
00:02:34,794 --> 00:02:37,594
(but becomes casual when getting home.)

40
00:02:38,514 --> 00:02:40,114
(She is a double-faced girl.)

41
00:02:40,794 --> 00:02:43,234
(She seems astute but careless inside.)

42

of zero-return entrepreneurship.)

Since 2017,

50
00:03:10,074 --> 00:03:12,234
they have been interested in this case.

51
00:03:12,394 --> 00:03:14,914
The creative team never meets clients
for investments,

52
00:03:14,914 --> 00:03:16,074
because they believe

53
00:03:16,074 --> 00:03:17,234
only perfect products

54
00:03:17,234 --> 00:03:18,674
can be launched to the market.

55
00:03:19,034 --> 00:03:21,194
Things will be tricky
if you hesitate now,

56
00:03:21,474 --> 00:03:25,074
because now is the best time to enter.

57
00:03:25,074 --> 00:03:26,514
A good opportunity is not

about the right time,
place, and people,

59
00:03:29,114 --> 00:03:31,394
but about a moment
when you suddenly realize

60
00:03:31,674 --> 00:03:33,954
you can create miracles.

61
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:36,354
While others are eagerly waiting,

62
00:03:36,354 --> 00:03:38,794
we have already created possibilities.

63
00:03:39,674 --> 00:03:41,674
Among four men, there's always one

64
00:03:41,954 --> 00:03:43,674
that suits your love needs.

65
00:03:44,394 --> 00:03:46,234
You could be in love all year.

66
00:03:46,234 --> 00:03:49,474
Fantasies of most women
about love will be satisfied.

No.

Every penny you invest

72
00:03:59,074 --> 00:04:01,394

74
00:04:02,634 --> 00:04:04,794
Your way of inviting investment

75
00:04:04,794 --> 00:04:06,474
is now outdated.

76
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:08,634
I've been there.

77
00:04:08,794 --> 00:04:10,834
I have another project.

78
00:04:11,194 --> 00:04:12,394
A good project.

79
00:04:12,514 --> 00:04:13,234

We're here.

83
00:04:25,314 --> 00:04:25,914
How much to invest?

84
00:04:26,514 --> 00:04:27,114
Thirty.

00:04:29,074 --> 00:04:29,794
How will you pay?

86
00:04:33,074 --> 00:04:35,674
(But there are too many dreams
in this world,)

87
00:04:36,074 --> 00:04:37,514
(few of which come true.)

Yes, it's me.

I'll move tomorrow.

95
00:05:06,914 --> 00:05:08,514
Okay, thanks. See you tomorrow.

Good evening, everyone.

101

Welcome to Heisha Time.

(City dwellers are always moving.)

106
00:06:05,794 --> 00:06:06,954
(Many people)

107
00:06:06,954 --> 00:06:09,354
(are used to feeling secure
by being busy)

108
00:06:10,514 --> 00:06:13,194
(and cultivating happiness
by consuming it.)

109
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:16,074
But don't make your life worthwhile

110
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:18,194
(with your blood and sweat.)

111
00:06:19,114 --> 00:06:20,834
(Just be brave in adversity.)

112
00:06:21,474 --> 00:06:24,394
(Perhaps it's just not your time yet.)

113
00:06:24,794 --> 00:06:27,034
(Stop and learn to wait.)

114
00:06:28,074 --> 00:06:28,914
(You will find)

115
00:06:29,314 --> 00:06:30,594
(there are sounds of breezes,)

116
00:06:31,034 --> 00:06:32,074
(birds, and insects)

117
00:06:32,354 --> 00:06:33,794
(waiting for you to listen.)

118
00:06:43,274 --> 00:06:45,914
(Today we're sharing a film,)

00:06:45,914 --> 00:06:46,994
(Survive in the Wild.)

120
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,594
(I admire the protagonist Alex)

121
00:06:50,594 --> 00:06:51,594

122
00:06:54,234 --> 00:06:56,034
(That is it for today.)

123
00:06:57,114 --> 00:06:58,354
(Thanks for listening.)

124
00:06:58,914 --> 00:07:00,434
(See you tomorrow.)

125
00:07:03,114 --> 00:07:05,914
You've turned down
three dubbing projects this month.

126
00:07:06,034 --> 00:07:07,354
If you keep doing this,

127
00:07:07,354 --> 00:07:08,994
I as your agent
will have no money for food,

128
00:07:09,274 --> 00:07:10,994
and you'll let the audience down.

129
00:07:12,114 --> 00:07:14,554
Take a look at the project plan.

130
00:07:15,434 --> 00:07:17,434
(Jiang Shan can dub it, but I can't.)

131
00:07:23,914 --> 00:07:25,794
Yueyue, are you busy now?

132
00:07:26,034 --> 00:07:28,234
I'm calling to tell you

133
00:07:28,794 --> 00:07:30,474
the new tenant will move in tomorrow.

134
00:07:30,674 --> 00:07:32,474
Remember to sign the contract.

135
00:07:33,034 --> 00:07:34,474
It's a single girl.

136
00:07:34,474 --> 00:07:35,474
She's very quiet.

137
00:07:35,474 --> 00:07:37,114
She definitely meets
your tenant standards.

138
00:07:37,354 --> 00:07:37,914
Got it.

139
00:07:38,554 --> 00:07:39,344
That's all.

140
00:07:39,794 --> 00:07:40,914
Have an early rest.

141
00:07:41,154 --> 00:07:42,114
Don't stay up late.

142
00:07:42,354 --> 00:07:42,914

144
00:08:23,154 --> 00:08:26,154
Why on the weekend.
Come on. It's killing me.

145
00:08:45,114 --> 00:08:45,674
Good morning.

146
00:08:46,714 --> 00:08:47,714
Why are you here?

147
00:08:50,114 --> 00:08:51,354
Isn't it time for you

148
00:08:52,234 --> 00:08:52,994
to pay me?

149
00:08:53,674 --> 00:08:54,594
Senior.

150
00:09:03,674 --> 00:09:05,474
No, Liu.

151
00:09:05,474 --> 00:09:06,994
(One day ago)
We don't lack investment.

152
00:09:06,994 --> 00:09:08,434
(One day ago)
What we lack is an investor

153
00:09:08,434 --> 00:09:10,114
with your foresight.

154
00:09:10,874 --> 00:09:12,154
Through our resource integration,

155
00:09:12,154 --> 00:09:14,114
we can achieve a larger market share.

156
00:09:14,674 --> 00:09:16,434
There's no problem making a return.

157
00:09:16,594 --> 00:09:18,994
We can talk about the specific profits.

158
00:09:20,594 --> 00:09:21,274
Miss.

159
00:09:21,914 --> 00:09:23,674
Before doing your big projects,

160
00:09:23,874 --> 00:09:25,554
please pay me 500 yuan
for cartage first.

161
00:09:27,714 --> 00:09:29,794
Alright, I'll wait for your news.

162
00:09:38,114 --> 00:09:39,274
Can I pay in installments?

163
00:09:39,474 --> 00:09:42,234
Can I help you move in installments?

164
00:09:44,794 --> 00:09:45,474
Son,

165
00:09:45,474 --> 00:09:47,594
she has paid one month's rent.

166
00:09:47,714 --> 00:09:49,674
And she will pay the rest
after moving in.

167
00:09:49,874 --> 00:09:50,914
You collect it for me.

168
00:09:50,914 --> 00:09:52,594
You do it yourself.

169
00:09:52,594 --> 00:09:53,994
I don't deal with strangers.

170
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:55,234
I've been too busy.

171
00:09:55,234 --> 00:09:56,594
Do me a favor, son.

172
00:09:57,034 --> 00:09:58,594
She's here. I got to go.

173
00:09:59,114 --> 00:10:00,714
Move out of the way.

174
00:10:00,994 --> 00:10:03,274
Pay up first, or we won't help you move.

175
00:10:03,594 --> 00:10:04,914
We agreed the fee was 300.

176
00:10:04,914 --> 00:10:07,234
Didn't I confirm
with you again and again?

177
00:10:07,594 --> 00:10:09,114
You have so many large items.

178
00:10:09,114 --> 00:10:11,274
Based on the rules,
you have to pay extra.

179
00:10:11,434 --> 00:10:13,234
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

180
00:10:13,234 --> 00:10:15,434
You're hiking up the price now.

181
00:10:15,714 --> 00:10:17,154
We're not targeting you.

182
00:10:17,154 --> 00:10:19,874
Anyone has to pay extra
if there're more than three large items.

183
00:10:20,114 --> 00:10:21,714
You have so many large items.

184
00:10:21,714 --> 00:10:23,594
It's not easy to move them up, right?

185
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:27,154
Sir, please be considerate.

186
00:10:27,154 --> 00:10:28,234
Okay?

187
00:10:28,714 --> 00:10:30,154
Can you let me in first?

188
00:10:30,914 --> 00:10:32,234
Sorry, I'll solve it right away.

189
00:10:32,234 --> 00:10:33,714
Miss, 500 yuan.

190
00:10:33,714 --> 00:10:34,914
I'll work right away.

191
00:10:34,914 --> 00:10:37,434
500? You are charging a lot.

192
00:10:37,434 --> 00:10:39,234
If that's the case, I won't move.

193
00:10:40,234 --> 00:10:40,874
Do it now.

194
00:10:44,274 --> 00:10:45,274
Thanks.

195
00:10:45,994 --> 00:10:46,594
Move.

196
00:10:48,434 --> 00:10:49,914
Who are you?

197
00:10:50,874 --> 00:10:51,474
Hello.

198
00:10:52,594 --> 00:10:53,914
The house you rent belongs to my family.

199
00:10:54,234 --> 00:10:55,114
I live next door to you.

200
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:56,474
Move faster, please.

201
00:10:56,714 --> 00:10:58,554
Pay me 500 yuan back
along with your rent.

202
00:10:58,554 --> 00:11:00,994
No, we can't mix things up.

203
00:11:01,114 --> 00:11:02,874
He's clearly jacking up the price.

204
00:11:02,874 --> 00:11:04,554
Besides, you gave him the money.

205
00:11:04,594 --> 00:11:06,034
Why should I pay you back?

206
00:11:06,034 --> 00:11:07,034
You don't have to.

207
00:11:07,274 --> 00:11:08,554
But you move out now.

208
00:11:14,994 --> 00:11:16,234
We keep moving?

209
00:11:16,594 --> 00:11:17,114
Yes.

210
00:11:17,114 --> 00:11:17,914
Come on.

211
00:11:25,674 --> 00:11:26,554
Do you know me?

212
00:11:28,914 --> 00:11:29,714
Just move.

213
00:11:33,554 --> 00:11:35,274
I can't forget a handsome man.

214
00:11:38,794 --> 00:11:40,034
So strange.

215
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:09,674
Mr. Landlord, please come in.

216
00:12:09,914 --> 00:12:10,874
It's a bit messy.

217
00:12:14,274 --> 00:12:15,114
Please have a seat.

218
00:12:17,554 --> 00:12:19,434
You need to sign this.

219
00:12:20,014 --> 00:12:22,094

and three months' rent in advance.

220

223

Okay.

224
00:12:47,034 --> 00:12:48,474
(I have to pay the rent today.)

225
00:12:50,034 --> 00:12:51,274
You graduated from Bowen University?

226
00:12:53,434 --> 00:12:54,234
You know me?

227
00:12:56,994 --> 00:12:58,594
Your mom told me.

228
00:12:58,914 --> 00:13:00,874
So did I. What a coincidence.

229
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,274
Which year were you enrolled in?

230
00:13:02,274 --> 00:13:03,994
You look so young.

231
00:13:03,994 --> 00:13:05,034
What's your major?

232
00:13:05,794 --> 00:13:08,354
(Is she trying to avoid paying?)

233
00:13:09,114 --> 00:13:10,594
(Has he seen me through?)

234
00:13:22,354 --> 00:13:24,594
We're both from the same school.

235
00:13:24,714 --> 00:13:25,914
Could you delay the rent

236
00:13:26,234 --> 00:13:28,434
for a few days?

237
00:13:31,714 --> 00:13:33,114
How many days?

238
00:13:44,474 --> 00:13:46,034
Will you go
to the alumni meeting tomorrow?

239
00:13:49,794 --> 00:13:50,714
I'm a bit busy.

240
00:13:51,714 --> 00:13:52,674
Mr. Landlord.

241
00:13:52,674 --> 00:13:54,354
You can do your things now.

242
00:13:54,874 --> 00:13:56,114
Thank you.

243
00:13:56,114 --> 00:13:58,434
Don't worry. I will pay the rent.

244
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:01,914
Hello, how's it going?

245
00:14:01,914 --> 00:14:04,034
Miss Lan will
attend the alumni meeting tomorrow.

246
00:14:04,914 --> 00:14:07,474
I'll rely the investment thing on you.

247
00:14:07,474 --> 00:14:08,234
Don't worry.

248
00:14:08,234 --> 00:14:09,474
But I heard she's quite busy.

249
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:11,154
She's not interested
in rookies like us.

250
00:14:11,154 --> 00:14:12,154
No worries.

251
00:14:12,154 --> 00:14:14,154
We'll find investors tomorrow.

252
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:14,994
Thanks, Changfeng.

253
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,994
Miss An, I'm really sorry.

254
00:14:22,234 --> 00:14:23,474
I've discussed with my leader.

255
00:14:23,474 --> 00:14:25,354
Your money can't be withdrawn

256
00:14:25,594 --> 00:14:26,554
until next month.

257
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:28,914
I don't need the interest.

258
00:14:28,914 --> 00:14:30,434
You help me withdraw it all.

259
00:14:30,434 --> 00:14:31,714
I need money badly.

260
00:14:31,714 --> 00:14:32,594
Please be patient.

261
00:14:32,594 --> 00:14:33,914
It's not an ample sum

262
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:34,874
and not due yet.

263

00:19:44,154 --> 00:19:46,274
He wasn't talkative in university.

376
00:19:46,514 --> 00:19:49,104
Yan Yue, they say you're not outgoing.

377
00:19:52,514 --> 00:19:53,114
He never changes.

378
00:19:55,474 --> 00:19:57,874
It's a female growing game.

379
00:19:58,714 --> 00:20:01,354
Sounds pretty interesting.

380
00:20:01,914 --> 00:20:03,514
Let me guess.

381
00:20:03,754 --> 00:20:05,154
You must

382
00:20:05,514 --> 00:20:06,874
have a boyfriend, right?

383
00:20:07,394 --> 00:20:09,474
Why don't you message me back?

384
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:18,994
I've been away for a moment,

385
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:20,624
and you've followed me here.

386
00:20:21,034 --> 00:20:21,714
Miss Lan.

387
00:20:22,274 --> 00:20:23,504
To be honest,

388
00:20:23,504 --> 00:20:25,456
after designing this game,

389
00:20:25,754 --> 00:20:26,274
I

390
00:20:27,514 --> 00:20:28,874
had a boyfriend.

391
00:20:31,994 --> 00:20:33,394
All my inspiration comes

392
00:20:33,394 --> 00:20:35,514
from real experiences,

393
00:20:35,594 --> 00:20:37,394
with no fake imagination.

394
00:20:40,714 --> 00:20:43,394
Please. I'll pay you
the rent after this.

395
00:20:54,634 --> 00:20:55,714
We're alumni.

396
00:20:56,474 --> 00:20:57,514
I told her to come together,

397
00:20:57,514 --> 00:20:58,634
but she disagreed.

398
00:21:00,514 --> 00:21:02,394
You think I'll embarrass you?

399
00:21:03,154 --> 00:21:04,528
How could that be?

400
00:21:05,354 --> 00:21:06,794
Your boyfriend is handsome.

401
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:10,754
Our game characters are also handsome.

402
00:21:13,154 --> 00:21:15,394
Your boyfriend looks so young.

403
00:21:15,394 --> 00:21:16,154
Which year?

404
00:21:18,034 --> 00:21:20,394
Love just came without noticing.

405
00:21:21,594 --> 00:21:23,034
Age isn't a problem.

406
00:21:23,234 --> 00:21:24,634
Many girls nowadays

407
00:21:24,634 --> 00:21:26,634
appreciate kind, cute,

408
00:21:26,634 --> 00:21:27,994
and good-looking younger men.

409
00:21:29,514 --> 00:21:31,274
As a game player,

410
00:21:31,274 --> 00:21:33,114
I must live in romance.

411
00:21:41,354 --> 00:21:42,234
Mr. Landlord.

412
00:21:42,274 --> 00:21:44,114
Didn't we agree to delay the rent?

413
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:45,994
So, when can you pay?

414
00:21:49,514 --> 00:21:50,634
The label is not removed.

415
00:21:53,616 --> 00:21:54,384
Thank you.

416
00:21:57,394 --> 00:21:58,514
To be honest,

417
00:21:58,634 --> 00:21:59,874
I will

418
00:22:00,394 --> 00:22:01,394
return this outfit.

419
00:22:01,394 --> 00:22:03,114
Plus, to match this outfit,

420
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:04,714
I even took a luxury car ride.

421
00:22:06,994 --> 00:22:07,754
That woman

422
00:22:08,754 --> 00:22:10,354
is Miss Lan from Lansheng Investment.

423
00:22:10,634 --> 00:22:12,754
She is my top potential client.

424
00:22:13,114 --> 00:22:13,874
I thought

425
00:22:13,994 --> 00:22:16,154
dressing up might increase my chances.

426
00:22:17,394 --> 00:22:18,114
You're too young

427
00:22:18,514 --> 00:22:18,994
to understand.

428
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:21,914
The world is too complex.

429
00:22:23,114 --> 00:22:25,754
Anyway, don't spoil my plan, alright?

430
00:22:26,114 --> 00:22:27,514
Let me finish this big deal.

431
00:22:31,394 --> 00:22:32,274
Thanks.

432
00:22:39,754 --> 00:22:40,394
Miss Lan.

433
00:22:40,634 --> 00:22:41,274
An Ran.

434
00:22:41,514 --> 00:22:43,114
You came just in time.

435
00:22:43,634 --> 00:22:44,994
This is Mr. Wang from Tiansheng Corp.

436
00:22:45,874 --> 00:22:46,514
Mr. Wang.

437
00:22:47,274 --> 00:22:49,514
Your firm is a subsidiary
of Gaishi Group.

438
00:22:49,514 --> 00:22:51,354
And you always visit Gaishi Group.

439
00:22:51,354 --> 00:22:52,394
You can't

440
00:22:52,394 --> 00:22:53,514
forget such a pretty girl.

441
00:22:56,474 --> 00:22:59,114
I'm sorry,
but I failed to recognize you.

442
00:22:59,714 --> 00:23:00,634
Are you working

443
00:23:00,634 --> 00:23:01,994
for Chen Xin

444
00:23:02,234 --> 00:23:03,474
or Lin Da?

445
00:23:07,914 --> 00:23:08,754
Neither.

446
00:23:10,634 --> 00:23:12,354
She's from Gaishi Unparalleled.

447
00:23:12,354 --> 00:23:13,488
(An Ran, Gaishi Unparalleled)

448
00:23:15,474 --> 00:23:17,914
Not Gaishi Group,
but Gaishi Unparalleled.

449
00:23:19,034 --> 00:23:21,354
I've heard of it.

450
00:23:23,234 --> 00:23:26,514
My company is often mistaken
for a subsidiary of Gaishi Group.

451
00:23:26,634 --> 00:23:27,714
But actually,

452
00:23:27,714 --> 00:23:30,032
apart from the familiar name,

453
00:23:30,032 --> 00:23:32,034
they have absolutely no relationship.

454
00:23:32,874 --> 00:23:34,114
Isn't that like a knockoff?

455
00:23:36,594 --> 00:23:37,154
Miss Lan,

456
00:23:37,714 --> 00:23:39,634
the game Fragment Time Boyfriend...

457
00:23:39,634 --> 00:23:40,154
An Ran.

458
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,394
We're here for the alumni meeting.

459
00:23:42,394 --> 00:23:44,234
Let's not talk about work.

460
00:23:44,514 --> 00:23:45,994
Anyway, you have my contact information.

461
00:23:45,994 --> 00:23:47,474
We'll find a chance to talk.

462
00:23:47,714 --> 00:23:48,714
I'll excuse myself.

463
00:23:49,354 --> 00:23:51,154
Wang, say hello to Hu.

464
00:23:54,354 --> 00:23:54,914
Miss Lan.

465
00:23:58,914 --> 00:24:00,514
Why hasn't she removed the tag?

466
00:24:16,114 --> 00:24:16,714
An Ran.

467
00:24:17,994 --> 00:24:18,754
Are you okay?

468
00:24:27,514 --> 00:24:29,794
What are you looking at?
Have you never had a fall?

469
00:24:30,354 --> 00:24:31,114
Let's go.

470
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:40,154
Be careful.

471
00:24:43,754 --> 00:24:45,154
Did I embarrass myself?

472
00:24:45,154 --> 00:24:46,714
What's the big deal?

473
00:24:47,154 --> 00:24:48,954
I haven't finished with Miss Lan.

474
00:24:50,154 --> 00:24:51,754
Your clothing is torn.

475
00:24:53,554 --> 00:24:55,754
How do I return it?

476
00:24:56,624 --> 00:24:58,000
You scraped your knee.

477
00:25:00,234 --> 00:25:01,594
What have you been through

478
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:04,176
while I was abroad these years?

479
00:25:05,794 --> 00:25:07,034
Don't cry.

480
00:25:09,394 --> 00:25:10,834
Why did you come back today?

481
00:25:10,914 --> 00:25:12,354
Wasn't your flight tomorrow?

482
00:25:12,634 --> 00:25:14,994
I wanted to surprise you.

483
00:25:14,994 --> 00:25:16,594
Instead, I got surprised.

484
00:25:20,034 --> 00:25:22,754
Wait a minute. Let me see.

485
00:25:23,794 --> 00:25:24,634
Turn around.

486
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,463
(Bai Mengyao, a genius painter
and love expert on paper)

487
00:25:30,754 --> 00:25:33,594
Bai Mengyao, you lived well in France.

488
00:25:33,754 --> 00:25:36,274
So your pictures weren't photoshopped.

489
00:25:36,274 --> 00:25:38,032
Shut up.

490
00:25:38,914 --> 00:25:40,394
People change.

491
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:41,794
So do you.

492
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:42,914
Me?

493
00:25:43,114 --> 00:25:44,474
Your type has changed.

494
00:25:44,714 --> 00:25:46,034
I saw your boyfriend

495
00:25:46,034 --> 00:25:46,874
just now.

496
00:25:46,874 --> 00:25:48,514
That was fake.

497
00:25:48,514 --> 00:25:49,914
You can rent a boyfriend?

498
00:25:50,914 --> 00:25:52,274
I can't afford to rent one.

499
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:53,634
It's a coincidence.

500
00:25:54,994 --> 00:25:56,874
I thought you were in love.

501
00:25:57,234 --> 00:25:59,234
So, you're back.

502
00:25:59,234 --> 00:26:00,034
Any plans?

503
00:26:00,034 --> 00:26:01,634
I haven't figured it out yet.

504
00:26:01,914 --> 00:26:05,794
But I've noticed the rise
of new media recently.

505
00:26:05,794 --> 00:26:06,874
I want to give it a try.

506
00:26:07,874 --> 00:26:09,474
You want to be an influencer?

507
00:26:12,114 --> 00:26:15,184
But I'm in need of a concept artist.

508
00:26:15,634 --> 00:26:16,634
No, no, no.

509
00:26:16,874 --> 00:26:18,474
I don't want to work in a company.

510
00:26:18,634 --> 00:26:20,754
I need to make money to pay off my loan

511
00:26:20,754 --> 00:26:22,514
for studying abroad.

512
00:26:22,594 --> 00:26:24,034
Both of us are in a tough time.

513
00:26:24,794 --> 00:26:26,114
You can't afford me.

514
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:30,074
Alright. Don't talk about it now.

515
00:26:31,114 --> 00:26:32,114
Artist.

516
00:26:32,394 --> 00:26:34,874
Can I invite you to dinner?

517
00:26:35,034 --> 00:26:36,354
Sure.

518
00:26:39,154 --> 00:26:41,154
Oh, I have something else to do.

519
00:26:41,154 --> 00:26:42,154
What is it?

520
00:26:42,994 --> 00:26:44,368
Dating.

521
00:26:46,874 --> 00:26:50,032
You just got back
and already have a date?

522
00:26:50,874 --> 00:26:53,274
I met him on the plane.

523
00:26:53,474 --> 00:26:55,514
He works in a new media company.

524
00:26:55,754 --> 00:26:58,874
I want to dig up some information.

525
00:26:59,874 --> 00:27:00,474
Forget it.

526
00:27:00,794 --> 00:27:01,594
I'll take you home first.

527
00:27:01,594 --> 00:27:03,354
There's no need for that.

528
00:27:03,354 --> 00:27:05,154
Don't stand him up.

529
00:27:05,154 --> 00:27:06,474
Go on your date.

530
00:27:06,594 --> 00:27:07,714
Anyway, you're back.

531
00:27:07,714 --> 00:27:09,394
We can have dinner another day.

532
00:27:09,874 --> 00:27:11,114
Are you sure?

533
00:27:11,754 --> 00:27:12,394
What?

534
00:27:12,554 --> 00:27:14,634
Do I need to do military boxing

535
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:15,474
in front of you?

536
00:27:16,274 --> 00:27:17,474
So you're okay.

537
00:27:17,794 --> 00:27:18,714
I'm leaving.

538
00:27:18,714 --> 00:27:19,034
Okay.

539
00:27:19,034 --> 00:27:20,514
You need to treat your wound.

540
00:27:21,394 --> 00:27:22,034
Keep in touch.

541
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:18,416
(Wang Xiaoxiao)

542
00:29:45,474 --> 00:29:45,914
Here you are.

543
00:29:55,472 --> 00:29:56,272
Thank you.

544
00:30:15,154 --> 00:30:17,034
Thank you for helping me twice today.

545
00:30:17,354 --> 00:30:18,354
And for not exposing me.

546
00:30:19,594 --> 00:30:20,874
Let me buy you a drink.

547
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:29,274
Sorry, your balance runs short.

548
00:30:34,634 --> 00:30:35,714
It's all included in the rent.

549
00:30:37,354 --> 00:30:38,754
Come on. Cheers.

550
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:40,754
I only drink this.

551
00:30:46,034 --> 00:30:48,874
Why are you only drinking soda water?

552
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,274
I don't drink.

553
00:30:51,074 --> 00:30:51,954
You don't drink?

554
00:30:54,914 --> 00:30:55,634
Well,

555
00:30:56,394 --> 00:30:58,794
why do you live alone in a large house?

556
00:31:01,154 --> 00:31:02,634
Which department did you graduate from?

557
00:31:04,048 --> 00:31:06,354
What do you do?

558
00:31:07,034 --> 00:31:08,594
My eyelids are so heavy.

559
00:31:22,394 --> 00:31:23,114
You're home.

560
00:31:24,354 --> 00:31:25,634
I'm home.

561
00:31:27,184 --> 00:31:28,394
Thank you.

562
00:31:29,914 --> 00:31:31,024
Your stuff.

563
00:31:37,034 --> 00:31:37,874
What's the password?

564
00:31:40,634 --> 00:31:41,154
Birthday?

565
00:31:43,394 --> 00:31:44,634
Last six digits of the ID?

566
00:31:47,514 --> 00:31:49,874
I need to use the bathroom.

567
00:32:02,274 --> 00:32:03,114
You should go home.

568
00:32:05,394 --> 00:32:07,714
The bag isn't mine.

569
00:32:08,754 --> 00:32:11,074
The shoes aren't mine either.

570
00:32:11,394 --> 00:32:13,754
My new house is mine.

571
00:32:14,354 --> 00:32:15,594
Not yours.

572
00:32:16,714 --> 00:32:18,314
It's mine.

573
00:32:18,314 --> 00:32:19,874
Insufficient balance is yours.

574
00:32:20,314 --> 00:32:22,554
Why are you so annoying?

575
00:32:22,834 --> 00:32:24,154
So annoying.

576
00:32:25,834 --> 00:32:27,554
Making money is so hard.

577
00:32:27,754 --> 00:32:29,314
I thought I would find an investor

578
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:30,754
in the alumni meeting.

579
00:32:31,312 --> 00:32:32,834
I'm so embarrassed.

580
00:32:33,154 --> 00:32:35,074
I've contacted everyone

581
00:32:35,074 --> 00:32:36,394
in my address list,

582
00:32:36,714 --> 00:32:38,074
but none of them
paid any attention to me.

583
00:32:39,474 --> 00:32:41,354
Not a single one was interested.

584
00:32:43,554 --> 00:32:45,424
If so, why do you insist?

585
00:32:47,216 --> 00:32:48,080
Because

586
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:49,554
they

587
00:32:50,314 --> 00:32:51,536
are waiting for me

588
00:32:51,984 --> 00:32:53,648
to pay their salaries.

589
00:32:54,074 --> 00:32:54,794
Who?

590
00:32:59,634 --> 00:33:00,394
What are you doing?

591
00:33:03,794 --> 00:33:04,834
They say

592
00:33:05,834 --> 00:33:07,474
dreams are expensive in this city.

593
00:33:09,914 --> 00:33:11,714
I think that makes sense.

594
00:33:14,234 --> 00:33:18,114
Why isn't there a person

595
00:33:18,314 --> 00:33:20,274
to comfort me?

596
00:33:26,554 --> 00:33:28,314
You're really cute.

597
00:33:30,874 --> 00:33:31,634
What are you doing?

598
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:33,552
Go home and work overtime.

599
00:33:33,648 --> 00:33:35,154
Come down and leave through the door.

600
00:33:35,154 --> 00:33:36,994
This place is closer to my dream.

601
00:36:52,034 --> 00:36:53,114
You got drunk last night

602
00:36:53,114 --> 00:36:54,074
and vomited all over me.

603
00:36:54,514 --> 00:36:55,434
Do you remember,

604
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:57,034
Senior?

605
00:37:03,994 --> 00:37:04,994
Cleaning fee,

606
00:37:05,354 --> 00:37:06,554
wall repair fee,

607
00:37:07,314 --> 00:37:08,754
mental damage compensation,

608
00:37:09,234 --> 00:37:11,114
and the moving fee I covered for you.

609
00:37:11,274 --> 00:37:12,474
All is added to the rent.

610
00:37:12,594 --> 00:37:14,674
It's 1,500 in total.

611
00:37:14,834 --> 00:37:16,834
Are you kidding me?

612
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:17,434
And,

613
00:37:17,994 --> 00:37:19,754
if you pay the rent today,

614
00:37:20,754 --> 00:37:22,274
those charges will be waived.

615
00:37:23,554 --> 00:37:25,674
Mr. Landlord, I haven't finished yet.

616
00:37:28,594 --> 00:37:29,674
I have a name.

617
00:37:30,274 --> 00:37:32,274
My name is Yan Yue.
