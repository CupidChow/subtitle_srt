(thinking that leaving this city
was protecting her)

(and giving up this relationship
was fulfilling her dream.)

until I saw her again)

Five million.

00:02:48,426 --> 00:02:49,066
Yan Yue is back.

36
00:02:50,586 --> 00:02:52,146
I thought you won the lottery.

00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:54,226
Pardon?

38
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:56,306
Yan Yue is back.

Oh my,

00:03:16,506 --> 00:03:18,346
the sun is rising from the west today.

00:03:20,946 --> 00:03:21,266
Alright,

43
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:22,226
get in now.

44
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:22,986
Wait.

45
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:25,906
You came to pick me up?

46
00:03:26,266 --> 00:03:27,306

00:03:28,986 --> 00:03:29,226
I will.

00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:35,226
Stop.

50
00:03:36,546 --> 00:03:36,826
Stop.

00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,666
When the people
from Southern Lights come later,

57
00:03:58,706 --> 00:03:59,626
what should I say?

58
00:04:03,506 --> 00:04:04,906
Did you hear me?

59
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:07,226
I'm listening. Go on.

60
00:04:08,386 --> 00:04:09,946
You seem a bit off today.

61
00:04:12,506 --> 00:04:14,066
Your love life...

62
00:04:14,066 --> 00:04:15,066
I-I-I don't want to hear it.

63
00:04:15,066 --> 00:04:15,826
I know.

64
00:04:17,386 --> 00:04:19,906
Just think about
the Southern Lights matter.

65
00:04:20,506 --> 00:04:21,826
Don't be as impulsive as last time.

66
00:04:22,066 --> 00:04:22,546
Okay?

67
00:04:22,906 --> 00:04:23,506
Roger.

68
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,386
I know.

69
00:04:29,706 --> 00:04:31,666
But I've been to those few companies.

70
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,386
There's no useful information.

71
00:04:34,946 --> 00:04:35,666
Right now,

72
00:04:36,226 --> 00:04:37,826
I'm near the Gaishi building.

73
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,066
You're funny.

74
00:04:41,226 --> 00:04:41,986
You can't expect me

75
00:04:41,986 --> 00:04:43,546
to go duel with Zhao Qian, can you?

76
00:04:44,848 --> 00:04:47,066
(Gaishi)

77
00:04:47,066 --> 00:04:47,786
Chen Rui.

78
00:04:48,026 --> 00:04:48,506
Wait.

79
00:04:48,506 --> 00:04:49,506
Changfeng, I'm hanging up.

80
00:04:51,186 --> 00:04:51,386
Chen...

81
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:59,536
(Gaishi)

82
00:05:03,986 --> 00:05:06,186
How can she be with Zhao Qian?

83
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:10,080
(Gaishi)

84
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:36,746
It's not time yet. Just wait.

85
00:05:41,826 --> 00:05:44,226
(Miss An, I ran into
Chen Rui at the Gaishi Group.)

86
00:05:45,426 --> 00:05:46,186
Chen Rui?

87
00:05:48,746 --> 00:05:49,106
What's it?

88
00:05:50,226 --> 00:05:52,186
Tian Xin said she ran into
Chen Rui at the Gaishi Group.

89
00:05:54,186 --> 00:05:54,626
Gaishi.

90
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:57,186
Tian Xin, are you sure?

91
00:05:59,306 --> 00:06:00,426
(Miss An, I'm sure.)

92
00:06:02,866 --> 00:06:04,546
Don't tell anyone for now.

93
00:06:04,546 --> 00:06:05,866
I'll handle this matter.

94
00:06:12,866 --> 00:06:15,186
Thanks to Wu this time,
we found a breakthrough

95
00:06:15,186 --> 00:06:16,746
and even managed
to set up a meeting with him.

96
00:06:17,986 --> 00:06:18,986
We must get some information.

97
00:06:31,106 --> 00:06:32,546
Hello, my name is An Ran.

98
00:06:32,946 --> 00:06:34,226
This is Hu Yingjun.

99
00:06:34,986 --> 00:06:36,426
We're the heads of Gaishi Unparalleled.

100
00:06:37,426 --> 00:06:37,866
Hello,

101
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,106
my name is Chen Jiaxi.

102
00:06:41,426 --> 00:06:42,546
I've heard from Wu

103
00:06:42,866 --> 00:06:43,866
that you are old friends.

104
00:06:44,426 --> 00:06:44,866
Yes.

105
00:06:47,506 --> 00:06:48,186
Were you guys

106
00:06:49,546 --> 00:06:50,506
attacked by hackers too?

107
00:06:52,866 --> 00:06:54,306
Our game has been shut down.

108
00:06:57,106 --> 00:06:57,866
I know

109
00:06:58,186 --> 00:06:59,546
your company and ours

110
00:06:59,746 --> 00:07:00,746
had the same experience.

111
00:07:04,186 --> 00:07:05,306
Let me give you some advice.

112
00:07:06,746 --> 00:07:07,666
If I were you,

113
00:07:08,866 --> 00:07:09,986
I would stick it out to the end.

114
00:07:11,066 --> 00:07:12,586
Never think about relying on others.

115
00:07:13,306 --> 00:07:13,866
Otherwise...

116
00:07:19,946 --> 00:07:20,426
Back then,

117
00:07:21,506 --> 00:07:24,306
our team worked hard for five years.

118
00:07:24,746 --> 00:07:27,426
Just when we were attacked by hackers,

119
00:07:28,106 --> 00:07:29,306
we felt too weak,

120
00:07:30,106 --> 00:07:31,666
so we chose to join a big company,

121
00:07:32,626 --> 00:07:35,106
hoping that it'd save
the company and the game.

122
00:07:36,306 --> 00:07:36,746
But then...

123
00:07:39,546 --> 00:07:40,546
Is it the Gaishi Group?

124
00:07:52,106 --> 00:07:53,866
Do you think our terms will be accepted

125
00:07:54,506 --> 00:07:55,666
by Gaishi Unparalleled?

126
00:07:58,426 --> 00:08:01,546
Mr. Zhao, your terms are too harsh.

127
00:08:02,426 --> 00:08:03,746
They care a lot about

128
00:08:03,746 --> 00:08:04,866
Time Boyfriend.

129
00:08:05,746 --> 00:08:06,666
I don't think

130
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:09,106
they will accept your terms.

131
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,986
Mr. Chen, may I ask the details

132
00:08:13,106 --> 00:08:15,186
of your company being acquired
by the Gaishi Group?

133
00:08:19,986 --> 00:08:20,546
Mr. Chen,

134
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,066
Wu told me some

135
00:08:23,066 --> 00:08:24,306
about Jiaxi Technology.

136
00:08:24,986 --> 00:08:25,746
I also know

137
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:28,866
how hard it has been
for you to sustain till now.

138
00:08:29,866 --> 00:08:30,746
I can tell you

139
00:08:31,626 --> 00:08:33,546
our company is under attack now,

140
00:08:34,066 --> 00:08:35,746
and that I absolutely won't compromise.

141
00:08:42,866 --> 00:08:43,786
If I tell you,

142
00:08:45,106 --> 00:08:46,066
do you have the confidence

143
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:47,866
to find out who the mastermind is?

144
00:08:52,946 --> 00:08:54,146
I didn't expect Time Boyfriend

145
00:08:54,146 --> 00:08:55,586
to end up like this.

146
00:08:56,306 --> 00:08:56,926
Two months ago,

147
00:08:56,926 --> 00:08:58,986
I was still discussing
cooperation with Miss An.

148
00:09:00,066 --> 00:09:01,266
Who would have thought of today?

149
00:09:02,306 --> 00:09:04,386
She made it harder
for herself, didn't she?

150
00:09:08,546 --> 00:09:12,946
My previous company
was called Xinyang Culture.

151
00:09:14,626 --> 00:09:15,786
I spent three years

152
00:09:16,226 --> 00:09:17,506
carefully making a game.

153
00:09:18,426 --> 00:09:20,106
But only three days after going online,

154
00:09:20,986 --> 00:09:24,106
it was attacked,
and I was blackmailed by a hacker.

155
00:09:25,386 --> 00:09:26,386
The hacker gave me

156
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,746
an account number
and threatened that if I didn't pay,

157
00:09:29,266 --> 00:09:30,866
he would keep attacking my server.

158
00:09:31,986 --> 00:09:33,986
I paid the first time,

159
00:09:35,226 --> 00:09:37,866
but I didn't expect him
to take it too far.

160
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:39,706
When I realized

161
00:09:40,106 --> 00:09:41,746
it was a bottomless pit,

162
00:09:42,386 --> 00:09:44,466
my company's cash flow
could not hold up.

163
00:09:46,626 --> 00:09:47,826
Just when I felt desperate,

164
00:09:49,626 --> 00:09:52,586
a friend introduced me
to Mr. Zhao of the Gaishi Group.

165
00:09:53,386 --> 00:09:53,866
Mr. Zhao?

166
00:09:55,146 --> 00:09:55,746
Which Zhao?

167
00:09:56,866 --> 00:09:58,106
The investment director of Gaishi,

168
00:09:59,106 --> 00:09:59,586
Zhao Qian.

169
00:10:09,826 --> 00:10:10,146
Alright,

170
00:10:11,626 --> 00:10:12,866
my condition

171
00:10:12,866 --> 00:10:14,226
is to get a stake in Time Boyfriend.

172
00:10:14,866 --> 00:10:16,746
I'll cover
the publishing and server costs

173
00:10:16,746 --> 00:10:18,146
in exchange for 40% equity.

174
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:20,986
After it's successful,

175
00:10:22,506 --> 00:10:24,626
you can get the part you deserve.

176
00:10:28,866 --> 00:10:29,386
Mr. Zhao,

177
00:10:32,346 --> 00:10:34,106
I have already decided to resign.

178
00:10:40,466 --> 00:10:43,146
Zhao Qian proposed
to invest in my company.

179
00:10:44,386 --> 00:10:46,346
We felt like we had grabbed
a lifeline at that time,

180
00:10:48,746 --> 00:10:49,746
but we didn't expect

181
00:10:51,746 --> 00:10:53,706
the investment turned
into an acquisition later.

182
00:10:54,386 --> 00:10:56,266
All of us and the games we developed

183
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,346
were acquired by the Gaishi Group.

184
00:11:00,506 --> 00:11:01,386
We were unwilling,

185
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:03,506
but we had no choices.

186
00:11:04,266 --> 00:11:05,706
But more unexpectedly,

187
00:11:05,826 --> 00:11:07,226
we were all kicked out

188
00:11:07,866 --> 00:11:10,026
in less than a month.

189
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:16,226
I know Gaishi Unparalleled is a startup.

190
00:11:16,866 --> 00:11:19,466
But your achievements

191
00:11:19,986 --> 00:11:21,146
are well-recognized.

192
00:11:21,826 --> 00:11:23,506
That's why I came here

193
00:11:23,706 --> 00:11:24,866
to propose

194
00:11:24,866 --> 00:11:25,746
a collaboration.

195
00:11:26,266 --> 00:11:27,866
What do you think about it?

196
00:11:31,106 --> 00:11:32,386
I was desperate at the time,

197
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,146
but I persisted and established

198
00:11:37,106 --> 00:11:38,106
Jiaxi Technology,

199
00:11:40,986 --> 00:11:43,706
yet to really take off.

200
00:11:45,386 --> 00:11:46,226
I have replayed it

201
00:11:47,226 --> 00:11:49,746
in my mind countless times.

202
00:11:50,986 --> 00:11:52,386
From being attacked,

203
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:54,026
extorted

204
00:11:54,586 --> 00:11:55,506
and acquired

205
00:11:56,146 --> 00:11:56,986
to being kicked out

206
00:11:57,626 --> 00:11:58,986
by the Gaishi Group in the end.

207
00:11:59,626 --> 00:12:01,026
All this is absolutely not
a coincidence.

208
00:12:05,586 --> 00:12:07,506
Mr. Chen, thank you for your honesty.

209
00:12:08,026 --> 00:12:08,986
Your words

210
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:10,746
really help us a lot.

211
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,226
Are you really sure to expose

212
00:12:14,146 --> 00:12:17,066
all the bad things Zhao Qian did?

213
00:12:22,106 --> 00:12:23,506
We will do our best,

214
00:12:25,226 --> 00:12:26,506
but we're still too weak.

215
00:12:29,106 --> 00:12:31,546
If we need you to stand up

216
00:12:31,546 --> 00:12:32,466
and join us at that time,

217
00:12:33,226 --> 00:12:33,986
would you be willing?

218
00:12:40,466 --> 00:12:43,026
Mr. Chen, may I ask

219
00:12:43,746 --> 00:12:45,386
how your game is now?

220
00:12:49,706 --> 00:12:51,826
After the Gaishi Group
acquired the game,

221
00:12:52,546 --> 00:12:55,346
the subsidiary Tiansheng messed it up.

222
00:12:56,266 --> 00:12:59,666
World of Imagination
is completely unrecognizable now.

223
00:13:09,306 --> 00:13:10,666
You're finally back.

224
00:13:11,306 --> 00:13:12,546
We haven't seen you for so long,

225
00:13:12,546 --> 00:13:13,426
and that's what you said?

226
00:13:13,906 --> 00:13:14,586
Stop joking.

227
00:13:14,706 --> 00:13:15,706
Go in and prepare.

228
00:13:15,706 --> 00:13:16,906
Those from Southern Lights
will be here soon.

229
00:13:16,906 --> 00:13:17,946
Alright, drop the act.

230
00:13:18,306 --> 00:13:19,506
Who asked when Yan Yue

231
00:13:19,506 --> 00:13:20,906
would come back every other day?

232
00:13:21,226 --> 00:13:22,826
I just wanted him to hurry back

233
00:13:22,826 --> 00:13:24,026
to deal with this matter.

234
00:13:25,306 --> 00:13:25,786
Losing weight?

235
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,066
Not much.

236
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:27,706
And you?

237
00:13:28,066 --> 00:13:29,226
Don't be so impulsive anymore.

238
00:13:29,906 --> 00:13:30,706
Got it.

239
00:13:36,346 --> 00:13:38,066
World of Imagination
was actually made by them,

240
00:13:38,586 --> 00:13:39,706
but it was completely messed up

241
00:13:39,706 --> 00:13:40,826
by Zhao Qian and Wang.

242
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:45,026
It's lucky we didn't agree
to their acquisition at the time.

243
00:13:45,586 --> 00:13:46,866
It's really scary to think about it.

244
00:13:47,306 --> 00:13:48,226
Chen Jiaxi's words

245
00:13:48,226 --> 00:13:50,066
basically confirmed
our previous thoughts.

246
00:13:50,426 --> 00:13:52,466
The hacker incident
was done by Zhao Qian.

247
00:13:53,586 --> 00:13:54,226
But we still

248
00:13:54,226 --> 00:13:55,586
don't have clear evidence.

249
00:13:57,186 --> 00:13:58,426
But at least one thing

250
00:13:58,426 --> 00:13:59,306
we can be sure of

251
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:03,706
is that we absolutely cannot compromise.

252
00:14:04,706 --> 00:14:04,946
Agreed.

253
00:14:08,906 --> 00:14:10,426
I'm going to meet Chen Rui.

254
00:14:11,706 --> 00:14:12,186
Then,

255
00:14:12,906 --> 00:14:14,186
I'll go work on Mr. Chen again.

256
00:14:16,546 --> 00:14:16,786
Bye.

257
00:14:20,906 --> 00:14:21,586
Hello, everyone.

258
00:14:22,066 --> 00:14:24,306
I am Song Yi, the proxy lawyer
for Southern Lights.

259
00:14:25,306 --> 00:14:26,666
Why did only you come?

260
00:14:27,186 --> 00:14:28,226
How about the person in charge?

261
00:14:28,746 --> 00:14:29,066
Well,

262
00:14:29,826 --> 00:14:31,066
I can represent

263
00:14:31,306 --> 00:14:32,586
all affairs of Southern Lights.

264
00:14:37,306 --> 00:14:37,706
Let's start.

265
00:14:38,186 --> 00:14:38,426
Okay.

266
00:14:40,826 --> 00:14:42,106
Our current demand is very simple.

267
00:14:42,546 --> 00:14:44,426
Southern Lights publicly apologizes

268
00:14:45,946 --> 00:14:47,346
and admits that it concealed from us

269
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:48,706
the fact that the author

270
00:14:49,186 --> 00:14:51,586
didn't grant the right
to produce the audiobook

271
00:14:52,306 --> 00:14:54,946
and compensates JS Sound Art Studio
and Mr. Yan Yue for all the losses

272
00:14:55,826 --> 00:14:59,066
in the copyright dispute
about Lovely Moonlight.

273
00:14:59,906 --> 00:15:01,426
Our attitude is very clear.

274
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,306
We refuse to negotiate.

275
00:15:05,066 --> 00:15:07,346
Negotiation is to prevent
the situation from escalating.

276
00:15:08,066 --> 00:15:09,066
Are you sure

277
00:15:10,186 --> 00:15:11,386
you have thought it through?

278
00:15:14,986 --> 00:15:19,106
I'm sorry.
But then what are you here for?

279
00:15:19,946 --> 00:15:22,546
I just represent
Southern Lights to express a stance.

280
00:15:24,026 --> 00:15:25,666
Hey, what's with the attitude?

281
00:15:25,826 --> 00:15:26,786
This is my task.

282
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,426
If you have other demands,

283
00:15:30,066 --> 00:15:31,466
we can talk about them in court.

284
00:15:32,826 --> 00:15:33,186
Goodbye.

285
00:15:34,786 --> 00:15:35,826
Hey, what do you mean?

286
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:37,306
We haven't even taken you to court yet,

287
00:15:37,306 --> 00:15:38,826
and you've already decided it?

288
00:15:38,826 --> 00:15:39,706
Calm down.

289
00:16:05,586 --> 00:16:06,466
I would like to know

290
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,306
why you want to join our company.

291
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:12,026
I really like the concept of

292
00:16:12,146 --> 00:16:13,306
Fragment Time Boyfriend.

293
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:14,546
I believe

294
00:16:14,546 --> 00:16:16,746
this romantic game truly understands

295
00:16:16,746 --> 00:16:17,506
contemporary women.

296
00:16:18,106 --> 00:16:19,266
I also did some research

297
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:21,706
and truly admired your staff's passion

298
00:16:21,706 --> 00:16:22,986
for this game.

299
00:16:24,386 --> 00:16:26,986
I can feel consideration

300
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,426
for the female customers in the game.

301
00:16:30,266 --> 00:16:32,426
(From character design to art style,)

302
00:16:32,626 --> 00:16:33,626
(it's all quite unconventional.)

303
00:16:34,146 --> 00:16:34,786
I believe

304
00:16:35,026 --> 00:16:36,666
your company has a real passion

305
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,386
for developing games.

306
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:01,986
Thank you, Miss An.

307
00:17:02,786 --> 00:17:03,306
You're welcome.

308
00:17:06,146 --> 00:17:07,106
What have you been doing?

309
00:17:08,146 --> 00:17:10,146
I've been packing up for a move.

310
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:13,746
You're really going home?

311
00:17:15,026 --> 00:17:15,506
Yes.

312
00:17:16,546 --> 00:17:18,666
Miss An, what can I do for you?

313
00:17:22,266 --> 00:17:24,266
You're doing quite well
at Gaishi Unparalleled.

314
00:17:24,506 --> 00:17:25,906
Why do you want to leave suddenly?

315
00:17:27,786 --> 00:17:29,026
Is it because

316
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:32,426
the environment is not good enough
or the salary is not high,

317
00:17:33,906 --> 00:17:35,986
or perhaps you want
to go to a better company,

318
00:17:36,906 --> 00:17:37,506
like

319
00:17:38,866 --> 00:17:39,506
the Gaishi Group?

320
00:17:46,346 --> 00:17:47,106
No, Miss An.

321
00:17:49,066 --> 00:17:49,626
Chen Rui,

322
00:17:50,706 --> 00:17:52,746
do you know
what impressed me most about you

323
00:17:53,386 --> 00:17:54,946
after you came to our company?

324
00:17:57,346 --> 00:17:59,746
You are meticulous
and organized in your work.

325
00:18:00,906 --> 00:18:02,706
You are not a creator,

326
00:18:03,146 --> 00:18:04,226
but I can see

327
00:18:04,386 --> 00:18:05,466
your love for games.

328
00:18:07,066 --> 00:18:08,226
With your personality,

329
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,186
I don't think you would easily

330
00:18:10,186 --> 00:18:11,386
leave this industry.

331
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:12,986
Unless

332
00:18:14,066 --> 00:18:15,386
you have some unspeakable secret.

333
00:18:16,546 --> 00:18:17,386
After it's successful,

334
00:18:18,946 --> 00:18:19,826
you can get

335
00:18:19,826 --> 00:18:21,226
the part you deserve.

336
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:24,666
Mr. Zhao,

337
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,866
I have already decided to resign.

338
00:18:36,946 --> 00:18:37,386
Miss An,

339
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:39,466
I'm sorry.

340
00:18:41,146 --> 00:18:43,146
Miss An, please believe me.

341
00:18:43,386 --> 00:18:44,306
I really didn't do

342
00:18:44,306 --> 00:18:45,946
anything bad to the company.

343
00:18:48,186 --> 00:18:48,906
I believe you,

344
00:18:50,826 --> 00:18:52,466
and I also believe my own choice.

345
00:18:55,066 --> 00:18:55,626
But

346
00:18:57,066 --> 00:18:57,906
if there's anything

347
00:18:58,546 --> 00:19:01,106
I must know,

348
00:19:01,586 --> 00:19:03,106
I hope you can tell me.

349
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:05,386
I will be very grateful to you.

350
00:19:11,866 --> 00:19:12,386
I know

351
00:19:13,106 --> 00:19:14,706
perhaps making this decision

352
00:19:15,226 --> 00:19:16,946
requires a lot of courage,

353
00:19:17,946 --> 00:19:19,066
but I sincerely hope

354
00:19:20,146 --> 00:19:21,946
you can think about it carefully.

355
00:19:36,146 --> 00:19:36,866
Thank you.

356
00:19:44,146 --> 00:19:44,746
How was today?

357
00:19:45,866 --> 00:19:47,426
We met Wu's friend

358
00:19:47,826 --> 00:19:49,586
and got some useful information.

359
00:19:50,946 --> 00:19:52,666
But just their company alone

360
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,306
can't form a chain of evidence.

361
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:56,186
We still need to gather some

362
00:19:56,186 --> 00:19:56,946
other materials.

363
00:19:58,706 --> 00:19:59,146
And you?

364
00:20:00,386 --> 00:20:03,106
How was your studio today?

365
00:20:05,186 --> 00:20:07,986
We planned to negotiate
with Southern Lights.

366
00:20:09,186 --> 00:20:10,466
But they clearly know

367
00:20:10,466 --> 00:20:11,906
they were in the wrong, yet they insist

368
00:20:12,066 --> 00:20:14,106
on going to court
and don't want to reconcile.

369
00:20:15,466 --> 00:20:17,226
This kind of lawsuit
is very hard to fight,

370
00:20:18,306 --> 00:20:20,906
and they are an old copyright company.

371
00:20:21,146 --> 00:20:22,466
I think they know

372
00:20:22,826 --> 00:20:23,666
that it's hard for you.

373
00:20:24,346 --> 00:20:26,866
The longer it drags on,
the more advantageous it is for them.

374
00:20:29,546 --> 00:20:29,986
Yeah.

375
00:20:30,746 --> 00:20:32,226
It's getting more and more complicated.

376
00:20:37,146 --> 00:20:39,186
But we're getting
closer and closer to the truth.

377
00:20:50,146 --> 00:20:51,146
Then why aren't you happy?

378
00:20:54,466 --> 00:20:55,586
The closer you get to the answer,

379
00:20:55,706 --> 00:20:56,986
the more you see

380
00:20:57,386 --> 00:20:59,746
some dirty, ugly things.

381
00:21:01,626 --> 00:21:02,586
I find it very annoying.

382
00:21:04,466 --> 00:21:06,466
On the way back, I kept thinking.

383
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,226
Would it be better

384
00:21:10,226 --> 00:21:11,186
if I didn't seek answers?

385
00:21:16,986 --> 00:21:18,946
But with you by my side,

386
00:21:19,386 --> 00:21:21,906
I have the strength
to fight all of this.

387
00:21:23,826 --> 00:21:24,466
You fool.

388
00:21:27,546 --> 00:21:28,666
Can you do me a favor?

389
00:21:30,106 --> 00:21:30,546
What is it?

390
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:32,906
I'm starving.

391
00:21:36,146 --> 00:21:36,826
Then

392
00:21:38,586 --> 00:21:39,346
give me some strength.

393
00:21:54,786 --> 00:21:55,706
Just like that?

394
00:21:58,146 --> 00:21:59,866
This is the down payment.

395
00:21:59,866 --> 00:22:03,226
If you want more,
you have to perform well.

396
00:22:10,426 --> 00:22:11,906
Chef Yan, thank you.

397
00:22:23,946 --> 00:22:24,626
Mengyao.

398
00:22:25,626 --> 00:22:26,106
What's wrong?

399
00:22:27,986 --> 00:22:30,106
Could you please go ask Mr. Hu

400
00:22:30,106 --> 00:22:32,146
if he resolved the issue
with Miss An yesterday?

401
00:22:32,466 --> 00:22:33,826
We dare not ask.

402
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:35,386
What's there to be afraid of?

403
00:22:35,826 --> 00:22:36,546
Of course we are.

404
00:22:36,746 --> 00:22:37,906
And they're too busy to tell us.

405
00:22:37,906 --> 00:22:38,666
Can't we be anxious?

406
00:22:39,226 --> 00:22:39,906
Right, Wu

407
00:22:41,146 --> 00:22:41,466
and Peng?

408
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:51,386
Alright, I'll go.

409
00:22:57,226 --> 00:22:58,666
Okay, thanks for the time.

410
00:22:59,306 --> 00:23:00,986
I will convey
Lansheng's thoughts to An Ran.

411
00:23:03,426 --> 00:23:04,146
On a call?

412
00:23:08,986 --> 00:23:10,186
We've found the evidence.

413
00:23:10,186 --> 00:23:11,546
The rest is only a matter of time.

414
00:23:13,586 --> 00:23:14,146
Understood.

415
00:23:14,986 --> 00:23:16,746
Thank you for the time, Mr. Pei.

416
00:23:22,226 --> 00:23:22,706
Mr. Hu.

417
00:23:30,186 --> 00:23:30,586
What's it?

418
00:23:31,466 --> 00:23:33,106
How was your investigation
with An Ran yesterday?

419
00:23:35,626 --> 00:23:36,746
We're getting closer to the truth

420
00:23:37,746 --> 00:23:38,666
and getting more annoyed.

421
00:23:39,386 --> 00:23:40,626
And there's no direct evidence.

422
00:23:41,906 --> 00:23:42,866
So what do we do now?

423
00:23:44,746 --> 00:23:45,826
I guess An Ran will find it.

424
00:23:46,986 --> 00:23:48,386
Lansheng wants us to hurry

425
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:50,106
to ride on the Gaishi Group's coattails.

426
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:52,986
I'll be bearing
the pressure and holding on.

427
00:23:55,546 --> 00:23:56,826
We have to persist

428
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:58,106
especially at this time.

429
00:23:58,906 --> 00:23:59,666
I believe in An Ran

430
00:24:00,226 --> 00:24:00,866
and you.

431
00:24:02,146 --> 00:24:02,666
Keep up.

432
00:24:07,466 --> 00:24:09,346
We haven't had a date for a long time.

433
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:10,706
After work today,

434
00:24:10,906 --> 00:24:12,346
let's go eat something good.

435
00:24:12,746 --> 00:24:13,586
Eating something good?

436
00:24:15,106 --> 00:24:15,906
Do your job.

437
00:24:16,146 --> 00:24:17,106
Still thinking about eating.

438
00:24:18,186 --> 00:24:18,626
Yes, sir.

439
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:22,146
Be good.

440
00:24:56,866 --> 00:24:58,066
How is it going, Mengyao?

441
00:25:01,746 --> 00:25:02,746
Give them some more time.

442
00:25:03,386 --> 00:25:04,466
We have to believe in them.

443
00:25:08,386 --> 00:25:10,586
When will Miss An be back?

444
00:25:12,946 --> 00:25:13,386
Yeah,

445
00:25:13,826 --> 00:25:14,626
without Miss An,

446
00:25:14,626 --> 00:25:15,706
we're leaderless.

447
00:25:16,066 --> 00:25:17,426
There's so much work on hand.

448
00:25:19,706 --> 00:25:21,426
Everyone, let's first do
the work in our hands.

449
00:25:25,146 --> 00:25:25,466
Alright.

450
00:26:03,066 --> 00:26:03,786
Dear,

451
00:26:05,666 --> 00:26:07,626
when are you going
to start the show again?

452
00:26:10,146 --> 00:26:12,706
It's already shut down. Start what?

453
00:26:14,626 --> 00:26:15,226
I don't want to.

454
00:26:21,306 --> 00:26:22,786
Bluebird was dubbed

455
00:26:23,066 --> 00:26:23,866
by you, right?

456
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:28,226
How did you know?

457
00:26:29,186 --> 00:26:30,306
How can't I recognize it?

458
00:26:31,866 --> 00:26:32,866
I feel

459
00:26:33,626 --> 00:26:34,906
the people on the internet

460
00:26:34,906 --> 00:26:36,306
are not so radical anymore.

461
00:26:37,546 --> 00:26:38,826
And your real fans have been waiting

462
00:26:39,386 --> 00:26:40,386
for you for a long time.

463
00:26:42,146 --> 00:26:43,346
Would there be?

464
00:26:49,306 --> 00:26:50,946
Of course, dear.

465
00:26:51,626 --> 00:26:54,946
You are a soul-soothing expert.

466
00:26:55,866 --> 00:26:56,986
If your show doesn't start,

467
00:26:57,146 --> 00:26:59,186
those souls will wither.

468
00:27:00,706 --> 00:27:01,346
Besides,

469
00:27:02,066 --> 00:27:03,826
would you give up and abandon your fans

470
00:27:04,226 --> 00:27:04,906
who've followed you

471
00:27:05,146 --> 00:27:06,906
for years
because of those criticisms online?

472
00:27:10,186 --> 00:27:12,506
Of course, I won't care
about those people's comments.

473
00:27:13,786 --> 00:27:14,386
But

474
00:27:16,866 --> 00:27:18,066
I'm afraid my audience

475
00:27:18,226 --> 00:27:19,826
won't want to listen to my show anymore.

476
00:27:22,066 --> 00:27:22,866
How could it be?

477
00:27:23,586 --> 00:27:24,386
They will want to.

478
00:27:25,626 --> 00:27:26,786
The first impatient one

479
00:27:27,106 --> 00:27:27,626
is me.

480
00:27:38,066 --> 00:27:40,026
The tree at the door
was planted by Shan, right?

481
00:27:41,346 --> 00:27:42,386
Who else could it be?

482
00:27:42,586 --> 00:27:43,386
It's his taste.

483
00:27:44,666 --> 00:27:45,386
My treasure.

484
00:27:46,626 --> 00:27:47,866
Can't believe you'll share it.

485
00:27:49,546 --> 00:27:50,266
I don't drink.

486
00:27:51,186 --> 00:27:52,306
This is to welcome you.

487
00:27:52,306 --> 00:27:53,626
Have a sense of ritual, okay?

488
00:27:53,786 --> 00:27:54,106
Just a little.

489
00:27:57,106 --> 00:27:57,946
A little bit.

490
00:27:58,466 --> 00:27:58,906
Okay.

491
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:01,866
I'll do it, sir.

492
00:28:03,146 --> 00:28:05,026
I couldn't stop you when you left.

493
00:28:05,306 --> 00:28:06,586
How come you're back with just a push?

494
00:28:08,626 --> 00:28:09,386
I missed you guys.

495
00:28:09,706 --> 00:28:10,426
You missed me?

496
00:28:10,666 --> 00:28:12,266
You didn't miss us.

497
00:28:12,546 --> 00:28:13,706
You were just eager to get home.

498
00:28:15,466 --> 00:28:16,626
You've had enough.

499
00:28:16,626 --> 00:28:17,466
Know when to stop.

500
00:28:18,426 --> 00:28:20,186
While I was gone,

501
00:28:20,186 --> 00:28:21,826
the studio couldn't survive, could it?

502
00:28:23,306 --> 00:28:24,266
The studio is fine.

503
00:28:24,906 --> 00:28:26,466
But your manager

504
00:28:26,466 --> 00:28:27,306
couldn't survive.

505
00:28:28,866 --> 00:28:30,106
Hurry back

506
00:28:30,106 --> 00:28:31,706
to let Nan make some more money,

507
00:28:31,706 --> 00:28:32,346
okay?

508
00:28:33,066 --> 00:28:34,946
Should I reconsider?

509
00:28:35,306 --> 00:28:36,026
Please don't.

510
00:28:37,386 --> 00:28:37,906
Yan Yue,

511
00:28:38,426 --> 00:28:39,786
she's an independent woman.

512
00:28:40,146 --> 00:28:41,906
You have to aspire
to be an independent man.

513
00:28:42,106 --> 00:28:42,906
If you don't,

514
00:28:42,906 --> 00:28:43,866
how can I be independent?

515
00:28:45,066 --> 00:28:46,866
Fine, I'll go home and think about it.

516
00:28:47,146 --> 00:28:48,186
Don't think about it.

517
00:28:49,586 --> 00:28:50,226
When we

518
00:28:50,346 --> 00:28:52,786
clear up the Southern Lights project

519
00:28:53,266 --> 00:28:54,546
and this guy returns,

520
00:28:54,946 --> 00:28:55,986
our studio,

521
00:28:55,986 --> 00:28:56,506
well,

522
00:28:56,506 --> 00:28:57,106
will go up

523
00:28:57,106 --> 00:28:57,786
to the next level.

524
00:28:57,786 --> 00:28:58,426
Cheers.

525
00:29:06,106 --> 00:29:06,826
How's the wine?

526
00:29:08,706 --> 00:29:09,106
So-so.

527
00:29:09,586 --> 00:29:10,226
So-so?

528
00:29:10,226 --> 00:29:10,946
I can't really tell.

529
00:29:11,266 --> 00:29:12,306
I haven't drunk before.

530
00:30:02,226 --> 00:30:02,906
Hello.

531
00:30:02,906 --> 00:30:03,546
Chen Rui.

532
00:30:04,106 --> 00:30:06,066
Miss An, I want to meet you.

533
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:18,192
(Work Plan)

534
00:30:27,066 --> 00:30:27,546
Miss An.

535
00:30:29,986 --> 00:30:30,586
Chen Rui.

536
00:30:32,546 --> 00:30:33,346
Let's talk.

537
00:30:35,346 --> 00:30:35,706
Sit.

538
00:30:42,826 --> 00:30:44,466
Zhao Qian asked me to join your company

539
00:30:44,746 --> 00:30:46,346
mainly for the acquisition.

540
00:30:47,386 --> 00:30:49,386
He hopes that after the acquisition,

541
00:30:49,386 --> 00:30:50,866
there can be his own people on the team.

542
00:30:53,666 --> 00:30:55,546
What does he want you to do then?

543
00:30:56,306 --> 00:30:58,186
Mainly to be responsible
for the operation

544
00:30:58,186 --> 00:30:59,706
of Time Boyfriend after it goes live.

545
00:31:02,186 --> 00:31:03,106
But I thought

546
00:31:03,706 --> 00:31:05,586
he was planning
to make a normal acquisition.

547
00:31:07,346 --> 00:31:09,146
I didn't expect him
to have hackers attack the game.

548
00:31:39,306 --> 00:31:39,666
Hello,

549
00:31:40,146 --> 00:31:40,666
Mr. Zhao.

550
00:31:41,426 --> 00:31:42,706
Hasn't it already been acquired?

551
00:31:43,826 --> 00:31:44,706
Why did you get people

552
00:31:44,706 --> 00:31:45,706
to attack Time Boyfriend?

553
00:31:46,386 --> 00:31:48,346
This isn't something
you should be worrying about, right?

554
00:31:48,866 --> 00:31:50,706
Focus on your own work.

555
00:31:51,386 --> 00:31:51,826
By the way,

556
00:31:52,426 --> 00:31:53,866
when can I get the internal information

557
00:31:53,866 --> 00:31:54,906
of Time Boyfriend?

558
00:31:56,146 --> 00:31:56,826
I...

559
00:31:58,346 --> 00:31:59,666
I don't have the information you want.

560
00:32:15,706 --> 00:32:17,386
This sounds very outrageous,

561
00:32:18,146 --> 00:32:18,706
but

562
00:32:19,066 --> 00:32:20,986
it can't serve as direct evidence.

563
00:32:22,666 --> 00:32:22,986
Miss An,

564
00:32:24,146 --> 00:32:24,866
I'm sorry.

565
00:32:25,586 --> 00:32:26,946
Is there anything else I can do?

566
00:32:28,466 --> 00:32:29,706
I'm already very grateful

567
00:32:29,946 --> 00:32:31,106
that you came to tell me.

568
00:32:32,906 --> 00:32:35,666
Then, do you have any countermeasures?

569
00:32:39,386 --> 00:32:40,186
I'm still working on it.

570
00:32:41,066 --> 00:32:42,346
I have to think of a plan anyway.

571
00:32:48,386 --> 00:32:50,946
Chen Rui, if I need you to stand up,

572
00:32:51,426 --> 00:32:52,666
would you be willing to help me?

573
00:32:59,226 --> 00:33:01,626
I know this is not a small decision.

574
00:33:02,226 --> 00:33:04,146
But if you're willing to help me,

575
00:33:05,226 --> 00:33:06,426
I will do my best

576
00:33:06,666 --> 00:33:08,066
to protect your career.

577
00:33:10,666 --> 00:33:11,666
Think about it.

578
00:33:18,106 --> 00:33:19,666
Don't feel burdened.

579
00:33:19,866 --> 00:33:20,946
In any case,

580
00:33:22,106 --> 00:33:22,986
our door

581
00:33:22,986 --> 00:33:23,906
is always open to you.

582
00:33:30,826 --> 00:33:31,906
May I know

583
00:33:31,906 --> 00:33:33,466
why you were willing to come today

584
00:33:33,466 --> 00:33:34,466
to tell me these things?

585
00:33:37,426 --> 00:33:39,906
Actually, before I joined
the Gaishi Group,

586
00:33:40,306 --> 00:33:41,826
what I wanted to do was game planning.

587
00:33:42,906 --> 00:33:44,346
My dream was to make

588
00:33:44,346 --> 00:33:45,746
the best mobile game in my mind.

589
00:33:46,866 --> 00:33:48,826
So I joined the Gaishi Group
with great expectations.

590
00:33:49,826 --> 00:33:51,546
But after that,

591
00:33:52,466 --> 00:33:53,466
I never had the chance to get

592
00:33:53,466 --> 00:33:54,706
to the core content positions.

593
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:57,666
I'd been looking for many opportunities.

594
00:33:59,906 --> 00:34:02,106
Although my colleagues
didn't say it outright...

595
00:34:02,466 --> 00:34:03,666
They just didn't see it.

596
00:34:07,986 --> 00:34:09,666
But after I joined Gaishi Unparalleled,

597
00:34:10,186 --> 00:34:12,186
I found your company was different

598
00:34:12,586 --> 00:34:13,906
and you were different from Zhao Qian.

599
00:34:14,906 --> 00:34:17,306
Miss An, you are one
of the few people in the gaming industry

600
00:34:17,306 --> 00:34:19,626
who are persistent
and have a love for games.

601
00:34:20,386 --> 00:34:21,186
I really felt it

602
00:34:22,106 --> 00:34:23,346
when I worked with you.

603
00:34:26,066 --> 00:34:26,626
So

604
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:29,986
I really want you to be back.

605
00:34:34,146 --> 00:34:35,906
Don't be nervous. Have some tea.

606
00:34:49,826 --> 00:34:52,146
(Chen Jiaxi agreed
to cooperate with us.)

607
00:34:54,746 --> 00:34:56,106
Is there any good news?

608
00:35:02,906 --> 00:35:04,266
(Why do you have to leave?)

609
00:35:05,026 --> 00:35:06,146
(You said before)

610
00:35:07,226 --> 00:35:08,186
(no matter what others said,)

611
00:35:08,186 --> 00:35:09,226
(you wouldn't leave.)

612
00:35:11,946 --> 00:35:13,226
(If I didn't come back today...)

613
00:35:27,066 --> 00:35:28,066
Mr. Jiang,

614
00:35:28,986 --> 00:35:30,986
you already come to our company

615
00:35:30,986 --> 00:35:31,466
every day,

616
00:35:31,746 --> 00:35:34,666
and today you even want
to stay here until we get off work?

617
00:35:37,866 --> 00:35:39,386
There's so much fun here.

618
00:35:39,666 --> 00:35:41,346
I just like staying here.

619
00:35:55,986 --> 00:35:56,866
Bluebird

620
00:35:56,866 --> 00:35:58,466
seems to be quite popular recently.

621
00:35:59,586 --> 00:36:01,306
Was it dubbed by Mr. Heisha?

622
00:36:02,346 --> 00:36:03,346
I really have no idea.

623
00:36:04,466 --> 00:36:05,666
You must know.

624
00:36:06,066 --> 00:36:07,066
I really don't know.

625
00:36:07,746 --> 00:36:09,546
Tian Xin, are you off work?

626
00:36:10,986 --> 00:36:12,146
Okay, wait a minute.

627
00:36:13,786 --> 00:36:15,826
Do you have any activities after work?

628
00:36:19,026 --> 00:36:19,706
No?

629
00:36:21,226 --> 00:36:21,826
Then I...

630
00:36:21,826 --> 00:36:22,986
We're leaving.

631
00:36:23,826 --> 00:36:24,146
Wait.

632
00:36:24,626 --> 00:36:25,626
Goodbye, Mr. Jiang.

633
00:36:26,666 --> 00:36:26,946
Goodbye.

634
00:36:26,946 --> 00:36:27,546
Okay, goodbye.

635
00:36:28,026 --> 00:36:28,266
Bye.

636
00:36:31,466 --> 00:36:32,066
Bye.

637
00:36:39,866 --> 00:36:40,826
Aren't you leaving?

638
00:36:40,946 --> 00:36:42,466
We're waiting to lock the door.
