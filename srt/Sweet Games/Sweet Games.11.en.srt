134
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:21,249

- (Lansheng signed with us!)
- (Congratulations!)

141
00:14:25,729 --> 00:14:27,649
No wonder you have been
so low-key, Mr. Heisha.

142
00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:30,889
- With your looks, you could be a star.
- Thank you.

to join our program

145
00:14:33,009 --> 00:14:34,169

00:14:34,609 --> 00:14:36,129
Now let's introduce our program

00:14:36,129 --> 00:14:37,609
to both of you.

148
00:14:37,889 --> 00:14:39,529
The first thing we can assure you

149
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:42,169
is that our program
has obtained the relevant permissions.

150
00:14:42,569 --> 00:14:43,809
You can rest assured about that.

151

00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:05,609
What's going on? Is there a situation?

156
00:15:06,729 --> 00:15:07,769
Say it again, and I won't go.

157
00:15:07,849 --> 00:15:10,849
I'm just curious.

158
00:15:11,289 --> 00:15:12,489
If there's really a situation,

159
00:15:12,609 --> 00:15:15,489
tell me so I can be prepared.
Do you hear me?

160
00:15:16,969 --> 00:15:20,049
- What did you say? I'm leaving.
- You...

161
00:15:25,809 --> 00:15:28,729
To celebrate Fragment Time Boyfriend
finally getting an investment,

162
00:15:29,249 --> 00:15:31,169
I've decided to use the company's money

163
00:15:31,409 --> 00:15:33,489
for our first team-building event

164
00:15:33,489 --> 00:15:35,809
- since our company was founded!
- Team building!

165
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:38,929
Wait, Mr. Hu, team building?

166
00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:42,809
It's been two years.
Tell me what team building is.

167
00:15:43,129 --> 00:15:44,169
What does team building mean?

168
00:15:45,609 --> 00:15:47,809
Team building is
when the whole company gets together...

169
00:15:47,809 --> 00:15:49,489
Buddy, I know what team building is.

170
00:15:50,929 --> 00:15:53,609
Mr. Hu, we're not doing team building
on the weekend, are we?

171
00:15:53,609 --> 00:15:57,729
How can it be team building when it's
on the weekend? We'll go on Thursday.

172
00:15:58,729 --> 00:16:00,409
Come on. Let's see where we're going.

173
00:16:00,729 --> 00:16:02,249
- Guys, choose the location.
- Let's see.

174
00:16:02,689 --> 00:16:04,609
So we've picked three places.
This is the first one.

175
00:16:05,009 --> 00:16:06,809
Two of the three places have lakes,
and one doesn't.

176
00:16:06,809 --> 00:16:07,849
We follow the majority rule.

177
00:16:08,289 --> 00:16:09,969
That's right. Let's see them one by one.

178
00:16:10,409 --> 00:16:13,169
Team building
for two days and one night,

179
00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:15,249
without boyfriend?

180
00:16:16,929 --> 00:16:18,489
I like... I like this one.

181
00:16:18,489 --> 00:16:19,369
I don't like it.

182
00:16:20,049 --> 00:16:20,969
The process...

183
00:16:21,169 --> 00:16:22,529
Forget about it.

184
00:16:22,929 --> 00:16:25,249
An Ran, you can't do that.

185
00:16:26,169 --> 00:16:29,689
Yan Yue is a boyfriend
in our Fragment Time Boyfriend.

186
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:33,209
Shouldn't he go?

187
00:16:33,689 --> 00:16:34,889
Just forget about it.

188
00:16:35,689 --> 00:16:37,329
Why don't you send him a message to ask?

189
00:16:38,969 --> 00:16:40,809
If you don't ask, I will...

190
00:16:41,689 --> 00:16:42,609
Is this place okay?

191
00:16:46,369 --> 00:16:49,169
(Are you free for our company's
team building on Thursday?)

192
00:16:56,009 --> 00:16:58,649
Let me make it clear.
Even if Yan Yue goes,

193
00:16:58,929 --> 00:17:02,249
he's going as a voice actor
that our company works with.

194
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:03,969
Don't spill the beans.

195
00:17:04,489 --> 00:17:06,289
What are you worried about?

196
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:12,649
I just want to keep a low profile.

197
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:14,609
Keep a low profile?

198
00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:17,369
Alright. What did he say?

199
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:19,169
(Okay, I'll definitely go.)

200
00:17:19,409 --> 00:17:21,489
You see? He said he'd definitely go.

201
00:17:26,529 --> 00:17:28,489
(Are you off work? My car is fixed.)

202
00:17:28,489 --> 00:17:29,569
(I'll pick you up.)

203
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:30,649
You can take photos anywhere.

204
00:17:31,209 --> 00:17:32,089
Mr. Heisha?

205
00:17:34,969 --> 00:17:36,169
Yan Yue, how come you're here?

206
00:17:39,649 --> 00:17:42,489
I came to pick up An Ran from work.
Let's go.

207
00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:49,209
Yes, we agreed. That's right.

208
00:17:57,089 --> 00:17:59,569
We're leaving. Mr. Heisha, let's go.

209
00:18:02,609 --> 00:18:04,169
- We're leaving first.
- Bye. Take care.

210
00:18:04,449 --> 00:18:05,369
Bye, Mr. Heisha.

211
00:18:08,489 --> 00:18:09,489
Something's off about them.

212
00:18:10,129 --> 00:18:11,249
I think so.

213
00:18:11,529 --> 00:18:13,649
Yao, you should know something, right?

214
00:18:13,649 --> 00:18:15,649
Don't ask me. I don't know anything.

215
00:18:16,609 --> 00:18:19,769
Why didn't they take us
if they were going out to eat?

216
00:18:22,009 --> 00:18:22,889
It's no big deal.

217
00:18:23,489 --> 00:18:25,529
I'll treat you to a meal without them.

218
00:18:25,969 --> 00:18:26,889
Sounds good!

219
00:18:26,889 --> 00:18:28,849
Let's discuss the location
while eating. Let's go.

220
00:18:28,849 --> 00:18:29,769
Mr. Hu, you are the best.

221
00:18:29,769 --> 00:18:31,009
Which one did you finally choose?

222
00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:40,409
Let's go.

223
00:18:46,849 --> 00:18:48,929
Why did you decide to pick me up today?

224
00:18:55,049 --> 00:18:58,609
Don't you want anyone
to know about our relationship?

225
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:01,729
How could that be?

226
00:19:01,729 --> 00:19:03,129
What are you thinking about?

227
00:19:05,369 --> 00:19:06,729
You're overthinking it.

228
00:19:08,969 --> 00:19:11,729
How about we listen to some music?
I'll turn the radio on.

229
00:19:13,489 --> 00:19:15,249
(My boyfriend and I
have been dating for a week.)

230
00:19:15,849 --> 00:19:17,729
(I've recently noticed
that he always keeps his distance)

231
00:19:17,729 --> 00:19:19,169
(from me in front of his friends.)

232
00:19:19,689 --> 00:19:22,569
(I feel like he doesn't want
to make our relationship public.)

233
00:19:22,969 --> 00:19:24,249
(What should I do?)

234
00:19:25,009 --> 00:19:28,369
Yeah, what should I do?

235
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,072
(Radio Channel)

236
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:37,929
(First of all, thank you for your call.)

237
00:19:38,409 --> 00:19:41,329
(If your boyfriend
doesn't want others to know)

238
00:19:41,329 --> 00:19:43,209
(that you two are dating,)

239
00:19:43,569 --> 00:19:46,569
(I suggest you have
a serious talk with him.)

240
00:19:46,689 --> 00:19:48,089
(You should first ask him)

241
00:19:48,329 --> 00:19:50,729
(why he doesn't want
to acknowledge your relationship.)

242
00:19:50,769 --> 00:19:55,009
- Why is that?
- (I see. Thank you.)

243
00:19:55,009 --> 00:19:57,369
(You're welcome.
Communication is very necessary)

244
00:19:57,369 --> 00:19:58,449
(between two people.)

245
00:19:58,449 --> 00:19:59,569
(He should clarify it for you.)

246
00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:02,129
(It's useless for you
to worry on your own.)

247
00:20:05,489 --> 00:20:08,129
Recent these radio shows

248
00:20:08,129 --> 00:20:09,769
are particularly meaningless.

249
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,289
They're all talking nonsense.

250
00:20:13,009 --> 00:20:15,649
Some of the content
is still quite meaningful.

251
00:20:25,089 --> 00:20:27,369
You are driving a bit fast.

252
00:20:52,369 --> 00:20:56,249
Ran, congratulations
on your successful second beta test.

253
00:20:56,609 --> 00:20:57,729
Didn't we agree before

254
00:20:57,969 --> 00:21:00,849
to give you a bouquet
on every important day?

255
00:21:04,849 --> 00:21:07,529
There's no such thing. I don't need it.

256
00:21:09,089 --> 00:21:10,009
Yan Yue, let's go.

257
00:21:13,529 --> 00:21:15,729
This is between her and me.
No need for you to interfere.

258
00:21:16,969 --> 00:21:18,969
An Ran's matters are mine.

259
00:21:19,849 --> 00:21:20,849
Don't bother her again.

260
00:21:22,169 --> 00:21:22,809
Ran.

261
00:21:26,969 --> 00:21:27,729
What are you doing?

262
00:21:33,529 --> 00:21:36,409
You want to compete with me?
You're not my match.

263
00:21:38,249 --> 00:21:39,649
A young man like you

264
00:21:39,849 --> 00:21:41,649
can only be
a fleeting presence in her life.

265
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,129
You can't take care of her.

266
00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:45,649
Even if she doesn't choose me
in the future,

267
00:21:46,009 --> 00:21:47,849
there are so many excellent men
in this world.

268
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:51,769
She won't choose you in the end.

269
00:21:58,129 --> 00:22:00,249
What? Do you dare hit me?

270
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:03,009
Yan Yue!

271
00:22:04,649 --> 00:22:06,049
No one is a toy that you can summon

272
00:22:06,049 --> 00:22:07,369
or dismiss at will.

273
00:22:08,169 --> 00:22:09,649
If you cared about

274
00:22:09,649 --> 00:22:10,609
An Ran even a little,

275
00:22:11,009 --> 00:22:11,969
you wouldn't have left her

276
00:22:11,969 --> 00:22:13,169
and then come back to pester her.

277
00:22:16,249 --> 00:22:17,249
From now on,

278
00:22:19,049 --> 00:22:20,889
don't let me see you harassing An Ran.

279
00:22:27,369 --> 00:22:27,969
Let's go.

280
00:22:36,449 --> 00:22:39,009
If that guy comes
to harass you again, tell me.

281
00:22:42,129 --> 00:22:45,009
I'm your boyfriend. I will protect you.

282
00:22:47,649 --> 00:22:49,489
You were pretty cool just now.

283
00:22:53,529 --> 00:22:54,409
I'm going home first.

284
00:22:55,529 --> 00:22:57,209

Are you moving?

305
00:24:15,249 --> 00:24:17,129

You're carrying so much stuff.
It's so heavy.

00:25:01,409 --> 00:25:02,529
Wu, and Changfeng are on it,

318
00:25:03,009 --> 00:25:04,249
whose minibus is it?

319
00:25:05,769 --> 00:25:07,249
- Whose?
- There's.

320
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:12,249
Because it's "there's a minibus".

321
00:25:14,489 --> 00:25:15,169
Very funny.

322
00:25:17,529 --> 00:25:18,769
- Amazing.
- Let me tell a joke.

323
00:25:19,129 --> 00:25:21,009
I have a super funny one.

324
00:25:21,369 --> 00:25:24,529
Yan Yue, I've been meaning to ask you.

325
00:25:24,969 --> 00:25:26,769
How did you get Zhou Qing to agree?

326
00:25:28,249 --> 00:25:29,169
I agreed to his invitation

327
00:25:29,489 --> 00:25:31,329
to participate in We Who Love Voices.

328
00:25:32,889 --> 00:25:36,849
So you agreed to go to the show
to help me?

329
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:40,289
Not entirely.

330
00:25:42,129 --> 00:25:44,529
Jiang Shan and the others also wanted me
to join in some activities.

331
00:25:47,089 --> 00:25:49,249
Yan Yue, I...

332
00:25:54,729 --> 00:25:57,529
- Let's talk when we get off later.
- Okay.

333
00:26:07,929 --> 00:26:09,049
The lollipop tastes good, right?

334
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:15,209
What does the place
for our team building look like?

335
00:26:16,129 --> 00:26:17,249
You'll know when we get there.

336
00:26:20,169 --> 00:26:23,369
What do you think of the new draft
I drew a few days ago?

337
00:26:26,609 --> 00:26:28,009
It's pretty good
but still needs changes.

338
00:26:29,289 --> 00:26:30,769
Is that so?

339
00:26:31,529 --> 00:26:32,529
That's how you talk?

340
00:26:33,249 --> 00:26:34,729
Didn't you ask for my opinion?

341
00:26:34,729 --> 00:26:37,129
Okay. I won't ask anymore. I will sleep.

342
00:27:34,089 --> 00:27:36,529
- You...
- Don't sleep all sprawled out, okay?

343
00:28:17,409 --> 00:28:20,489
Mr. Hu, are we here to shepherd?

344
00:28:20,729 --> 00:28:22,889
We surely can't order takeout here.

345
00:28:23,009 --> 00:28:26,969
Surprise or not? Two days and one night!

346
00:28:27,049 --> 00:28:29,249
We can be far away
from the concrete jungle

347
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:30,969
and get close to nature.

348
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:34,769
Mr. Hu, didn't our company just revive?

349
00:28:35,529 --> 00:28:36,769
Yes, we have a great future.

350
00:28:36,969 --> 00:28:38,889
So why did you bring us
here in the middle of nowhere?

351
00:28:39,449 --> 00:28:41,729
How can you say that?

352
00:28:42,249 --> 00:28:44,249
It's a natural oxygen bar. Very fancy.

353
00:28:45,289 --> 00:28:47,009
Come on. Let's set up the tents first.

354
00:28:47,729 --> 00:28:48,889
Come on.

355
00:28:52,569 --> 00:28:53,609
Did you find this camping place

356
00:28:53,609 --> 00:28:55,289
for Hu Yingjun?

357
00:28:55,529 --> 00:28:58,769
This place is not really

358
00:28:59,169 --> 00:29:00,649
- Hold one corner each.
- for camping.

359
00:29:03,049 --> 00:29:06,129
Location is not the problem.
I'm more curious about

360
00:29:06,129 --> 00:29:10,289
- Go in. You, stand there.
- who you are sharing a tent with.

361
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,129
Over there. Turn it upside down.

362
00:29:13,649 --> 00:29:16,369
Mr. Yan, please help!

363
00:29:16,369 --> 00:29:19,289
- We need help.
- Coming.

364
00:29:33,529 --> 00:29:35,569
Why am I tired already?

365
00:29:36,209 --> 00:29:37,289
Cheer up.

366
00:29:37,289 --> 00:29:41,489
There's not much time left
for you to fight. Three days.

367
00:29:43,489 --> 00:29:45,489
Why do I find this so difficult?

368
00:29:45,649 --> 00:29:46,889
He couldn't get me at all.

369
00:29:46,889 --> 00:29:49,249
Is it that he couldn't get it
or didn't want to?

370
00:29:50,009 --> 00:29:52,249
Why do I feel
that he is not that stupid?

371
00:29:55,729 --> 00:29:56,769
I underestimated him.

372
00:29:57,289 --> 00:29:59,649
I think you just didn't prepare.

373
00:29:59,889 --> 00:30:01,609
Did you prepare?

374
00:30:02,889 --> 00:30:04,889
So why are you staying here with me now?

375
00:30:05,729 --> 00:30:06,849
Why don't you go over?

376
00:30:07,089 --> 00:30:08,609
What nonsense are you talking about?

377
00:30:09,329 --> 00:30:11,129
We haven't gone public yet.

378
00:30:11,129 --> 00:30:13,529
Just say it. We're all adults.

379
00:30:13,769 --> 00:30:15,169
There's nothing to be shy about.

380
00:30:19,569 --> 00:30:22,249
Sometimes I feel guilty
when I'm with him.

381
00:30:24,569 --> 00:30:26,649
You just think too much.

382
00:30:27,129 --> 00:30:29,249
Dating is not like doing a math problem.

383
00:30:29,649 --> 00:30:31,249
You need to be calm.

384
00:30:33,129 --> 00:30:36,529
I think Yan Yue is very brave for you.

385
00:30:36,969 --> 00:30:39,129
And you're the one who's hesitating.

386
00:30:39,409 --> 00:30:41,489
I don't really agree with your behavior.

387
00:30:43,649 --> 00:30:45,769
We're the same.

388
00:30:45,769 --> 00:30:47,609
Why are you giving me a lecture here?

389
00:30:48,609 --> 00:30:50,249
I'm not like you.

390
00:30:51,689 --> 00:30:53,969
Come on. Let's gather up.

391
00:30:54,009 --> 00:30:54,849
Then I'm going over.

392
00:31:02,249 --> 00:31:03,249
Well...

393
00:31:03,329 --> 00:31:06,449
I've prepared two options
for today's activity.

394
00:31:06,769 --> 00:31:08,849
- The first is fishing.
- No.

395
00:31:08,849 --> 00:31:10,049
Then let's do the second one.

396
00:31:10,889 --> 00:31:11,729
How about frisbee?

397
00:31:12,129 --> 00:31:12,969
Let's go fishing.

398
00:31:13,449 --> 00:31:15,289
No, this is fun.

399
00:31:15,409 --> 00:31:16,729
We don't know how to play frisbee.

400
00:31:16,849 --> 00:31:17,889
I can teach you.

401
00:31:21,009 --> 00:31:22,889
I want to play frisbee.
Can you teach me?

402
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:29,529
You? Aren't you afraid
of getting tanned?

403
00:31:29,529 --> 00:31:30,529
You're talking nonsense again.

404
00:31:30,849 --> 00:31:33,289
I'm naturally beautiful.
How could I possibly get tanned?

405
00:31:36,009 --> 00:31:37,009
I should go fishing.

406
00:31:37,769 --> 00:31:39,849
Fishing is fine too. Can you teach me?

407
00:31:40,249 --> 00:31:42,329
Why do you want to learn everything?
Are you Miss Curious?

408
00:31:43,489 --> 00:31:45,249
- Let's go.
- Yan Yue, come with us.

409
00:31:46,289 --> 00:31:47,369
- You guys go play.
- An Ran.

410
00:31:47,369 --> 00:31:48,289
- Buddy.
- Come on.

411
00:31:48,409 --> 00:31:49,969
- I'm not going.
- Let's go.

412
00:32:19,129 --> 00:32:20,009
Why

413
00:32:20,889 --> 00:32:23,409
don't you want others
to know we're together?

414
00:32:30,409 --> 00:32:34,729
I can see that.
Just tell me what you think.

415
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,369
I have always thought

416
00:32:41,409 --> 00:32:43,849
a serious relationship
takes time and care.

417
00:32:44,609 --> 00:32:46,489
I don't want to rush it

418
00:32:47,489 --> 00:32:50,129
or let some external factors

419
00:32:50,129 --> 00:32:52,089
affect our relationship
in the beginning.

420
00:32:53,249 --> 00:32:55,329
I also think stabilizing it
before making it public

421
00:32:56,209 --> 00:32:58,369
is a way to protect our relationship.

422
00:32:58,649 --> 00:33:00,889
I want our relationship
to last a long time.

423
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:07,969
- I understand.
- So fast?

424
00:33:08,529 --> 00:33:10,169
If you don't want to tell everyone,

425
00:33:11,369 --> 00:33:12,769
then let's just keep it as it is.

426
00:33:15,529 --> 00:33:16,809
This is not your problem.

427
00:33:17,609 --> 00:33:18,969
You don't need to change.

428
00:33:20,129 --> 00:33:21,169
Let me come closer to you.

429
00:33:22,009 --> 00:33:24,369
Together, we'll eliminate
others' interference.

430
00:33:29,489 --> 00:33:30,409
Why are you looking at me?

431
00:33:32,169 --> 00:33:36,409
- You are more mature than me.
- Are you mature?

432
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:25,529
Yingjun,

433
00:34:26,849 --> 00:34:29,369
we've been fishing from day to night,

434
00:34:29,769 --> 00:34:31,889
and you haven't caught a single one.

435
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:33,889
The fish is about to bite the bait.

436
00:34:35,969 --> 00:34:37,369
You need to talk to me.

437
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:38,769
Otherwise, I'll fall asleep.

438
00:34:38,849 --> 00:34:40,769
Keep your voice down.
Don't scare the fish away.

439
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:48,129
Do you think
it's quite beautiful here at night?

440
00:34:53,169 --> 00:34:53,769
Yeah.

441
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:58,809
La nuit est belle.

442
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,569
- What are you saying?
- French.

443
00:35:06,169 --> 00:35:09,569
Are you cursing me
because I don't understand French?

444
00:35:12,489 --> 00:35:16,609
I said "The night is so beautiful".

445
00:35:23,409 --> 00:35:26,089
- Can you teach me something simpler?
- Do you want to learn?

446
00:35:30,089 --> 00:35:32,809
- Je t'aime.
- What?

447
00:35:35,369 --> 00:35:37,609
Je t'aime.

448
00:35:40,409 --> 00:35:45,329
The ta me?

449
00:35:46,249 --> 00:35:47,089
Smart.

450
00:35:52,289 --> 00:35:53,489
Ta me.

451
00:35:58,329 --> 00:36:00,569
Why don't you ask what this means?

452
00:36:01,529 --> 00:36:05,889
- What does it mean?
- I love you.

453
00:36:13,729 --> 00:36:17,609
Lady, can I buy you a drink?

454
00:36:18,569 --> 00:36:19,609
How do you say this in French?

455
00:36:20,009 --> 00:36:21,529
Just think about it.
When I walk into a bar

456
00:36:22,009 --> 00:36:23,649
and say this to someone,
I will be so cool!

457
00:36:28,329 --> 00:36:28,649
Get lost!

458
00:36:39,329 --> 00:36:41,049
Bai Mengyao, the fish is hooked!

459
00:36:41,289 --> 00:36:44,889
Bai Mengyao, the fish is hooked!
Bai Mengyao, the fish!

460
00:36:45,809 --> 00:36:47,489
Cheers!

461
00:36:47,489 --> 00:36:48,809
Alright. Have a taste of my cooking.

462
00:36:49,529 --> 00:36:50,809
The skewers are here, and...

463
00:36:51,529 --> 00:36:53,369
This meat is really tasty.
You can try it.

464
00:36:53,489 --> 00:36:55,089
Who ate half and brought it over?

465
00:36:56,649 --> 00:36:57,849
It must be Miss An who took a bite.

466
00:36:58,089 --> 00:36:59,569
I didn't.

467
00:36:59,809 --> 00:37:00,849
She did eat it.

468
00:37:07,889 --> 00:37:08,529
Come on.

469
00:38:20,809 --> 00:38:22,129
Come on! Cheers!

470
00:38:22,129 --> 00:38:25,769
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

471
00:38:29,249 --> 00:38:32,529
- Eat quickly. Don't let it get cold.
- Try it.

472
00:38:52,049 --> 00:38:53,329
Let me introduce him to you all.

473
00:38:55,929 --> 00:38:57,649
This is my boyfriend, Yan Yue.

474
00:39:05,729 --> 00:39:07,809
Wait a minute.
What's going on with you two?

475
00:39:07,809 --> 00:39:09,569
An Ran, well done!

476
00:39:09,729 --> 00:39:12,369
Actually, Miss An, it's not big news.

477
00:39:12,369 --> 00:39:13,489
We knew a long time ago.

478
00:39:13,889 --> 00:39:15,049
Since you now make it public,

479
00:39:15,049 --> 00:39:16,009
we won't pretend anymore.

480
00:39:16,089 --> 00:39:17,169
When we see Mr. Heisha again,

481
00:39:17,169 --> 00:39:18,369
we can just act normally.

482
00:39:18,369 --> 00:39:20,369
We've been waiting for you
to announce it officially

483
00:39:20,369 --> 00:39:22,769
since we knew about your relationship.

484
00:39:22,769 --> 00:39:24,009
When did you know?

485
00:39:24,369 --> 00:39:25,529
Even I knew it.

486
00:39:26,769 --> 00:39:29,089
An Ran, give him a kiss.

487
00:39:29,089 --> 00:39:31,009
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

488
00:39:31,009 --> 00:39:32,649
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

489
00:39:32,729 --> 00:39:34,089
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

490
00:39:34,249 --> 00:39:39,809
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

491
00:40:07,089 --> 00:40:09,169
Mr. Yan, this is your package.
Please sign for it.

492
00:40:21,889 --> 00:40:23,729
It was badly broken,

493
00:40:24,209 --> 00:40:25,209
and yet you said it's nothing.
