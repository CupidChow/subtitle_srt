He looks good.

So handsome.

31
00:02:37,186 --> 00:02:38,506
He's really tall.

32
00:02:38,506 --> 00:02:39,786
Yeah, tall and handsome.

33
00:02:39,786 --> 00:02:40,466
Really?

34
00:02:59,226 --> 00:03:00,506
Excuse me, it's taken.

35
00:03:00,506 --> 00:03:00,946
It's taken.

36
00:03:00,946 --> 00:03:01,746
It's me.

37
00:03:02,146 --> 00:03:02,626
Who?

38
00:03:05,906 --> 00:03:06,706
It's me.

39
00:03:06,706 --> 00:03:07,946
Little Princess.

40
00:03:07,946 --> 00:03:08,912
Why are you wearing this?

41
00:03:08,912 --> 00:03:09,968
Why are you dressed like this?

42
00:03:11,186 --> 00:03:12,146
I just think that

43
00:03:12,146 --> 00:03:13,866
Mr. Jiang has seen
so many pretty girls.

44
00:03:13,866 --> 00:03:15,706
I can attract his attention

45
00:03:15,706 --> 00:03:17,226
if I wear the sunglasses like his.

46
00:03:17,226 --> 00:03:18,306
Good idea.

47
00:03:18,946 --> 00:03:20,306
I just got this for you.

48
00:03:20,946 --> 00:03:22,146
Thank you so much.

00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:27,146
Dear fans, welcome

51
00:03:27,146 --> 00:03:29,506
to Mr. Jiang's reading club to celebrate

52
00:03:29,506 --> 00:03:31,186
the tenth anniversary of his debut.

53
00:03:31,626 --> 00:03:33,506
Is anyone else coming
apart from Mr. Jiang?

54
00:03:33,626 --> 00:03:34,706
We were just saying

55
00:03:34,706 --> 00:03:36,626
that No.22 just came out of the bathroom

56
00:03:36,626 --> 00:03:38,706
and saw Mr. Jiang and Heisha.

57
00:03:38,706 --> 00:03:39,026
Yeah.

58
00:03:39,026 --> 00:03:39,466
Who?

59
00:03:39,946 --> 00:03:41,026
Heisha.

60
00:03:41,866 --> 00:03:43,426
I happened to hear them talking

61
00:03:43,426 --> 00:03:45,066
and realized that it was Heisha.

62
00:03:45,346 --> 00:03:47,146
Heisha rarely shows up in public,

63
00:03:47,426 --> 00:03:48,306
but he's so handsome.

64
00:03:48,306 --> 00:03:50,466
A rising dubbing actor, Mr. Heisha.

65
00:03:50,466 --> 00:03:51,186
Welcome them.

66
00:03:51,186 --> 00:03:52,026
Where are you going?

67
00:03:52,226 --> 00:03:53,866
Sit down. It's starting.

68
00:03:54,626 --> 00:03:55,186
Sit.

69
00:03:58,346 --> 00:03:59,506
So handsome.

70
00:04:00,346 --> 00:04:01,946
Hello, everyone. I'm Jiang Shan.

71
00:04:04,626 --> 00:04:06,466
Welcome to my reading club

72
00:04:06,466 --> 00:04:09,226
to celebrate
the tenth anniversary of my debut.

73
00:04:09,746 --> 00:04:12,226
Meanwhile, I'd like to show my gratitude

74
00:04:12,226 --> 00:04:14,226
to my buddy, Mr. Heisha,

75
00:04:14,226 --> 00:04:15,506
for coming to support me.

76
00:04:16,706 --> 00:04:17,906
Hello, I'm Heisha.

77
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:20,426
So handsome.

78
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,186
So handsome.

79
00:04:21,186 --> 00:04:24,026
By the time I heard my mom calling me

80
00:04:24,026 --> 00:04:25,466
with her suppressed voice,

81
00:04:25,746 --> 00:04:28,146
I had already reached
the window outside the door.

82
00:04:28,466 --> 00:04:31,066
The rainwater
streaming down the eaves...

83
00:04:40,186 --> 00:04:42,306
I saw someone in a cap approaching

84
00:04:42,306 --> 00:04:44,906
a common trash can by the road.

85
00:04:46,466 --> 00:04:47,626
I recognized her.

86
00:04:48,176 --> 00:04:49,520
I knew it was her.

87
00:05:03,706 --> 00:05:04,786
What's wrong? Feeling sick?

88
00:05:04,786 --> 00:05:07,426
To thank you for your constant support,

89
00:05:07,426 --> 00:05:09,906
we're picking two lucky fans

90
00:05:09,906 --> 00:05:11,346
to come on stage

91
00:05:11,346 --> 00:05:12,786
for a group photo.

92
00:05:12,786 --> 00:05:14,306
Group photo.

93
00:05:14,306 --> 00:05:18,626
The first lucky fan is...

94
00:05:19,728 --> 00:05:21,626
Green, No.28.

95
00:05:23,186 --> 00:05:25,066
It's me. I'm No.28.

96
00:05:25,066 --> 00:05:26,226
Go ahead.

97
00:05:26,466 --> 00:05:27,506
Come on.

98
00:05:28,066 --> 00:05:29,066
Just like that?

99
00:05:29,066 --> 00:05:31,306
Three, two, one.

100
00:05:31,626 --> 00:05:34,186
Okay, Mr. Heisha will draw

101
00:05:34,186 --> 00:05:36,706
the second lucky number.

102
00:05:36,906 --> 00:05:37,706
Come on.

103
00:05:39,346 --> 00:05:40,506
Red, No.81.

104
00:05:41,066 --> 00:05:42,746
Aren't yours red? Let me see.

105
00:05:43,346 --> 00:05:44,346
No.81.

106
00:05:44,784 --> 00:05:45,744
Here.

107
00:05:45,744 --> 00:05:46,384
Little Princess.

108
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:46,896
Hurry up.

109
00:05:46,896 --> 00:05:47,984
Come on.

110
00:05:49,626 --> 00:05:50,746
Go, Little Princess.

111
00:05:51,066 --> 00:05:51,346
Go.

112
00:05:51,346 --> 00:05:52,146
Hurry up.

113
00:05:55,946 --> 00:05:58,626
She's quite mysterious.

114
00:06:03,746 --> 00:06:06,466
Isn't it a pity
to take a photo with your idol

115
00:06:06,506 --> 00:06:08,346
without showing your face?

116
00:06:08,906 --> 00:06:09,906
Please rest assured.

117
00:06:09,906 --> 00:06:12,186
This event is
only for internal purposes.

118
00:06:12,186 --> 00:06:14,146
Nothing will be posted online.

119
00:06:14,186 --> 00:06:15,066
Please rest assured.

120
00:06:15,746 --> 00:06:17,306
Or maybe you're hiding

121
00:06:17,746 --> 00:06:18,906
a secret or something.

122
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:22,426
Take off your mask, okay?

123
00:06:22,746 --> 00:06:23,906
Take it off, Little Princess.

124
00:06:23,906 --> 00:06:24,626
Cheer for her.

125
00:06:24,946 --> 00:06:25,706
Cheer for her.

126
00:06:25,706 --> 00:06:26,506
Come on, Little Princess

127
00:06:26,506 --> 00:06:27,506
Cheer for her.

128
00:06:27,506 --> 00:06:28,866
Take off your mask.

129
00:06:33,186 --> 00:06:33,626
It's you?

130
00:06:34,786 --> 00:06:35,346
An...

131
00:06:36,186 --> 00:06:36,906
An Ran?

132
00:06:37,626 --> 00:06:38,626
What a coincidence.

133
00:06:38,626 --> 00:06:39,546
Let me introduce her.

134
00:06:39,546 --> 00:06:40,706
She is

135
00:06:40,786 --> 00:06:43,026
a hard-core fan of Mr. Heisha.

136
00:06:43,026 --> 00:06:44,386
What a coincidence.

137
00:06:44,546 --> 00:06:46,146
Come on, give her a clap

138
00:06:48,026 --> 00:06:48,786
Alright.

139
00:06:49,226 --> 00:06:50,346
Let's take a photo.

140
00:06:50,906 --> 00:06:53,106
Three, two, one.

141
00:06:54,346 --> 00:06:55,706
Way to go, Little Princess.

142
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:57,786
So you've switched to another fan club.

143
00:06:58,106 --> 00:07:00,466
Tell us the truth,
when did you betray Mr. Jiang?

144
00:07:01,026 --> 00:07:02,106
I didn't.

145
00:07:02,346 --> 00:07:02,986
Stop denying it.

146
00:07:04,226 --> 00:07:07,666
My love for Mr. Jiang can withstand
the test of heaven and earth.

147
00:07:07,906 --> 00:07:10,706
I'm just fooling around with Heisha.

148
00:07:11,106 --> 00:07:12,786
So you know each other for real.

149
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:15,106
Don't tell me

150
00:07:16,386 --> 00:07:19,106
he's the neighbor
who's six years younger than you.

151
00:07:19,226 --> 00:07:20,466
- Six years?
- Neighbor?

152
00:07:21,106 --> 00:07:22,226
It's really him?

153
00:07:22,906 --> 00:07:23,346
You...

154
00:07:23,346 --> 00:07:25,346
Way to go, Little Princess.

155
00:07:25,586 --> 00:07:27,106
I didn't expect that.

156
00:08:01,226 --> 00:08:02,106
What a coincidence.

157
00:08:07,346 --> 00:08:09,786
Thanks to me, you finally
took a photo with your idol.

158
00:08:11,786 --> 00:08:12,786
Thank you so much.

159
00:08:16,906 --> 00:08:18,026
Want an autograph?

160
00:08:19,346 --> 00:08:20,586
No, thanks.

161
00:08:22,906 --> 00:08:23,786
Your bag is heavy?

162
00:08:24,786 --> 00:08:25,386
Not really.

163
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:26,786
Let me help you.

164
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,904
What did I do to you? What do you want?

165
00:08:31,106 --> 00:08:32,226
Didn't you tell me that

166
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,026
you like Heisha

167
00:08:34,346 --> 00:08:35,386
instead of Jiang Shan?

168
00:08:37,026 --> 00:08:39,546
Could it be that you like both?

169
00:08:43,706 --> 00:08:44,346
Well.

170
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,266
Only kids make choices.

171
00:09:23,586 --> 00:09:25,786
I just pretended to be a fan.

172
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,466
Why is he so jealous?

173
00:09:32,546 --> 00:09:34,386
I like Jiang Shan, so what?

174
00:09:34,386 --> 00:09:35,986
Why can't I like him?

175
00:10:05,811 --> 00:10:08,178
(JS Sound Art Studio)

176
00:10:08,346 --> 00:10:09,706
Thanks for the hard work.

177
00:10:09,706 --> 00:10:10,346
Thanks.

178
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:27,466
Hello.

179
00:10:28,986 --> 00:10:29,586
Hi, there.

180
00:10:29,872 --> 00:10:32,106
M-Mr. Jiang. Please take a seat.

181
00:10:35,026 --> 00:10:35,906
Lately...

182
00:10:35,906 --> 00:10:36,906
I want bubble tea.

183
00:10:41,546 --> 00:10:42,466
I'll get a takeout.

184
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:44,546
It's too slow.

185
00:10:44,826 --> 00:10:45,786
Go get it on hand.

186
00:10:49,026 --> 00:10:50,386
What would you like to drink?

187
00:10:50,706 --> 00:10:52,826
No sugar. Same for him.

188
00:10:54,546 --> 00:10:55,386
No sugar. The same.

189
00:11:05,906 --> 00:11:07,146
Why did you come today?

190
00:11:08,026 --> 00:11:09,808
Why can't I come?

191
00:11:11,226 --> 00:11:15,026
I heard that someone
has been nesting in the studio.

192
00:11:15,226 --> 00:11:17,466
It's so rare.
I have to see it with my own eyes.

193
00:11:21,008 --> 00:11:21,826
Shan.

194
00:11:22,786 --> 00:11:24,786
There's a new hotpot restaurant nearby.

195
00:11:25,026 --> 00:11:26,106
Shall we try it?

196
00:11:27,226 --> 00:11:28,906
I'm avoiding spice these days.

197
00:11:29,346 --> 00:11:30,226
Avoiding spice.

198
00:11:32,466 --> 00:11:34,226
Nice sunglasses you've got there.

199
00:11:34,826 --> 00:11:36,466
What are you trying to say?

200
00:11:37,386 --> 00:11:39,026
Come on. Sit here.

201
00:11:47,826 --> 00:11:49,106
I have a friend.

202
00:11:49,586 --> 00:11:51,986
Yeah, you have a friend.

203
00:11:52,226 --> 00:11:53,106
Be serious.

204
00:11:53,106 --> 00:11:53,666
Okay.

205
00:11:54,106 --> 00:11:55,666
You have a friend. Go on.

206
00:11:57,146 --> 00:11:58,146
I have a friend.

207
00:11:58,666 --> 00:11:59,826
He asked me some questions.

208
00:12:00,226 --> 00:12:01,986
I'm consulting you because you're

209
00:12:01,986 --> 00:12:02,706
more experienced.

210
00:12:04,346 --> 00:12:05,386
My friend

211
00:12:05,706 --> 00:12:07,466
ran into his goddess in college,

212
00:12:07,826 --> 00:12:08,986
but this goddess

213
00:12:09,226 --> 00:12:10,466
has changed a lot.

214
00:12:10,986 --> 00:12:12,666
And she doesn't remember him at all.

215
00:12:13,026 --> 00:12:14,026
Do you think

216
00:12:14,466 --> 00:12:15,586
he should tell her

217
00:12:15,586 --> 00:12:16,666
that he's been into her?

218
00:12:17,226 --> 00:12:18,826
Of course not.

219
00:12:19,146 --> 00:12:19,826
Why not?

220
00:12:23,226 --> 00:12:24,906
Manipulation, get it?

221
00:12:25,386 --> 00:12:26,226
Manipulation?

222
00:12:28,226 --> 00:12:29,986
You know why
I'm always wearing sunglasses?

223
00:12:31,056 --> 00:12:32,146
To be mysterious.

224
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:33,466
To be mysterious?

225
00:12:34,346 --> 00:12:36,826
Being mysterious

226
00:12:37,106 --> 00:12:39,826
has the power of making people curious.

227
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:41,546
- Curious.
- Such curiosity somehow brings

228
00:12:41,906 --> 00:12:44,386
the dull and stagnant relationship
between men and women

229
00:12:44,386 --> 00:12:47,106
to a high level called love.

230
00:12:47,586 --> 00:12:48,106
Look.

231
00:12:48,986 --> 00:12:50,706
That girl doesn't remember you.

232
00:12:50,826 --> 00:12:52,146
S-S-Sorry.

233
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,706
She doesn't remember t-that guy.

234
00:12:53,826 --> 00:12:54,266
Right?

235
00:12:54,786 --> 00:12:55,346
And

236
00:12:55,986 --> 00:12:57,146
she's changed a lot.

237
00:12:58,226 --> 00:12:59,586
First, we must figure out

238
00:12:59,586 --> 00:13:01,346
why she has changed so much.

239
00:13:02,466 --> 00:13:05,706
Knowing your enemy and yourself
is the key to winning.

240
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:08,146
If you don't get to know...

241
00:13:08,146 --> 00:13:09,266
It's not me.

242
00:13:09,266 --> 00:13:09,906
Sorry.

243
00:13:10,826 --> 00:13:12,226
Y-Your friend

244
00:13:12,346 --> 00:13:13,986
shouldn't rush to confess

245
00:13:13,986 --> 00:13:16,986
before he figures out
anything about this girl.

246
00:13:16,986 --> 00:13:17,546
Then...

247
00:13:23,706 --> 00:13:24,666
Mr. Jiang.

248
00:13:26,586 --> 00:13:27,586
I-I'm thirsty.

249
00:13:33,226 --> 00:13:33,786
Thank you.

250
00:13:34,466 --> 00:13:35,706
Mine is too sweet.

251
00:13:36,226 --> 00:13:36,906
I'll get this one.

252
00:13:38,466 --> 00:13:39,906
Slim chance of winning.

253
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:43,666
Alright, I will stop being
a thorn in the flesh here.

254
00:13:44,106 --> 00:13:45,146
Go ahead. Bye.

255
00:13:45,546 --> 00:13:46,106
My "friend".

256
00:13:57,346 --> 00:13:58,346
This one is fine.

257
00:14:05,786 --> 00:14:07,146
But they are sugar-free.

258
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,128
(JS Sound Art Studio)

259
00:14:12,906 --> 00:14:14,146
That's it for today.

260
00:14:14,986 --> 00:14:15,466
Thank you.

261
00:14:15,466 --> 00:14:16,026
Thank you.

262
00:14:16,386 --> 00:14:16,826
Bye.

263
00:14:17,026 --> 00:14:17,586
Thank you.

264
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:28,146
Thank you.

265
00:14:29,106 --> 00:14:30,266
You did well today.

266
00:14:31,024 --> 00:14:33,226
Get some rest tomorrow.

267
00:14:34,266 --> 00:14:35,226
Rest well.

268
00:14:35,586 --> 00:14:36,466
See you around.

269
00:14:37,466 --> 00:14:38,226
Be careful.

270
00:15:06,826 --> 00:15:10,106
Knowing your enemy and yourself
is the key to winning.

271
00:15:12,146 --> 00:15:14,026
Why are you phasing out? We're losing!

272
00:15:17,266 --> 00:15:18,906
Go ahead. I'm done.

273
00:15:21,386 --> 00:15:23,786
Come on, I came to your place
just to play.

274
00:15:23,906 --> 00:15:25,266
Don't do this to your teammate.

275
00:15:25,506 --> 00:15:26,266
Associate captain.

276
00:15:28,866 --> 00:15:30,026
Pei Jun came to see An Ran.

277
00:15:31,266 --> 00:15:32,586
Pei Jun came to see her?

278
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,026
How did you know?

279
00:15:35,146 --> 00:15:36,346
An Ran told me.

280
00:15:38,106 --> 00:15:39,746
Right, you're next-door neighbors now.

281
00:15:43,906 --> 00:15:44,786
Back then,

282
00:15:45,506 --> 00:15:46,906
she was such a sweet girl,

283
00:15:46,906 --> 00:15:48,386
going out with him all the time

284
00:15:48,506 --> 00:15:50,026
in her pretty high heels.

285
00:15:51,506 --> 00:15:53,106
(Where do I start?)

286
00:15:57,506 --> 00:15:58,786
Were they really so close

287
00:15:59,906 --> 00:16:01,106
back then?

288
00:16:01,706 --> 00:16:02,266
Yeah.

289
00:16:03,506 --> 00:16:05,786
But she wasn't so mature back then.

290
00:16:05,786 --> 00:16:07,626
She just liked older guys.

291
00:16:08,386 --> 00:16:09,386
Pei Jun was

292
00:16:10,146 --> 00:16:11,386
quite decent and mature.

293
00:16:13,866 --> 00:16:14,906
How did they break up?

294
00:16:17,626 --> 00:16:19,146
Why do you care?

295
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,506
Could it be that you...

296
00:16:31,706 --> 00:16:33,026
Need material for the show?

297
00:16:35,266 --> 00:16:35,786
Yeah.

298
00:16:37,386 --> 00:16:38,266
Well,

299
00:16:38,266 --> 00:16:40,746
she didn't want to mention it,
so I didn't ask.

300
00:16:41,746 --> 00:16:42,706
She didn't mention it.

301
00:16:43,026 --> 00:16:44,586
Why didn't you ask to show concern?

302
00:16:44,906 --> 00:16:46,386
You're being narrow-minded, buddy.

303
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:49,266
You don't have to
ask about it to show concern.

304
00:16:54,506 --> 00:16:55,906
Let's try another round.

305
00:16:56,986 --> 00:16:58,506
Forget it. You can play alone.

306
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:37,386
(Why do I feel bored
in the office rather than the studio?)

307
00:17:40,106 --> 00:17:41,466
Tian Xin, I have a proposal

308
00:17:41,466 --> 00:17:43,266
that I'd like to consult with you.

309
00:17:45,346 --> 00:17:46,106
What is it?

310
00:17:47,506 --> 00:17:49,986
We're used to having Miss An
out of the office,

311
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:51,106
supervising the dubbing.

312
00:17:51,106 --> 00:17:52,386
I'm a bit uneasy

313
00:17:52,746 --> 00:17:54,106
with her here today.

314
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:56,986
I bet you're used to slacking off work.

315
00:17:58,386 --> 00:17:59,786
What are we having for lunch?

316
00:18:09,986 --> 00:18:10,586
Tian Xin.

317
00:18:11,506 --> 00:18:13,266
I read your proposal.

318
00:18:13,266 --> 00:18:14,266
Shall we discuss it?

319
00:18:15,706 --> 00:18:16,386
Coming.

320
00:18:18,986 --> 00:18:20,506
Take a look at it.

321
00:18:23,506 --> 00:18:25,506
This page. You see the problem?

322
00:18:28,506 --> 00:18:31,386
First, you forgot the basic.

323
00:18:31,746 --> 00:18:35,626
All the titles should adopt
the same font and be aligned.

324
00:18:35,986 --> 00:18:36,986
Otherwise, the PPT

325
00:18:36,986 --> 00:18:38,866
would look unprofessional.

326
00:18:39,106 --> 00:18:41,026
BP showcases the project.

327
00:18:42,506 --> 00:18:44,386
Sorry, Miss An, I was careless.

328
00:18:44,506 --> 00:18:45,906
I'll correct them.

329
00:18:45,986 --> 00:18:47,146
Okay, take your time.

330
00:18:58,866 --> 00:19:00,026
You rascal.

331
00:19:00,026 --> 00:19:01,906
You harassed my employee
and stole my proposal.

332
00:19:01,906 --> 00:19:03,146
I'm gonna beat you up!

333
00:19:06,266 --> 00:19:09,466
(He's quite handsome when he's serious.)

334
00:19:11,266 --> 00:19:11,986
Mr. Hu.

335
00:19:12,386 --> 00:19:12,986
Come in.

336
00:19:18,386 --> 00:19:20,626
We're working hard,

337
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:21,986
but you're playing games.

338
00:19:22,448 --> 00:19:24,986
Mr. Hu, do you find it appropriate?

339
00:19:26,106 --> 00:19:27,866
You only see me playing games.

340
00:19:28,386 --> 00:19:30,906
It's because we're on different levels.

341
00:19:30,906 --> 00:19:32,506
And the enemy got the first kill.

342
00:19:32,746 --> 00:19:33,986
You're so lame.

343
00:19:35,856 --> 00:19:38,026
You only see
the enemy getting the first kill.

344
00:19:38,026 --> 00:19:40,656
But you don't see me
cultivating myself in the process.

345
00:19:40,656 --> 00:19:41,386
Over there.

346
00:19:41,986 --> 00:19:43,266
You're losing.

347
00:19:45,506 --> 00:19:48,266
I'm losing all the battles,
but I won't give up.

348
00:19:49,386 --> 00:19:50,746
That's how I overcome difficulties

349
00:19:50,746 --> 00:19:52,266
and guide Gaishi Unparalleled

350
00:19:52,266 --> 00:19:54,506
to its prime in the battles of business.

351
00:19:54,746 --> 00:19:56,272
Noob. Let me do this.

352
00:19:56,272 --> 00:19:57,986
Check out the character sketch.

353
00:19:58,386 --> 00:19:59,786
I'll proceed if it's confirmed.

354
00:20:05,506 --> 00:20:06,626
Someone's coming.

355
00:20:06,746 --> 00:20:07,986
Here. I see him.

356
00:20:08,506 --> 00:20:09,106
Here.

357
00:20:09,296 --> 00:20:10,106
Here.

358
00:20:12,506 --> 00:20:13,506
Not bad.

359
00:20:14,386 --> 00:20:15,266
You're quite something.

360
00:20:15,386 --> 00:20:16,986
I haven't played much,

361
00:20:16,986 --> 00:20:18,026
but I'm better than you.

362
00:20:18,224 --> 00:20:19,626
Here. Listen.

363
00:20:19,906 --> 00:20:21,906
Use these two. And...

364
00:20:22,266 --> 00:20:23,986
Upgrade this over there.

365
00:20:23,986 --> 00:20:24,986
There you go.

366
00:20:26,506 --> 00:20:27,106
Okay.

367
00:20:40,496 --> 00:20:43,120
(Pei Jun: Mengyao, can you
ask An Ran out for me again?)

368
00:20:54,506 --> 00:20:55,106
An Ran.

369
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:57,506
I thought about it.

370
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,746
I think I should inform you.

371
00:20:58,746 --> 00:20:59,266
Look.

372
00:21:01,386 --> 00:21:04,506
I shouldn't have helped Pei Jun
without informing you.

373
00:21:04,986 --> 00:21:07,106
But he's been texting me all the time.

374
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:08,906
I think

375
00:21:08,906 --> 00:21:09,986
even if I don't help,

376
00:21:09,986 --> 00:21:11,906
he will figure something out.

377
00:21:12,266 --> 00:21:14,506
That's why I'm telling you this.

378
00:21:14,986 --> 00:21:16,266
I'm done as a messenger.

379
00:21:16,266 --> 00:21:18,466
You'll know what to do.

380
00:21:22,266 --> 00:21:23,626
Alright, I see.

381
00:21:24,906 --> 00:21:26,866
Tell him that I'll decide

382
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:28,746
where to meet.

383
00:21:28,866 --> 00:21:29,506
Okay.

384
00:21:37,106 --> 00:21:39,386
Boss, same old. Two servings.

385
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:40,586
I'll pay you on WeChat.

386
00:21:41,106 --> 00:21:41,586
Alright.

387
00:21:45,506 --> 00:21:46,906
Why did you choose such a place?

388
00:21:47,746 --> 00:21:50,346
It took me so much effort
to book that French restaurant.

389
00:21:50,746 --> 00:21:52,866
The ingredients
are flown in from France today.

390
00:21:55,906 --> 00:21:58,106
Mr. Pei, you haven't changed at all.

391
00:22:02,746 --> 00:22:03,386
Ran.

392
00:22:04,506 --> 00:22:06,506
I often recall the days
when we were together.

393
00:22:06,506 --> 00:22:07,706
Stop calling me that.

394
00:22:10,266 --> 00:22:12,506
I meant to apologize to you
in person today.

395
00:22:13,226 --> 00:22:14,986
But look at the place you chose.

396
00:22:15,786 --> 00:22:16,866
What about it?

397
00:22:17,506 --> 00:22:20,626
You never visited places like this.

398
00:22:21,746 --> 00:22:22,866
You didn't have to

399
00:22:23,106 --> 00:22:25,626
make yourself suffer
just to show resentment toward me.

400
00:22:28,226 --> 00:22:31,906
Mr. Pei, you're too self-centered.

401
00:22:32,146 --> 00:22:35,146
Your taste could change. Why can't mine?

402
00:22:38,986 --> 00:22:39,626
I know.

403
00:22:41,106 --> 00:22:42,466
I hurt you back then.

404
00:22:42,746 --> 00:22:43,626
I'm sorry.

405
00:22:44,386 --> 00:22:45,706
But I'm back now.

406
00:22:46,746 --> 00:22:47,786
Let me make it up to you

407
00:22:48,706 --> 00:22:50,106
and give you the best life.

408
00:22:55,626 --> 00:22:57,106
What is the best life?

409
00:22:59,626 --> 00:23:00,706
We only know

410
00:23:01,106 --> 00:23:02,746
what's best for us through experience.

411
00:23:03,866 --> 00:23:06,106
I used to be so naive.

412
00:23:06,266 --> 00:23:08,746
I really believed that
whatever you showed me

413
00:23:08,866 --> 00:23:11,106
would be something I liked.

414
00:23:11,506 --> 00:23:13,266
I'm actually grateful to you.

415
00:23:13,866 --> 00:23:15,266
Because after we broke up,

416
00:23:15,506 --> 00:23:16,746
I finally realized

417
00:23:16,866 --> 00:23:19,506
what I truly want in life.

418
00:23:20,266 --> 00:23:22,266
So, what you want in life

419
00:23:22,746 --> 00:23:24,866
is to dine at dirty and cheap places

420
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:27,866
and mess around
with that immature young man.

421
00:23:30,746 --> 00:23:31,986
I think we have

422
00:23:31,986 --> 00:23:34,466
different definitions of maturity.

423
00:23:34,906 --> 00:23:35,986
In my opinion,

424
00:23:36,506 --> 00:23:39,706
it's quite childish
for you to keep pestering me.

425
00:23:45,986 --> 00:23:48,506
I really hate to see you
end up like this.

426
00:23:53,746 --> 00:23:54,386
First,

427
00:23:55,266 --> 00:23:57,506
we're like from two different worlds.

428
00:23:57,746 --> 00:23:58,866
Our paths don't cross.

429
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,466
Second, it's none of your business

430
00:24:01,466 --> 00:24:03,026
what I end up being.

431
00:24:04,386 --> 00:24:06,026
In fact, I asked you out today

432
00:24:06,266 --> 00:24:08,026
to make things clear.

433
00:24:08,986 --> 00:24:10,986
I don't need your apology.

434
00:24:11,266 --> 00:24:12,746
Because I became a better person

435
00:24:12,746 --> 00:24:14,226
after we broke up.

436
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:15,866
I have my dreams.

437
00:24:15,986 --> 00:24:17,266
I have my friends.

438
00:24:17,266 --> 00:24:19,266
My life may seem

439
00:24:19,266 --> 00:24:20,706
tacky to you.

440
00:24:20,746 --> 00:24:23,906
But this is what I like.

441
00:24:23,906 --> 00:24:25,866
I'm so cozy in this environment.

442
00:24:25,986 --> 00:24:26,906
I'm at ease.

443
00:24:27,266 --> 00:24:30,786
Also, stop asking
Bai Mengyao to be the messenger.

444
00:24:36,626 --> 00:24:39,386
I know you're just saying those
because you're upset.

445
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:43,266
I've said what I had to say.

446
00:24:43,986 --> 00:24:46,266
Stop bothering me.

447
00:25:11,266 --> 00:25:12,626
(The beauty of having a crush)

448
00:25:13,866 --> 00:25:15,506
(made us look back)

449
00:25:15,626 --> 00:25:17,866
(over our youthful years,)

450
00:25:18,106 --> 00:25:19,986
(again and again.)

451
00:25:22,986 --> 00:25:24,626
(Remember what Sanae Oikawa said)

452
00:25:24,626 --> 00:25:27,226
(to Male Itsuki
after she got rejected by him?)

453
00:25:27,866 --> 00:25:30,586
(The stories between boys and girls
keep repeating.)

454
00:25:31,786 --> 00:25:33,786
(Visit Otaru when you're free.)

455
00:25:35,266 --> 00:25:36,986
(Look for that person called Itsuki.)

456
00:25:39,146 --> 00:25:41,226
(That's it for today.)

457
00:25:42,346 --> 00:25:43,746
(Good night, everyone.)

458
00:26:00,266 --> 00:26:02,266
Great show today.

459
00:26:02,746 --> 00:26:03,386
Of course.

460
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,346
I'm an expert
on soothing souls of the city dwellers.

461
00:26:13,106 --> 00:26:14,746
What a starry night.

462
00:26:24,026 --> 00:26:25,746
You didn't finish what you said.

463
00:26:26,386 --> 00:26:29,026
You said you got tired
of dating someone.

464
00:26:29,506 --> 00:26:30,386
Tell me more.

465
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:37,266
Okay.

466
00:26:37,266 --> 00:26:39,866
Let me provide the soul-soothing expert

467
00:26:39,866 --> 00:26:40,976
with some materials.

468
00:26:44,688 --> 00:26:47,106
I was young back then.

469
00:26:48,266 --> 00:26:50,544
I was eager to devote everything I had

470
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:52,386
to the man I loved.

471
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:56,986
Just like a desperate gambler.

472
00:26:57,986 --> 00:26:58,746
And what happened?

473
00:27:00,866 --> 00:27:01,786
I lost everything.

474
00:27:03,026 --> 00:27:05,946
It's not that I'm scared of failure.

475
00:27:07,186 --> 00:27:08,426
It turned out that

476
00:27:08,906 --> 00:27:10,306
it was easy for me to fall in love

477
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:12,746
but hard for me to snap out of it.

478
00:27:14,386 --> 00:27:16,506
I've over 30.

479
00:27:17,626 --> 00:27:19,266
I've been through so much.

480
00:27:19,986 --> 00:27:22,506
I don't think I can accept
another person in my life

481
00:27:22,506 --> 00:27:25,226
or wait to be accepted.

482
00:27:26,266 --> 00:27:28,746
It's tiring to even think about it.

483
00:27:30,866 --> 00:27:32,986
I don't have the strength to deal with

484
00:27:32,986 --> 00:27:34,506
those twists and turns

485
00:27:34,506 --> 00:27:35,986
or another utter failure.

486
00:27:37,552 --> 00:27:39,106
Just like you said,

487
00:27:40,266 --> 00:27:41,746
it's just fine to be alone.

488
00:27:42,266 --> 00:27:43,266
I think so too.

489
00:27:44,176 --> 00:27:46,506
It's not like we're failing

490
00:27:46,866 --> 00:27:48,746
just because we're not with anyone.

491
00:27:55,386 --> 00:27:56,866
You're not exactly successful.

492
00:28:03,184 --> 00:28:04,688
Has anyone told you that

493
00:28:04,688 --> 00:28:06,706
you're really bad at conversations?

494
00:28:12,586 --> 00:28:13,346
So,

495
00:28:13,346 --> 00:28:15,066
stop telling women older than you

496
00:28:15,066 --> 00:28:16,826
to be brave and go seek love.

497
00:28:17,066 --> 00:28:19,946
They didn't choose to be single
because they were not brave enough.

498
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,066
Then why is that?

499
00:28:25,968 --> 00:28:27,426
Love is heavy.

500
00:28:28,586 --> 00:28:29,616
It's tiring to carry it.

501
00:29:03,546 --> 00:29:04,906
Fragment Time Boyfriend

502
00:29:04,906 --> 00:29:07,066
is a project we've been planning.

503
00:29:07,706 --> 00:29:10,306
With the change
in the target customers' aesthetics

504
00:29:10,306 --> 00:29:11,906
and trending topics,

505
00:29:12,066 --> 00:29:13,666
we've made countless modifications

506
00:29:13,666 --> 00:29:14,786
to the drafts.

507
00:29:16,066 --> 00:29:19,186
Very soon, Fragment Time Boyfriend
will go public

508
00:29:19,186 --> 00:29:23,066
as we submit
the business proposal to be approved.

509
00:29:24,912 --> 00:29:28,306
To be honest, I'm a bit nervous.

510
00:29:29,546 --> 00:29:31,706
But we've come so far.

511
00:29:32,066 --> 00:29:34,426
We have to pull it through
with confidence.

512
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:35,786
That's about it.

513
00:29:36,146 --> 00:29:39,666
Let's try to make the case perfect.

514
00:29:39,826 --> 00:29:40,786
Of course.

515
00:29:43,666 --> 00:29:46,186
Miss An, I'll come up
with a new version of the sketches.

516
00:29:46,186 --> 00:29:48,306
I promise, it's going to
surprise everyone.

517
00:29:48,666 --> 00:29:50,266
Peng and I got two boxes of supplies

518
00:29:50,306 --> 00:29:51,546
for us to work overtime.

519
00:29:51,586 --> 00:29:52,586
Rest assured.

520
00:29:53,426 --> 00:29:56,386
Let me make some
newly-invented refreshing tea

521
00:29:56,386 --> 00:29:57,426
for all of you.

522
00:29:57,706 --> 00:29:58,826
Alright.

523
00:29:59,306 --> 00:30:01,546
My turn! I'll follow up
on the player's feedback

524
00:30:01,546 --> 00:30:03,546
and the information
integrated by big data

525
00:30:03,546 --> 00:30:04,786
to please the players.

526
00:30:04,786 --> 00:30:05,306
Okay.

527
00:30:05,426 --> 00:30:06,786
Miss An, I...

528
00:30:08,066 --> 00:30:09,066
I-I...

529
00:30:11,186 --> 00:30:12,026
I forgot.

530
00:30:13,946 --> 00:30:16,066
Root for Fragment Time Boyfriend.

531
00:30:16,066 --> 00:30:17,306
We got this!

532
00:30:28,786 --> 00:30:31,506
Come on, won't you cheer?

533
00:30:33,786 --> 00:30:34,706
We got this!

534
00:30:40,066 --> 00:30:40,706
Miss An,

535
00:30:41,186 --> 00:30:42,786
I want the color lighter here.

536
00:30:42,786 --> 00:30:44,426
It's a bit too bright right now.

537
00:30:44,906 --> 00:30:45,546
No problem.

538
00:30:45,546 --> 00:30:47,706
Miss An, please sign
the financial statement.

539
00:30:47,706 --> 00:30:49,186
Let me see.

540
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:52,400
Miss An, is the drawing fine?

541
00:30:53,946 --> 00:30:54,706
Nice face.

542
00:30:55,826 --> 00:30:57,266
It's a bit complicated here.

543
00:31:00,306 --> 00:31:01,546
The demo of Chapter One is out.

544
00:31:01,546 --> 00:31:02,706
Want to try it?

545
00:31:02,706 --> 00:31:03,306
Come on.

546
00:31:04,186 --> 00:31:05,546
The demo is out. Get online.

547
00:31:07,306 --> 00:31:07,906
Where is it?

548
00:31:09,186 --> 00:31:11,026
Peng, the visual effect is good.

549
00:31:11,946 --> 00:31:12,546
Check it out.

550
00:31:12,546 --> 00:31:13,266
Let's see.

551
00:31:14,186 --> 00:31:15,946
Wu, come and see.

552
00:31:18,066 --> 00:31:19,306
- Here.
- Nice hues, huh?

553
00:31:19,306 --> 00:31:20,306
It's amazing.

554
00:31:20,306 --> 00:31:21,706
Great boot-up animation.

555
00:31:30,306 --> 00:31:32,066
Who sent all these?

556
00:31:32,066 --> 00:31:33,426
So generous.

557
00:31:35,306 --> 00:31:36,426
If I'm not mistaken,

558
00:31:36,426 --> 00:31:38,786
the graphics card must be for me.

559
00:31:38,906 --> 00:31:41,546
Two graphics tablets.

560
00:31:42,306 --> 00:31:45,786
Peng, how come
there happens to be two of these?

561
00:31:47,026 --> 00:31:48,666
There must be something for me.

562
00:31:48,786 --> 00:31:50,426
You got the desserts I bought?

563
00:31:50,928 --> 00:31:52,426
These are desserts?

564
00:31:52,666 --> 00:31:53,506
You bought these?

565
00:32:00,946 --> 00:32:03,786
Miss An, you got these for us?

566
00:32:04,786 --> 00:32:06,266
You really think so?

567
00:32:06,512 --> 00:32:07,386
- No.
- Not really.

568
00:32:08,306 --> 00:32:08,786
Really?

569
00:32:08,786 --> 00:32:09,546
Who got these?

570
00:32:15,826 --> 00:32:16,346
Hello?

571
00:32:16,826 --> 00:32:18,786
Miss An, you got the delivery?

572
00:32:18,786 --> 00:32:20,506
These are the gifts for proposals

573
00:32:20,506 --> 00:32:21,586
from innovative startups.

574
00:32:21,826 --> 00:32:23,666
It's our new regulation.

575
00:32:24,346 --> 00:32:25,426
Wish you success.

576
00:32:26,346 --> 00:32:28,826
Please thank Miss Lan
and the shareholders for us.

577
00:32:28,826 --> 00:32:29,826
We will do our best.

578
00:32:30,786 --> 00:32:31,386
Bye.

579
00:32:33,346 --> 00:32:35,626
These are from Lansheng Investment.

580
00:32:37,346 --> 00:32:38,346
Open them.

581
00:32:38,346 --> 00:32:39,066
Here we go.

582
00:32:39,066 --> 00:32:40,506
Graphics tablets. My goodness.

583
00:32:40,866 --> 00:32:42,706
A whole box of tea leaves.

584
00:32:43,266 --> 00:32:43,826
I'll take it.

585
00:32:44,346 --> 00:32:46,106
The biggest one is gone.

586
00:32:46,106 --> 00:32:47,946
Let me help. It's so heavy.

587
00:32:47,946 --> 00:32:48,706
Sure.

588
00:32:49,706 --> 00:32:50,426
Peng.

589
00:32:52,866 --> 00:32:54,666
It paints better scenes with that.

590
00:32:55,346 --> 00:32:56,106
Try it.

591
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:11,856
(Everything will go well.)

592
00:33:27,826 --> 00:33:28,426
Hello?

593
00:33:29,026 --> 00:33:29,946
Got the delivery?

594
00:33:30,866 --> 00:33:32,506
I was about to call you.

595
00:33:32,866 --> 00:33:35,106
I made myself clear last time.

596
00:33:35,106 --> 00:33:36,706
Why are you still pestering me?

597
00:33:37,186 --> 00:33:38,826
I just want to help your company.

598
00:33:39,106 --> 00:33:42,626
Mr. Pei, our proposal
will be approved anyway.

599
00:33:42,866 --> 00:33:45,186
Please stop sending us things

600
00:33:45,186 --> 00:33:46,386
in the name of Miss Lan.

601
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:56,026
Bai Mengyao.

602
00:34:01,306 --> 00:34:02,106
What's wrong?

603
00:34:02,626 --> 00:34:03,266
It's yours now.

604
00:34:05,104 --> 00:34:06,186
A fountain pen?

605
00:34:07,472 --> 00:34:08,666
Doesn't it look nice?

606
00:34:11,346 --> 00:34:12,586
Pei Jun gave it to you?

607
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:18,266
Return it if you don't like it.

608
00:34:19,106 --> 00:34:20,186
Why would I?

609
00:34:20,586 --> 00:34:22,506
He can give me gifts all he wants.

610
00:34:22,506 --> 00:34:24,146
I can decide what to do with them.

611
00:34:24,976 --> 00:34:27,346
Think twice. I'll leave it here.

612
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,106
Why are you here?

613
00:34:44,706 --> 00:34:46,546
I thought we'd meet at the studio.

614
00:34:49,106 --> 00:34:50,346
I came to tell you that

615
00:34:50,866 --> 00:34:52,866
I'm sick today and won't go to work.

616
00:34:55,066 --> 00:34:56,106
What's wrong?

617
00:35:00,346 --> 00:35:01,546
Do you want a ride?

618
00:35:01,546 --> 00:35:02,906
Let's get some medicine.

619
00:35:02,906 --> 00:35:04,866
We'll carry on with work
once you're better.

620
00:35:05,866 --> 00:35:06,346
No.

621
00:35:07,906 --> 00:35:10,706
Why are you so willful?

622
00:35:13,506 --> 00:35:15,664
Deal with that fountain pen
first, Miss An.

623
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,586
I'm sick. I'm leaving.

624
00:35:22,426 --> 00:35:24,906
You could have just called me.

625
00:35:29,706 --> 00:35:31,346
Just give me a break.

626
00:35:43,696 --> 00:35:45,264
(Cefixime Capsules)

627
00:36:20,026 --> 00:36:21,106
Little brat.

628
00:36:47,696 --> 00:36:48,666
Why are you staring?

629
00:36:50,346 --> 00:36:53,506
Mr. Heisha certainly looks cool
when he's at work.

630
00:36:57,626 --> 00:36:58,906
What's wrong? Blushing?

631
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:03,186
Are you going to stay there?

632
00:37:10,786 --> 00:37:13,106
Are you better today?

633
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:15,866
Kind of.

634
00:37:17,866 --> 00:37:20,306
These are letters from your audience?

635
00:37:21,106 --> 00:37:23,026
Yeah. And they're handwritten.

636
00:37:23,386 --> 00:37:24,786
Handwritten?

637
00:37:25,186 --> 00:37:27,426
That's rare nowadays.

638
00:37:27,984 --> 00:37:29,266
What did they write?

639
00:37:29,626 --> 00:37:31,666
Mostly their feedback on Heisha Time

640
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,306
and the dubbing I worked on.

641
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:36,146
Some of them are their love stories.

642
00:37:36,706 --> 00:37:38,866
I would pick from those stories

643
00:37:39,106 --> 00:37:40,826
and share them in the show.

644
00:37:41,146 --> 00:37:43,146
This is one way for us to communicate.

645
00:37:44,866 --> 00:37:46,106
These are the read ones?

646
00:37:46,666 --> 00:37:47,626
These are unread?

647
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:48,866
That's right.

648
00:37:49,146 --> 00:37:50,306
What about that?

649
00:37:52,346 --> 00:37:54,106
It's also unread. Want to read it?

650
00:37:54,706 --> 00:37:55,626
I can read it?

651
00:38:01,936 --> 00:38:05,146
(Sir Heisha, your voice is awful.)

652
00:38:05,146 --> 00:38:05,786
What's wrong?

653
00:38:07,026 --> 00:38:11,506
It turns out your audience
is people of all ages.

654
00:38:12,626 --> 00:38:15,346
Sir Heisha, your voice is awful.

655
00:38:15,346 --> 00:38:16,506
So awful.

656
00:38:16,506 --> 00:38:17,266
Are we gonna dub?

657
00:38:17,906 --> 00:38:18,426
Of course.

658
00:38:18,866 --> 00:38:19,386
Let's go.

659
00:38:30,586 --> 00:38:31,786
(Please don't be sad.)

660
00:38:32,466 --> 00:38:34,466
(You don't have to hide your old wounds)

661
00:38:35,226 --> 00:38:36,496
(and swallow your sorrow alone.)

662
00:38:37,346 --> 00:38:38,386
(I will stand by you)

663
00:38:38,706 --> 00:38:40,746
(and create new memories with you.)

664
00:38:41,392 --> 00:38:44,026
(I know you're working hard
to achieve your dream.)

665
00:38:44,746 --> 00:38:47,506
(I support you no matter what.)

666
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,946
