specially arranged for singles today.

27
00:02:00,034 --> 00:02:01,514
We wish you a pleasant meal.

(Even though I've long given up
on fantasies of love,)

29
00:02:08,314 --> 00:02:11,034

of a fluttering heart arrives,)

00:02:12,144 --> 00:02:13,434
(you'll know)

31
00:02:13,712 --> 00:02:14,714
(perhaps,)

00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,112

You...

36
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,754
Why are you stalking me?

37
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,154
I'm shopping here alone.

38
00:04:17,434 --> 00:04:18,640
And you didn't buy anything.

39
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:22,954
Together?

40
00:04:26,546 --> 00:04:27,786
What kind of snacks do you like?

41
00:04:28,386 --> 00:04:29,466
I don't eat snacks.

42
00:04:30,128 --> 00:04:31,746
Do you like to drink milk or yogurt?

43
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,306
Lactose intolerant.

44
00:04:34,346 --> 00:04:35,186
Fruit then?

45
00:04:35,786 --> 00:04:36,906
Too high in sugar.

46
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:38,746
What about drinks?

47
00:04:39,266 --> 00:04:40,666
I don't drink carbonated beverages.

48
00:04:44,146 --> 00:04:45,346
So, why are you here?

49
00:04:49,626 --> 00:04:50,626
Why are you avoiding me?

50
00:04:52,706 --> 00:04:53,946
Is it because of that person?

51
00:04:58,146 --> 00:04:59,946
Mind your own business, kid.

52
00:05:11,546 --> 00:05:12,346
An Ran,

53
00:05:15,466 --> 00:05:16,546
what a coincidence.

54
00:05:17,226 --> 00:05:18,066
Quite a coincidence.

55
00:05:18,266 --> 00:05:19,546
You two are grocery shopping together?

56
00:05:26,106 --> 00:05:27,746
Come with me.
I have something to say to you.

57
00:05:32,186 --> 00:05:33,866
How come you two are shopping together?

58
00:05:34,146 --> 00:05:34,826
Coincidence.

59
00:05:35,426 --> 00:05:37,986
Does Mr. Heisha have feelings for you?

60
00:05:38,946 --> 00:05:39,946
I don't agree.

61
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,026
He's too young.

62
00:05:41,226 --> 00:05:42,666
He's not nearly as good as Pei Jun.

63
00:05:43,506 --> 00:05:45,106
Speaking of which, Pei Jun is back.

64
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:46,666
How is it? Have you seen him?

65
00:05:47,026 --> 00:05:49,226
Is he still as handsome as before?

66
00:05:52,466 --> 00:05:53,106
Let me tell you.

67
00:05:53,706 --> 00:05:55,986
I've seen countless men over the years.

68
00:05:56,386 --> 00:05:56,986
I'm telling you.

69
00:05:57,346 --> 00:06:00,146
Good men like Pei Jun are rare.

70
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,146
Don't be annoyed by my nagging.

71
00:06:02,226 --> 00:06:03,706
In the years
since you broke up with him,

72
00:06:03,706 --> 00:06:05,306
have you met a better man than him?

73
00:06:05,386 --> 00:06:06,386
Have you been in love?

74
00:06:06,626 --> 00:06:07,426
You haven't, have you?

75
00:06:08,626 --> 00:06:09,666
Should we

76
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,986
add a daily health plan reminder

77
00:06:11,986 --> 00:06:15,826
in addition to text and alarm reminders?

78
00:06:16,386 --> 00:06:17,506
In this way, players can

79
00:06:17,506 --> 00:06:19,546
manage their lives in a healthier way.

80
00:06:19,866 --> 00:06:20,786
This is particularly good

81
00:06:20,786 --> 00:06:21,706
for people like me,

82
00:06:21,706 --> 00:06:24,266
an irregular sleeper
and severe procrastinator.

83
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:26,106
Perfect for single people like you.

84
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:28,266
Aren't you too?

85
00:06:28,506 --> 00:06:29,946
That's true.

86
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,112
Miss An,

87
00:06:37,266 --> 00:06:38,026
Miss An,

88
00:06:38,826 --> 00:06:41,666
don't you think
that after a day-long meeting,

89
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:44,266
it seems to be lunchtime now?

90
00:06:45,946 --> 00:06:47,386
It really is.

91
00:06:48,066 --> 00:06:49,146
I'll treat you to what you want.

92
00:06:49,706 --> 00:06:50,546
The sandwich

93
00:06:50,546 --> 00:06:52,506
we ate yesterday was very good.

94
00:06:52,506 --> 00:06:53,546
So it's not my treat today?

95
00:06:53,786 --> 00:06:55,146
You can treat us to afternoon tea.

96
00:06:55,146 --> 00:06:56,426
Miss An rarely treats us.

97
00:06:56,426 --> 00:06:57,520
Let's eat something expensive.

98
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,672
We wouldn't exploit Miss An.

99
00:06:58,672 --> 00:07:00,026
We only exploit you.

100
00:07:00,026 --> 00:07:01,426
The expensive ones are on you.

101
00:07:01,648 --> 00:07:03,066
That one is particularly delicious.

102
00:07:03,426 --> 00:07:04,866
You're a bit unkind, aren't you?

103
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:08,226
Heisha's gonna invite
Yaoyao out for dinner alone.

104
00:07:08,786 --> 00:07:10,106
Really?

105
00:07:10,266 --> 00:07:12,266
I always thought he came to our company

106
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:13,986
for some reason.

107
00:07:14,386 --> 00:07:16,266
Turns out he wants to poach Yaoyao.

108
00:07:16,266 --> 00:07:17,786
Mr. Heisha or Yaoyao...?

109
00:07:22,466 --> 00:07:23,986
What do you want to eat? I forgot.

110
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:24,826
Sandwich.

111
00:07:26,026 --> 00:07:26,586
Sandwich.

112
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:30,706
Did they two ask for my opinion
before making a date?

113
00:07:36,826 --> 00:07:37,866
Where are they going to eat?

114
00:07:38,186 --> 00:07:40,306
It's just the UFO Restaurant next door.

115
00:07:42,746 --> 00:07:43,746
This is interesting.

116
00:07:43,746 --> 00:07:44,866
Is it a love triangle?

117
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:46,786
It is.

118
00:07:46,906 --> 00:07:48,546
Absolutely.

119
00:07:57,106 --> 00:07:58,746
We'll take a look
by ourselves first. Thank you.

120
00:08:00,466 --> 00:08:01,186
Just say it.

121
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:03,986
Can't I just ask you out for a meal?

122
00:08:04,626 --> 00:08:05,426
If so, I'm leaving.

123
00:08:05,626 --> 00:08:06,466
Don't leave.

124
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,226
We'll work together.

125
00:08:08,426 --> 00:08:09,986
What's wrong with having a meal with me?

126
00:08:11,186 --> 00:08:11,866
So?

127
00:08:13,386 --> 00:08:14,746
So Mr. Heisha,

128
00:08:15,306 --> 00:08:16,546
what kind of girl do you like?

129
00:08:17,426 --> 00:08:18,626
What does it have to do with you?

130
00:08:18,866 --> 00:08:20,426
Do you like An Ran?

131
00:08:24,386 --> 00:08:25,746
Why are you asking so many questions?

132
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:27,346
Just confirming.

133
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:28,586
Relax.

134
00:08:28,866 --> 00:08:29,906
If you like her,

135
00:08:30,106 --> 00:08:31,866
I won't be fixated on you.

136
00:08:32,826 --> 00:08:34,546
But I hope you think it through.

137
00:08:34,946 --> 00:08:36,346
An Ran is not just any girl.

138
00:08:37,426 --> 00:08:38,226
You're not right for her.

139
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:40,266
I've known her for so long,

140
00:08:40,426 --> 00:08:41,786
so I understand her better than you do.

141
00:08:42,866 --> 00:08:43,946
What An Ran needs

142
00:08:44,346 --> 00:08:46,106
is a man who can give
her a sense of security

143
00:08:47,386 --> 00:08:49,466
instead of a boy
who follows her around every day.

144
00:08:50,546 --> 00:08:53,226
Do you think you can do that?

145
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:56,546
Have you said enough?

146
00:09:14,426 --> 00:09:15,306
Huang Mengyao,

147
00:09:15,746 --> 00:09:16,546
I warn you.

148
00:09:16,786 --> 00:09:19,186
Any tricks you have,
direct them at me but not at my buddy.

149
00:09:20,546 --> 00:09:21,866
You're spouting nonsense again.

150
00:09:23,426 --> 00:09:24,186
Have you eaten yet?

151
00:09:26,186 --> 00:09:26,786
No.

152
00:09:27,626 --> 00:09:28,546
Let's eat together.

153
00:09:29,826 --> 00:09:30,546
You're paying.

154
00:09:31,226 --> 00:09:33,426
You came out to eat
without bringing your wallet?

155
00:09:33,426 --> 00:09:34,226
You're the boss.

156
00:09:34,346 --> 00:09:35,346
Shouldn't you treat

157
00:09:35,346 --> 00:09:36,466
your employees?

158
00:09:37,746 --> 00:09:38,986
If you put it that way,

159
00:09:41,786 --> 00:09:42,226
come on.

160
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:45,106
Pour a glass of water for me.

161
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,466
What?

162
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,186
Pour a glass of water for your boss.

163
00:09:49,826 --> 00:09:50,466
What?

164
00:10:07,386 --> 00:10:08,466
(What An Ran needs)

165
00:10:08,912 --> 00:10:10,800
(is a man who can give
her a sense of security)

166
00:10:11,184 --> 00:10:13,146
(instead of a boy
who follows her around every day.)

167
00:10:24,346 --> 00:10:26,266
Why hasn't Heisha arrived yet?

168
00:10:33,808 --> 00:10:36,066
(Are you still eating? Where are you?)

169
00:10:46,266 --> 00:10:47,626
Why are you here so late?

170
00:10:48,226 --> 00:10:49,826
Sorry, traffic jam.

171
00:10:56,306 --> 00:10:57,386
Let's do the dubbing now.

172
00:11:29,386 --> 00:11:32,386
I've got something else
to do. I gotta go.

173
00:11:33,186 --> 00:11:36,666
Okay, then, be safe.

174
00:11:37,986 --> 00:11:38,426
Bye.

175
00:11:39,546 --> 00:11:39,946
Bye.

176
00:11:47,026 --> 00:11:48,946
Still here? Let's go for drinks tonight.

177
00:11:50,306 --> 00:11:50,946
Okay.

178
00:11:54,466 --> 00:11:56,266
What are you looking at? Let's go.

179
00:11:56,546 --> 00:11:58,306
Aren't you usually not involved?

180
00:12:09,346 --> 00:12:11,026
(Not replying to my messages.)

181
00:12:12,986 --> 00:12:14,906
(What's wrong with that kid?)

182
00:12:14,906 --> 00:12:15,906
(He was fine yesterday.)

183
00:12:15,906 --> 00:12:17,946
(Why the big change today?)

184
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:20,906
I'll order some food.

185
00:12:22,736 --> 00:12:24,912
(Barbecue delivery)

186
00:12:35,626 --> 00:12:38,786
Hello, Yaoyao, are you free?
Come over for snacks at my place.

187
00:12:39,026 --> 00:12:40,386
I'm busy.

188
00:12:40,386 --> 00:12:41,266
You eat by yourself.

189
00:12:41,266 --> 00:12:41,946
I'm hanging up.

190
00:12:42,706 --> 00:12:44,386
Hello, Tian Xin.

191
00:12:45,426 --> 00:12:46,066
Hello.

192
00:12:46,626 --> 00:12:48,226
Hello.

193
00:13:03,106 --> 00:13:04,586
Weren't we supposed to go drinking?

194
00:13:04,586 --> 00:13:06,106
Why did you run off again?

195
00:13:06,626 --> 00:13:08,026
Hello.

196
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,706
You guys enjoy yourselves.
I have a bad signal.

197
00:13:11,146 --> 00:13:11,626
Bye.

198
00:13:16,469 --> 00:13:20,085
(Are you still eating? Where are you?)

199
00:13:53,136 --> 00:13:55,568
(When Men Fall in Love)

200
00:14:38,146 --> 00:14:38,946
Really boring.

201
00:14:58,026 --> 00:14:59,026
What's it? I'm playing a game.

202
00:15:00,826 --> 00:15:01,346
Nothing.

203
00:15:01,906 --> 00:15:02,706
I just want to ask you.

204
00:15:03,266 --> 00:15:05,946
Why does a boy suddenly ignore a girl?

205
00:15:06,466 --> 00:15:07,066
He's tired of her.

206
00:15:08,186 --> 00:15:09,026
Don't go out.

207
00:15:09,026 --> 00:15:09,706
Movement, 4:00.

208
00:15:09,706 --> 00:15:10,826
Let's lay low this round.

209
00:15:11,346 --> 00:15:12,226
I'm hanging up.

210
00:15:24,501 --> 00:15:27,258
(The reason
why men suddenly ignore you.)

211
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,826
(The Internet says
there are various reasons)

212
00:15:29,946 --> 00:15:31,786
(why men suddenly
give you the cold shoulder.)

213
00:15:31,946 --> 00:15:34,146
(Don't be silly. Today let me tell you.)

214
00:15:34,626 --> 00:15:37,466
(Men are very realistic.)

215
00:15:37,906 --> 00:15:40,146
(The only reason
to explain the sudden change)

216
00:15:40,346 --> 00:15:42,626
(is that he's tired of the relationship)

217
00:15:42,986 --> 00:15:45,066
(and doesn't want
to spend more effort on you.)

218
00:15:45,426 --> 00:15:47,666
(This also shows
from the very beginning,)

219
00:15:47,706 --> 00:15:49,626
(you weren't that important
in his heart.)

220
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,386
(You're just someone he used)

221
00:15:51,546 --> 00:15:53,026
(to kill time when he was bored.)

222
00:16:06,186 --> 00:16:07,346
(Why should I care about him?)

223
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,520
(What are you doing? Sleeping?)

224
00:16:54,608 --> 00:16:57,552
(Asleep? I was a bit busy today.
Let's talk in person tomorrow.)

225
00:18:17,146 --> 00:18:18,386
Where did you go last night?

226
00:18:21,306 --> 00:18:22,386
How do you know I went out?

227
00:18:25,106 --> 00:18:26,466
Your house lights were off.

228
00:18:28,986 --> 00:18:29,866
I...

229
00:18:32,306 --> 00:18:33,106
I went out for fun.

230
00:18:39,106 --> 00:18:39,666
What about you?

231
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:41,786
What were you doing?

232
00:18:43,026 --> 00:18:44,906
I spent all last night
revising the plan.

233
00:18:48,386 --> 00:18:49,506
Not like you kids.

234
00:18:49,506 --> 00:18:51,626
Now, if I pull
an all-nighter, I feel sleepy.

235
00:18:52,906 --> 00:18:53,786
An Ran,

236
00:18:54,866 --> 00:18:56,026
Mr. Heisha is here too.

237
00:18:56,826 --> 00:18:58,386
Are you checking the script?

238
00:18:58,426 --> 00:18:59,386
No.

239
00:19:00,266 --> 00:19:01,586
You asked me out for drinks last night,

240
00:19:01,586 --> 00:19:03,066
but I was busy.

241
00:19:03,746 --> 00:19:04,666
I'm free tonight.

242
00:19:04,866 --> 00:19:05,666
Half Hill Restaurant,

243
00:19:06,066 --> 00:19:08,266
the one you always say
you want to go to, yes or no?

244
00:19:09,506 --> 00:19:10,544
Half Hill Restaurant?

245
00:19:12,146 --> 00:19:14,506
- Okay.
- See you at 7:30 p.m.

246
00:19:16,746 --> 00:19:17,266
An Ran,

247
00:19:18,026 --> 00:19:20,546
do you want to go home
and change your clothes?

248
00:19:22,026 --> 00:19:22,546
Why?

249
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:25,186
Anyway, go there dressed nicely.

250
00:19:27,226 --> 00:19:28,186
At 7:30 p.m.

251
00:19:29,106 --> 00:19:29,906
Do I look not good?

252
00:19:35,546 --> 00:19:36,386
Pei Jun,

253
00:19:36,786 --> 00:19:38,346
I got her out for you.

254
00:19:38,506 --> 00:19:40,186
You'll have to do the talking yourself.

255
00:19:43,728 --> 00:19:45,386
I've come out from the recording studio.

256
00:19:50,786 --> 00:19:51,626
Hey?

257
00:19:51,946 --> 00:19:54,066
Going out to play again tonight, kiddo?

258
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:59,746
Are you in charge, sister?

259
00:20:31,306 --> 00:20:32,866
I let Bai Mengyao ask you out.

260
00:20:33,946 --> 00:20:35,746
I wanted an opportunity
to talk to you alone.

261
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:43,546
How about this? Let's talk while we eat.

262
00:20:44,386 --> 00:20:45,786
Look, what do you want to eat?

263
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,066
If you have anything to say, say it.

264
00:20:55,266 --> 00:20:56,026
Ran,

265
00:20:57,266 --> 00:20:57,986
I'm sorry.

266
00:20:58,986 --> 00:21:01,506
I shouldn't have just left you
like that back then.

267
00:21:02,026 --> 00:21:03,266
I hurt your heart.

268
00:21:05,506 --> 00:21:06,426
At that time,

269
00:21:07,306 --> 00:21:08,906
I wasn't very clear about what I wanted.

270
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:11,666
So I made some confused decisions.

271
00:21:12,226 --> 00:21:13,306
But this time I came back

272
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:14,546
for you.

273
00:21:14,866 --> 00:21:16,026
I hope you could

274
00:21:16,186 --> 00:21:18,026
give us another chance to be together.

275
00:21:18,826 --> 00:21:19,986
Let me make it up to you properly.

276
00:21:25,186 --> 00:21:27,066
I heard from Miss Lan
about your company's situation.

277
00:21:27,866 --> 00:21:28,706
I can help you.

278
00:21:31,386 --> 00:21:31,786
Mr. Pei,

279
00:21:32,706 --> 00:21:34,186
you were unclear

280
00:21:34,346 --> 00:21:35,746
and very confused then.

281
00:21:36,266 --> 00:21:37,386
Now you're back for me.

282
00:21:38,386 --> 00:21:40,866
I have nothing to say in reply.

283
00:21:41,386 --> 00:21:43,866
And you want to help me?
How would you help?

284
00:21:44,826 --> 00:21:46,866
Nepotism? I don't need it.

285
00:21:49,136 --> 00:21:50,640
Actually, you don't have to
work so hard.

286
00:21:51,088 --> 00:21:52,912
Why do you have to rely on yourself?

287
00:21:53,168 --> 00:21:55,344
Rely on whom then? You?
Can I rely on you?

288
00:21:56,546 --> 00:21:58,386
I think you were not confused before,

289
00:21:58,386 --> 00:22:00,146
but you are now.

290
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,986
What? Getting dumped by someone,

291
00:22:09,168 --> 00:22:10,480
and now you're back to fool me?

292
00:22:11,746 --> 00:22:13,186
No, I didn't mean that.

293
00:22:13,186 --> 00:22:14,266
Please, don't misunderstand.

294
00:22:14,306 --> 00:22:15,826
I just genuinely want to help you.

295
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:18,386
No need. I'm leaving.

296
00:22:34,546 --> 00:22:35,906
Mr. Pei, please let go.

297
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:36,666
Ran,

298
00:22:37,146 --> 00:22:38,906
can't we just finish this meal nicely?

299
00:22:39,146 --> 00:22:40,946
I promise not to talk
about things that upset you.

300
00:22:40,946 --> 00:22:42,546
I really have nothing
to talk about with you.

301
00:22:42,746 --> 00:22:43,346
Let go.

302
00:22:43,346 --> 00:22:44,506
An Ran, listen to me.

303
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:45,786
I was young back then...

304
00:22:45,786 --> 00:22:47,026
Can you let go?

305
00:23:08,146 --> 00:23:10,226
(Under Construction)
Seems like I took a wrong turn.

306
00:23:10,226 --> 00:23:11,586
I don't want to go back.

307
00:23:12,466 --> 00:23:14,026
Okay, we won't go back.

308
00:23:41,546 --> 00:23:43,146
Well, shall we...

309
00:23:47,266 --> 00:23:48,026
Hold my hand.

310
00:23:50,386 --> 00:23:51,786
You're not going backwards, right?

311
00:24:46,826 --> 00:24:49,546
I can't believe it's so beautiful here.

312
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:04,666
By the way, why are you here?

313
00:25:05,266 --> 00:25:06,506
I often record here.

314
00:25:07,626 --> 00:25:08,266
I happened to

315
00:25:10,226 --> 00:25:11,026
be nearby.

316
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:22,426
Listen to this.

317
00:25:39,186 --> 00:25:41,626
So this is the sound in your headphones.

318
00:25:41,626 --> 00:25:42,986
I've never heard it before.

319
00:25:46,146 --> 00:25:47,866
Have you ever heard
the sound of fireflies?

320
00:25:48,666 --> 00:25:50,186
Fireflies make sounds?

321
00:25:50,626 --> 00:25:52,466
Of course, listen.

322
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:01,666
This is the sound
of mosquitoes, isn't it?

323
00:26:10,226 --> 00:26:11,026
You're laughing.

324
00:26:25,026 --> 00:26:27,666
I haven't felt
so relaxed for a long time.

325
00:26:28,866 --> 00:26:30,426
The sound you just heard

326
00:26:30,786 --> 00:26:32,586
was recorded in Jiangbulake, Xinjiang.

327
00:26:34,586 --> 00:26:35,986
Xinjiang?

328
00:26:38,666 --> 00:26:40,146
When you're feeling down,

329
00:26:40,746 --> 00:26:42,386
you can listen
to the sound of the valley.

330
00:26:45,506 --> 00:26:46,786
This is so cool.

331
00:26:46,786 --> 00:26:48,546
It's perfect for pleasing a girlfriend.

332
00:26:50,386 --> 00:26:52,946
I don't have a girlfriend.

333
00:26:56,466 --> 00:26:58,906
That's okay.
People will always fall in love.

334
00:27:00,626 --> 00:27:01,786

I think dating is a hassle.

338
00:27:10,986 --> 00:27:12,306
Being together

339
00:27:12,586 --> 00:27:13,666
requires mutual adjustment.

340
00:27:14,306 --> 00:27:15,426
Even if the two do it,

341
00:27:15,706 --> 00:27:18,306
they can't stay
in the best moment forever.

342
00:27:18,706 --> 00:27:20,026
They always worry

343
00:27:20,266 --> 00:27:22,746
that it may turn bad again
the next second.

344
00:27:23,546 --> 00:27:24,706
This kind of uneasiness.

345
00:27:25,786 --> 00:27:27,146
I don't want to experience it again.

346
00:27:29,746 --> 00:27:31,146
I'd better focus on work first.

347
00:27:34,306 --> 00:27:34,746
Is that so?

348
00:27:41,906 --> 00:27:44,066
What other valley sounds
do you have in your headphones

349
00:27:44,066 --> 00:27:45,826

350

375
00:29:22,226 --> 00:29:23,546
Everyone, let's pause for a moment.

376
00:29:25,546 --> 00:29:26,386
Just the two of us.

377
00:29:29,866 --> 00:29:30,906
The salary has been disbursed.

378
00:29:31,346 --> 00:29:32,866
Remember to check your phones.

379
00:29:33,906 --> 00:29:34,906
Really? So fast.

380
00:29:37,386 --> 00:29:38,266
God of Wealth,

381
00:29:38,546 --> 00:29:39,626
it has really increased.

382
00:29:39,746 --> 00:29:41,266
We still need to do the outsourced work.

383
00:29:41,786 --> 00:29:43,226
We need to survive to talk about dreams.

384
00:29:44,226 --> 00:29:46,306
You've got your salary.
How do you plan to spend it?

385
00:29:47,346 --> 00:29:48,666
That digital drawing tablet.

386
00:29:48,906 --> 00:29:50,146
I'll buy the drawing tablet I want!

387
00:29:50,146 --> 00:29:51,792
Buy. Buy whatever you want.

388
00:29:52,386 --> 00:29:53,026
Tian Xin,

389
00:29:53,346 --> 00:29:54,506
the salary's been paid, you know?

390
00:29:54,506 --> 00:29:55,266
I do.

391
00:29:55,386 --> 00:29:56,784
I saw a bag on the way here.

392
00:29:56,906 --> 00:29:57,986
Look, isn't it beautiful?

393
00:30:00,586 --> 00:30:01,706
Just buying a bag won't do.

394
00:30:02,266 --> 00:30:03,986
You need to enhance your aura first.

395
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:06,346
What good can come out of your mouth?

396
00:30:06,426 --> 00:30:07,986
Tian Xin looks good with any bag.

397
00:30:08,546 --> 00:30:10,266
Peng knows how to speak.

398
00:30:10,586 --> 00:30:11,266
Love you.

399
00:30:12,432 --> 00:30:15,386
Wait, don't you guys save money?

400
00:30:16,026 --> 00:30:17,786
Wu, times have changed.

401
00:30:17,786 --> 00:30:20,266
The money is yours
only when you spend it.

402
00:30:20,866 --> 00:30:21,946
In this world,

403
00:30:22,026 --> 00:30:24,506
the unbeatable business
is investing in yourself.

404
00:30:26,946 --> 00:30:27,866
Good morning, everyone.

405
00:30:27,866 --> 00:30:28,626
Morning.

406
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:30,666
What are you talking about
so enthusiastically?

407
00:30:30,666 --> 00:30:31,786
We've received our salaries.

408
00:30:31,786 --> 00:30:32,666
Salaries?

409
00:30:33,546 --> 00:30:34,506
Let me see.

410
00:30:34,946 --> 00:30:36,186
Bai Mengyao.

411
00:30:41,186 --> 00:30:41,906
What's up?

412
00:30:49,506 --> 00:30:51,146
Miss An, what's the matter?

413
00:30:51,466 --> 00:30:52,866
Did you set up the thing with Pei Jun?

414
00:30:53,266 --> 00:30:54,026
That matter?

415
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:56,666
He seemed sincere when he came to me.

416
00:30:57,466 --> 00:30:58,426
He said he'd win you back.

417
00:30:58,946 --> 00:31:01,226
Could you stop meddling?

418
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:02,866
Do you know what happened
between him and me?

419
00:31:03,146 --> 00:31:05,026
You always say the past is the past

420
00:31:05,026 --> 00:31:05,986
and never talk about it.

421
00:31:05,986 --> 00:31:07,426
You didn't tell me. How would I know?

422
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:09,146
Besides, I'm just...

423
00:31:11,266 --> 00:31:13,026
afraid you'll stay single forever.

424
00:31:13,866 --> 00:31:14,986
Did you set it up?

425
00:31:14,986 --> 00:31:16,306
(Pei Jun requests to add you.)

426
00:31:16,306 --> 00:31:17,946
You two even unfriended
each other on WeChat?

427
00:31:18,586 --> 00:31:19,746
You really can talk.

428
00:31:20,186 --> 00:31:23,026
I'm telling you.
You can't meddle in this anymore.

429
00:31:23,786 --> 00:31:24,906
Is the drawing finished?

430
00:31:25,866 --> 00:31:27,346
We're still waiting for the pictures,

431
00:31:27,346 --> 00:31:28,786
and we'll have to show them to Lansheng.

432
00:31:28,866 --> 00:31:31,026
Okay. I'm going to work.

433
00:31:34,666 --> 00:31:38,026
An Ran, how did your conversation go?

434
00:31:41,986 --> 00:31:42,666
I'm going to work.

435
00:31:43,266 --> 00:31:43,706
Work.

436
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,400
(Messages from Jiang Shan's fan group)

437
00:32:23,426 --> 00:32:25,546
Can't believe I forgot about Jiang Shan.

438
00:32:25,546 --> 00:32:27,666
An Ran, you're a fake fan.

(Calling Runaway Princess Angel)

440
00:32:29,306 --> 00:32:31,466
(Runaway Princess Angel,
why have you disappeared?)

441
00:32:34,896 --> 00:32:37,488
(Here I am. I've been too busy lately.)

442
00:32:57,226 --> 00:32:58,386
Sorry.

443
00:32:58,386 --> 00:32:59,226
I didn't forget you.

444
00:32:59,226 --> 00:33:00,266
I was just too busy.

445
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:05,066
(Runaway Princess Angel,)

446
00:33:05,226 --> 00:33:06,666
(why have you been absent lately?)

447
00:33:07,426 --> 00:33:09,506
(Yeah, did you encounter any problems?)

448
00:33:10,306 --> 00:33:11,186
(Tell us.)

449
00:33:12,026 --> 00:33:13,266
(Did you change your heart?)

450
00:33:13,666 --> 00:33:15,266
(No. I haven't changed my heart.)

451
00:33:15,986 --> 00:33:18,106
(No. Of course, I haven't.)

452
00:33:18,226 --> 00:33:20,946
(Then what happened?)

453
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:23,186
(I've been busy.)

454
00:33:24,386 --> 00:33:27,426
(I don't believe it.
You must have got a boyfriend.)

455
00:33:31,946 --> 00:33:33,906
(So, what do you do every day?)

456
00:33:34,866 --> 00:33:36,666
(What boyfriend?)

457
00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:38,146
(The only man around me)

458
00:33:38,146 --> 00:33:40,346
(is my landlord next door.)

459
00:33:40,826 --> 00:33:42,866
(Well, little princess.)

460
00:33:44,546 --> 00:33:45,426
(What do you mean?)

461
00:33:47,546 --> 00:33:48,666
(What's wrong with being young?)

462
00:33:48,706 --> 00:33:50,706
(Nowadays, there are many boys
who like older girls.)

463
00:33:54,946 --> 00:33:58,544
(He's six years younger than me.
What are you talking about?)

464
00:34:00,946 --> 00:34:03,026
(Yeah, the age gap is hard to overcome.)

465
00:34:03,426 --> 00:34:04,786
(You guys, stop making a fuss.)

466
00:34:05,306 --> 00:34:06,946
(It's six years, not six months.)

467
00:34:07,066 --> 00:34:08,946
(Besides, the love views
of young people now)

468
00:34:09,186 --> 00:34:10,466
(are not the same as ours.)

471
00:34:18,746 --> 00:34:22,426
marks my tenth year as a voice actor.

472
00:34:23,026 --> 00:34:25,586
To appreciate your years
of companionship,

473
00:34:25,866 --> 00:34:27,826
my studio has decided to hold

474
00:34:27,866 --> 00:34:29,906
a small reading sharing session.

475
00:34:30,226 --> 00:34:32,026
Looking forward to seeing you.

476
00:34:33,826 --> 00:34:35,066
(Let's go there, little princess.)

477
00:34:35,226 --> 00:34:37,026
(You weren't there last time.)

478
00:34:37,346 --> 00:34:38,386
(Yeah, Runaway Princess.)

479
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:47,586
I guess I'm still his fan, right?

480
00:34:51,426 --> 00:34:52,866
The event registration is done.

481
00:34:53,026 --> 00:34:54,186
Are you coming or not?

482
00:34:56,186 --> 00:34:57,426
Hey, are you coming or not?

483
00:34:59,146 --> 00:34:59,546
No.

484
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:02,226
It's the tenth anniversary of my debut.

485
00:35:02,226 --> 00:35:03,706
Can't you come to support me?

486
00:35:03,906 --> 00:35:05,426
It's been ten years since you debuted.

487
00:35:05,666 --> 00:35:08,066
Is there no one else to invite but me?

488
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,226
How could there be no one?
You're joking.

489
00:35:10,306 --> 00:35:12,106
Well, you're quite unpopular.

490
00:35:12,706 --> 00:35:15,626
Yan Yue, I'm doing this
for your own good

491
00:35:15,666 --> 00:35:17,546
and for the future development
of the company.

492
00:35:17,666 --> 00:35:19,066
Don't think you're popular now,

493
00:35:19,066 --> 00:35:20,186
and you can do whatever you want.

494
00:35:20,346 --> 00:35:22,626
Only if you appear
in front of everyone frequently,

495
00:35:22,626 --> 00:35:24,346
will you have more work in the future.

496
00:35:24,346 --> 00:35:25,066
Do you understand?

497
00:35:25,226 --> 00:35:26,026
I don't need it.

498
00:35:30,706 --> 00:35:31,386
Yue,

499
00:35:32,586 --> 00:35:33,866
do you know why I'm still

500
00:35:33,946 --> 00:35:35,346
the top one in the dubbing industry

501
00:35:35,346 --> 00:35:36,666
for so many years?

502
00:35:37,026 --> 00:35:39,906
Because I'm seen by people frequently.

503
00:35:40,146 --> 00:35:40,506
Look,

504
00:35:41,786 --> 00:35:43,026
this is my fan group.

505
00:35:43,386 --> 00:35:44,946
They're all my old fans.

506
00:35:44,946 --> 00:35:45,906
(Jiang Shan's fan group)

507
00:35:45,906 --> 00:35:48,946
This time, I just want
to show my gratitude to everyone.

508
00:35:49,506 --> 00:35:50,906
I've given away all the tickets.

509
00:35:57,746 --> 00:36:00,386
(Jiang Shan's Weibo posts)
(Today I saw Jiang Shan in person.)

510
00:36:00,586 --> 00:36:02,506
(I'm so excited.)

511
00:36:02,746 --> 00:36:04,266
(Where did you see him?)

512
00:36:05,466 --> 00:36:06,946
(In a recording studio.)

513
00:36:06,946 --> 00:36:10,608

514
00:36:10,608 --> 00:36:16,400
(An Ran's Weibo posts)

515
00:36:19,546 --> 00:36:21,866
This is such a good opportunity,
you just...

516
00:36:21,866 --> 00:36:22,586
Okay.

517
00:36:26,946 --> 00:36:27,426
Yes!

518
00:36:30,346 --> 00:36:32,466
It's time. I have to go do the show.

519
00:36:32,506 --> 00:36:33,146
Okay, go ahead.

520
00:36:37,266 --> 00:36:40,346
An unrequited love
is like the rain in April,

521
00:36:41,266 --> 00:36:42,906
silent and long.

522
00:36:43,792 --> 00:36:45,026
The movie April Story

523
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:46,586
is like a prose poem,

524
00:36:46,866 --> 00:36:49,226
describing a secret crush.

525
00:36:50,346 --> 00:36:53,146
Who are you calling "kid"?

526
00:36:54,066 --> 00:36:55,546
Is that Pei guy so good?

527
00:37:00,666 --> 00:37:01,226
Hello,

528
00:37:01,506 --> 00:37:03,146
has a Miss Bai made
a reservation for tonight?

529
00:37:05,426 --> 00:37:06,306
